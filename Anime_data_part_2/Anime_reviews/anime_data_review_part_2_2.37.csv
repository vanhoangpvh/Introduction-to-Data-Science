Cardcaptor Sakura: Kero-chan ni Omakase!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1078/Cardcaptor_Sakura__Kero-chan_ni_Omakase,"[""Nothing so ground-breaking with this short as it doesn't introduce anything new to the Cardcaptor Sakura universe proper either via its characters or plot, but it does deliver some cute enjoyment and comedy in the form of a rivalry they decided to revisit from the original series.The story is simple, the art is consistent with what everyone has come to expect from the team working on Cardcaptor Sakura, the sound is fair, and it makes for a fun little romp.About my only complaint would be that I wasn't particularly fond of the music choices, but that's just my opinion. "", 'I wasn\'t expecting this to be tacked on to the end of ""The Sealed Card"", but it was a nice surprise. It\'s basically a little animation expo and experiment, showing a story from Kero\'s point of view. Suitably, the animation is top-notch, not just from an ""it looks like they did more frames"" perspective, but from a ""there\'s some remarkably good composition here"" one. The sword-fight, the drain pipe, the chase after the bouncy-ball takoyaki, the reveal of the octopus piece. Just the choice to show the human characters at low angles in general.I also appreciated the chance to see a bit more of Spinel....I never thought Eriol\'s familiars got enough screentime to be full characters in the main series.This is a great short.

Black Jack the Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1521/Black_Jack_the_Movie,"[""I've been spending a lot of time with Dr. Black Jack lately, so it is impossible for me to review this movie of its own merits and not compare it ruthlessly to the other adaptations that have been made. There is something I have always loved about Black Jack--he is such a well-developed character that he has the depth of simplicity, and yet, is genuinely far more complicated than he seems. This is a huge oxymoron, but it makes sense if you think about it. There is nothing *contrived* about him, and for such a dynamic, dark character, that is an accomplishment worthy of mention....Thankfully, Black Jack says true to Tezuka-sensei's character insofar as conception is concerned.The art style and overall aesthetic of the movie is *strongly* reminiscent of the movie adaptation of X, except this is overall a better movie. X made the mistake of trying to condense a long, complex story into an hour and a half. Black Jack wisely shied away from that mistake and focused instead on one story--a mega-episode, if you will, with a higher production value and, as is often the case with movies vs. TV shows, higher stakes.That being said, the movie lacks some of the simple, powerful charm of Tezuka's manga stories, or even their portrayal in the recent TV series adaptation. This movie isn't intended to be charming--it is dark, gritty, sprawling, and blunt. Black Jack wears a trenchcoat instead of a cape (albeit with his arms out of the sleeves so it flutters like a cape), and he meshes himself in a world that is both sterile and industrial, a sprawling mass of tubing and electronics that could almost be considered retro-futuristic, even given that the anime is contemporary to 1996. The visuals are lush and gorgeous, and, again, like X the movie, are intricately-faceted and often ethereal. Both movies are able to make blood splatter look hauntingly elegant. This is the sort of aesthetic I love, so I'm admittedly biased, but it does what it does *well*, and that is what counts.My biggest complaint with the movie is that conceptually it does not cover any new ground. We have the Big, Bad Pharmaceutical Corporation performing unethical experiments on uninformed humans, and the movie bashes us over the head with the consequences of trying to transcend humanity, reminding us that there is no such thing as a free lunch and all successes come at a cost. Instead of selling your soul to the devil, you have to sell your soul to the Giant, Faceless Multinational Corporation. The concept that a child growing up in a brutally-competitive, unaccepting, cold environment makes a screwed-up adult hellbent on success AT ALL COSTS (hi, Japan; I think this was aimed at you) is not new either. Granted, this is all the stuff epics are made of, and there is a reason the same themes keep resurfacing in fiction--they are relevant--but compared to Tezuka's creative, quirky way of delivering the same universal messages, this seems weak. I had already guessed pretty much everything that was going to happen two minutes into the movie.All things considered, though, within the framework of a wider context this is a solid movie title, and there is the potential for those with little understanding of the Black Jack canon to enjoy themselves. It's not very deep and it's not very groundbreaking, but hey, the worst disasters and mistakes are often echoes of the same old refrains we've heard throughout human history. Maybe that is part of the point. Or maybe I'm reading too damn much into this movie.

Acula's MovieWhile I'm not as familiar as with the character as I was watching the show semi-regularly when I was younger, I found this feature adaptation on Amazon the other night and decided I'd try it out. What I found was a mixed bag of alternating extremes. At times extremely interesting and involving writing, at times extremely cliched and melodramatic writing, at times truly beautiful and engaging animation, at times truly terrible animation half-heartedly painted over with stylized freeze-frames.I found the concept of the story to be pretty great, even if it's not necessarily the most original, a...spooky company performing experiments on people to create super humans gone horribly wrong ask a brilliant doctor to help them fix the formula. It's relatively well-done and I was quite drawn in throughout about 75% of the run-time, however, the last 25% almost completely lost me. Where it started out as a moderately subdued and down-to-earth medical mystery/conspiracy theory story, in the last act it felt the need to throw in a cacophony of dramatic exposition dumps and fiery action scenes set to supremely cheesy 80s love ballads.The last act was beyond ridiculous and wasn't helped by the fact that the incessant freeze-frames for dramatic emphasis tended to occur almost every time a character projectile vomited blood, a side-effect of the aforementioned experiments gone wrong. But as the dramatic conclusion drew near, characters were almost constantly vomiting blood to remind us of the ticking clock and after a while it became frankly hysterical every time it happened.Despite its occasionally awkward animations and slightly overblown shakespearean dialogue, the movie was a pretty good time and kept me entertained from start to finish. It had quite a few interesting characters who almost all got their time to shine, even if that time was sometimes spent hamming it up a bit in the voice acting department. If you're a big fan of the series you'll probably like it more than I did and if you aren't or were just a casual viewer like I was, you can still get a kick out of it. Black Jack the Movie gets a good 7 out of 10 stars from me. spooky company performing experiments on people to create super humans gone horribly wrong ask a brilliant doctor to help them fix the formula.

"", 'The 1996 Black Jack anime film is actually a side story of sorts from a series of OVAs that were released throughout the 1990s, featuring Osamu Tezuka’s famous unregistered surgeon. Here, Black Jack has to aid a mysterious doctor named Jo Carol Brane, who blackmails him to aid a number of supposed “superhumans” who possess extraordinary capabilities within different fields, yet find their bodies deteriorating after a period of time from a newly discovered disease.The Black Jack movie is more-or-less a medical mystery film with the titular character trying to figure out the origins of the disease affecting the superhumans. Those who have dabbled into...the OVA series from the 1990s can think of this as an extended episode of it. It retains the dark, gritty mood found from the OVA series and the mystery in question plays into the franchise’s overall theme of dabbling into corruption within the medical field. The film drops hints of shady activity at play with the disease in question and Jo Carol having something to do with it, that is gradually unraveled by Black Jack and others as the film progresses. The mystery is an engaging one to see develop and offers solid exploration of Jo Carol’s motives for her involvement with the superhumans, though the film’s efforts to make a moral of the mystery do usually get overly dramatic and to-the-point on occasion. Also a fair warning, this movie can get quite graphic at points as there are several scenes depicting Black Jack performing surgeries that are shown in rather graphic detail thus I’d avoid this film if you get squeamish at the site of gore, even when depicted during medical procedures.Visually, the Black Jack movie’s more-or-less on par with the visual quality of the OVA series in depicting Black Jack with a modern drawing style with detailed character designs and subdued color tones to be in line with the dark mood depicted from the OVA series. The drawing style does allow for some lifelike character designs and detailed scenic shots to be shown, though Pinoko seems to oddly stick out in still being drawn in Tezuka’s classic drawing style which does clash with the intended aesthetic choices for this film.Anyone with interest in medical mystery or anything connected to Osamu Tezuka should give this film a watch. There is solid buildup with the mystery as more elements concerning the superhuman medical crisis get unraveled and the fleshing out of Jo Carol’s character with her connections to it show she has more dimension than your run-of-the-mill anime villain. Those looking for anything a bit more action-heavy or squeamish over graphic violence may not get as much enjoyment out of seeing the 1996 Black Jack movie. the OVA series from the 1990s can think of this as an extended episode of it.

The idea of SuperHumans, who end up getting sick, the idea of how far medical assessment can go, well I do believe stuff like this happens, and people are just not aware of it, its scary to thing what the future holds haha. I wont give more details about the movie, do not want to spoil it...for anyone.However i will say the following the story and concept is really good, and just based on the story alone its worth a watch, I feel its an anime anyone can enjoy even known anime lovers, the art, and animation is really great too, voice acting is pretty nice as well, and overall character development is good.Its almost a perfect movie, but i gave it 9 out of 10 stars, felt it could have been a little better but defiantly worth a watch. for anyone.However i will say the following the story and concept is really good, and just based on the story alone its worth a watch, I feel its an anime anyone can enjoy even known anime lovers, the art, and animation is really great too, voice acting is pretty nice as well, and overall character development is good.Its almost a perfect movie, but i gave it 9 out of 10 stars, felt it could have been a little better but defiantly worth a watch.', ""Plot/Story: 9/10For a movie about Blackjack, this is one of the best anime films I've seen.

The ending falls a bit short, but not devastatingly so.Animation/Design: 9/10BJ The Movie is surprisingly well-animated, which I didn't expect. The body movements are smooth and clean, the gore is well done, and the characters' expressions are always clear.Characters: 7/10The characters are spot-on, acting and working together as they have in the past. BJ is great to watch as he faces this new threat. It's satisfying to see a main character's foundation...crumble and see them overcome it.Audio/Soundtrack: 7/10To be honest, there isn't much to say here. It wasn't bad, but at the same time, it wasn't particularly noteworthy, which is disappointing considering how great the film is. The opening and ending tracks were a nice choice, but the film's score wasn't emphasized much.Honorable Mentions:Pinnico & BJ are voiced by the same actor from the 2004 series (SUB).The film carries on Osamu Tezuka's anime style.Review Conclusion:Give this movie a watch. It's a classic in the anime genre and serves as a great introduction to the series. I highly recommend continuing with young BJ from here on out. crumble and see them overcome it.Audio/Soundtrack: 7/10To be honest, there isn't much to say here.

Captain Herlock,https://myanimelist.net/anime/17269/Captain_Herlock,"[""I came into this blind -having never watched the original series or even read a synopsis.The premise (of being relegated to living on dying planets) is quite good even though it is illogical given the super advanced science and technology on display.The movie has really good visuals and passable OSTs; normally that would usually make for a good watch but the monumentally stupid plot and incredibly awful, trope riddled characters ruined any chance of enjoyment for me.I won't say to skip it but if you are going to watch it -have low expectations for everything but the CGI to mitigate disappointment. "", ""I'm lucky enough to have seen this in the theater last night, so I thought I'd add my thoughts after seeing it!I've been looking forward to Captain Harlock being released because the animation looked amazing. I have to say, it did not disappoint. I was blown away by the CGI! It was beautiful. I can't even imagine how much time they spent on this, but I hope it's done well in theaters here. Major props to the animations team.I've never seen the original series and went into the film knowing next to nothing about the plot. I think the story was a bit lacking and...perhaps a bit preditable (as were many of the characters). BUT I still really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it. If for no other reason, see it for the animation! perhaps a bit preditable (as were many of the characters). BUT I still really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it. If for no other reason, see it for the animation!"", 'Captain HarlockGoing into this film, I had no prior knowledge of the source material or previous adaptations of Captain Harlock. Though reading the synopsis and watching some of its trailers, I could see a lot of time and money went into its production. And it didn\'t disappoint in that regard. It looked fucking amazing!Characters and Plot development. (6). I must say the biggest gripe I had with this movie was the fact that most of the MCs (Yama and Ezra especially) aren\'t really likable nor have audience investment to their agendas. They sort of just ""fill"" their roles rather than own their on-screen moments, its...a bit like they were given identities but never explored nor captured the emotion and character of their identity. It was left up to the likes of Captain Harlock and first mate Yattaran to deliver the solid performances and flesh out their identity. The plot and ethos was very interesting and at times inspiring but I felt as though the pace was rather slow in conveying the story which left much of the movie underwhelming at times until something happened. Although to contrast this slow pace, when the action kicked in (whilst looking fucking amazing! - yes i said it before) it certainly lifted emotion and developed a very enjoyable atmosphere to watch, Just needed a better balance in pace and character interactions to give an invested attachment to the plot and story unfolding.Art, Sound and Action. (9.5) Wow, awesome, amazing, beautiful or holy smokes batman! The production level in detail of the animation is incredible and really makes this feature an eyegasmic joy. The action and art seamlessly work together. Sound is the only small adjustment that could have made this section better (to be perfect) and that is the suspense. There were plenty of decent themes portrayed but again the contrast between the highs and lows didn\'t really connect well together. Still its only a small botch on an otherwise awesome production.One small side topic I\'d like to point out and this isn\'t really a spoiler but more of a ""window shattering moment"" but it seemed to me a lot of the time that the animation of mouth movement during speech was out of sync. It\'s kinda of annoying when you pick it up and they give you plenty of opportunities to notice this flaw. A slight distraction to consider, it doesn\'t hurt the movie but just annoys the shit out of me. (Not sure if you, the reader, will have the same reaction - to each their own i suppose) It\'s noticeable in both the dub and sub, btw both are great so you\'re not missing out by watching the dub.This film is blockbuster entertainment for its production value alone. Beautiful action scenes and character designs for the making of an epic tale. Sadly, the characters and plot can\'t compete with it. I had a lot of eyegasms during this movie and their are plenty of memorable moments to enjoy. I just wish it fleshed out the characters a bit more (especially Ezra and Yama) and pushed the plot a little quicker so we could admire more of its beauty! a bit like they were given identities but never explored nor captured the emotion and character of their identity.

Since the original Space Pirate Captain Harlock series premiered in 1979, the character has been in numerous spin-offs and re-iterations throughout the proceeding decades; each in a different continuity with the only commonality being a few key characters and the space-opera setting (sans Gun Frontier, which is a western). The latest reimagining is 2013 CGI animated action spectacle directed by Shinji Aramaki of Appleseed fame. It's a grand-scale sweeping space epic with big themes and bravado to match, attached to a somewhat convoluted sci-fi plot. In other words, it is a movie...that is faithful to the spirit of the original, and a worthy addition to the franchise.Following in the traditions of its predecessors, this movie has its own variation of the setting and characters. It is set in a future in which mankind abandoned Earth because it could no longer sustain the population, only to return to it after finding no refuge in space, and engaging in an internal power struggle for control of their home planet called the Home Coming War.  After the war, the authoritarian Gaia Sanction is formed and declares Earth sacred ground, forbidden to humanity. The only resistance towards this is the seemingly ageless space pirate Captain Harlock, who rebels against the Gaia Sanction for the next hundred years before the main story begins. This is all explained in a long montage before the title credits, which gives us an idea of how grandiose this movie intends to be, for better or worse. It also sets up Harlock to be an almost mythical figure, which works two-fold: giving the title character significant presence, and reminding us (the viewer) of the franchise's legacy.The story itself mainly follows Yama, a Gaia Sanction soldier who infiltrates the ranks of Halock's crew (and designated audience surrogate), as he tries to bring Harlock's defiant actions to an end. Well, at least that is what he tries to do at first. The movie goes from one big set-piece to the next, with stretches of explanation and plot development in-between. Flashbacks are used to disclose Yama's backstory, Harlock's past, and the world changing events of the Home Coming War which are not shown in the opening montage. To be honest, the storytelling here is kind of clunky; it is paced in such a way that sometimes the movie feels like it is just pushing its way to the next action blowout. That said, it never really becomes boring or tedious, as big twists and revelations are aplenty, and the action set-pieces payoff in a big way.The plot itself is backed by themes born from modern ecological anxieties, a fact which the movie makes very apparent. Mankind's abandonment of Earth is a blatantly obvious address to modern issues concerning overpopulation. The movie's fixation on the survival of a flower illustrates both the endurance and fragility of nature. Another theme is mankind's tendency to destroy the things it values through anger or envy. This can be seen in the only vaguely explored love-triangle between Yama, his brother Erza, and the girl for which they both have feelings; needless to say it takes a tragic turn. The theme can also be seen in Harlocks's past and the shocking truth behind the end of the Home Coming War. The endurance of hope and freedom in the face of such dispiriting factors has always been at the core of the franchise, and that is as true for this movie as it is for any other iteration; though Harlock's role as the personification of such hope and freedom is slightly subverted by the movie's big twist.The direction concerning the movie's aesthetics is simply phenomenal. Shinji Aramaki made his name on his CGI work in Appleseed, and continues to display exceptional CGI artwork and rendering in this movie. Leiji Matsumoto's characters transition extraordinarily well to 3-D animation, and are very faithful as far as Captain Harlock and pirate girl Kei Yuki are concerned. Some liberties are taken: Harlock's alien advisor/drinking-buddy Miime looks more humanoid than her original counterpart, and Harlock's first mate Yattaran is almost completely different from his original appearance (and personality). Yama looks suspiciously similar to the original series' audience surrogate, Tadashi Daiba, too. Harlock's iconic pirate spaceship, the Arcadia, looks absolutely intimidating with its GGI make-over. The action sequences are a marvel to behold. The large-scale space battles and showboating melee fights are gorgeously well animated and, more importantly, exciting. Aramaki handles the action with gusto; letting them brim with a frenetic energy which fully engages the audience, while also juggling the multiple battles flawlessly. If nothing else, this movie is a testament to Aramaki's talent as a top-notch action director.Unfortunately, his talents don't carry over into the movie's action-less dramatic scenes. Aramaki might direct a mean battle sequence, but his handling of drama leaves a lot to be desired. Many of the flashbacks and revelations come off as rather dry. They are visually stimulating, certainly, but are also emotionally distant. The scenes simply don't communicate the characters' emotions to the audience, or at least not as strongly as they should. You watch the scene unfold, but you don't feel the emotions that the characters are experiencing. Not helping matters is the fact that most of these characters are underwritten; plot and theme has always taken precedence over character depth in this franchise. The one exception being Captain Harlock himself, who is fascinating in his ideology (and always has been), and has an aura of myth and mystery surrounding him. While his backstory here removes some of the mystery, he is no less mythical from it. What this all means is that the movie's drama works on a thematic level, but far less so on an emotional level.In the end, this movie is an admirable addition to the longstanding franchise. It pays homage to the original, while updating it by applying modern priorities to old-fashioned bravado. It doesn't really improve upon what was already there, as it suffers from the exact same flaws as the original series, albeit in different ways. However, it does deliver some downright fantastic action sequences (doubtless the best the franchise has produced), and a solid story overall. It may not have transcended the original's legacy, but it carries on that legacy quite well. that is faithful to the spirit of the original, and a worthy addition to the franchise.Following in the traditions of its predecessors, this movie has its own variation of the setting and characters.

The theme can also be seen in Harlocks's past and the shocking truth behind the end of the Home Coming War. The endurance of hope and freedom in the face of such dispiriting factors has always been at the core of the franchise, and that is as true for this movie as it is for any other iteration; though Harlock's role as the personification of such hope and freedom is slightly subverted by the movie's big twist.The direction concerning the movie's aesthetics is simply phenomenal. Shinji Aramaki made his name on his CGI work in Appleseed, and continues to display exceptional CGI artwork and rendering in this movie. Leiji Matsumoto's characters transition extraordinarily well to 3-D animation, and are very faithful as far as Captain Harlock and pirate girl Kei Yuki are concerned. Some liberties are taken: Harlock's alien advisor/drinking-buddy Miime looks more humanoid than her original counterpart, and Harlock's first mate Yattaran is almost completely different from his original appearance (and personality). Yama looks suspiciously similar to the original series' audience surrogate, Tadashi Daiba, too. Harlock's iconic pirate spaceship, the Arcadia, looks absolutely intimidating with its GGI make-over. The action sequences are a marvel to behold. The large-scale space battles and showboating melee fights are gorgeously well animated and, more importantly, exciting. Aramaki handles the action with gusto; letting them brim with a frenetic energy which fully engages the audience, while also juggling the multiple battles flawlessly. If nothing else, this movie is a testament to Aramaki's talent as a top-notch action director.Unfortunately, his talents don't carry over into the movie's action-less dramatic scenes. Aramaki might direct a mean battle sequence, but his handling of drama leaves a lot to be desired. Many of the flashbacks and revelations come off as rather dry. They are visually stimulating, certainly, but are also emotionally distant. The scenes simply don't communicate the characters' emotions to the audience, or at least not as strongly as they should. You watch the scene unfold, but you don't feel the emotions that the characters are experiencing. Not helping matters is the fact that most of these characters are underwritten; plot and theme has always taken precedence over character depth in this franchise. The one exception being Captain Harlock himself, who is fascinating in his ideology (and always has been), and has an aura of myth and mystery surrounding him. While his backstory here removes some of the mystery, he is no less mythical from it. What this all means is that the movie's drama works on a thematic level, but far less so on an emotional level.In the end, this movie is an admirable addition to the longstanding franchise. It pays homage to the original, while updating it by applying modern priorities to old-fashioned bravado. It doesn't really improve upon what was already there, as it suffers from the exact same flaws as the original series, albeit in different ways. However, it does deliver some downright fantastic action sequences (doubtless the best the franchise has produced), and a solid story overall. It may not have transcended the original's legacy, but it carries on that legacy quite well."", 'Legendary anime/manga creator Leiji Matsumoto perfected dystopian before the rest of the world even knew what it was. His vast universe is rife with it, from Space Battleship Yamato‘s dying Earth to Galaxy Express 999‘s bleak future, Matsumoto does dystopian better than anyone else. No where is this more evident than in his legendary manga-cum-anime, Space Pirate Captain Harlock.Captain Harlock made his TV debut in 1978, and he’s been back many times over the years with varying degrees of success. The latest incarnation, a big budget CGI fest, premiered in Japan last fall. It’s an origin story of sorts and stands well enough on its...own. Those familiar with the Harlock will find much to like here. Viewers unfamiliar with Harlock stories won’t get lost here either.The story begins with a Matsumoto staple: a town that looks more like the American west than a futuristic alien word. Inside a ubiquitous saloon, a drifter named Yama nurses a drink until a deep rumbling announce a space craft’s arrival. And not just any spaceship. This one belongs to the notorious, hundred-year-old outlaw, Captain Harlock. Yama and the bar’s other patrons seemed to anticipate the ship’s arrival, and once it lands, they head out to meet it, determined to join Harlock’s crew. But Harlock only has room for one. In a scene similar to the Joker’s ‘try-outs’ in The Dark Knight, a brutal selection process ensues. The Captain demands the would-be recruits explain why they want to join in a single word. Unacceptable answers result in immediate–and permanent–dismissal.Fortunately for Yama, Harlock likes his answer and allows the young man to suit up. Along the way, we learn why Yama wanted to join Harlock’s crew, a reason that at times runs counter to the word he gave to Harlock.If this sounds as if Yama’s more of a protagonist than the Captain himself, he is. Intentionally so. Harlock is a mythic figure. His stories work best when he’s mysterious–something you can’t maintain when you see things from his point-of-view. The film gets that right–at least initially. In the middle, when it tries to show Harlock’s motivations through flashback, it makes the mistake of humanizing him. The decision feels false, and it doesn’t work. Fortunately, once we get the backstory over with, Harlock goes back to being the badass we all know and love.Visually, Space Pirate Captain Harlock is a sumptuous feast. The animation is as good as the ground-breaking Final Fantasy movies, and the character designs are gorgeous. The same can’t be said of the mechanical designs, however. The powerful forces arrayed against Harlock fly nondescript battleships that look more like boxes than spacecraft. Certainly, some of Matsumoto’s anime series had some interesting ship designs, but they were never this dull. Sadly, the Arcadia, Harlock’s iconic ship, suffers even more. It’s just plain ugly, looking more  like a  cross between an giant x-wing and H.R. Giger’s Alien than the beautiful ship Matsumoto envisioned. And that’s a shame, especially since the interior is fantastically realized.Changing the Arcadia’s look isn’t exactly sacred, the film, My Youth in Arcadia, altered and improved upon the 1978 design, with glorious results. It was big and absolutely gorgeous. It was also as intimidating as hell. If not for the dark matter cloud swirling around the new Arcadia, the ship would just look…generic. If the Arcadia wasn’t as important to Harlock’s persona, it wouldn’t be a problem. But the legendary ship is as much a part of Harlock cannon as the Yamato is to that story. It doesn’t ruin the film, but it certainly reduces its impact.In all its incarnations, Captain Harlock has been more about big themes and flash than substantive storytelling. My Youth in Arcadia, as good as it is, nearly collapses under its own melodramatic weight. Space Pirate Captain Harlock is no different. The over arching themes are grand and ambitious, but when it comes down to telling a compelling story, Harlock falls short. In an odd way, you might call that a success, because it means this Harlock isn’t that different from other Harlock stories. It means the filmmakers faithfully brought Harlock to the big screen. Being faithful, though, just isn’t enough. This was a chance to deliver a great space saga fitting its legendary hero. Space Pirate Captain Harlock just misses. own.

Space Pirate Captain Harlock just misses.', 'An extravagant show-piece of 3D rendering technology that\'s unfortunately bogged down by a needlessly convoluted plot, filled with TV-soap drama and characters who didn\'t know what they were doing.If you don\'t care about making head or tails of a story, and only want the first 5 minutes of space carnage in Revenge of the Sith filling an entire feature film, this is your jam - Harlock repeatedly rams a cheat-enabled auto-healing battleship head-first into swarms of pleasingly weighty metal behemoths, crunching, crushing huge complex components amidst a light show of ray weaponry triggering chain explosions. Releasing endorphins in a primal part of our brains that...finds a pleasing satisfaction in breaking up and disintegrating objects. The film brings TWO mega space weapons to boot, which is a bit of a missed opportunity when Arcadia didn\'t explode them as well.If only the film just focused on being an unapologetic orgy of explosions a la Michael Bay, instead, it succumbed to that most common of afflictions in Japanese 3D animation - melodrama. Three of four recruits were killed in the beginning, why? So Harlock can look like an angsty hard-ass. There\'s an entire subplot of sibling rivalry, why? Because the glasses-wearing douche needed an excuse to be all cold and aloof. Why does he hate him? Because the younger idiot randomly opened a valve that caused an explosion. Why did he open that valve? Because he was angry! WHY?!?!?!? If you want melodrama, at least establish a clear root cause! Or else you\'re just brooding for the sake of brooding!And what was the point of the subplot melodrama? What did the brooding bros do except creating unnecessary conflict out of nothing and dragging countless lives with them? What was the point of making the alien the last of her race? Just to make it depressing or is her backstory integral to the central tenet of the story? In which case WHY did she become the last of her race? Either TELL us, or don\'t include these half-baked headless characters that don\'t MEAN anything!Even the namesake of the film, Harlock himself, is apparently a complete idiot with NO idea of what he\'s doing! He unleashed dark matter to ""protect"" Earth only to ravage it, then to... ""make up"" for his own colossal f***-up, he decides, on behalf of 500 billion lives, to end the universe and start anew?! HE\'S THE REASON IT\'S SCREWED UP IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!To explain a bit of the film\'s background, the Harlock of the original series was an archetypical ROMANTIC hero - a lone voice of hope against alien tyranny, like a Rebel leader of the original trilogy. He was NOT a nihilistic, emo kid that succumbed to a hopelessness of HIS OWN FAULT, and decided to end everything with himself! And this selfish **** is the HERO of this film?!?!? Shouldn\'t he be the villain and root cause of all these problems?!?!Leiji Matsumoto revolutionised manga into a more mature, ""realist"" direction, his Space Battleship Yamato is a case study of tackling suffocating nihilism right. As far as I\'m concerned this film remake neither inherited the true romantic spirit of the real Harlock, nor did it successfully bring in the nihilism of Matsumoto\'s other works. All of the problems the characters face are of THEIR OWN MAKING - they\'re not heroes, they\'re not anti-heroes, they\'re just brooding teens in their puberties throwing a tantrum from breaking their own playstation. It speaks volumes when the only tolerable characters are an emotionless, backstory-less alien and a catatonic woman.I really wish some screenwriters would mature out of their brooding bros, whether it be Cloud, Noctis, or these insufferable ""hero"" villains.p.s. minus points for that one weird gratuitous zero-grav shower scene, for god\'s sake some Japanese animation, GROW UP! finds a pleasing satisfaction in breaking up and disintegrating objects.

His motivations are meaningless at worst and wholeheartedly flawed at best. He has zero sense of self and is for the most part an empty shell that both Harlock and Ezra use as a mouthpiece. I know the review guidelines say to avoid spoilers so with out going...into much detail, Yama switches his allegiance to either party at least a dozen times. He is so damn frustrating. If anyone reading this has watched Iron Fist, imagine Danny Rands level of taking everything at face value and times that by 10. He is infuriating and single-handedly ruins everything this movie had going for it.With that being said, the animation on this film is gorgeous and the sound editing is well above average for an animated feature. Was very impressed with both.In summation if you want to watch this movie for the animation then go ahead and do so, but if you want to watch it for story and character development, avoid it at all costs. into much detail, Yama switches his allegiance to either party at least a dozen times.

costs."", 'Warning possible SpoilersIt was kinda surprising to see that this movie was actually a remake of the original series back in the seventies, so I saw what the movie would offer and it wasn\'t as bad as I was expecting.Story (6/10)However just because it isn\'t bad, doesn\'t mean it has it\'s weak points and the story is definitely a weak point, sure it was simple as our MC Yama is a spy on Harlock\'s ship and tries to kill him, until he starts to realise what Harlock is doing and then a whole bunch of stuff that seemed like a ripoff of Wall-E happened, like...the fact that after many years of suffering, the Earth is finally supporting life again just seemed way too familiar.Although despite the story seeming familiar, it did have it\'s own stuff to go on, like ulterior motives, betrayal, hidden secrets and a whole religious scheme made the movie/film a little more interesting to watch, because for many years humanity has been fooled that the Earth was a safe haven, when really it wasn\'t and the whole government was keeping it hidden from the public.I couldn\'t exactly tell whether the pacing was good or not, considering what happened in the movie/film, although I do think the ending was one big Deus Ex Machina, especially when it came to Yama\'s character whose look and appearance resembled Harlock quite a bit, so his outcome by the end wasn\'t a surprise for me.The story wasn\'t bad, it just didn\'t have a lot of impact for me, apart from a few things that did make the movie/film stand out.Characters (6/10)The characters were another weaker aspect of the movie/film, because it looked like there wasn\'t any development for them whatsoever, well apart fro Yama and Harlock, but their the main characters so of cause there has to be some development there, but all the other characters felt like they were just along for the ride and some of them like Yuki and Miime looked like they could\'ve been big characters, but since this is a movie/film you have to put concentration on certain character\'s, otherwise there\'ll just be too much for the viewers to handle.It also surprises me how, apart from the bad guys and cannon fodder troops, no-one actually dies, which kinda disappointed me, but at the same time it didn\'t because it\'s setting up the TV series from the seventies.Pretty much there wasn\'t much interest in the characters other than that they can kick some ass and the concentration on Yama wasn\'t too bad either, until it\'s the usual he\'s doing this for someone he loves that he ended up hurting, which reminds of the only surprising death in the movie/film and that was the girl Yama liked, so there was something here.Art (8/10)Now I haven\'t seen many anime\'s in the 3-D CGI format, but it works really well here surprisingly, the designs of the ships were very well done, especially the Arcadia, which had a menacing, but badass feel to it.The design of the characters, weapons, armour and equipment was also top notch, although Harlock\'s crew\'s armour did look a lot like the Big Daddy suit from Bioshock, which I\'ll accept because it looked badass.Even the locations looked great too, including the capital city on Mars, it looked like something out of a fantasy, but made for a sci-fi setting.Sound (7/10)The soundtrack was pretty good, it captured the feel of what it would be like to be a space pirate, especially during the first space battle, it captured that feeling very well, although after that I couldn\'t really remember much else of the soundtrack.Extras:The action was definitely something entertaining to watch, awesome space battles, pretty hectic gunfights with CQC elements including a fight in zero-G and there was also quite a lot of Slow-mo in some fight scenes too, it didn\'t spoil the moment, but added a nice extra detail to the characters movement as they started kicking ass.Another thing is, I will watch anything in sub or dub, but I watched this in dub and thought ""yeah this would be better in sub"" so if you\'re going to watch this in dub, don\'t I would recommend watching it in sub, because some of the lines just didn\'t mix well with the lip-sync.Enjoyment (7/10)Overall (7/10)Overall this was a alright space pirate adventure, kickass space battles and great looking effects, but with a meh story and characters it can be a mixed result, however if you\'re

sure how much I would like this movie. I still looked forward to it and finally sat down and watched it.First the art and animation. Obviously it is a beautiful film and the action scenes are top notch. The Arcadia does it's classic ramming technique a few times which is sure to please long-time fans. The designs for the characters and settings were also amazing, so if you don't like anything else about the film you'll at least enjoy looking at it! I will say, though it's not much of a gripe, I did think...it was a bit odd that the characters all looked like regular people instead of the usual Matsumoto style. I can understand why they made this choice, however they included Harlock's bird which took on the same stylistic appearance as the original series while everyone else did not.The voice acting, I watched the dub and read the subtitles. I noticed in the subs the names of the characters are different which can be distracting. Overall the voice acting was good, Harlock was spot on.As for the characters and plot, this is where the film starts to fall apart. Speaking as a fan of the series, I couldn't help but be disappointed by the lack of vital characters. There was no Daiba or his father, only a replacement for him named Yama. A few other crew members that appear in the other series were also missing but that isn't a big deal. Kei was a bit more sassy than she usually is and Harlock also ended up being more selfish with his goals which I consider uncharacteristic. Miime also did not play her harp for some reason. However, Harlock, Yattaran and Kei were good on screen and had more investment with the audience than Yama or Ezra. Even with Ezra's redemption I still did not like him as a character. I'm probably just biased because of Daiba not being in it but I also did not care much for Yama.The plot was interesting, some parts were a bit boring but I think that's mostly on me. There was one thing that I didn't like about the plot and that was it's redundancy. I noticed similarities in the story to other movies especially a few that came to mind immediately while watching. I did enjoy the ending and look forward to possibly another installment.I'm probably being a bit too harsh here but those are my thoughts. The movie did keep me entertained throughout, I enjoyed seeing my favorite characters again and I'm sure others will enjoy it, especially on the big screen! it was a bit odd that the characters all looked like regular people instead of the usual Matsumoto style.

In every single case, without exception, I prefer stylized designs over hyperrealistic ones. Leiji Matsumoto's designs and characters have an extremely distinctive, instantly recognizable look, but they've been robbed of those stand-out qualities to just look realistic.While I find the CGI to look impressive, the characters' movements seem really weird. They are clearly mo-capped, which isn't bad by itself, but they have this weird, flowy quality that almost makes it hard to...watch them. The hair physics engine they use is clearly too sensitive, so even when they stand still and talk, their hair is influenced by that. It's a minor gripe but one I continually noticed throughout the movie.I was not too fond of how the characters were treated. While I did enjoy Kei being of more use than in the original series, she is a lot harder now and not as soft, which made her really charming in the original. Outside of her and Harlock, the characters have no distinctive personalities. Miime and Yattaran are only recognizable in design and don't resemble much of their original selves outside of that. Yattaran was also a goofy character who made model ships. He meant business when it came out, but he isn't his own character here.I also did not like Yama. He was more of the main character than Harlock and quite dull. He's at war with his brother throughout the movie, and Harlock just pitches in to help out. Yama has no real personality, and I wasn't invested in his story. I hate how the Harlock characters became so sidelined because of him; it was a major disappointment.Lastly, the movie simply didn't have that Harlock and Matsumoto charm. While Harlock was mainly a drama-oriented series, there were lighter moments where the crew just had fun and felt like a family. That is stripped away here. While I understand that this is a movie, so that can't pad up that limited time with those moments if Yama's scenes were cut, you easily could flesh out Harlock's crew. I'm disappointed only Harlock, his bird, Kei, Yattaran, and Miime were brought back; his entire crew had a lot of charm, like the doctor, engineer, cook, and even Mayu. Tochiro is barely mentioned and serves a very small purpose.So, it's not a good movie on its own, and it's not a good movie for Harlock fans. Do not watch. It's technically impressive, so if you want to just look at some shots and be inspired, that's about the only positives you can glean from this. watch them. The hair physics engine they use is clearly too sensitive, so even when they stand still and talk, their hair is influenced by that. It's a minor gripe but one I continually noticed throughout the movie.I was not too fond of how the characters were treated. While I did enjoy Kei being of more use than in the original series, she is a lot harder now and not as soft, which made her really charming in the original. Outside of her and Harlock, the characters have no distinctive personalities. Miime and Yattaran are only recognizable in design and don't resemble much of their original selves outside of that. Yattaran was also a goofy character who made model ships. He meant business when it came out, but he isn't his own character here.I also did not like Yama. He was more of the main character than Harlock and quite dull. He's at war with his brother throughout the movie, and Harlock just pitches in to help out. Yama has no real personality, and I wasn't invested in his story. I hate how the Harlock characters became so sidelined because of him; it was a major disappointment.Lastly, the movie simply didn't have that Harlock and Matsumoto charm. While Harlock was mainly a drama-oriented series, there were lighter moments where the crew just had fun and felt like a family. That is stripped away here. While I understand that this is a movie, so that can't pad up that limited time with those moments if Yama's scenes were cut, you easily could flesh out Harlock's crew.

It's still on the air 20 years later and yet never goes stale. The characters distinct and memorable. The story-lines simple yet unforgettable.Will it change your views or leave a mark?No. it was never meant to. A simple slice of life anime that deals with every day issues from a simpler time.

It does not have the special effects that we are now blessed with having.However, it is blessed with great storytelling and has a nice moral.Both movie (Disney) and story (by Charles Perrault) do not go in great detail about Cinderella's life before she went to the ball. This series tell a great deal, and, not only that, the twists make the story a bit more realistic, in my point of view.Fairy tails are always, or almost, the same and have many common components such as: love at first sight (without even knowing each other),...a villain or two defeat and a happy ending.In my opinion, Cinderella Monogatari changes all of these examples and weaves a story that is so great that you should overlook the fact that perhaps you do not like the ancient aspect of it. a villain or two defeat and a happy ending.In my opinion, Cinderella Monogatari changes all of these examples and weaves a story that is so great that you should overlook the fact that perhaps you do not like the ancient aspect of it."", ""This is my first time writing a review.At first I didn't think much of it as it is a older anime, but I convinced myself otherwise.I Did Wonder what it would of turned out to be like.To my surprise it was a little different then the normal Cinderella stories you hear about, not by much but had a good story that made me want to watch the next episode.Over all the build up of the characters and the ending was good.

Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo! - Oh wait, wrong soundtrack..This is YET another take on the classic story of Cinderella. A story of a young maiden forced to do unendless laborious house work under her own noble home by her wicked stepmother. Yep most of us is very much adept and familiar of how the story of this such pitiful maiden goes; but in this Anime adaptation of this classic tale holds a fine re-telling of the story.What set this apart from the rest is that it gave a much deeper background to Cinderella and the Prince relationship. I\'m a sucker for romance and especially...about ""RAG to RICHES"" stories. This series serves just that, with bonus morale lessons about Friendship, Love, Family and other goody values.In order to fully appreciate this series is that you just have to watch this with an open mind because their is an undeniable HUGE FLAW regarding its plot.

We get to see them interact throughout almost the entire series that you wish for Cinderella to realize it\'s the prince all along.

Why does she have a Fairy Godmother and so on.This was created back in the mid 90\'s so the animation is dated but you wouldn\'t care for it too much as it\'s still a decent quality. Forget about its technical aspect and just go with the flow. You\'ll adore this kiddie show. Episode 4 sealed the deal for me I knew I would end up loving this show. The ending was near pitch perfect.

It was made to be in-character and similar to our love of Hans Christian Anderson books. Cinderella is a decent and lovely lady but lives a eccentric and hardworking life after her dad leaves and her mother is dead. Two stepsisters and a stepmother treat Cinderella awfully and make her responsible for her stuff. But with the help of a couple of sweet and kindhearted animals and a fairy godmother, it improves her life. To me, it seems fair to me. The art was the old 90s but a...little more darker than series like Sailor Moon or anything according to that. The story was cute. I enjoyed it a bit. And the characters were pretty much kept in-character but poor Cinderella. The animals reminded me of the ones in The Rescuers (1977) where there was this little orphan girl who drops a bottle containing a plea for help into the water and two mice come out and rescue her from her evil aunt. I did this just for refreshment of memory. But by the by, Cinderella is a pretty much quirky animated series but is very cute and sweet; with just a touch of romance, most drama and fantasy alike. Not very much of a comedy but is more likely to capture or uplift your heart with a touch of some heart-warming moments. little more darker than series like Sailor Moon or anything according to that.

This is by far one of the best adaptations I have ever seen. It was such a good story. I loved how the prince and Cinderella met before the ball. The music was great. At times it was a bit louder than the dialogue though. I personally liked the character designs and thought the prince was very handsome.

I think there is one complaint I have about the series. I'll be honest... Cinderella, in this, isn't really the brightest, and the Dialogue is lackluster. Some parts are repetitive and redundant, and there are a lot of flashbacks that I think are a bit needless. Suspension of disbelief is sometimes ... eh. And the animation isn't always the smoothest. You see some obvious cycles in there at points.But by and large, this is still my favorite version of the story, and there's a lot more character development in this than there is in any other Cinderella, which makes the characters more realistic and more likable... even in the step-sisters sometimes.

I first watched this anime in dub and I couldn't help but notice that throughout over half the movie, there's a generic bird chirping sound. like in the background noise it's birds chirping I found it super annoying once I noticed it and wonder if...it was the same with the Japanese. I couldn't actually find the Japanese dub of it so idk if it is? it's just a weird thing. It's not just the copy I watched, everywhere that I've seen this movie it's the same lol.

You can tell this is an older show with a small budget but I honestly enjoyed the outdated sound effects because it reminded me of other shows I used to like. Where I think this show shines though is in storytelling and character writing; sure the baddie is a bit bland (although i like his kind of soft side in regards to his child) and while the redemption for some characters was hinted at it...did come a bit out of nowhere, but Cinderella, Charles, and their relationship are leaps and bounds better than any other Cinderella adaptation I’ve seen, and their relationship has better development than quite a few popular anime ships imo.

There could definitely be some improvements to this show but I think it’s a good watch nonetheless (although if you have a thing about good animation I wouldn’t recommend).Unrelevent side note; I also find it funny how Charles (the prince) looks like a slightly prettier version of Derek (the Swan Princess) and a dark haired version of John Smith (Pocahontas), 90s animation seems to have had a type. did come a bit out of nowhere, but Cinderella, Charles, and their relationship are leaps and bounds better than any other Cinderella adaptation I’ve seen, and their relationship has better development than quite a few popular anime ships imo.

D-Frag!*,https://myanimelist.net/anime/23383/D-Frag,"[""Ok, according to info, this OVA is taken from ninth special-edition volume of its manga, and I just gonna cut to the chase and just present my ratings for this OVA:Story and art: Mediocre 5.Because it was still the usual plot where there is no plot and everything rides on the male character, Kazama, so therefore there is nothing more to say on something when it was pretty obvious that it was the usual, same thing with the art since the one who did the illustration of both the manga and parent anime is the same one who did it anyways.Sound: Poor 3.Now I may...like the opening theme, but Kazama'z seiyuu, Konishi, Katsuyuki was really too old to do the voice of a 17 year old, in fact one can really tell that Kazama's voice is really done by a 40 year old man, Studio FUNimations should have taken the effort to choose a younger individual to do Kazama's voice. Also, Sakura's voice should have been done by Toyosaki, Aki, co'z, the character's seiyuu Takahashi, Mikako  doesn't have that playful tone that would fit the characters personality. Roka's voice is ok, but Chitose's voice isn't , her voice should've have been done by Ueda, Kana, and not by Saito Chiwa.Character, Enjoyment and Overall: Good 7.Unlike the parent anime where it involves the guy and the girls' antics, this time the focus was about the guy's sister, Noe and the water girl Sakura, of course the main character Kazama was still there, the threesome has given this OVA a whole new lease at least just for this OVA, which is good, since the threesomes' did provide a much change of enjoyment for this anime, especially when the competition for the guy's affection was with Nao vs Sakura, so overall it was good that we get to see Nao having her shine in this OVA.So should this OVA be followed up by a season 2, maybe, but, why not? like the opening theme, but Kazama'z seiyuu, Konishi, Katsuyuki was really too old to do the voice of a 17 year old, in fact one can really tell that Kazama's voice is really done by a 40 year old man, Studio FUNimations should have taken the effort to choose a younger individual to do Kazama's voice.

This actually makes for a nice change, as we see the characters outside of the school environment getting up to yet more crazy stuff.I know that some argue that D-frag lacks a clear direction from episode to episode, however I can think of one or two shows where the stories are self contained within each episode. I found this OVA to be a lot of fun and if your a fan of the series, then definitely watch it.The only criticism I...do have is regarding the voices, sometimes the voice actors sounded a little too mature for the characters they were voicing. But as I'm reading the subtitles and not paying much attention to the voices, it really didn't detract from the episode. do have is regarding the voices, sometimes the voice actors sounded a little too mature for the characters they were voicing.

And I have to agree it was nice that Sakura was finally brought into the light, since she kind of served as the most minor character in the club and never really had any major development.Noe is an enjoyable sister character, though she also appeared very rarely in the anime. She was mentioned plenty, but also has the tropes of respecting her brother a lot and being bashful about it.The most surprising thing about this OVA was the...fast food employee being Takao's mother, though I should have pieced that together earlier and felt kind of silly for not doing so before.This OVA shines a bit of light on certain characters and makes you realize Sakura is perfectly fitting of being in the club since she's whack in her own way. Of course, they shoehorned in the rest of the club before the OVA began, but the attention was definitely on Sakura and Noe.Oh, if only Tama appeared in this one. Though despite her absence, I still ranked this higher than the series, so it does a lot more right to me than the original. Maybe cause they visited a different location too, which gave it a sense of freshness. fast food employee being Takao's mother, though I should have pieced that together earlier and felt kind of silly for not doing so before.This OVA shines a bit of light on certain characters and makes you realize Sakura is perfectly fitting of being in the club since she's whack in her own way.

Dareka no Manazashi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/17121/Dareka_no_Manazashi,"['""An ounce of blood is worth more than a pound of friendship.""There have probably been cases in all of our lives in which we took our families for granted. When I look back on my life I realize I was a selfish, greedy kid. Growing up in a suburb of the United States will make you that way. You want to fit in with the \'now\' and want to be socially acceptable so you aren\'t judged by others. I\'ve bought material things to impress people I don\'t know, shown off the newest fashion or technology to friends to feel an ounce of vanity, and gone...out of my way to do something because a \'friend\' asked me to; I valued my friends more than my family at several points in my life.There comes a point in life, however, when you might just come to realize something. Friends aren\'t always there for you like your family is. Friends come and go; their affections are usually conditional and demanding. This isn\'t always the case, as there are exceptions to this. Some friends display an immense, unwavering loyalty, and some family members couldn\'t give less than a shit about us. However, in most cases, your family will always love you unconditionally; they took care of you when you were sick, fed you, clothed you, gave you an education, and put a roof over your head. They\'ve worked hard for us and shouldn\'t be taken for granted or forgotten. In an animated short film of about six minutes, all this is admirably depicted.Dareka no Manazashi follows a young girl, who has moved out of her parents\' place and has sought an independent life in the work force. Though things are tough for her and she struggles to make a living, she lies to her father about how her life truly is. Both she and her father struggle with loneliness since their family has lost the close-knit bond that they once had. Despite how distant they have become, this animated short shows that it\'s never too late to reform those bonds.What\'s really strong about the story is how realistic it is for something of a short slice of life drama. In only a few minutes Dareka no Manazashi presents a clear, heartfelt message to their audience. The way it is presented, however, is not perfect. Personally, I didn\'t enjoy the flow of the story as much as other comparable animated short films like Rain Town or Tsumiki no Ie. Some parts of Dareka no Manazashi felt random and too quick to bounce around. While the overall message was great, the execution of how the story was told was only fair.The art/animation of Dareka no Manazashi was marvelous. Everything looks simply stunning and I couldn\'t ask for more. The soundtrack was good overall. There is the classic piano tingle for the soul, and an actual song near the middle of the series. I enjoyed the aesthetics and soundtrack that Dareka no Manazashi had to offer.The characters that are the prime focus are the daughter and the father. You can\'t help but empathize for both of these characters because they are so human. In the span of just a few minutes I grew attached to this family and wanted to see them attain happiness.After watching Dareka no Manazashi one can\'t help but think about the past. Somewhere along the line we\'ve lost our innocence and love for the simple things in life. We\'ve lost that little bit of bliss that stems from our ignorance. Maybe we\'ve outgrown all the things that we once loved. But who knows?

It doesn’t ask for any more of your precious time. Amidst all the troubles in life, if you decide and manage to invest that amount of time in watching this ultra short film, what you get is something that will undoubtedly stay with you for a long time.Dareka no Manazashi awes with its simplicity. It portrays a certain phase of human life, i.e., the growing up phase and the changes that come along with it in one’s life, that almost every person experiences. It is about how we tend to put up facades in public just for the sake of presenting ourselves as...intellectual grown-ups. It is also about how during this process, we end up losing our child-like innocence and the ability to be brazenly honest about our true feelings.Humans are a strange lot. As children, we possess such noble virtues of honesty and good-will but as we grow up and enter adulthood, we try our best to discard them, largely because of the fear of being ridiculed and not being taken seriously in the harsh world of adults. This film expresses just that. What is really appreciable about the film is that it does not try to pass a judgement. It doesn’t advise us on whether it’s the right thing to do or not. It does not tell us whether it’s the right way or not. It just puts forth a stark reality of human life before us and tries to be optimistic about the happening of it all.The film shows the advent of the transition phase in a girl’s life, her gradual years of growing up from a child to a self-sustaining adult, and how it affects her relations with her father and family.Aya Okamura, the girl and lady in question, lived happily with her father and mother in a typical nuclear family. She had a certain sense of freeness as a child, always happy and joyous in the presence of her doting parents. But gradually, as life takes certain turns, she starts to feel ashamed of her parents, making jokes about them in front of friends and also develops an independent streak which makes her live on her own away from them. But in reality, she feels guilty of it all and tries to make amends. This is something most of us experience in life and it is the films very close connect with reality that makes it a good watch.Even if we stay away from our parents, we always crave for them, consciously or sub-consciously. Sometimes we are unable to admit it in fear of sounding weak or just feel ashamed. But we do, at all times, feel the pangs of separation from our parents when we live apart from them. The child in us always craves for those two special people. No matter how much we may deny it, the one thing that supports us in life and which is the pillar of our existence in the world is our family. This is the core message Dareka no Manazashi tries to convey.The world is a tough place to survive in and more so, when one is alone. We realize how we have been protected and cared for by our parents only when we separate from them. It is then that our heart cries for them. It is then that we want them to shield us from the harshness of the world over again. Aya’s beautiful relation with her father is heart-warming. The mutual love they have for each other is undeniably great though they do not express it openly at any point of time. It’s her family that matters to her the most, is what the narrator hopes Aya to realize. And us as well.The animation is beautiful and fitting. It complements the atmosphere built up wonderfully with some neat artwork. The background song that starts playing towards the end is soulful and heart-felt and connects deeply with the message that the film tries to convey.In overall, the film is a great watch. Not only does it manage to bring tears to your eyes in such a short period of time but also it enriches you with a certain realization. It does not obfuscate but rather presents some everyday events that occur in almost every human’s life in a simplified manner. And therein lies its charm because as they say, in simplicity lies greatness. intellectual grown-ups.

I wouldn´t say that there aren´t many who can actually achieve this, but there are definetly very few who can pull it off in less than seven minutes. 6 minutes and 40 seconds of screentime  is all that Makoto Shinkai needs to tell the bittersweet story that is Dareka no Manazashi.In this little story about family values,  it is impressive how Shinkai manages to use the seven minutes he has here... we learn just  enough about the characters and their background to care about them, making the film quite...a tearjerker if you tend to weep easily. Despite the runtime, nothing seems rushed and the show is surprisingly slow paced.The animation is, like the story, beautiful. However i could´t help but think i´m watching Garden of Words again, a film from the exact same writer, animated by the exact same studio in the exact same year. Those two just look a little too similar for my taste, a bit of originality would´ve been nice here.The theme song is not for me, but i can´t say that it doesn´t fit the overall feel of the show...so what we have here is a lovely piece of art that should not be missed by anyone (like all of Shinkai´s works in my opinion).

Tired, she just wants to get home and collapse in bed. She is surprised by a call from his father, who wants to have dinner with her. But her...day was so overwhelming that she just wants to be alone and invents a story to no go see him. In here, the narrator shows a bit of Aya's relationship with his family from the beginning until now, and shows that she really has left behind the choices they have made\u200b\u200b, as well as his father.I will not comment much about this OVA, but recommend everyone to attend it. With beautiful music in the background, Dareka Manazashi goes deep in the soul of those who have left home to build their own lives: the challenges, loneliness, and the price we pay for fighting for our dreams.

Everything in just 6 minutes.Beautiful."", 'Dareka no Manazashi (DnM for short) is a short film directed by Makoto Shinkai - if you\'re an anime fan in any capacity, you\'re probably familiar with some of the titles he\'s directed, such as Byousoku 5 Centimeter and the more recent Kimi no Na wa. His films are often described as bittersweet and sentimental, and this is also the case with DnM. However, the short length and consequential underdevelopent of the many plot points the film presents left me feeling underwhelmed - like this was something that had the potential to be emotionally touching, if given more time.DnM is visually stunning, featuring vibrant colors,...attractive character designs and skilled use of lighting to match the story\'s emotional shifts. However, the ""near future"" setting adds nothing to the overall story - it could have just as easily taken place in the present.The voice actors portrayed their characters with conviction and heart. The music was soft piano for the bulk of the film and a piano ballad at the end, which fit the mood of the story well. All aspects of sound featured in DnM were pleasing but nothing spectacular.The story of DnM centers around Aya Okamura and the evolution of her relationship with her family, and many focal points of this relationship are shown, past and present, ups and downs. The common thread between these plot points is that very little time is spent on any of them, preventing the viewer from establishing much of a meaningful connection with the plot or the characters portrayed in the story. Speaking of the characters, they\'ve got a surprising amount of personality for the short time they\'re shown, but because we don\'t get to see that much of them it\'s hard to find yourself caring about their lives, day-to-day troubles, or relationships with one another. The themes of the story, in addition, are underexplored due to the film\'s brevity and quick switches from scene to scene.I do have one gripe about a potential ""plothole"", which is strange for a film that isn\'t even seven minutes long - it has no impact on the events of the story, but left me slightly puzzled. Near the end of the film, it\'s heavily implied that the narrator is one of the characters from the story. However, this narrator describes events as if they were there from before their character was actually introduced in the story, which raises questions. Whether this was an oversight or just Shinkai taking creative liberties with the narration, I found it a bit odd.Overall, DnM is a good example of an adequate film that could have been much better given more time to grow and develop. There\'s a lot here with potential that is never met, which is a shame, but the framework for a more solid film is present. attractive character designs and skilled use of lighting to match the story\'s emotional shifts.

The themes of the story, in addition, are underexplored due to the film\'s brevity and quick switches from scene to scene.I do have one gripe about a potential ""plothole"", which is strange for a film that isn\'t even seven minutes long - it has no impact on the events of the story, but left me slightly puzzled. Near the end of the film, it\'s heavily implied that the narrator is one of the characters from the story. However, this narrator describes events as if they were there from before their character was actually introduced in the story, which raises questions. Whether this was an oversight or just Shinkai taking creative liberties with the narration, I found it a bit odd.Overall, DnM is a good example of an adequate film that could have been much better given more time to grow and develop. There\'s a lot here with potential that is never met, which is a shame, but the framework for a more solid film is present.', 'This\'ll be my first review on MyAnimeList, but I hope it will be useful.I\'ve been following Makoto Shinkai for quite some time now, it all started with ""5 Centimeters per second"" ever since then I couldn\'t wait for his future releases. I noticed that his short was released so I watched it as quick as I could!Story 8/10:I was carried away with the story pretty fast, I don\'t think you need a summery of a story that is 6 minutes long. Shortly: I liked it.Art 10/10:As expected from Makoto Shinkai, the art was amazing and was truly eye-candy.Full 10 points well deserved....Sound 9/10:The soundtrack and short voice acting were really good, and the quality delivered was amazing. I especially loved the piano at the background.Character 10/10:As you can imagine, the character development is pretty hard for a 6 min short, but even then I felt like I already knew the characters and was already bounding with them after 4 minutes.Enjoyment 7/10:I would\'ve given it a 9/10 but the narrator was sometimes pretty annoying, I think it would\'ve been better if it would give us a little time sometimes to let the dialog sink in. The narrator also didn\'t stop talking in the moment of the possible tearjerker/drama, the feeling just didn\'t felt as strong at I\'m used to when watching his work.Overall 8/10:I would recommend this short for anybody!

It is a little hard to believe that this visually stunning short animation was made for a trade exposition.Due to the shortness of the animation it is difficult to write a detailed review.

Most of the film shows the daughter growing up and as she does so she becomes less and less close to her father but ironically her growing independence makes her father proud but lonely.The mother appears, we assume, to have moved overseas for work leaving the father and daughter a lone and it is possibly the mother doing the narration all the while a soft melodic piano score is played over the top.A beautiful short animation and well worth 6 minutes of your life. happiness back in to their lives.The story is a heavily narrated story about the relationship between a father and daughter who have grown apart as the daughter has matured and left home.

However, this beautiful film has taken advantage of that limited time to tell a life story that is extremely parallel to reality. As an avid fan of gore, violence, action, fantasy etc., it was refreshing to take a step back and enjoy something different.This film broke my heart and got me sobbing for the entire day, probably because I am going through the phase of rebellion and maturity which made the movie extremely applicable to my life.It's about time I respected the notion of...'family' :) 'family' :)"", ""Ae seen in anime shorts such as The house of small cubes and furiko, it does not take a long time to tell an amazing story. However it continues to amaze me how well narratives are presented in a short time frame. Dareka no Manazashi is yet another example of this concept.Makoto Shinkai is the director of this short and he also directed one of my favorite romance stories of all time in The Garden of words. He also directed the film five centimeters per second which is also critically acclaimed. And you can definitely tell just by looking at it that it is by...him.The story of Dareka no manazashi is a very simple tale but is outstanding in execution and incorporates a beautiful message that deserves to be heard by absolutely everyone who has ever had conflict with their family. There isn't a deep structure or intricate plot devices. However simplicity is what sells this story and it's definitely a well executed plot despite its lack of complexity.The characters of this story are kind of dossapointing. However they are human in their behaviors and don't seem cheap or unrealistic. Obviously it is difficult to fully develop and humanize a character in 6 minutes however despite being used as a template these characters are well used for the expression of the central theme of the work.There is some good music in this story(especially the ending theme). And the voice acting was solid and I had no problem. The visuals were beautiful as expected from Makoto Shinkai. These visuals were rich in detail and just really pretty to look at.In conclusion Dareka no manazashi is an impressive story despite its very short run time it manages to convey a mature theme with a effective narrative.

I felt the need to search further into the man\'s work, and the first thing I stumbled upon was this short film that I\'m reviewing now.It\'s only a short and sweet 7 minutes. The intent of this short is to remind people what growing up feels like from the perspectives of both the parent and the child.

It\'s a hard technique to pull off, but it\'s done very well here.

With wonderfully made character designs and scenery.  However, what bugs me is the fact that this OVA didn\'t really meet up fully to its anime parent.  The background characters for the majority of the OVA were literally white blobs with a face.  To me, this saddened me, as the creators sort of took the ""easy"" way out.  The sound is reused from its anime counterpart and needs no further explanation.Personal enjoyment (7/10): While this wasn\'t as good as I thought it was going to be, it was still entertaining.

It\'s a premise that\'s both ridiculous and intriguing at the same time.The main character, Shido, is your typical harem protagonist - he\'s kind, dense, and always seems to find himself in compromising situations with the female characters. However, he does have...a unique ability that sets him apart - he can seal the Spirits\' powers by kissing them. It\'s a bit of a strange mechanic, but it adds to the overall charm of the show.The music in Date A Live is decent, with a few catchy opening and ending themes. However, it\'s not particularly memorable and doesn\'t add much to the overall experience.As for the enjoyment experience, can be a hit or miss for viewers. If you\'re a fan of harem anime and don\'t mind some ecchi moments, then you might enjoy it. However, if you\'re looking for a deeper sci-fi story or well-developed characters, then you might want to look elsewhere.Overall, I\'d give Date A Live a 7.5 out of 10. It\'s a fun, entertaining show that doesn\'t take itself too seriously, but it\'s not without its flaws.

Ini adalah premis yang konyol dan menarik pada saat yang sama.Karakter utama, Shido, adalah protagonis harem biasa - ia baik hati, tumpul, dan selalu tampaknya menemukan dirinya dalam situasi yang memalukan dengan karakter perempuan. Namun, dia memiliki kemampuan yang unik yang membedakannya - dia dapat menutup kekuatan Spirits dengan mencium mereka. Ini sedikit mekanik aneh, tetapi menambah pesona keseluruhan acara.Musik di Date A Live cukup baik, dengan beberapa lagu pembuka dan penutup yang catchy. Namun, itu tidak terlalu mudah diingat dan tidak menambah banyak pengalaman secara keseluruhan.Untuk pengalaman yang menyenangkan, ini dapat menjadi hit atau miss bagi penonton. Jika Anda penggemar anime harem dan tidak keberatan dengan beberapa momen ecchi, maka Anda mungkin menikmatinya. Namun, jika Anda mencari cerita fiksi ilmiah yang lebih dalam atau karakter yang terkenal, maka Anda mungkin ingin mencari di tempat lain.Secara keseluruhan, saya memberikan Date A Live 7,5 dari 10.

Ini adalah premis yang konyol dan menarik pada saat yang sama.Karakter utama, Shido, adalah protagonis harem biasa - ia baik hati, tumpul, dan selalu tampaknya menemukan dirinya dalam situasi yang memalukan dengan karakter perempuan. Namun, dia memiliki kemampuan yang unik yang membedakannya - dia dapat menutup kekuatan Spirits dengan mencium mereka. Ini sedikit mekanik aneh, tetapi menambah pesona keseluruhan acara.Musik di Date A Live cukup baik, dengan beberapa lagu pembuka dan penutup yang catchy. Namun, itu tidak terlalu mudah diingat dan tidak menambah banyak pengalaman secara keseluruhan.Untuk pengalaman yang menyenangkan, ini dapat menjadi hit atau miss bagi penonton. Jika Anda penggemar anime harem dan tidak keberatan dengan beberapa momen ecchi, maka Anda mungkin menikmatinya. Namun, jika Anda mencari cerita fiksi ilmiah yang lebih dalam atau karakter yang terkenal, maka Anda mungkin ingin mencari di tempat lain.Secara keseluruhan, saya memberikan Date A Live 7,5 dari 10. Ini adalah acara yang menyenangkan dan menghibur yang tidak terlalu serius, tetapi tidak tanpa kekurangan.

I already did a review for season 1 and my Date A Live re-watching experience continues with this OVA. This is actually the second time I've watched this OVA, and the first time I watched it in English. So, does it provide entertainment? Well, let's hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryAdmittedly, apart from the dating, season 1 doesn't have much in the way of a story and this OVA is no different. The premise is...that Shido goes on different dates with Origami and Tohka to clear up some misunderstandings with them. There is a decent amount of character drama to be had, but the overarching element here is comedy, plain and simple. Origami and Tohka subject Shido to quite a few comedic situations and the Ratatoskr team doesn't make things easier for him, either. Considering how season 1 ended, I don't know which place does this OVA take in the show's overarching timeline, but this OVA merely exists for comedic purposes, so we probably shouldn't take it seriously.Some TV shows enjoy using mean-spirited humor and to regularly humiliate their protagonists, but Date A Live isn't one of them. The humor can be a bit weird, but it never feels cruel and the episode always remains light-hearted and highly enjoyable. There is a small amount of fanservice, but thankfully, the characters are never objectified. By the end of the day, this OVA is simply harmless escapism ready to provide a light-hearted laugh. (8/10)CharactersShido, Tohka and Origami retain their basic characterizations from season 1. Tohka and Origami are still overly attached to Shido, who tries to keep the peace between them. Shido is still one of the best examples of the everyman archetype I've watched in recent anime history and his interactions with the supporting cast are what makes the show so fun in the first place. Character writing has always been one of Date A Live's biggest strengths and I'm glad this particular aspect of this show was handled well. (9/10)ArtSince there wasn't much to strain the animation budget here, the art quality was fine. The overly exaggerated facial expressions work really well for the comedy scenarios and the retro video game graphics were used to great effect. The character designs were amazing and help illustrate how distinctive and unique the characters are. (8/10)SoundJosh Grelle still delivers the perfect everyman voice for Shido and he has great chemistry with both Michelle Rojas and Michelle Lee. Rojas and Lee do an amazing job at conveying Tohka and Origami's rivalry. I also liked Bryn Apprill's performance as Kotori, who is just as shocked by Origami's antics as Shido is. Despite the comedic nature of this little story, the cast does wonders and that deserves no shortage of praise. (8/10)OverallDate A Live was one of the first anime shows I've watched as an adult and left a huge mark on my experience as an anime fan. Season 1 was great and this OVA improved on it by focusing on the characters and increasing the comedy. Does it advance the story in any meaningful way? No. I still don't know what impact it has on the larger story. Should you still watch it? Of course!

So on the first season I mentioned how this show was a guilty pleasure of mine and the only non-nitpicky complaint i had was Origami\'s motives aren\'t well explained. Well here we are witht he season 1 OVA. So let\'s make this a quick one.Story: 6The potential was lost on this one. It starts off being about Origami, which immediately said to me, ""Ok cool. I may finally learn something that with resemble a backstory for her or...maybe just clue me in as to why she goes after Shido"". Boy was I wrong. It\'s just a short plot that proves further that Origami is nuts for him. Thanks, already knew that. The other half of the story follows Shido and Tohka, but to be honest I didn\'t really care about this part as much due to my disappointment with the first part. The second half is good but you can\'t help but say, ""I\'ve seen this before"".Art: 8Same as in season !, the art is good and nice to look at. Nuff said.Sound: 9The opening is still the same, which is good, as well as the ending, which is also good. There isn\'t really anything much different here so if you want a better explaination, check out my season 1 review.Character: 6Again, because of the wasted potential we don\'t really see and get anything new from this OVA. The characters involved stay the same and what happens isn\'t anything new to the table. They are still their likeable selves but in the end you still look back on the adventure and wonder what all changed and if it was worth it. I will say though nice easter egg. I didn\'t see it till i watched it a second time.Enjoyment: 7If you couldn\'t tell from the previously metioned, I feel like this was wasted potential. It was a nice story all in all, but I wanted to see something different. Something to help me get a better grasp of these characters or even make them more likeable. Don\'t think that me not enjoying it as much means they did it poorly, it was a good extra and I was glad I watched it. It\'s just that they didn\'t really do much different. But maybe its just me having preconceptions about what the extra was about. Who knows, who cares. It was good enough.Overall:7Taking the score of season 1 (score of 8), this averages the series to a 7.5 right now. maybe just clue me in as to why she goes after Shido"". Boy was I wrong.

As far as plot goes, there really isn’t one. Essentially, there’s a bunch of vulgar shock humor and fan service scenes.The first half is about Shido trying to get Origami to break up with him, and the rest of the story is about Tohka and her competing with Origami for Shido’s affection. I found some of the shock humor funny, but other than that it was kinda boring, which makes sense because it’s just a bonus OVA.In conclusion, if you’re looking for something plot relevant here, skip this. If you just want...more Date A Live before watching Season 2, watch this. But don’t expect to be blown away or anything. more Date A Live before watching Season 2, watch this. But don’t expect to be blown away or anything.', ""Beyond wholesome OVA, had me smiling the entire time watching. Tohka and Origami are the best girls in the show and this episode really demonstrated why in my opinion. In short, the OVA is split into half of an Origami date and half of a Tohka date, Origami's being more humor oriented and Tohka's more wholesome (while still containing some humor). The animation is similar to that of S1 and S2 (peak season and animation/art style of the date of live series) and the sound design is upbeat and nicely voice acted as always. Absolutely a must watch of any Date a Live fan or...if you just are looking for a quick 23 minute smiling break. if you just are looking for a quick 23 minute smiling break."", 'OVA of Date a live which is what i going called as episodes 12 instead the firsst season bring conclusion by using filler episodes included rival between origami and Tokha there start fighting against in arcade but one of best fanseverice scene when Shido accidentally show tokha embrassing photo front of classmates it was so funny but like how tokha do get pretty anger against by destroying arcade but overall it was good and it end of first season i kind of enjoy seeing first opening blasted off with catchy themes and it kind of my favourite anime with putting on my top best harem...series series']"
Black Cat (TV),https://myanimelist.net/anime/68/Black_Cat_TV,"['Gah~ Ceray\'s Review Time (procrastination in disguise)! Anyway, this is the review for the anime Black Cat. The anime is about Black Cat, also known as Train Heartnet, who once was an assassin for the organization Chronos. Due to events that happen in the story, Train quits being an assassin to becoming a sweeper/bounty hunter.Plot: Since I haven\'t read the manga (yet) I can\'t compare the plots, I do know, however, that the storyline has changed a bit, however that doesn\'t really affect the story. The main part of the story consists of Train more or less wanting to confront a ghost from his past...and this takes up roughly a little less than half the series. Though it\'s good that Black Cat had other small subplots, it felt rushed at times, as if they wanted to get straight to the action, which took away from the enjoyment. That aside, the story was wonderful, and kept me anxious for the next episode (which is why I finished so quickly), wanting to know what would happen to Train and company next.Score: 7/10Animation: If you want me to express what I though about the animation for Black Cat in one word that word would be ""PWETTY."" Not pretty, but pwetty. The animation is smooth and does look all.... icky. Yeah. If there\'s one thing about the animation that I have to point out is that Train looks younger, a few years younger. I mean, he\'s twenty three in the manga, but in the anime he looks nineteen (age change could be because of the changed time line...). What else should I say? The ending animation for the first twelve episodes is amusing, but only until... episode eight, but honestly I was missing it after a while. But, that\'s not the point, and the point is that Black Cat\'s animation nice... No reused animation, as far as I saw.Score:10/10Sound: Ah~ The background music, it\'s music to my ears. The music pretty much matches the mood of the current scene, for example during the dramatic scenes some sort of opera sounding music plays giving you that... ominous (?) feeling. I absolutely adored the piano version of the song Konoyo no Uta, which plays at certain points in the series. The opening theme, Daia no Hana, is amazing as well... However, the first ending theme Namidaboshi sometimes doesn\'t match the mood of the episode that it\'s ending...Now usually, I don\'t watch subs, this is because I\'d rather hear it in English, with Black Cat, I had no choice but to watch it subbed... And how wonderful it was. Takashi Kondo pulls Train off extremely well, sounding one way when serious and totally lighthearted another way. Also Shin\'ichiro Miki makes Creed sound absolutely obsessed, which is good... I guess...Cept, I dun like Creed...Score:9/10Character: Ah. Do I have to put this? I totally love the characters of Black Cat... Even Creed, who scares me a lot. They aren\'t all that different than their manga counterparts, which is... good, and you can really tell the difference between then, Train is Train, Tanya is Tanya and Creed.... is obsessed.Score: 9/10Enjoyment: ... Must I explain?... Well... I sorta watched the whole series for Train... So... yeah...Score: 9/10Overall:Yay!: Animation is smooth and pwetty. Smooth animation is good on Ceray\'s glasses ridden eyes.Nay!: Plot was way too rushed. Pull it out at least ten or so more episoes.Score: 9/10 and this takes up roughly a little less than half the series.

I did not enjoy this series as much as i thought i would like it mainly because of the plot and how it got fairly rushed in the end.Story - The beginning part of the story i thought was very well made, it was very dark, mysterious but not scary at all for those who dislike scary storylines. But after a while the plot just seem dull and unoriginal. Typical protagonist trying to save the world, trying to protect his friends and trying to get revenge, all these types of storylines has been overused, if Black...Cat had a better storyline, i believe it would have been better.Art - I liked the design of the characters, especially Train during the beginning of the series. So i have nothing to complain about the art category.Sound- Not much to review about sound, but i have to admit the gunshots were pretty real. Also, the voice actors fitted the role very well, especially Eve and Sven. The OP was quite nice, fitted into the anime quite nice.. Forgot how the ED goes so i can't review that.Character- One of the things that makes Black Cat enjoyable are the wide variety of characters. It is quite amusing watching Jenos and Rins yell at each other. So if your looking for some humorous characters, Black Cat has that for you. The one thing that i thought lacked in the character section was the sudden change of Train Heartnet. Although it says half a year has passed, I'm pretty sure people other then me wants to watch the process of him from a deadly assassin to a overly energetic young man. Another reason i suggest Black Cat was rushed.Enjoyment- Black Cat is actually quite enjoyable if you do not care about the unoriginal storyline seeing that the characters are greatly designed and there are many great fight scenes.Overall- Overall i would say Black Cat is a fair made anime that fails to achieve better due to the lack of storyline and how it is quite rushed. Although i say this, i still enjoyed Black Cat to it's full potential. Cat had a better storyline, i believe it would have been better.Art - I liked the design of the characters, especially Train during the beginning of the series.

It’s been two years since I watched this anime and I’m still a little bitter at how much potential remained unrealized at its end.Black Cat is about this assassin named Train Heartnet (hey, at least he escaped whoever named all the characters in Geass). Or wait, it’s about this secret bio-weapon disguised as a loli named Eve. Actually no, it’s about this bounty hunter dude named Sven. Oh, wait, never mind, I remember, it’s actually about the villain, Creed, who has a hard-on for Train. No hang...on, it might’ve been about the organization that Train worked for, Chronos…See, I’m writing all of this as if the abundance of disparate elements in the plot is a bad thing, but the thing is, the story started out with a ton of potential. The first four or five episodes do a great job of tying all these characters together in a sensible and, dare I say, a captivating manner. Seriously, the beginning of this show is excellent. It’s exciting and a bit dark without getting too edgy or angsty, the characters all have good synergy and play off of each other very well, and the pacing is near-perfect.And then the timeskip happens.I’ll try to be brief and not spoil anything here, but suffice it to say that a certain main character’s personality does a complete 180 after the timeskip, and virtually zero explanation for the change is given to the viewer, outside of occasional scattered hints that refer to certain events that happened pre-timeskip. This is unfortunately only the beginning, as the rest of the anime devolves into a giant mess of hastily-introduced and poorly-fleshed-out characters, a distinct lack of focus on core plot points that the initial episodes tried to establish, and a ridiculous number of plot contrivances that attempt to reconcile this lack of focus, to no avail. The pacing is haphazard at best and has all the grace of a one-legged donkey at worst. The only relatively consistent character throughout the show is Sven; everyone else undergoes obscenely rushed character “development”, which is really just most of the characters overreacting to major events and, much like aforementioned main character, completely flipping the script on their personalities and becoming the exact opposite of who they originally were. This isn’t even mentioning the staggering number of characters this show introduces. There are like 10 new villains that arrived on the scene halfway through the show, plus all the Chronos assassins and executives, plus the guys who were in charge of those 10 or so new villains I just mentioned…the list just keeps growing and growing, and almost none of them get any kind of proper characterization, let alone development. It’s as if Naruto or One Piece were to condense themselves into 25 or so episodes, and cram their entire casts and plot into that timeframe. It’s insane.All that being said, the anime does have its good qualities. As I said before, the first part of the anime is very well done, and it constructs a reasonably compelling narrative while introducing a pretty solid cast of characters to drive it forward. The art and animation are also good, although the color palette was a little weird and off-putting at times. The soundtrack is fairly strong as well, and I am particularly fond of the opening theme.Ultimately, the overwhelming number of flaws prevent this anime from being anything more than way below-average at best. In truth, the last three-quarters or so of this anime are straight up terrible in terms of execution. Still, though…I can only imagine how much more enjoyable this anime could’ve been if they had just stuck to the format the first few episodes had established. It’s a damn shame. on, it might’ve been about the organization that Train worked for, Chronos…See, I’m writing all of this as if the abundance of disparate elements in the plot is a bad thing, but the thing is, the story started out with a ton of potential.

I didn&rsquo;t like it at first probably because it was a bit serious, and its first impression on me wasn&rsquo;t that good. The storyline for the first few episodes didn&rsquo;t grab me, and I found myself always distracted by something else.The storyline was promising, but I felt like the creators tried to fit as much as they can in only 26 episodes. Only the last three episodes were dedicated to Eve&rsquo;s true nature, which was almost forgotten.Character design was average. The Numbers and the other villains who had the power...of the Tao looked impressive (Specially Leon), but Sven was just weird, Eve had a big head (although she was adorable when she became a bit human) and Rins tried to pull of some fan service but it didn&rsquo;t work too well for her. I have to say the characters were poorly managed &ndash; there were just too many of them and in the end, not everyone was able to get a good amount of screen time. I don&rsquo;t even know the names of most of the sweepers from the sweeper alliance. A lot of them were unnecessary too. Although I still find myself liking Train. He was so cool and mysterious at first but in the end he became so wacky and funny and just adorable.Drawing style was so &ndash; so. I felt like it was almost there, but still quite lacking. Train was well drawn, but there were times when the drawing style would change and his face would morph. Speaking of morph, I noticed that the colors were inconsistent, specially when it came to hair colors. Towards the end I noticed that Sven&rsquo;s hair was a darker green, and Eve&rsquo;s hair was a paler yellow, and Rins&rsquo; hair was also a lighter purple. The colors were just sub par. I would also like to note the use of CG, which complimented the animation.The voice acting was okay. At first I thought Train&rsquo;s voice didn&rsquo;t match him, because he looked too young and his voice was too low. When he became more cheerful and friendly, his voice changed and became more suited to his personality. I was also happy to find out that Number X&rsquo;s (Shaolee?) seiyu was the same seiyu for Kohsaka from Genshiken, Wolfram from Kyo Kara Maoh!, Junior from R.O.D the TV and Robert Haydn from Law of Ueki. I love all of those series and I thought the seiyu for all those characters did well too, so it was definitely a plus to have her be a seiyu for Black Cat as well, even if it&rsquo;s just a supporting role.I&rsquo;m a big fan of the BGM for this series. I thought the BMG complimented the scenes well, and if not, improved the feel of the scenes. I was a bit indifferent towards the opening and ending themes, specially the first ending theme &ndash; I just thought it didn&rsquo;t match the anime at all, but it grew on me. Same for the second ending theme which was a bit dull and boring, but in the end I got to appreciate its beauty.It did reach my expectations &ndash; it lived up to the name of Gonzo after all. It was a good decision to watch it and I understand why it&rsquo;s so popular in the Philippines. I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s great, specially since the ending under whelmed me (yet again), but it was a good watch for most of the time. of the Tao looked impressive (Specially Leon), but Sven was just weird, Eve had a big head (although she was adorable when she became a bit human) and Rins tried to pull of some fan service but it didn&rsquo;t work too well for her.

It has a genuine plot that has...a clear goal and approaches it with a fairly consistent pace; it is rather all the little details which detract from this anime for me. The manga's art is more enjoyable since it is not poorly animated, its plot is executed more grandiosely, which is the main difference besides art that bothers me, and the manga allows you to imagine how the characters act a little more, and while sometimes an anime exceeds my imagination, as I am not very creative, it did not in this instance.I think the easiest place to start is the art. If you have watched a lot of Gonzo, then you probably have found that although maybe not always superb, they have had a hand in such creations as Gankutsuou or Last Exile with superb animation that moves very naturally (except in the terrible mech scene), and even in less refined instances like Full Metal Panic! or Gantz is still quite acceptable typically. In this anime it moves very awkwardly and left me rendered uncomfortable the entire anime. It is not the worst art ever, and I am giving it a three not so much for the actual drawing style, which is probably around fairly typical, but for the emphatically terrible way in which movement occurs.The voice acting is stellar. In regard to music, I usually try to rate it this way: if it does not detract from the anime, then I am not upset (if it detracts I will rate it a 1 or 2 by default). In this case, it is certainly no Cowboy Bebop or anything, but it never terribly detracts, distracts, or annoys.I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that the plot changes they made were for the amount of time they had allotted to do with the amount of episodes, but I found almost every plot change to be for the worse, which is why I penalized the story so highly. It is much more exciting and constantly 'epic' in the manga. I will not spoil them here, but if you have read and not watched or vice versa, then you will easily notice them. a clear goal and approaches it with a fairly consistent pace; it is rather all the little details which detract from this anime for me.

Needless to say my review will probably be taken as a dissenting opinion from the majority who have given this show a medium to low score. Black Cat is not a bad show and it's not really a disappointing show either....only to those who selected this series with the expectation of finding the next Holy Grail of an anime, i.e., Cowboy Bebop or Trigun.If...you decide to pick this series to watch, then judge it on it's own merit and you will enjoy it a lot better. There's a nice mixture of funny and sad moments [expect some characters being killed off], there is some dramatic tension and a decent climax. Again, to me this was not such a horrendous story and I don't see where the big disappointment is. So I guess it would be best to say that this is the type of show you are going to have to watch and then formulate your own opinions about it.Art StyleAt first I thought &ldquo;Gee, what sucky animation! ....Especially for something that came from Gonzo!!!!&rdquo; But then I thought it was unfair to &ldquo;expect things&rdquo; and not allow room for change or a different form of expression. So I guess I could say that the animation for this show was pretty standard during the non-combat scenes......and &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; during the battle scenes. By experimental I mean, that the movements aren't very stylish, fancy, fluid or even detailed for that matter, objects tend to move at a super fast rate and there's a lot of [over] usage of different blurring effects and overlays. Also during these battle scenes a lot of times you won't have any backgrounds just the characters duking it out with their own brand of super powers thru numerous repeated [non-looped] scenes and multi-angled shots. Nothing else really stands out animation-wise, there aren't any beautiful scenery or exotic locales, this show is pretty much character driven so expect most [if not all] scenes to involve these people with powers in various situations.SoundI can't remember there being much music in this show. My favourite song has to be the OP, not for any particular reason except for that I like the part where Saya spins at &frac12; speed in her star-printed yukata, and the sound of the singers voice at that part. The first ED song I don't remember....I just like all the cat-faced people running and jumping around, the second ED song was also very nice, but I didn't think it should have been part of this anime's soundtrack.....also again I did like the little filmstrip flashback with Saya at the very end.StoryEventho I read some reviews on a couple of sites, I don't think the story was such a total mess. Yes! I DO think the ending was a little abrupt, it could have used a little cleaning up and with the series overall, a little tightening up here and there could have been done.....but it was still a fairly decent and entertaining story! But really I think just because this series started with that type of dramatic opening scenes with the shady characters jumping around on rooftops and a couple assassinations, people thought &ldquo;YES! Guns, assassins, gangsters...Gungrave, Bebop, Trigun!!!&rdquo; and then was put off by the shows apparent goofiness. The thing is the show was always goofy and was intended to be that way from the get-go. Now whether or not the manga was originally as goofy I don't know and honestly part of the reasons I used to not read mangas much was because I knew I would have issues with animes that didn't do a good job with the adaptation and I wouldn't be able to wholly enjoy the show. Black Cat I did enjoy because I watched it without trying to attach it to something else or try to compare it to anything else whether it be the original manga or other anime shows and it was a fun show.So in other words, this was hardly a compelling drama or nail-bitingly suspenseful series it's just a superficially entertaining show where you'll laugh at the funny parts and be moved by the more touching parts, it's nothing you'll want to write a college thesis about.CharactersYou can definitely expect lots and lots of characters! I don't particularly go for shows with an infinite array of characters because it's too easy to lose focus of the actual plot and get all engrossed with &ldquo;favourite&rdquo; characters! Besides seeing too many faces and hearing a lot of names, gives me headache. This show does try it's best to keep it all around the five or so central figures, so this isn't as bad....and Sven does try to keep things light and funny which I could appreciate.Worth it or not?I liked it, I thought it was a good show and they kept it light and funny, except for a few poignant scenes. I would recommend this show to people...but not without making sure they're going to be really objective about it, otherwise they just be wasting their time to wind up as another disappointed viewer. you decide to pick this series to watch, then judge it on it's own merit and you will enjoy it a lot better.

It gives you the pleasure of a good laugh at its gags, moderately suspenseful as the story unfolds and with certain scenes, maybe a tear or two may shed. I found this thoroughly enjoyable.The story revolves around Train Heartnet, a.k.a Black Cat. Chained down as a professional assassin, Black Cat is expected to adhere strictly to the orders of Chronos Organization. Betrayal to the groups ideals is unforgivable and leads only to death. Train lived his life, killing professionally without a second thought until he meets...a 'Sweeper', Minatsuki Saya.Being completely free and independent Saya believes strongly in choice, whether in taking charge of ones own life or choosing to take others'. With this contradiction, Train begins to doubt his methods and slowly yearns to search for more than cold murder.Black Cat portrays different meanings of justice, honour and life as Train escapes from the clutches of indomitable Chronos and obsessive ex-partner to a &quot;mercenarious&quot; life of a sweeper. a 'Sweeper', Minatsuki Saya.Being completely free and independent Saya believes strongly in choice, whether in taking charge of ones own life or choosing to take others'.

Ka-boom! Ka-boom!A plethora of evocative, vibrant fireworks erupt in the gloomy skies of a particularly somber city. In the streets of said city, two forces empathetically collide together and immediately disconnect again and again, like two pendulums swinging in different directions, as brilliant, multicolored sparks soar all over the place. The conflict is one between two fighters that appear to be engaged in a fierce duel to the death, the animosity for each other intoxicating. One fighter possesses the look of a weathered wanderer with his tattered black jacket in tow, and he holds a gun in his hand while the other fighter, donning...a polished white jacket, grips a glowing sword, akin to a lightsaber. While slabs of concrete are torn to shreds, while entire houses are reduced to smithereens, the movements of these two alleyway brawlers are effortless, elegant, and expeditious, more a resemblance of Baryshnikov than Andre the Giant. As the showdown reaches its climax, the weapons of the two fighters, the gun and the lightsaber-like sword, are pressed against one another, the sparks frenziedly bouncing off them. The man in the white jacket bellows at his opponent, “Your eyes! That woman! She’s got you! You’re under that witch’s spell!” A cutaway to a woman’s body, horrifically pale and bloodied, occurs before he raises his sword in preparation for a lethal downward strike. We then witness the aftereffect of his attack; we see his opponent, the fighter in the black jacket, howling in pain, spiraling to the ground in defeat.This, my friend, is the first thirty-five seconds of Black Cat.If there’s one thing that this series can accomplish, it’s the ability to hook you into its framework, to really galvanize the audience into discovering what it’s all about. Black Cat’s theme song, Yorico’s “Daia no Hana”, does a fantastic job at this. This opening unveils a story centered on the black-coated wanderer (Train Heartnet) seeking a purpose in life, attempting to escape the psychological stronghold placed on him by the white-coated swordsman (Creed Diskenth) and the organization which once employed both of them (Chronos, the governmental entity comprised entirely of assassins for hire). In a strange twist of fate, Train encounters others that either desire to live freely like him or that want to encourage him in the right direction (Sven Vollfied, Saya Minatsuki, Eve, and Rinslet Walker). The remainder of the theme song is dedicated to presenting the obstacles these characters face as well as the friends (and enemies) they come across along the way. Musically speaking, “Daia no Hana” is a triumph, explosive at times and somber in other moments, a virtuoso of tonal shifts. Really, it’s among the biggest highlights of Black Cat’s soundtrack. Crafted by composer Taku Iwasaki (who would later create the OST for Gurren Lagann), the music in Black Cat is surprisingly sober, a relaxed and low-key combination of folk blues, classical, and piano compositions (The music that appears in the eye catches are particularly smooth). However, the bombasticness, the over-the-top energy, that Taku Iwasaki would later be acclaimed for, shines through in songs like “Accettami” and “Yajuu no Chi” but especially “Kuroki Neko” (Train’s character theme), a memorably grandiose and overpowering orchestral track. In contrast to the mood Iwasaki already established, Black Cat’s first ED, PUPPEYPET’s “Namidaboshi”, is silly, immature, and even infantile at times. However, the second ED (Matsuda Ryouji’s \xa0“Kutsuzure”) is much more fitting; it possesses a soulful, melancholic feel to it.While the soundtrack applies a sleek yet vibrant atmosphere to the show, Black Cat’s amazing aesthetics provide a stylishly visceral element. Produced by Studio Gonzo, this show’s character designs are mercurial in terms of quality (It’s strikingly obvious when it’s great and when it’s not), and the animation overall is fairly standard for the most part. Sure, the show’s CGI is simply horrifying (a Gonzo trademark) but Black Cat compensates with its beautiful back lighting and enthusiastic color palette. However, it’s the streaks of artistic brilliance that causes Black Cat to visually stand out the most. In one scene, a particularly opulent character showcases an outfit of Unmoving Plaid, a creative move reminiscent of Gankutsuou, an earlier Gonzo project. More than anything else, Black Cat’s fight scenes are where it unleashes the fullest extent of its visual excellence; they’re almost always intense and jaw-droppingly stylish, the embodiment of cinematic creativity. The fights that personally stand out are the ones late in the series, like Eve vs Leon, the final showdown between Train and Creed, and especially Sephiria vs Creed (In that particular fight, there’s an amazing shift between during the battle and after; the showdown’s result is portrayed in black and white while the fight itself is overflowing in color). To be honest, it was Black Cat that first inspired me to value the art of cinematography.“Wow. This sucker sure is heavy,” - Saya Minatsuki (episode 5)You can possess the world’s most hardboiled soundtrack and dark-colored designs but if the writers of a TV show can’t craft a consistently exciting drama, then everything falls apart. Just look at Deadman Wonderland. Black Cat, on the other hand, is a master of mood execution. What I mean is that when drama is needed, it is established and executed at a high level of quality, like episode ten’s chase scene. When Black Cat desires to frighten the audience, it elevates its Horror Factor to an unprecedented level, like Train’s nightmare in episode 14. Admittedly, this show falters when it involves emotional appeal but Black Cat compensates with scenes like Beluga (a Chronos operative) and his roaring rampage of revenge in episode 15; it’s among Black Cat’s most poignant moments. Sadly, the show’s forays into comedy are even worse. Early on, Black Cat maintained a generally unremarkable yet balanced sense of humor; during serious scenes, the jokes were never repetitive nor underwhelming. Later on, Black Cat’s comedic success devolves into oversaturated mediocrity with a knack for tiresome, unoriginal gags (Remember The Looney Tunes Rule: when you’re in the air, don’t look down).There are quite a few areas in which Black Cat hardly qualifies as perfect but its characterization is where the show is perhaps the most deficient in. Black Cat performs commendably at its usage of recurring side characters, allotting them sufficient screen time, depth, and individuality, like Petra Ghoul, Annette, and Tanya. However, Black Cat’s overall characterization leaves much to be desired. With notable exceptions to three fantastic characters (who I’ll mention later), the members of Black Cat’s cast can be filed into five categories: consistently good-but-not-great (Train and Eve), good-but-not-great characters with shrinking importance (Rinslet, Leon, Sephiria, and Woodney), fairly worthwhile characters with decent amount of depth (Tearju, Dr. Kanzaki, Igor Planter, Tim, and Gyanza), terrible (Mason, Kyoko, 85% of Chronos, and the entire Sweepers Alliance)....and River Zastory.(I won’t mince words here: River Zastory is unarguably one of the most pointless characters in all of anime. There is not one thing that he contributed to the show that someone else didn’t already contribute at a higher level of quality. Train, Creed, Eve, and Sephiria are stronger. Sven, Woodney, and almost everyone else have a greater sense of humor. Even the show’s pet mascot is more important than him. River Zastory has no chemistry or bond with anyone. He has zero character development and depth. He doesn’t even have personality traits. If there’s one word that can be used to describe River Zastory, it’s “expendable”).While River Zastory (and the show’s characters in general) represent Black Cat at its worst, there are three members of the cast that allot a sense of respectability to the group as a whole, and one of them as Saya Minatsuki (voiced by Caitlin Glass). She’s an experienced bounty hunter (or “Sweeper” as this is what they are known by in Black Cat) whose relaxed nature belies her frightening accuracy with \xa0her handgun. A free spirit more than anything else, Saya influences Train to embrace his individuality and to not be concerned with how others (namely Creed) wish for him to live. The show was only graced with her presence for six episodes but Saya became a fan favorite due to her witty observations, her likability, her competitive spirit, and her silliness.Sven Vollfied is another of Black Cat’s finest characters, and my personal favorite of the bunch. A cross between Trigun’s Nicholas D. Wolfwood (his sarcasm and snarky brilliance) and Cowboy Bebop’s Jet Black (his fashion sense and traditionalist values), Sven is a chain-smoking ex-cop with unbelievable bad luck, chain to an occupation he once referred to as being a glorified nomad. Brandon Potter, in his role as Sven, delivers a raspy, worn-out baritone that’s perfect for Black Cat’s green-haired sweeper; it’s as if Potter was born for this role. In a show where characters are defined almost entirely by how physically imposing they are, Sven gets by with his gadget-filled suitcase, his superb quick thinking, and a nifty ability to glimpse into the future. Ultimately, Sven Vollfied is a paragon of natural charm, the embodiment of smooth, and a richly developed character…. but he doesn’t come close to Creed Diskenth.At first glance, Creed (brought to life by a scenery-chewing, show-stopping performance from Chris Patton) doesn’t look like much, just another maniacal villain aiming to take over the world. Yet, there’s more to Creed than that. Throughout the course of Black Cat, we witness a broken human being mistreated and dismissed by those above him. We witness a man who seeks to change the world for the better but devolves into one of the monsters he despised in the first place (Creed’s ambition is pure yet his intentions are not). We witness a man, who wasn’t too mentally stable to begin with, spiral further and further into the very depths of madness. We witness a charismatic leader establish a tight-knit circle of followers and we observe his utter disdain for virtually all of them. We witness a man’s overly obsessive pursuit for the approval and praise of another, and we observe the man’s realization of his pursuit being a pointless one. Finally, we witness a man’s journey towards redemption; it is a rather hasty journey but a journey nonetheless. Compared to Black Cat’s other characters, Creed Diskenth is a diamond in the rough, the proverbial needle in the haystack, a ray of light in a cave of darkness.Though there is much to criticize Black Cat’s cast for, what I appreciate most about them is the show’s ability to frame the characters in representing the various ideologies that are established in the plot. Zagine (Train’s mentor) and Creed passionately advocate for Social Darwinism while Sephiria pontificates on the societal effects of a corrupt government. Eve introduces an unconventional outlook on pets (that these animals are forced into a new and unfamiliar environment against their will) while the Sweepers Alliance criticizes the government’s nonchalant treatment of them. All of this (and more) are woven together to collectively enhance the central storyline of revenge and redemption.However, it was this speciality, the gift for presenting an array of ideologies, that gradually dissolved into nothingness as Black Cat’s runtime increased, along with many of the series’ other noteworthy attributes. While the show was never one without flaws, Black Cat, at its absolute apex (from episodes 1 to 12, specifically episodes 8 to 12), achieved in magnifying its greatest features and minimizing its shortcomings to the best of its abilities. It is immediately after Train’s second big showdown against Creed in episode 12 (they would have one more before the series concluded) that Black Cat devolves from a gritty, multilayered action-noir epic into a half-hearted, by-the-numbers beat-em-up comedy. After episode 12, Black Cat possesses a few glimmers of brilliance, like the transcendent episode 14 and Charden’s character arc, but ultimately it’s not enough to overcome the phenomenal deprivation of everything that made this show special.To deploy a term invented by MyAnimeList user CodeBlazeFate, Black Cat is a poster boy victim of “Second Half Syndrome”.Just when you think that Black Cat’s latter portion can’t become more of a disgrace (after the pointless filler episode, the useless Tao monsters, River Zastory’s entire existence, and episode 20’s uber-convenient deus ex machina), the Eden Project Arc commences. This is what Black Cat’s last four episodes are dedicated to; this is something that the show has been anticipating since the very beginning but you can’t resist wishing it were better executed. The Eden Project Arc is centered on Eve’s desires to be understood and to find somewhere she belongs yet she’s utilized as a plot device, a placeholder if you will, instead of a character with real emotions. The Eden Project Arc bombards its runtime with an overflow of unnecessary archetypes instead of simply selecting a handful of important characters and providing them with their own individual reasons for destroying the evil operation. The Eden Project Arc possesses an abundance of Biblical references (mostly involving the Book of Genesis) but it devotes its runtime to “making the weapon of destruction look really cool and do really cool things” instead of allotting substance and nuance to the references. The utterly irredeemable cop-out near the end serves as the embodiment of everything the Eden Project Arc did wrong, the cherry on top of a perfect disaster.Black Cat, in a medium where action shows are a dime a dozen, has become a forgotten relic of the mid-2000s, ruthlessly criticized on the rare occasion in which its name pops up. The majority of those that viewed Black Cat immediately dismissed it as a Cowboy Bebop knockoff (kind of true) instead of appreciating it for what it is. As a result, Black Cat is wandering aimlessly outside of MAL’s Top 1000, its fans few and far between. As one of the only advocates for this hidden gem, I’d argue that Black Cat, despite its shortcomings, is wildly underrated; it’s much more creative, intense, and complex than people give it credit for. Black Cat exists as an interesting revision of the Cowboy Bebop formula, as a brilliant representation of Gonzo at the height of its aesthetic glory, and as one of the greatest shonen epics you’ll ever encounter. With that, I encourage you to not allow the opinions of others to prevent you from giving this show a chance. Black Cat is not a kitty that will bite you. a polished white jacket, grips a glowing sword, akin to a lightsaber. While slabs of concrete are torn to shreds, while entire houses are reduced to smithereens, the movements of these two alleyway brawlers are effortless, elegant, and expeditious, more a resemblance of Baryshnikov than Andre the Giant. As the showdown reaches its climax, the weapons of the two fighters, the gun and the lightsaber-like sword, are pressed against one another, the sparks frenziedly bouncing off them. The man in the white jacket bellows at his opponent, “Your eyes! That woman! She’s got you! You’re under that witch’s spell!” A cutaway to a woman’s body, horrifically pale and bloodied, occurs before he raises his sword in preparation for a lethal downward strike. We then witness the aftereffect of his attack; we see his opponent, the fighter in the black jacket, howling in pain, spiraling to the ground in defeat.This, my friend, is the first thirty-five seconds of Black Cat.If there’s one thing that this series can accomplish, it’s the ability to hook you into its framework, to really galvanize the audience into discovering what it’s all about. Black Cat’s theme song, Yorico’s “Daia no Hana”, does a fantastic job at this. This opening unveils a story centered on the black-coated wanderer (Train Heartnet) seeking a purpose in life, attempting to escape the psychological stronghold placed on him by the white-coated swordsman (Creed Diskenth) and the organization which once employed both of them (Chronos, the governmental entity comprised entirely of assassins for hire). In a strange twist of fate, Train encounters others that either desire to live freely like him or that want to encourage him in the right direction (Sven Vollfied, Saya Minatsuki, Eve, and Rinslet Walker). The remainder of the theme song is dedicated to presenting the obstacles these characters face as well as the friends (and enemies) they come across along the way. Musically speaking, “Daia no Hana” is a triumph, explosive at times and somber in other moments, a virtuoso of tonal shifts. Really, it’s among the biggest highlights of Black Cat’s soundtrack. Crafted by composer Taku Iwasaki (who would later create the OST for Gurren Lagann), the music in Black Cat is surprisingly sober, a relaxed and low-key combination of folk blues, classical, and piano compositions (The music that appears in the eye catches are particularly smooth). However, the bombasticness, the over-the-top energy, that Taku Iwasaki would later be acclaimed for, shines through in songs like “Accettami” and “Yajuu no Chi” but especially “Kuroki Neko” (Train’s character theme), a memorably grandiose and overpowering orchestral track. In contrast to the mood Iwasaki already established, Black Cat’s first ED, PUPPEYPET’s “Namidaboshi”, is silly, immature, and even infantile at times. However, the second ED (Matsuda Ryouji’s \xa0“Kutsuzure”) is much more fitting; it possesses a soulful, melancholic feel to it.While the soundtrack applies a sleek yet vibrant atmosphere to the show, Black Cat’s amazing aesthetics provide a stylishly visceral element. Produced by Studio Gonzo, this show’s character designs are mercurial in terms of quality (It’s strikingly obvious when it’s great and when it’s not), and the animation overall is fairly standard for the most part. Sure, the show’s CGI is simply horrifying (a Gonzo trademark) but Black Cat compensates with its beautiful back lighting and enthusiastic color palette. However, it’s the streaks of artistic brilliance that causes Black Cat to visually stand out the most. In one scene, a particularly opulent character showcases an outfit of Unmoving Plaid, a creative move reminiscent of Gankutsuou, an earlier Gonzo project. More than anything else, Black Cat’s fight scenes are where it unleashes the fullest extent of its visual excellence; they’re almost always intense and jaw-droppingly stylish, the embodiment of cinematic creativity. The fights that personally stand out are the ones late in the series, like Eve vs Leon, the final showdown between Train and Creed, and especially Sephiria vs Creed (In that particular fight, there’s an amazing shift between during the battle and after; the showdown’s result is portrayed in black and white while the fight itself is overflowing in color). To be honest, it was Black Cat that first inspired me to value the art of cinematography.“Wow. This sucker sure is heavy,” - Saya Minatsuki (episode 5)You can possess the world’s most hardboiled soundtrack and dark-colored designs but if the writers of a TV show can’t craft a consistently exciting drama, then everything falls apart. Just look at Deadman Wonderland. Black Cat, on the other hand, is a master of mood execution. What I mean is that when drama is needed, it is established and executed at a high level of quality, like episode ten’s chase scene. When Black Cat desires to frighten the audience, it elevates its Horror Factor to an unprecedented level, like Train’s nightmare in episode 14. Admittedly, this show falters when it involves emotional appeal but Black Cat compensates with scenes like Beluga (a Chronos operative) and his roaring rampage of revenge in episode 15; it’s among Black Cat’s most poignant moments. Sadly, the show’s forays into comedy are even worse. Early on, Black Cat maintained a generally unremarkable yet balanced sense of humor; during serious scenes, the jokes were never repetitive nor underwhelming. Later on, Black Cat’s comedic success devolves into oversaturated mediocrity with a knack for tiresome, unoriginal gags (Remember The Looney Tunes Rule: when you’re in the air, don’t look down).There are quite a few areas in which Black Cat hardly qualifies as perfect but its characterization is where the show is perhaps the most deficient in. Black Cat performs commendably at its usage of recurring side characters, allotting them sufficient screen time, depth, and individuality, like Petra Ghoul, Annette, and Tanya. However, Black Cat’s overall characterization leaves much to be desired. With notable exceptions to three fantastic characters (who I’ll mention later), the members of Black Cat’s cast can be filed into five categories: consistently good-but-not-great (Train and Eve), good-but-not-great characters with shrinking importance (Rinslet, Leon, Sephiria, and Woodney), fairly worthwhile characters with decent amount of depth (Tearju, Dr. Kanzaki, Igor Planter, Tim, and Gyanza), terrible (Mason, Kyoko, 85% of Chronos, and the entire Sweepers Alliance)....and River Zastory.(I won’t mince words here: River Zastory is unarguably one of the most pointless characters in all of anime. There is not one thing that he contributed to the show that someone else didn’t already contribute at a higher level of quality. Train, Creed, Eve, and Sephiria are stronger. Sven, Woodney, and almost everyone else have a greater sense of humor. Even the show’s pet mascot is more important than him. River Zastory has no chemistry or bond with anyone. He has zero character development and depth. He doesn’t even have personality traits. If there’s one word that can be used to describe River Zastory, it’s “expendable”).While River Zastory (and the show’s characters in general) represent Black Cat at its worst, there are three members of the cast that allot a sense of respectability to the group as a whole, and one of them as Saya Minatsuki (voiced by Caitlin Glass). She’s an experienced bounty hunter (or “Sweeper” as this is what they are known by in Black Cat) whose relaxed nature belies her frightening accuracy with \xa0her handgun. A free spirit more than anything else, Saya influences Train to embrace his individuality and to not be concerned with how others (namely Creed) wish for him to live. The show was only graced with her presence for six episodes but Saya became a fan favorite due to her witty observations, her likability, her competitive spirit, and her silliness.Sven Vollfied is another of Black Cat’s finest characters, and my personal favorite of the bunch. A cross between Trigun’s Nicholas D. Wolfwood (his sarcasm and snarky brilliance) and Cowboy Bebop’s Jet Black (his fashion sense and traditionalist values), Sven is a chain-smoking ex-cop with unbelievable bad luck, chain to an occupation he once referred to as being a glorified nomad. Brandon Potter, in his role as Sven, delivers a raspy, worn-out baritone that’s perfect for Black Cat’s green-haired sweeper; it’s as if Potter was born for this role. In a show where characters are defined almost entirely by how physically imposing they are, Sven gets by with his gadget-filled suitcase, his superb quick thinking, and a nifty ability to glimpse into the future. Ultimately, Sven Vollfied is a paragon of natural charm, the embodiment of smooth, and a richly developed character…. but he doesn’t come close to Creed Diskenth.At first glance, Creed (brought to life by a scenery-chewing, show-stopping performance from Chris Patton) doesn’t look like much, just another maniacal villain aiming to take over the world. Yet, there’s more to Creed than that. Throughout the course of Black Cat, we witness a broken human being mistreated and dismissed by those above him. We witness a man who seeks to change the world for the better but devolves into one of the monsters he despised in the first place (Creed’s ambition is pure yet his intentions are not). We witness a man, who wasn’t too mentally stable to begin with, spiral further and further into the very depths of madness. We witness a charismatic leader establish a tight-knit circle of followers and we observe his utter disdain for virtually all of them. We witness a man’s overly obsessive pursuit for the approval and praise of another, and we observe the man’s realization of his pursuit being a pointless one. Finally, we witness a man’s journey towards redemption; it is a rather hasty journey but a journey nonetheless. Compared to Black Cat’s other characters, Creed Diskenth is a diamond in the rough, the proverbial needle in the haystack, a ray of light in a cave of darkness.Though there is much to criticize Black Cat’s cast for, what I appreciate most about them is the show’s ability to frame the characters in representing the various ideologies that are established in the plot. Zagine (Train’s mentor) and Creed passionately advocate for Social Darwinism while Sephiria pontificates on the societal effects of a corrupt government. Eve introduces an unconventional outlook on pets (that these animals are forced into a new and unfamiliar environment against their will) while the Sweepers Alliance criticizes the government’s nonchalant treatment of them. All of this (and more) are woven together to collectively enhance the central storyline of revenge and redemption.However, it was this speciality, the gift for presenting an array of ideologies, that gradually dissolved into nothingness as Black Cat’s runtime increased, along with many of the series’ other noteworthy attributes. While the show was never one without flaws, Black Cat, at its absolute apex (from episodes 1 to 12, specifically episodes 8 to 12), achieved in magnifying its greatest features and minimizing its shortcomings to the best of its abilities. It is immediately after Train’s second big showdown against Creed in episode 12 (they would have one more before the series concluded) that Black Cat devolves from a gritty, multilayered action-noir epic into a half-hearted, by-the-numbers beat-em-up comedy. After episode 12, Black Cat possesses a few glimmers of brilliance, like the transcendent episode 14 and Charden’s character arc, but ultimately it’s not enough to overcome the phenomenal deprivation of everything that made this show special.To deploy a term invented by MyAnimeList user CodeBlazeFate, Black Cat is a poster boy victim of “Second Half Syndrome”.Just when you think that Black Cat’s latter portion can’t become more of a disgrace (after the pointless filler episode, the useless Tao monsters, River Zastory’s entire existence, and episode 20’s uber-convenient deus ex machina), the Eden Project Arc commences. This is what Black Cat’s last four episodes are dedicated to; this is something that the show has been anticipating since the very beginning but you can’t resist wishing it were better executed. The Eden Project Arc is centered on Eve’s desires to be understood and to find somewhere she belongs yet she’s utilized as a plot device, a placeholder if you will, instead of a character with real emotions. The Eden Project Arc bombards its runtime with an overflow of unnecessary archetypes instead of simply selecting a handful of important characters and providing them with their own individual reasons for destroying the evil operation. The Eden Project Arc possesses an abundance of Biblical references (mostly involving the Book of Genesis) but it devotes its runtime to “making the weapon of destruction look really cool and do really cool things” instead of allotting substance and nuance to the references. The utterly irredeemable cop-out near the end serves as the embodiment of everything the Eden Project Arc did wrong, the cherry on top of a perfect disaster.Black Cat, in a medium where action shows are a dime a dozen, has become a forgotten relic of the mid-2000s, ruthlessly criticized on the rare occasion in which its name pops up. The majority of those that viewed Black Cat immediately dismissed it as a Cowboy Bebop knockoff (kind of true) instead of appreciating it for what it is. As a result, Black Cat is wandering aimlessly outside of MAL’s Top 1000, its fans few and far between.

I noticed only the people who rated this about and 8 or up knows why. When its completely obvious why he changed. Also the anime has a plot, then another two plots in one. They did it all how i wanted them too. Maybe they did rush it a little at the end, but it still made sense. The animation was really good. I loved all the characters. To me they are the best part. I really dont remember any characters...that didnt contribute anything. Some of the chronos numbers really didnt but thats all. EVERYone did something. The reason this anime sparked in my book, was that it was Shounen yet it wasnt anything like Bleach and all those other ones, that are pure fighting. The characters sparked a lot, and a huge change from the manga in art. Really it irritates me how under rated this anime is. There wasnt much wrong with it.I would suggest watching it all over the other bounty animes. Like Cowboy Bebop, truelly i dont know why that one is that great. that didnt contribute anything.

Let\'s get on with it, shall we?Animation:The animation is okay, but it gets better during the action scenes. But during a few battle scenes, there aren\'t backgrounds, it just shows the characters brawling it out.Music:The music is quite good, it usually fits the mood and all. The opening is pretty awesome if you ask me, it\'s one of my favorites. The first ending theme is quite funny, and I always find myself thinking ""This is pretty funny"" and start laughing just a little bit. The second ending took me a little while to get...used to, but the scene with all the characters is quite well done, in my opinion.Story:I find the story quite interesting. I really like both Sven\'s and Train\'s side of the story, and it\'s also enjoyable to find more on their backgrounds. I was surprised that some of the characters did die, I really thought that it would be a fighting series without actual deaths. Of course, the deaths aren\'t a bad thing. I found the main characters appealing and a great fit for a Shonen anime. The only thing I don\'t like is that absolutely none of the episodes are the same as the manga, but it gets the basic story through.Final Judgement:Pros- Fine Music, Great Characters, Keeps a similar storyCons- Differs from the manga, Animation needs improvement used to, but the scene with all the characters is quite well done, in my opinion.Story:I find the story quite interesting.

Trully disgusting.Also the different POV changes to Sven, Eve and the others characters instead of focusing solely on MC point of view felt really out of place and destroyed a lot of enjoyment.People watch this for Train, if they would have committed to follow only his POV and focus on his badass counterpart solely rather than destroying his character and giving too much POV to others, it would have been a very solid anime.Rating:7/10 episode 1-61/10 epiosode 7+ director/writer of this series, it felt almost like he changed his mind from cool badass to ""I\'m scared it won\'t sell so I need to make it as generic and boring as possible and do 180* on MC"".

Now in this, it’s a bit different except the concept was the same, guy gets into a organization as pretty much a hired gun and goes around assassinating who the organization doesn’t like. The thing I like about this show is that it doesn’t start there, and most of that is actually back story. This is about him getting out of the group and learning what he himself wanted. The character that actually helps him figure this out is...‘new’ code was Saya but it really annoyed me they killed her off so quickly.Now I do wonder a lot about why Saya is a big part of Train’s life and why he goes out for revenge. He only knows her for about 2 or three days so why does he go crazy when she dies? Is it because she is the only person he cared about that died in front of him? I don’t think that’s the case because they show he has seen others he cares about dieing before then so why? Give us a bit more to work on with her please. I liked the show but I hate that they add Saya only to kill her off in the first 2 to 3 episodes. It’s just not fair to both Train and the watcher. Once I got into her character, then I’m hurt by how she is no longer there. Though there flash backs, we don’t see much of how she affects Train much. It somewhat makes me feel that the first five episodes were wasted on the so called relationship between Train and Saya that had no real reason for being because it wasn’t much of a relationship.The fighting was rather interesting though sometimes it bothered me that we only got flashes of the fight and not a whole fight. It did get better after a while though. I am also don’t really like the sudden change in Train’s character that seems to mess with me. He all of a sudden is so childish in front of strangers. It’s a complete turn around from how he was in the first few episode without any space in between for growth.Some of the animation feels much like an opening to a James Bond opening though it has a bit of the same flare as a new-vole in the beginning. And then it cuts that and goes into comic fest with jokes and funny site gags. It has a nice way of taking you into the story line for the drama, then hitting you over the head with a bat continually until it again goes back into Drama mode. But every battle works well with the next, someone studied well when it came to camera angles. Gonzo isn’t known for great animation but this one is pretty nicely done.The music has many different feels for each scene from the hunting chant whenever Greed (aka Seductive obsessed freak!) to the playful sounds of walking down the street that you normally get for comical affect. Most of them work well with the characters but once in a while… we get something that sounds rather bad or not fitting the area. ‘new’ code was Saya but it really annoyed me they killed her off so quickly.Now I do wonder a lot about why Saya is a big part of Train’s life and why he goes out for revenge.

You will still enjoy the twist and turns of how the plot was played. But I am totally disappointed on how ""fast"" the stories were. It\'s like it was rushed. It could have been better if they would have at least 40 or more episodes just to stretch out the details. It\'s like I just watched a long movie, not a series.The art and sounds are good enough.When it comes to character, since the story, in my opinion,...was rushed, they weren\'t able to give the characters depth on why they were like that.Everything was compressed in an episode and all willing to do everything after meeting them once. The shifting of black cat\'s character was not smoothly shifted as well. It\'s like he turned 180 degrees after just a few conversation.But still, like what I said earlier, nonetheless, this is still a good anime to enjoy. I would still recommended it, esp to those doesn\'t like much talks but more on to action.

Unfortunately, it all just fell apart into a giant mush of boring side stories, awful character morals, and poorly designed villains.I like to start my reviews off with the good aspects of a series, so let\'s go over a few. The opening song wasn\'t too bad....The animation was average. I did find myself enjoying a few of the characters. Sven had excellent voice acting. Saiya and Kyouko  were enjoyable characters. There was so much potential!Let\'s skip the point... I just, wow. I was enjoying Black Cat a lot, but it was just written so poorly. It was about cool assassins and bounty hunters, then they became morally illogical, neighborhood watch style of characters.""We have the power to kill this terrible murderous rapist with super powers, but let\'s turn him over to the police so he can break of jail for the 6th time.""Of course, this is just an example, not a spoiler, but you understand how frustrating it became. Not only that, but the story just kept flipping to awful side stories and introducing useless characters with no relevance whatsoever. Most of the villains had ridiculous logic, or lack thereof. Not to mention, this series actually has 24 episodes. Mal probably didn\'t include the 24th episode because it was downright terrible. You could hardly tell what was going on at all.All and all, I will not be watching this series again, and I\'m not even that proud to have finished it. It\'s too violent for kids, too illogical for adults.. it\'s just a flop. If you enjoy far-fetched, wild adventures, with ministories that don\'t add to the main story, you might enjoy Black Cat, but it definitely wasn\'t for me.3/10 Sweepers.

Don't know how. It's like a totally different anime after that. The producer might have hit his head or something. The beginning was very dark and cool, the main character, Train, was brilliant. A cold-blooded assassin who was starting to get a softer side, because of a girl he met. He was so serious compared to the other crazy characters. Even if I dislike this kind of psycho acting in an anime, I thought the jokes were very funny. All...these were a sign of an extremely good anime. Bad impression. It gets so stupid and Train's character is RUINED. The mysterious, cool and serious guy is starting to act like a retard. They want to show us that he totally changed, but they could have done that in a more decent way. I'm so disappointed right now. And not because it's a retarded anime. I saw many like that. But the beginning was too brilliant for all to turn out like this. It's really a shame...edit after finishing it: I still have the same opinion, but I must say, the last few episodes were kinda good, and saved the whole anime. They stop acting like retards, the jokes are funny again. So I try to think of the middle part as an accident.  The story had a great potential, but oh well, it was still nice... these were a sign of an extremely good anime. Bad impression. It gets so stupid and Train's character is RUINED. The mysterious, cool and serious guy is starting to act like a retard. They want to show us that he totally changed, but they could have done that in a more decent way. I'm so disappointed right now.

Train Heartnet, codename BrakoKato, is a boy around 20 years old, whose family were killed by his after-teacher. When his teacher murdered, he became an assassin whose bullets were faster than his mind. In the short begin of the story, he met a girl called Saya, from who his transformation came to effect. He resigned  in assassination and became sweeper on his own will.BlackCat is anime mostly based on action. There\'s a lot of cool-posing BlackCat situations, and...a lot of fights, evasions, fun and indeed a lot of ... really big individualities: from a little childish and shy Train, to a very obsession Creed ... in midsts there\'s one head-aired person, journalist with passion and \'ohime-sama\' who bare bio-weapon\'s burden. However ... some parts of characters looks like copied from other animes. For example Eve, bio-girl, looks almost identically like Yami-chan from ToLoveRu anime series. Kyouko looks like Kyoko from ToLoveRu too ... so lame in my opinion but from the other side - those \'copies\' are copies of the best chars, so I can forgive this little \'defect\'.Music ... it is the best thing at this anime. I love music during battles, during some funny moments ... and thing about opening and ending ... just love it. When protagonists are fighting there\'s a lot of good tunes, when they\'re doing funny thing there\'s good music for it ... and when there\'s no music ... that\'s good moment to be so too.Summary ... I enjoyed this anime a lot and hope it will continue a little bit more (14 episodes watched). Some moments of this anime are sad, some are happy but always there\'s not a \'boring time\'. This anime is for peoples who like action, some dramatical scenes (mostly there\'s a one significant), a lot of darkness, insanity and add-ons of some funny scenes ;). I really recommend this anime for all those who think that mystery will work with fun.Greetings 9/10 from me.27/09/09I\'ve just finished watching this anime, and I can say, that it wasn\'t as good as I thought for the first time when I saw it. I did not change my mind about characters, sounds ... but I lower the grade of story, art and enjoyment as occurs. Why? There\'s no any logical sense between two close episodes. In the one episode train is doing something and that thing is not continuing in the next episode - you don\'t know what exactly happened!! About art: so ... further episodes, maybe after 15, have some charges at the background like ""colorful lines"" - it really annoys. And about enjoyment - heh - I think that I shouldn\'t tell that when the art and the story sucks sometimes, enjoyment is lower.So in summary: After all, \'KuroNeko\' degraded by me to 7 points of max 10. a lot of fights, evasions, fun and indeed a lot of ... really big individualities: from a little childish and shy Train, to a very obsession Creed ... in midsts there\'s one head-aired person, journalist with passion and \'ohime-sama\' who bare bio-weapon\'s burden.

Don't get me wrong. This has all the needed ingredients for a top hit, but the story is severely lacking. At the end of the series, I was badly wishing for the main cast (all 4 of them) to be put in another anime or something. Their backgrounds were all good too, But the glue that binds it all together, the plot, well it's just too average to think about.If this is your first anime, you'll probably enjoy it.But, if you're an anime addict (like me), then you probably want to spend your time elsewhere. YAWN!...There were some times when I was just watching this series just to put it on my completed list. It isn't as bad as something that deserved to be dropped, but it was a pain just to finish it.The main 2 characters, Train & Sven, I'd love to put them as my avatars or something, but they deserve to be in another anime. Or at least, another plot. There were some times when I was just watching this series just to put it on my completed list.

The art was great, I loved the story and background that went with the main character (Train). It was a great set up for my kind of anime (""dark"" or something like that).Then the plot changed (I won\'t say how so I won\'t spoil it for the people who haven\'t watched it yet). But after that I absolutely couldn\'t watch any more, and now I have to hate this anime. What happened definitely changed the kind of anime it was set up as.I do recommend this anime...to people who like kinda intense fighting and cool plots, but I don\'t think the entire anime will be enjoyable. to people who like kinda intense fighting and cool plots, but I don\'t think the entire anime will be enjoyable.', 'Black Cat is a typical anime whereby the protagonist is usually someone who starts off being part of an organization, is the best at what he is or does and usually is a loner partly because childhood experiences helped to shape the nature of his character and what drives his goals and ambitions. The anime comprises of twenty three (23) episodes and it was not particularly a striking anime. In the opening episode, the anime displayed lots of promise and potential but as the series progressed, it started to fall apart based on storyline, plot and the development of the characters in the series.STORY...7/10The story focuses on the life of Train Hartnett, a former assassin of Chronos and the manner in which he transforms from a cold blooded assassin into someone living with a purpose. The story was not bad, just needed a few loose ends clearly up sometimes and some characters needed a bit more depth in them especially some of the supporting characters. Characters were thrown in and out of the story and there was no one with whom one can truly identify with. Also, the quick progression of the story saw characters changing sides from one episode to the next. Nevertheless, it made for some entertaining watching.ART 7/10The artwork and setting reflected the mood of the anime since most of the action took place at night. This was due in part possibly to the name of the anime so the animation reflected this. The characters were well drawn and Train features did contain cat-like features.SOUND 9/10The music was excellent. The opening song was mellow yet spirited and the ending song was cute. The musical numbers in the anime were reflective of the mood at any one particular moment in time and even Saya’s song was melodic and peaceful.CHARACTER 7/10The characters had some unique qualities and the way they were drawn as well as their attire also reflected such. Train’s character went through changes in the anime but there was no other significant development with regard to the other characters in the series.ENJOYMENT 7/10Even though there were a few inconsistencies in the story at times, I did enjoy the series since the characters, although not anything especially special, were quite entertaining and there were times when it there was some suspense as to what was going to take place next so it was because of this that I found it quite okay.OVERALL 7/10The anime had potential but it was too rushed. The story, although interesting and engaging at times was not developed to a point where there could be justifications for some of the actions of some characters that took place in the anime itself.

OH im not talking to just a simple cute/cool looking cat`s out there.Whom I was talking about is Mr.#13/Black Cat/Train Heartnet.Story :Black Cat is about a former assassin, Train, and a former investigator, Sven. While Train was an assassin, he was known as Black Cat. He used to work for an organization known as Chronos. Chronos controls the world and maintains the peace. It has 13 of its own assassins. Train was the 13th. Train and Sven are now bounty hunters, known as Sweepers. Train bears the number 13, in roman numerals, on his left chest and on his gun....Sven wears an eye patch over his right eye. They make their living going from place to place and catching bounties. Another former member of Chronos, Creed, plots to destroy Chronos. Creed wants to make a new world. Creed creates an organization known as The Messengers of The Stars, and gather other people who have gained unique powers through a special potion. And the ending, good god both the ending in the Anime and Manga were anticlimatic.***So I read all of the manga and only watched some of the anime, and I must say after reading the full story from the manga everything was medicore. I always wondered how you can make a genuinely good fight scene in a shonen series with guns, and the answer is not very well. Sure in Seinen Anime\'s guns shoot and kill people, but in Black Cat that never happens. The plot almost never develops it has always been a one track goal main character Train Heartnet is a sweeper and must find Creed to defeat him. Heck even the character development seemed rushed at some points, and man do I hate the scenes when Train goes into immature child mode, theres a right and wrong way to do it, and everything is wrong about him.***Characters :Train Heartnet: Train is the main protagonist aka Himaru Kenshin except he uses a gun, besides that everything  and I mean everything about him is an exact clone copy. His old girlfriend dies, so he swears to never use his weapon to kill again. Now Himaru Kenshin was able to pull this off, besides his immaturity scenes, because he had a strict moral code. Train however just seems to be goofing off every second he can get, it\'s like he almost never takes his enemies seriously if their not Creed. And I also never understand how his enemies never attack him when he is reloading his gun, I mean come on, really.Saya Minatsuki : is an accomplished sweeper and close friend of Train. Her involvement with him leads to his more human outlook on life and his departure from Chronos. She is killed by Creed, who believes that Train\'s personality change is a curse due to her. Before dying, she tells Train to ""forget about her"", which causes him to struggle while deciding to get revenge on Creed or not. Her ""spirit"" lives on, often guiding Train and his friends and giving them strength. In the final scene of the anime, Train is seen walking past Saya\'s spirit.Sven Vollfied : Sven now I knew was a good character from the start, it wasn\'t just his awesome suit and hat that he always wore, but it was his diligent all round gentleman personality. With Train literally a loose cannon running wild with his antics around town you need a more mature, more sophisticated type of person to keep him in check, and Sven is that man. He almost never had any action scenes because his main role was more of a support partner for Sven which is a good thing. However he has a briefcase gun so I don\'t care, that automatically beats Train in everything.Eve : Every story needs a loli side kick if the main character is a young dude, and Eve is that girl, or maybe a better way to put it, biochemical weapon. She is one of those ""damn I don\'t have any emotions and can\'t act like a girl my age"" kind of girls and you get to watch her character development evolve throughout the course of the story, which is more then could be said for Train and Sven. Whats special about her is that she can turn her body into a living weapon, angel wings to fly? sure, molecular knifes to cut through steel? how about full body diamond defense? shes a pretty hax character.Creed Diskenth : Wow this guy couldnt be anymore like Sephiroth even if he tried, except minus the mama\'s boy complex. He likes wearing long black overall\'s, long silver hair, killed Trains girlfriend because he was jealous, and torments Train every waking moment of his life. He is also a closet homesexual because he has an unearthly lust after Train good god. It\'s like he wakes up every morning thinking ""I wonder what Train is doing right now? proberbly just getting out of bed just like me hehe"" Seriously this villian has no character developemnt and is flat our boring.Manga art/Quality :The manga art/quality was okey I thought, nothing too special and nothing too bad, so it suprised me when the anime had at most, an above average quality of animation. It suprised me that they were doing quite well animating scenes at night time, using alot of random thunder and lightening for effect. The animation had a very crisp yet bold look to it that made the whole image of the show quite sharp. If it had the same animation quality as, oh lets say trigun, it would fail badly, even though their both gun slinging animes. The main reason being Trigun\'s desert setting matches quite well to the old classic animation style. Black Cat had to go about this in a more modern approach.Closing :*** So I always saw the Black Cat manga up and about and it seemed that quite a few number of people had read and watched it. Seeing as how I thought ""heck I should have a go myself"" I felt very unsatisfied with the whole story, it all seemed way too predictable. Everything was way too generic, I mean I thought the story would of been a whole lot better if they focused primarily on the Chronos Organisation. But no, they had to focus on Creeds unhealthy obsession on Train and the countdown until the fatal finale. Heck even the endings of both the anime and manga left a very disatisfied feeling in my mouth, it was way to rushed and you just knew ""yeah thats pretty much how Train\'s gonna beat Creed"" Been there, done that is all I can say about Black Cat.*** Sven wears an eye patch over his right eye.

I understand in action scenes the need to change frames often, but even in the first fight sequence the frames change so much you can\'t tell whats going on. The writing is so awful and cheesy. Black Cat, ""I\'m here to bring bad luck."" What, are you joking? Thats the coolest thing you could think of.The Art style is probably the best thing about this show.I guess the sound wasn\'t too bad, but nothing ground breaking here.The main character, or the guy with...the eye patch, seems like an interesting person at first but after using his lame power, he can see five minutes into the future, you might want to reconsider. He has this vision of somebody dieing and thinks that it is going to happen. If it\'s going to happen you may as well give up because you can\'t stop it. This happens all the time in other anime. The Black Cat character is your cliché short badass who has super powers and just kills everybody. Then after  Black Cat, or Train Heartnet his real name ( which is a really dumb name by the way), gets a cut on his face, which also happens in almost every other anime, some Homo (He is clearly a homo because he says"" Oh you scratched Train\'s beautiful, pretty-boy face, I\'ll have to kill you for hurting my lover) comes over and kills the other guy that cut his face.Well yeah I know ""I only saw one episode, How can I say the show sucks after only seeing one episode?""Considering how many other better animes there are out there why waste my time with this one if the first episode sucks so much? the eye patch, seems like an interesting person at first but after using his lame power, he can see five minutes into the future, you might want to reconsider.

I liked the premise of the story, a man fighting his dark past is something that is released in Japan about as often as a new Rihanna song in the pop industry but hey I find that a unoriginal story is not a death sentence and can be made into something truly unique with character development & plot...twists.Black Cat started out great with action and humor and had Trains fancy gun skills to boot, it felt like it was going to become a great anime. Then episode 8 happens, the anime takes a turn for the worse and feels like I am watching all filler which I was quite curious about due to Black Cat only having one season. Once the anime finally stops showing the viewer how to capture Reptar and helping the next Hercule out of the mess he had created, it picks up from where it left of and tries to make up for lost time which it does quite well despite the last arc being incredibly rushed.The art work for Train in the first few episodes were beautiful, I don\'t blame Creed for wanting to see the killer look it was quite captivating. The fight scenes were done well not the best I have seen but nothing really to complain about. The backgrounds buildings were done well and set the tone of the anime without drawing away from the characters.Soundtrack for Black Cat, I loved the opening song but the rest of the soundtrack... I didn\'t really notice it, I guess that can be classed as a good thing it wasn\'t so bad to mute or be distracting but when it comes to creating suspense and enhancing action scenes it\'s not really doing it\'s job.Ugh. This is where my problem with the anime lies Train Heartnet\'s character development, when I got to episode 8 I had to pause the anime to check I hadn\'t missed any episodes I looked on Wikipedia I apparently was on the correct one and six months had passed. From assassin to goon in an opening sequence and becoming surprisingly chatty whoever his therapist was they should set up a shop in Apostles of the Stars and all the problems would be solved. For those saying ""well six months have passed"" I hardly believe that a lifetime of murder and Cloud Strife syndrome is overcome in that short amount of time. I would of felt better about the transformation if it was gradual and was included in the anime.I enjoyed the series up until episode 8 and the anime became preoccupied with looking at the scenery. Though it did rescue itself from good ol\' filler pie and continue on with the story and I found the end product satisfying.Overall I would say it\'s probably unworthy of the 7 I have given it. Don\'t get me wrong the anime had some great ideas it just fell at the last hurdle, Black Cat was held up by it\'s supporting characters, interesting story and great art style.The anime feels like an advert for the manga ""here is a poorly executed anime, would you like to buy our manga?"" No, no I don\'t. An anime should be able to stand on it\'s own and not be held up by it\'s better manga counterpart. With only 24 episodes to work with it spent too much time on dillydallying and parts became rushed and parts seemed unnecessary.

The series definitely has its share of bishounen and bishojo, but it sometimes gets in the way of the storyline. The  voice acting's pretty good, though i recommend watching it in Japanese best.

It reminded me of Trigun an awful lot in a way with exception that it didn\'t focus on just one character, but a few.During the story it felt a little rushed and there was plotholes they never fully explained with exception of the black cat special epsiode ""24"" or whatever you call that episode lol.The animation was smooth and was fresh with colour, the ost was amazing and worth buying in my opinion!All in all, great anime! ', ""I love Black Cat, it really is an underrated anime, so I hope this review will open people's eyes.First of all, the story is outstanding. It is very suspenseful and not to mention funnySecondly, I should say the art is pretty good. The action is nice, but tbh, I think the characters could be cuter.Secondly, the sound is pretty good too~ I like Train's voice, and Eve sounds so cute!In additon, the character is great....I like how most voice actors and actresses have a voice that matches the character's personality. However, one concern I have for that is that sometimes a character can be.. out of character. Either than that, I enjoyed this anime. It was outstanding. 8 stars!

The initial mise-en-scéne has style, points to some nice characters, and grabs you with its awesome art and sound.But you'll soon be disappointed, as inspiration fades and the episodes soon turn into a pour-whatever-comes-into-your-mind-and-make-it-look-as-if-it-were-good.There is a promise of a good plot, with secret organizations, killers, and supernatural beings. There is also a promise of interesting characters. But all this truly is is an excuse to make quick money by putting together sketches of ideas which aren't really original per se.They just become silly...excuses for vulgar fight scenes, which should appeal to younger audiences in that they blend supernatural techniques and fast action. Then, there is the big rivaliity between two characters which is some sort of poor spinoff from cowboy bebop.Globally, you're better off not watching this. Do download the OST though!

He is also just like Luffy, because of his silliness, but gets serious at some points. Another character that disappointed me was Eve. I feel that her character was way to cliche. Golden  Darkness from To-Love Ru was exactly the same. And Sven was probably the weakest character of them all. Rinslet would have more value than Sven, being that she has money and actually has means of getting it. Creed amuses me, but...his masochistc cries for Train make me want to vomit.The sound was good, Train's theme was cool, and the opening and ending were pretty good.The story isn't all that good, because you could predict events of some parts pretty easily, but I like how Train met Saya, even though it feels like that kind of plot is quite common.I enjoyed this series. The way the seriousness and fooling around had good timing, and didn't clash with each other.

I was told that Arthropod venom is one of the worst and most deadly venoms out there, but I guess science batted an eye on the more so deadly competitor known as nostalgia. Ever since I was little, and much like every other Arabian kid, a TV channel by the name of “Spacetoon” was what made all of those kids' childhood, “The channel of future youngsters” was the slogan, and it was no stretch. Among the many classics they used to air was “Black Cat”, with its nostalgic opening theme song and key characters, you couldn't call yourself a...fan if you haven't at least rewatched the series more than twice and recall the chronological order of events by heart. But over the +10 years that have passed since those simpler days, the plot, in general, had already faded from my memory and it was time to revisit the nostalgic classic once again and see if it holds up to today's standards.- Story (7.0/10):Heavily reliant on mythology and religious references, a story set on a post-war setting where conflict is still being fueled for what the losses that have already been suffered from weren't enough. A secret organization by the name of Chronos reigns from the shadows in pursuit of true peace by the means of blood and assassination, standing on the lead of its ranks numbered agents that go from 1 and increasing reaching number 13, that would be Train Heartnet, one of the protagonists of the series that seeks freedom and takes from Chronos a false escape from his intent of murder, little did he know soon enough that he will be freed with the help of Saya Minatsuki, a sweeper that helped him see the world in a different perspective.Unlike the real-world intuitive definition of a sweeper, sweepers here are people, much like freelance bounty hunters that arrest criminals alive in a manner that contradicts the methods of Chronos but also not completely oppose them. That was pretty much the set up for the story without spoiling any vital information.One thing they nailed here is the balance of comedy and action that very few shows manage to achieve (ex; One Piece), a running theme here seems to be cat humor, so, for cat lovers out there, you're in for some minimalistic chibi cat figures, in the other hand comes the badassness, everything from the cool poses, epic entrances, badass black cloaks and guns, enough to draw in your interest in fights. However, it seems they went the wrong turn with that, most fights are just a mess of complicated poorly juxtaposed frames that barely make sense, it makes it hard to keep up and follow what's going on, for the most part, add to that the frequently low FPS moments that make my potato computer running Minecraft shaders look like a champ.One misconception in anime is that if a show is fast-paced and straightforward, it creates opportunities for better story execution and character development, that is if done right. Black Cat suffers from consistency in pacing, it's fast yes, but faster than the flow of the story. The main quest is about revenge and redemption after all, but it doesn't leave much space for side quests to be fleshed out, and thus, every other side episode so to speak, feels like watching a horrible filler from the deepest pits of Naruto Shippuden's filler hell.- Art (7.5/10):Personally, I adore the art style, I would describe it as that of a vampire-ish dark vibe, heavy on sharp edges but not quite as sharp as Code Geass's character's chins, God lord, those are deadly (Not to say that Code Geass is a horrible show, like seriously, if you haven't watched yet, what are you waiting for?). Having the show portrays a light-hearted comedy, it doesn't fall short on it being dark, remember, this show is about assassins, bounty hunters, a world of conflict, and if the title “Black Cat” wasn't enough to emphasize, the art style surely does. The color palette is dark, but unlike other shows where it gets so dark that it's difficult to see anything on the screen, Black Cat knew when to stop. Those mix of aspects created a certain atmosphere to the story that you don't get from any other shows, I would say, it's the closest you can get to the Resident Evil 4 video game (you know what greatness you're getting now).- Sound (8.5/10):Whilst typing this, I'm still on an intense debate in my head whether I find the Arabic version of the opening theme song or the original Japanese version the better one, nostalgia is a biased factor here, but that doesn't make the other any less good. I mean, it's “I can listen to this all day” material going as far as “play this in my funeral” type of song. What I love about it is how soft and light it starts out and how quietly strong it gets near the end, makes for a perfect preparation to get you in the mood for some Train wrecking (that was intended). I'm glad they kept the same opening theme song throughout the whole run, with updated visuals midway the show, and two great ending theme songs to kind of cal you down at the end of each episode.I listened to both the English dubbed and subbed versions before choosing which one to go by, spoiler alert, it was the English sub, however, that didn't make the dubbed version look any less immersive, the main voices were spectacular, but I still wanted to go by the original version to kind of experience it the way it was made. So, for those who are deciding which one to watch, I recommend both, you might as well watch both alternating between one and other any time you see fit.- Character (8.0/10):Characters make half the show they say, and they couldn't be wrong, I mean look at Taboo Tatoo, that's what you get when you populate a story with potential with shallow characters, absolutely terrible. Black Cat, on the other hand, did a decent job keeping things as neutral as they are.Literally, every single character had a great development throughout, the initial Train is not the Train five episodes later, and the same Train is not the Train of later either, and that doesn't go for only main characters.There wasn't any annoying pitiful figure that made you snap out every time they spoke, I liked every single one of them and even had my favorites as well. Buuuuuuut, an issue with lacking backstories and plausible plot holes did leave their marks, some characters were indeed fleshed out but only compared to the neglected individuals, I'm not asking for a focusing ark for every single fraction of dirt. A character needs motive and purpose, it needs to follow an ideology or else, it falls under the nouveau-rich category from the background crowd.- Enjoyment (7.0/10):Nostalgia is a drug, I remember watching this show like it was like no other, it's safe to say that it was way below my expectations. Did it age well, pr-oba--b-l-y???! I'd feel guilty of admitting it, there were strong moments, but there were also weak moments that didn't live up to what I remember.I still laughed at the same exact old jokes (it seems parts of me never got old), I still liked the characters and found the story mildly interesting.At the start of my rewatch, I went all out, a barking nostalgia dog claiming that I can binge it in no time, but the effect of the drug wore off near the two-digit episodes, and the rest was history. A humble number of episodes were just plain boring, “I fell asleep while watching X” material. Not my proudest come back in any respect, it seems I learned to disregard nostalgia the hard way, but the actual good parts were just enough refreshment to get me all strong and recovered.- Overall (7.6/10):As far as shounen shows, Black Cat had its unique take on the genre, nothing revolutionary, but it certainly is way different than your modern shounen shows (My Hero Academia, Black Clover...). If you want to revisit what old shows used to be like, Black Cat does a good job retaining that fashion and atmosphere, the feelings that you're sent back to 2005 for 20 minutes, that's one approach to time travel. Now, for you people who have nostalgic memories to the show, please proceed with caution, the show that blew your mind back then may never feel the same, so tone down the expectations, but don't make my words scare you, our little nostalgic friend here still has its old special charm. fan if you haven't at least rewatched the series more than twice and recall the chronological order of events by heart.

While good and entertaining and all, it just doesn't stick out that well in the sea of shonen anime. Although, average, it's done rather well.Story: The story is pretty good. I mean, it's certainly not the best, but it's still enjoyable. That is, until you get to the last few episodes. It gets rather repulsive and disgusting, if I do say so myself. But the thing it has is consistency. No matter how good or bad the episodes get, you are always cheering for the good guys to win. You want to see the victory that these people...get, and how the attain it, and how they defeat the bad guys. If you're into something like that, this anime is perfect for you.Characters: The Heroes are great. They each have there own unique individual personalities that make them special. Train is cool, Eve is collected and awesome, and Sven is just badass! Sure Rinslet is not that great, but, the others makes up for that.  I think that the flawed characters are the villains. They're just not that good. They're either assholes, obsessive, or just flat out disgusting. But, in a sense, they work. The villains are so awful, that you like the good guys even more. So, I'm not sure is that's what they were going for, but it still gets the job done.Art: The art is rather well done. It has this sense of similarity about it, but it works. It's dark when it needs to be, and it's light when it needs to be. It's just a simple art style done right.Sound: The OST was pretty good, but not all that great. The Opening was OK. I found myself skipping it from time to time, but it wasn't bad. If you wanna talk bad, the first ending was really bad. It doesn't fit at all, and it sounds almost as annoying as Durarara's first ending. there second ending was magnificent. It dealt with the serious side of Black Cat, and it is a smooth melody that you can easily enjoy.Overall: It maybe only slightly different from other shonen anime, but it's worth viewing. I wouldn't pass it up, but I also wouldn't wouldn't call it a masterpiece either. 8/10 get, and how the attain it, and how they defeat the bad guys.

I think quirky is an apt way to describe it if I were being kind, inconsistent is another. Being constantly thrown back and forth from wacky slapstick comedy to serious plot is just irritating. I don’t think it would have hurt the series to lose a few of the comedic moments. The other major flaw is that Black Cat goes downhill rapidly after about 10 episodes. I would say episode 11 is the beginning of the end. The plot just seems contrived after this point and the ending is rushed and just plain terrible. It’s...disappointing to see this happen to an anime that started off so strong.There are a lot of positives to Black Cat. Action scenes are fun and suitably over the top. Characters are likable and memorable with good quality voice acting. And for half of the series at least, the story solid and imaginative. Even though the ending isn’t great it is still entertaining to watch and not a waste of time.A more detailed review can be seen at: http://nikkimanga.com/black-cat-review-anime/ disappointing to see this happen to an anime that started off so strong.There are a lot of positives to Black Cat.

Usually producers seem to have trouble squeezing in all the necessary elements of a long series into the limited number of episodes, but Black Cat has a bit different approach. Some characters and events have been removed, but then again there are some completely new characters and added scnenes topped with completely different, or maybe I should say extra, ending.The story revolves around Train Heartnet, a gunman who works for the organization called Chronos but decides to leave...the organization and lead a different life as a bounty hunter with his new gang. Important themes in the series are choosing one's own road and coming in terms with past. Story is very humoristic with a lot of comedy relief.  The fight scenes are mixture of guns and other 'believable' weapons and different 'powers', giving the show a fantasy element.The comedy is one of Black Cat's strongest points, and it's superbly expressed, having it's own special rhytm and flow. The characters are very charismatic and both contrast and complement each other. Especially the 'main trio' is crafted in a manner that allows lot of spontaneous apparing jokes to spring out from their interaction.In a nusthell, Black Cat is nice and easy shounen anime. It's enjoyable, but don't memorable. While some scenes, especially in the earlier episodes, are darker than the others, Black Cat doesn't even either even aim for being remembered for it's heart breaking moments or fails at it. Also, a lot has been lost in the translation between the manga and the anime.

Within the very first forty seconds, anyone will be drawn. It shows a scene that will happen later, similar to High School of the Dead, except this scene does not take place in episode one, and it is more tragic. Hanabi (fireworks) are lightened at night, then two men appear to be having a beautifully animated duel, one with a sword and the other with a gun. The one with the sword says: ""Those eyes. . . Those are the eyes! That woman. . . (A lying woman\'s bloody (which is black...due to censorship, I believe) hand is displayed) Because of that woman\'s curse, you are. . .! (Crying and wielding the sword)"" Then the scene ends with the other guy yelling.The plot of this show changes significantly after a few episodes. Firstly, a man called Train Heartnet works for an organization, named Chronos, whose members bear a Roman numeral on their body. He is number XIII, also known as Black Cat/Kuro Neko. Train is a highly praised member, who kills bad people with a gun (the same person from the beginning) in the name of Chronos, telling his victims right before their death that he ""came to deliver bad luck."" A man who has worked as an informant for years has never heard of a target escaping Heartnet. Train\'s friend, who wields a sword (the other individual at the start), applauds the former\'s talent, saying that only them two can strike a person at a fatal spot with one hit, and that Heartnet is subarashi (amazing). However, despite how cold he looks, he is actually tormented by his past and the guilt of single-handedly executing people. His next job is considered more difficult, and number XIII gets briefed by a woman, Sephiria. Sven, a sweeper, intends to arrest Lib Tyrant, a former gang lord who is running for office in Bracchio City and is about to marry his fiance, Joanna. After having alcohol spilled on him at a party for Lib, Sven goes to the bathroom to clean himself up, taking the patch over his eye off. Tyrant walks in with his bodyguards as well, and, with his vision eye, which can see five minutes into the future while draining his power, Sven is surprised to foresee Lib\'s death. . .Based on the first episode alone, the story, I have to say, is intricate. This is not your dumb, weak kid trying to be strong; this is not your beat-them-up children\'s superhero; this is not your funny, clumsy newbie gaining experience; no, this is a serious boy who is not easy to mess with, who has a dark past, and who cries for those he murders and his parents.Unfortunately, the opening sequence (and people\'s comments on the series) suggests a lighter mood later on. The lyrics are wonderful and the tune is nice, but I am not a big fan of the visuals, because I think they should be more gloomy/depressing. It shows small scenes of the important ones of the cast. Even less appropriate is the ending sequence, which starts off okay, but soon it becomes a joke of a song, having miniatures of the main characters turn into silly looking neko (cats), and sounding like something out of a Miyazaki movie.So, yes, good story, check; fine animation, check; excellent seiyuu, check; comedy, check; drama, check; action, check; and adventure, check. I would compare this anime to Rurouni Kenshin and Ubel Blatt, in terms of a series containing a powerful, but sorrowful protagonist.

The poor pacing, inconsistent animation, and uninteresting plot make the series painfully average.  The music really elevates what it accompanies and makes scenes feel much more impactful.  The characters are all unique and it is a shame that their backgrounds and motivations are not explored further.  The animation is extremely inconsistent, there are some scenes where it was obvious where the budget went, and others that are lacking.  The pacing is also a huge detriment especially later in the...series where there are large exposition dumps overshadowing the rest of the episode.  The main narrative is rather boring and messy especially at the end of the series.  Black Cat is cool to look at but that's about it. series where there are large exposition dumps overshadowing the rest of the episode.

They have similar enough plots, similar themes, etc. The people at Funimation seemed to know this. Jason Liebrecht, Brandon Potter, and Brina Palencia all play similar characters in both shows. But here's the thing: both of the two shows are really, really good.The differences between Black Cat and Darker than Black remind me of those between Fullmetal Alchemist and FMA: Brotherhood. One is more fun (Brotherhood and Black Cat), and the other is more thoughtful (Fullmetal Alchemist...and Darker than Black). But whereas the difference between the two FMA shows are rather subtle, Black Cat and Darker than Black are on opposite ends of the spectrum. Just like how Darker than Black is remarkably clever (see my review of it), Black Cat is one of the most enjoyable and funny shows I've watched.

The art style was mediocre at best; the overly-cut fight scenes left little to be desired and the lack of character development really put a damper on my interest in Black Cat. My favorite character was Sven Vollfied, as he seemed to be the most multi-dimensional character in the show. The first few episodes started on the right note, then gradually disintegrated into a muddle of blah with unexplained character changes and utter confusion. It's a shame, really, because the series...did hold potential in the first five episodes or so.

Since there are many battles, often with supernatural powers involved, this is an important issue. Battles flow smoothly, and, despite the crazy mix of powers involved, it is kept at a fairly realistic level. The settings themselves seems to be some odd kind of mishmash between western surroundings coupled with various futuristic elements like huge laboratory setups and the occational computerized add-on. Even one of the main characters is an example of that, but more on this later.Sven Vollfied is maybe one of the most hilarious and charming goofballs I\'ve encountered within this kind of genre. I\'ve...heard him described as a mix between Vash the stampede and Spike Spiegel, which might be accurate, I guess. (Having seen neither of the aforementioned shows, I can\'t confirm that, but it sounds.... well, sound.) At first glance, he seems like quite the harmless guy. He often gets into arguments with the local cafe hostess for never really seeming to be able to pay for the coffee he drinks while he sits there and read whatever newspaper he can get his hands on. When things get serious, however, he\'s shown as more than able to handle himself.Black Cat is..... he\'s interesting, I guess, for a character who is named Train Heartnett. There, I said it. TRAIN! HEARTNETT! He is the aforementioned top agent and assassin in Chronos, sporting nearly supernatural abilities at handling his firearms, a simple looking handgun with a ""XIII"" marking on it. While he isn\'t the most interesting conversationalist in the group, he never disappoints when it comes to making battle scenes look kickass. (No pun intended.) In the duration of the show, he leaves Chronos at the urges of a young girl, and eventually joins up with Sven and the others after their rescue operation.The... well, the target of said rescue operation is Eve, a nano-machine construct made for battle. When we first meet her (yes, HER), she is held captive by a person who intend to break her -- to prepare her to become the ultimate killing machine, which is made all the more unsettling, seeing as she looks like a young girl. In fact, she reminds me a lot of another young girl in another show I\'ve seen recently; namely Ren from Erementar Gerad, a fact that is made all the more apparent seeing as they\'re both weapons by nature. Of course, things never go as planned, and inevitably, she meets up with Sven, who promise to take her away and to teach her more about what it is like to lead a human life.It would seem that the last character, Rinslet Walker, is the only one who doesn\'t seem to be blessed with anything remotely close to supernatural powers. Not that it makes her helpless by any means, though, as she might very well be the Faye Valentine to Sven\'s Spike/Vash combo. She\'s sneaky and intelligent, but also fairly able to look after herself when she heads out on her own.Of course, the antagonists seems to be filled with the same kind of strange people that makes up the main team. Ranging from voodoo practicioners to kids on hoverboards a la Back to the future. From bespectabled men in large hats to young schoolgirls with flame attacks. And in the leader\'s chair, we pretty much have a Sephiroth-type character at his most insane. They\'ve got plans, they\'ve got powers and mr. Sephiroth seems to harbor a rather unsettling interest in our main lead Train. You know, Train Heartnett, our ex-Chronos operative? Yeah, I\'m still rather taken aback by that name.

This show never sits still for long, because there are always people to rescue or hunt down, always things to figure out and locations to find.

Yes, there are some comic moments, but they absolutely don\'t go with the dramatic stories and sad flashbacks.I also don\'t believe that Train\'s personality could change so.

This is no surprise, as most anime/manga tend to be fairly derivative of the industry's titans. There are certainly worse examples to riff off than Bebop, and it's an interesting choice since Bebop was a flop in Japan. Black Cat is nowhere near as interesting, nuanced, or artistic as that series, but there is fun to be had here and what cliches...do exist are well-executed.The anachronistic setting is split into three factions, rather like Outlaw Star now that I think of it. There is Chronos, which is a secret society of assassins who have some sort of ill-defined influence over the world's governments. Their members are all badass fighters with various supernatural weapons, much like Organization 13 from KH. Two such members were the main character Train Heartnet along with the main villain of the piece, Creed Diskenth. The first seven or so episodes explain the backstory of how these two characters leave Chronos and join the other two factions in the setting.Train decides to become a freelance bounty hunter, known as a Sweeper, after meeting a nice girl who persuades him to leave the life of a cold killer behind. Of course, being a bounty hunter for hire isn't actually that different from being a bounty hunter for Chronos, but I suppose Train now has the ability to choose which jobs he is willing to take. Indeed, there is nothing morally challenging about the story in any respect - the Sweepers are essentially no different than the ninjas in Naruto or the mages in Fairy Tail. They are unambiguous heroes. Train forms a squad with comic relief/everyman Sven Vollfied, deadpan loli stereotype Eve, and femme fatale Rinslet Walker. I quite liked Rinslet, was ok with Sven, and rolled my eyes at Eve, who is probably the most cliched character of the bunch. Interestingly, Train himself goes from being an edgelord to an upbeat shonen protagonist over the course of the series, though he is still haunted by his dark past. I imagine much of Train's popularity comes from surface-level appreciation of his character design, but he's actually a fairly rounded character who has some depth to him. It's worht noting the main characters match up 1:1 with Cowboy Bebop's main cast. Train=Spike, Sven=Jet, Rinslet=Faye, Eve=a less fun version of Ed, and Creed=Vicious.Speaking of Creed, he is an utterly psychopathic villain who is also a yandere for Train. He's never explicitly stated to be gay, but we all know. He creates the third faction of the series, the Apostles of the Star. Despite the cool name, the group's motivations are ill-conceived beyond taking over the world. It's never really explained why Creed despises Chronos so much, or how he would do things differently than them. Indeed, beyond his singular desire for Train he's a flat character. Ultimately, he's a flash in the pan villain who has style but no substance.The series has very good animation and sound across the board, which helps to differentiate the extensive cast of secondary characters. They all only get scraps of screentime, but I was impressed by the sheer volume of different designs and powers. It helped the world feel vivid and populated. For a shonen series, many female characters got significant focus and were strong fighters as well. Wasn't a sausage fest at all despite the yaoi overtones between Train and Creed. The fight scenes were usually quite fluid and the colors really popped. In addition, the opening song is fantastic. I think the technical aspects of the show kept me endeared even when the actual plot got dangerously thin.In total, I think everyone should watch Cowboy Bebop instead, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the series. The manga the anime is based off of is finished, allowing for a complete story. You don't always get that in anime. Although this show doesn't tell the full story of the manga, the impressive technical qualities displayed helped boost my score to a very weak 7 bordering on a 6. do exist are well-executed.The anachronistic setting is split into three factions, rather like Outlaw Star now that I think of it.

Of course, being a bounty hunter for hire isn't actually that different from being a bounty hunter for Chronos, but I suppose Train now has the ability to choose which jobs he is willing to take. Indeed, there is nothing morally challenging about the story in any respect - the Sweepers are essentially no different than the ninjas in Naruto or the mages in Fairy Tail. They are unambiguous heroes. Train forms a squad with comic relief/everyman Sven Vollfied, deadpan loli stereotype Eve, and femme fatale Rinslet Walker. I quite liked Rinslet, was ok with Sven, and rolled my eyes at Eve, who is probably the most cliched character of the bunch. Interestingly, Train himself goes from being an edgelord to an upbeat shonen protagonist over the course of the series, though he is still haunted by his dark past. I imagine much of Train's popularity comes from surface-level appreciation of his character design, but he's actually a fairly rounded character who has some depth to him. It's worht noting the main characters match up 1:1 with Cowboy Bebop's main cast. Train=Spike, Sven=Jet, Rinslet=Faye, Eve=a less fun version of Ed, and Creed=Vicious.Speaking of Creed, he is an utterly psychopathic villain who is also a yandere for Train. He's never explicitly stated to be gay, but we all know. He creates the third faction of the series, the Apostles of the Star. Despite the cool name, the group's motivations are ill-conceived beyond taking over the world. It's never really explained why Creed despises Chronos so much, or how he would do things differently than them. Indeed, beyond his singular desire for Train he's a flat character. Ultimately, he's a flash in the pan villain who has style but no substance.The series has very good animation and sound across the board, which helps to differentiate the extensive cast of secondary characters. They all only get scraps of screentime, but I was impressed by the sheer volume of different designs and powers. It helped the world feel vivid and populated. For a shonen series, many female characters got significant focus and were strong fighters as well. Wasn't a sausage fest at all despite the yaoi overtones between Train and Creed. The fight scenes were usually quite fluid and the colors really popped. In addition, the opening song is fantastic. I think the technical aspects of the show kept me endeared even when the actual plot got dangerously thin.In total, I think everyone should watch Cowboy Bebop instead, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the series. The manga the anime is based off of is finished, allowing for a complete story. You don't always get that in anime. Although this show doesn't tell the full story of the manga, the impressive technical qualities displayed helped boost my score to a very weak 7 bordering on a 6."", ""Black Cat started as an edgy and serious anime with a mediocre plot that soon turned into a happy-to-go all after a time jump showing how amateur the writer was.

The story was fanominal and i love how Black's attitude changed from a killer to a happy go lucky person. It was the perfect anime as a sort of buffer between other series. I would really enjoy to rewatch this anime. "", 'The show starts off very strong. Without giving away any plot you will get engrossed with the first couple of episodes.  The theme is set after that and the story takes off doing rather well not meandering too much towards its plot goals. But after the first arch in what seems like a second haphazard season they threw an odd plot together and it just went off the deep end. I finished it for the sake of the first arch but I was gritting me teeth through the end of the second arch.

How could you entirely change the personality of the titular character? :pHalf the events in the story got rearranged, Train already was partners with Sven and left that other group before the manga started but arcs that took place during the beginning of the manga happen while Train is doing things from a part of his life prior to the start of the manga. "", ""Characters: This show was a mix of good compelling characters, and throwaway side characters. All the main characters were pretty decent. I liked Train even though his character development was very weird and nonsensical. I wish they had done a better job with his personality. At the start of the show, I thought he was going to be the edgy badass assassin type with maybe somewhat of a secret soft side. For the first like 7 episodes, it seems like that was what they were going for. But after a somewhat short time skip, his personality does a practical 180, becoming brash, fun-loving, and righteous....I understand that this was supposed to be his real personality behind his facade, but I wish they had built that up more, maybe showing that side of him here and there and over time having him become comfortable with showing his real attitude. I thought Sven was a much more consistent character with clear motivations and decent development. I liked Eve a lot, but I wish we could have seen her becoming closer to Sven and opening up more rather then her just immediately being fine after the skip. Creed was ok, I liked his motivations and character at the beginning but it just felt like he got worse and worse over time, until I barely cared what he was doing. other then that though, while there were a couple of gems, most of the side characters were just throwaway nameless guys with no backstory. I think the show suffered greatly from just the sheer volume of them. If they were going to have this many characters, then why did they make the series so short? Many of them barely had any screen time and felt like they were only there to provide minor assistance to make it easier for the protagonists to win fights. I feel like they should have tried to cut many of them. Like, at one point later in the show, this random wolf appears and I just have no idea who he is or why I should care. The show acts like I should know him, but I just don't? Did I miss something?Character designs/animation: it's a real shame that so many of the side characters are such trash because thought was clearly put into their designs. I liked Train in all his outfits, especially his cool trench coat and that little bell that's around his neck. I thought that was cute. Sven's all white suit and pants and little fedora were pretty stupid though ngl. Eve's berserk form was pretty awesome but her regular appearance was pretty mediocre, I don't really think it needed to be more though. A lot of the side characters looked really awesome, and I don't really understand why they gave them such cool looking designs if they we're going to be in a total of 3 episodes. On the other hand though, some of the side characters just looked like 'generic thug #4' and I will immediately forget about them after writing this. The animation had its ups and downs. It definitely wasn't bad, it actually had some cool psychedelic looking scenes with very interesting shots and very nice uses of colors. I also liked the way they animated Train using his gun, because it was pretty awesome and badass. My problem though, was that it felt like they were doing this not because it looked cool, but because they wanted to avoid animating straight up fights. When there were real fights, they were pretty chunky. I did think that the climax fight was pretty neat though and I enjoyed it.pacing: This show, like another one I reviewed recently had some weird pacing issues. My main issue though was the three month time skip after the group finally came together. It completely eliminated so much character development. After seeing it, I was convinced that I must have skipped an episode or something. It just goes from them being almost complete strangers to buddy buddy little family. I cannot fathom this choice because every scene that required one of them to save the other one or cheer them up it, I just had to ask myself why? Why do they care at all? I never saw them become close. It also disappointed me because I was looking forward to them becoming closer as a group. That's what the point of these 'road-trip characters are forced to stick together and slowly become family while beating up bad guys' kind of show is right? It also felt like the show moved a little too fast, with many characters barely getting any screen time in order to service the plot.Music/VA: The OP was nothing special, just serviceable. I liked the first ED a lot, both the song and the funny visuals, even though it felt somewhat out of place. The second ED was pretty generic and lame though. The background music was pretty decent, but at times I thought they were playing the wrong song at the wrong time. Like, there would be a moment that I thought was supposed to be heartwarming but it had this eerie music playing. I did like that if you listen, a lot of the music was based around Saya's song at the beginning. I thought that the VA was good, Train's voice was cute, if a little nasally. I think they did a decent job with the casting all around. I don't really have any more to add on this front.plot: This was easily the worst part of the show. It was all over the place. I couldn't tell if the show was going for a serious mafia assassin story, or a villain of the week magical road trip. I liked that there was a slight supernatural vibe to the world, like with Sven's eye (which he hardly uses for some reason) but after a while it got to be overwhelming. I think the tao powers were just way too much and it should have just stayed at like the slight magical elements that it had at the beginning. I also didn't really understand the choices made with Chronos, the organization Train was a part of. I don't feel like I understood their motivations for anything. What was the goal of their existence? It was apparently to 'keep peace' but I'm not really sure what that entailed. They also really fell to the wayside as the plot progressed. There were also many mechanics introduced that just stopped being used or mattering after a while. Like Sven's eye being seemingly forgotten for huge chunks of the story. And the juice that gives you tao power being completely abandoned and never mentioned again. The most egregious example was when something happens to Train that is supposedly supposed to effect him in a big way. I thought maybe he would gain new abilities or literally anything would change, but no it's over after one episode and never brought up again. I thought that this was really dumb. And it really ruined any expectations I had of the show after that point. When the climax finally came to a close, I was actually somewhat satisfied with the ending and final scenes, but then I realized that there were actually like 5 episodes left? The remaining scenes and true climax was an absolute mystery to me. It seemed like they were pushing a kind of mix of Evangelion and Code Geass with weird the christian imagery and a perfect paradise that isn't so perfect after all. It was pretty baffling that they did this, and it did not fit the show at all. Never when I starting watching this show did I think it would go this off the rails and not in a good way.All in all, I thought the beginning of the show was pretty good but as it continued it just went very downhill. I think the best experience with this show would be watching it up to three month time skip, but if you absolutely have to know how it ends, just end it with the first climax and pretend it's over. I understand that this was supposed to be his real personality behind his facade, but I wish they had built that up more, maybe showing that side of him here and there and over time having him become comfortable with showing his real attitude.

That's what the point of these 'road-trip characters are forced to stick together and slowly become family while beating up bad guys' kind of show is right? It also felt like the show moved a little too fast, with many characters barely getting any screen time in order to service the plot.Music/VA: The OP was nothing special, just serviceable. I liked the first ED a lot, both the song and the funny visuals, even though it felt somewhat out of place. The second ED was pretty generic and lame though. The background music was pretty decent, but at times I thought they were playing the wrong song at the wrong time. Like, there would be a moment that I thought was supposed to be heartwarming but it had this eerie music playing. I did like that if you listen, a lot of the music was based around Saya's song at the beginning. I thought that the VA was good, Train's voice was cute, if a little nasally. I think they did a decent job with the casting all around. I don't really have any more to add on this front.plot: This was easily the worst part of the show. It was all over the place. I couldn't tell if the show was going for a serious mafia assassin story, or a villain of the week magical road trip. I liked that there was a slight supernatural vibe to the world, like with Sven's eye (which he hardly uses for some reason) but after a while it got to be overwhelming. I think the tao powers were just way too much and it should have just stayed at like the slight magical elements that it had at the beginning. I also didn't really understand the choices made with Chronos, the organization Train was a part of. I don't feel like I understood their motivations for anything. What was the goal of their existence? It was apparently to 'keep peace' but I'm not really sure what that entailed. They also really fell to the wayside as the plot progressed. There were also many mechanics introduced that just stopped being used or mattering after a while. Like Sven's eye being seemingly forgotten for huge chunks of the story. And the juice that gives you tao power being completely abandoned and never mentioned again. The most egregious example was when something happens to Train that is supposedly supposed to effect him in a big way. I thought maybe he would gain new abilities or literally anything would change, but no it's over after one episode and never brought up again. I thought that this was really dumb. And it really ruined any expectations I had of the show after that point. When the climax finally came to a close, I was actually somewhat satisfied with the ending and final scenes, but then I realized that there were actually like 5 episodes left? The remaining scenes and true climax was an absolute mystery to me. It seemed like they were pushing a kind of mix of Evangelion and Code Geass with weird the christian imagery and a perfect paradise that isn't so perfect after all. It was pretty baffling that they did this, and it did not fit the show at all. Never when I starting watching this show did I think it would go this off the rails and not in a good way.All in all, I thought the beginning of the show was pretty good but as it continued it just went very downhill. I think the best experience with this show would be watching it up to three month time skip, but if you absolutely have to know how it ends, just end it with the first climax and pretend it's over."", ""It seems I only end up writing reviews for shows I have a lot of negative things to say about. Black Cat is by far the least inspired Shonen (This was originally in shonen jump btw, for 4 years;; ) I have ever seen.Take this review with a grain of salt. I was paying minimal attention through out the show, because it really failed to capture my attention.STORY:The setting and world building is AWFUL, I seriously don't know what they were going for... The setting feels like what a Japanese man would imagine the west in the 2000's to be like, but it makes 0...world building sense. (apart from it being WILDLY inaccurate in my European eyes)  I JUST finished this show and I can't remember a single location accurately. (I feel like they fought at castles and mansions a lot?)There are the Sweepers, Chronos and the Apostle’s, but you don't get the impression that any of these organisations influence the world around them, or that this world would warrent the existence of these types of organisations in the first place. The setting is so bland, that at one point I forgot that it was supposed to take place in a world with computers. (which is dumb because nano technology is a big part of the show)So this world has Taoists and nanomachines, which enable the users grand powers. It reminds me of a certain magical index, where there is an opposition of magic and technology, but this story does nothing with these sources of power, they just exist as an excuse to have cool powers. But then you have Train who just has protagonist powers, which really cheapens the impact of any imbalance that nano technology or tao could have brought into the story.Don't really care about the story, it's super tropey and cliche, which it no doubt feels that way to me as a modern viewer, but I doubt this was such an innovator even back then.This show has a tendency to undercut serious moments with stupid bullshit that's just really fillery and boring. Like, something serious can happen, but the show turns it into a joke and all tension is lost. Train turning into a kid is a good example; it leads NOWHERE.ART:Not awful, but not good, certainly not for todays standards.SOUND:God, I hated the sountrack. Those arias in the fights were so annoying.CHARACTER:There aren't necessarily any characters that infuriated me or anything, but I didn't really love the dynamics between the characters either. Rinslet was absolutely useless, and it felt as if she was only there to have more female characters.Train was just an angsty protagonist, with the blandest personality imaginable.I liked Eve, but the show was mostly about Creed. Although I think the show didn't do him any favours, it was extremely pleasing for me to watch a male yandere character. It was the reason I started this show, if I'm honest. I don't think his development is the best, but he is the most memorable thing about this show.ENJOYMENT:I skipped through some parts honestly, it was so boring.OVERALL:I think in general, this is just a product of its time. It's not something that would be made today. I enjoy anime from this time period occasionally, despite it's common trappings, but this one really wasn't for me. I doubt many modern viewers can enjoy this show like people did when it aired. Even then I think something like Soul Eater or maybe even Fairy Tail (forgive me) that have somewhat stronger settings despite their faults.This show doesn't have a good setting, lots of cliches, boring characters, bad art so yeah, nothing for me to love.

Actually has to say that the manga was better than the anime for the first 50%, but actually got worse than the anime adaptation from the halfway point onwards.The manga starts and runs fundamentally different, even if the main events at the beginning,  are initially the same.--I used to be a fan of this work as a child and wanted to rewatch  it. Of course, it is much more negative to me now than before. But for a shounen, still positive....The action of the Black Cat adaptation is quite simple and one will understand in some episodes what the Shounen typical action amounts to.The implementation is also just average. However, the style of implementation was quite personable.The characters also had their own traits and were entertaining. Only her actual character received much less attention than he should. This made the characters no less likeable, but they lacked depth of character.For my part, the anime was entertaining to some extent.StoryThe Plot was a simple one, and as I said, it differentiated it from the manga, at least the process.The story is about Train, his change of heart, the consequences and just his adventure. A story that moves linearly from A - to -> B, with a few minor scenes. However, the episodes remained mostly important and it didn't drift into the filler area.Unfortunately, the episodes from c. 17 or 18 were really disappointing. It was recognized that the adaptation should clearly take a different path than the manga. However, towards the end everything was quickly thrown into a pot. The finale, the later events and the end were simply processed somehow. Many scenes were skipped completely, which created gaps that made less sense. Everything has been thrown over the table just so that the work can quickly come to an end in the last few episodes. They originally took their time, but apparently they drastically reduced the number of episodes, which led to such a terrible theater. Couldn't look at the end because it was really, just sad.Animation / pictures:The animations, dynamics, lighting effects and co. were hit very well here. In particular, this fluid combat animation, along with the dynamics, has been a good approach to dominant combat.Characters:The characters were neat, but only in terms of sympathy. The only character that was really addressed was Train. The rest just stayed the way they were and they just lacked depth of character.Sven was a simple womanizer as he is in the book and, as I said, just personable.Before his change of heart, Train was quite interesting, after that he only became a gobble, which is not surprising.Eve was also .. just a girl who didn't really understand her emotions and yes, like the rest of her, she was just there and done.The only thing Creed did was really positive. Never seen a character exude such an obsession. I'm not saying that it was well written. But he was all a charismatic chunk.Music:Black Cat's first intro was nothing too special musically, but was a good intro to the work.The outro was ... let's say it was very strange. Still there was something nice about it.The Osts in this plant were really noteworthy. Professionally designed Osts, who could beautifully underline every scene, something like that is a pleasure to see.My conclusionA decent shounen for in between, which you can definitely look at. The characters were personable enough, the music was fine, the animations dynamic and smooth and the representation of the genre was impressive enough.Only the end was a disaster The action of the Black Cat adaptation is quite simple and one will understand in some episodes what the Shounen typical action amounts to.The implementation is also just average.

There were too many flaws for me to like the show. However, there are a few things that the show did right, such as the characters' unique and distinct personalities. However, there are issues with consistency, character development, and story progression.As I mentioned, I did enjoy the distinct personalities of the main characters. Train is a laid-back goofball who can become serious when necessary. Sven is more serious and worries about their finances, but he follows a gentleman's code when it comes to women. Eve is quiet and bookish but can fight when needed.The art style and animation are good,...and the soundtrack is catchy and memorable.The story was okay, but the pacing was the worst, and it was inconsistent, with some episodes dragging on and others moving too quickly. The tone also varies, with some episodes being serious and others being comedic. The story takes a forced and sudden turn towards the end, which is very disappointing.Some of the secondary characters are underdeveloped, which is a shame considering how well the main cast stands out.Only watch Black Cat if you need to kill some time or you are having trouble sleeping. I had to take several naps to finish this, especially during the slowest episodes. and the soundtrack is catchy and memorable.The story was okay, but the pacing was the worst, and it was inconsistent, with some episodes dragging on and others moving too quickly.

Date A Live Movie: Mayuri Judgment,https://myanimelist.net/anime/24655/Date_A_Live_Movie__Mayuri_Judgment,"[""From the very first episode in Season 1, Date A Live was definitely unique in its set-up. Using dates to save spirits from their misery is certainly a concept  that you do not see often in the romance genre (except maybe The World God Only Knows? Just maybe?) and this was initially executed in a very interesting way. Where Date A Live goes wrong, however, is that, instead of coming up with something new, the writers choose to recycle the same generic formula once, twice, and now thrice.“Formula? What the heck are you talking about? What formula is this?” you may ask. Nothing wrong...with asking a totally legitimate question. And to answer: well, let us boil down exactly what happened in the past two seasons. Whenever a problem comes up in the form of a new character, tensions among various characters, or some kind of event, how do the characters resolve it? That’s right, a date. Something as simple as two people spending time together as a way to seal up the worst of the worst.Does this happen once again in Mayuri Judgment? Certainly. But having Shidou go on six dates for the first 45 minutes of the movie was really unnecessary and dragged the plot on and on. Nothing spectacular come out of these dates, and we learned nothing new about the characters that we did not already know.As for the climax itself, talk about messy, messy, messy. One thing that I kept asking was what the heck is the big-ball-of-doom doing there? The relationship between that and Mayuri’s presence is constantly hinted at during the “climax” battle, but it’s never fully explained and thus we end up taking it at face value.Moving onto the characters themselves, there really isn’t any development at all. In the first and second seasons, dates were used as a way to forge and deepen the relationships between Shidou and the rest of the main characters. Since they are all now close friends, these dates don’t hold the same kind of meaning anymore, hence the little character development. Don’t get me wrong – the characters are definitely interesting – it’s just that they don’t really change at all.One new character does come into the mix: Mayuri. But she’s just there with really no purpose for most of the movie – stalking around in the background, following the main characters around, with some hints here and there. When it’s finally her time to shine, she transitions into the plot inconsistently and poorly. In one moment, nobody but Shidou can see her, but all of a sudden in the next second everybody else can. All of this crammed into literally the last 20 to 30 minutes of the movie.The only one character I was extremely disappointed with was Origami. She was completely a throwaway character in the movie who butts in randomly to challenge Tohka (as if we’ve never seen this happen in the previous seasons), and then removes herself from the picture once that is over. The movie could have just done well without her (although I’m sure the fans wouldn’t have liked that).Sound and art are of high quality. The animation is by Production IMS so it is definitely high quality. The voice acting is also done well. I personally really like how Shidou changes his voice when he switches into his female counterpart. My only major issue is that sometimes the 3D graphics looked a little odd and incompatible with the bright, well-illuminated background, but otherwise from that, no complaints on that front.So is this movie worth your time? Well if you’re reading this review and thinking about it, you’ve probably already enjoyed the first two seasons well enough so go right ahead. From a critical standpoint, however, I was pretty disappointed. Date A Live: Mayuri Judgment did not put itself ahead of the pack.Overall Grade: D+Author's Disclaimer: Please remember, this is my own personal opinion.

We are only half way through the Light Novels and We need more!', 'To summarise, a fairly satisfying ending to the whole series, although I do feel it could have been explained and expanded a bit more.Story: 7I feel like the story from the past two seasons seemed to work slightly better, the film was mainly comprised of Shido going on dates with everyone, which I suppose nicely rounds off his relationships with everyone, I suppose merely to keep all fans happy, although I do feel that it was rather forced, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. I did enjoy the ending, but I feel that poor character development let it down a little. I was slightly annoyed about...the lack of answers towards the end, like ""Who created the spirits?"" and ""Where do they really come from?"", but hey I guess some things are just left to be wondered...Art: 8Fairly standard artwork in this one, cant really complain, although, like I have said before in my season 2 review, it could be a tad crisper and sharper, but I\'m not going to be a miserable bastard and mark it down for it.Sound: 7I\'m a fan dub, and I did watch the first 2 season and OVAs in dub; going into the same story with sub was a little strange, and since I am obviously lacking in the Japanese language department I cant really judge the voicing, but it sounded okay.Character: 6It was okay, I mean there\'s not much say about the development of all the other characters since there has been 2 seasons where that has been done nicely. So with the introduction to Mayuri, I thought the idea of her existence was a strange twist to the story, although unexpected, I like her as a character but without any real development I couldn\'t really scope her angle if you get what I mean.Enjoyment: 7I did like this movie, but not quite as much as the seasons previous to it.Overall it was good. I mean like it could have better, but of course there\'s always room for improvement in anything, The ending;  although it seems like everything is all good, did leave me hanging on quite a few important questions, but not all questions get answered I suppose. Nonetheless this was well worth the watch and suitable ending to a very good series! the lack of answers towards the end, like ""Who created the spirits?"" and ""Where do they really come from?"", but hey I guess some things are just left to be wondered...Art: 8Fairly standard artwork in this one, cant really complain, although, like I have said before in my season 2 review, it could be a tad crisper and sharper, but I\'m not going to be a miserable bastard and mark it down for it.Sound: 7I\'m a fan dub, and I did watch the first 2 season and OVAs in dub; going into the same story with sub was a little strange, and since I am obviously lacking in the Japanese language department I cant really judge the voicing, but it sounded okay.Character: 6It was okay, I mean there\'s not much say about the development of all the other characters since there has been 2 seasons where that has been done nicely.

No fun, this was something I never thought I would ever see. This was Amazing.So, I just said its amazing and good ,but why it is good? Back to the review, shall we?So, if you managed to saw every episode and OVA of DaL series (in chronological order) and then saw this you will be satisfied with whole series. I can assure you.

Date A Live Mayuri Judgement was overall a pretty good, relaxing movie to watch considering that I am tired as fuck today. All of the dates were very enjoyable to watch and all the girls were extremely fucking cute on their dates!The story is what you would expect of Date A Live, dating. They spend the whole pretty much first hour going through each of the characters dates. Considering they only have about an hour and twenty minutes to throw this all together it does...feel extremely rushed with each date lasting about 10-15 minutes max.Also the ending were they had their fight it felt really rushed and seeing Mayuri dissappear had little impact towards me in the feels department. This is to be expected however since she doesn\'t talk at all throughout the movie until the ending. She is just seen as quite honestly a stalker who is following Shidou everywhere, even his own house.I was quite disapointed with the story being so rushed and also lacking in content. I made you think ""is that it?"" by the end of the movie.The soundtrack they used was abesolutely beautiful and I also liked how they added the season 1 opening at the end during the fighting scene. It really fit into the fighting scenes but my personal favorite song was the song played during the end credits ""Invisible date"" was the name.The art was good as you would expect with the movie. I really loved how Tohka\'s new Spirit looked and the touch with dual wielding added a little bit of coolness to the movie I guess.Overall it was a pretty good movie but I believe that if they had made this an T.V adaptation they could have fleshed out the good points of the arc much better and had a less rushed story since they would have much more time to work with.This movie is a much watch for Date A Live fans, now all we have to do is wait for the new season to come out! feel extremely rushed with each date lasting about 10-15 minutes max.Also the ending were they had their fight it felt really rushed and seeing Mayuri dissappear had little impact towards me in the feels department.

A Date a Live movie. I can\'t wait to see more Origami in it!""about a movie later""Well, someone is getting fired over this.There are maybe TWO characters we like in the Date a Live series and only ONE we actually care about. The first one we like is the Time-Girl, and the second one of course is ORIGAMI, the white haired human (shut up VN player) girl that\'s socially awkward, loads of fun and pretty cute in her own way. After them there is CHAOS. A whole bunch of filler characters we could easily do without and who wouldn\'t be missed if they...disappeared. So... Whoever had the idea of a movie about the main character going on a date with every girl BESIDES Origami deserves to be fired, simple as that.It doesn\'t really go anywhere after that either. There\'s a small subplot about a new girl (oh who gives a crap about ""spoilers"") being formed from the pent-up stress of the other spirits, but she only interacts with people for about 5 minutes at the end of the movie and everything else is just filler. The protagonist also has an over-exaggerated response to her disappearing besides barely knowing her that can really push the wrong buttons for you and the movie ends.Not much to say about it, the 20-30 seconds we got of Origami were fun (actual good humor), the rest was pretty much crap. disappeared.

The second season was not as good but this film, Mayuri Judgment, just disappointing to me. Being that the original Date A Live aired a couple years back I was probably less aggressive towards the cliches of this series, but watching this film now has made me wonder why I ever enjoyed Date A Live; has it always been like this?The story takes place after the events of Date A Live II so all the previous characters will appear in this film. The new character(s) is developed...poorly for a 2 hour movie. The art is the same tier as the previous series so no complaints there. It has a bit of ""service"" for the fans of each girl in the series. Finally, it pulls a completely fresh plot that forces action scenes and juggles it around with a dash of bad pacing.Why is it the highest rated in MAL out of the Date A Live series? I\'m not sure. Do I recommend it? Nope. Unless you must see more Date A Live. I personally think Date A Live II concluded fine without the movie. 4/10 on my book. poorly for a 2 hour movie.

So what did LA think of this anime film?. Before LA answers this let\'s first look at the premise, well Shidou our main protagonist sees a huge sphere in the sky in which only HE can see, later the Ratatosk group analyze this huge sphere and tells Shidou that he must go on a...date with his right now current harem to remove this huge threat from the sky, that\'s right, the bulk of this movie is Shidou going out on consecutive dates with each of his haremette members Tohka, Yoshino, Miku, Kotori, Yuzuru and Kaguya. The thing is, although the movie spends the bulk of the movie fleshing out these haremette special dates for each of the harem members, LA can sorta see something from this, it\'s really fleshing out these characters in which some of them didn\'t get in the anime series, mainly being Kaguya and Yuzuru who gets this effect on LA. The dates have each of their haremette\'s theme added to it that adds to fleshing out the haremette in questions personality and behaviour, some even making nods to the original series, LA\'s favourite date would have to Kaguya\'s, Kotori\'s and Tohka\'s but especially Kaguya\'s (LA didn\'t know whether it was Kaguya\'s voice actor \'\'Maaya Uchida\'\' or for the fact that they fleshed out one of the Yamai Twins and made her a 3-dimensional character instead of ""\'\'Ohh she\'s one of the Twins\'\'"" with her date). Now the series\' title is \'\'Mayuri Judgement\'\', who\'s Mayuri?...well she at first comes in a certain points of each of the 6 dates as a ""mysterious girl"" and she obviously has a connection to the huge sphere in the sky. Well LA can tell you that Mayuri voiced by \'\'Sora Amamiya\'\' without spoilers ends up with the same ""\'\'anime film with a new character exclusive to the film\'\'"" syndrome many anime films have and LA by the time it lead to the huge climactic battle knew this was gonna happen. On speaking of the battle, there is only ONE battle in this 1 hour 12 minute anime film and it\'s GLORIOUS, with Shidou\'s harem fighting the ""huge sphere"" in the sky that turned rogue (ohhh...LA would have never guessed the huge sphere was bad), nonetheless the climactic battle is something to watch in this film alone. The animation done by Production IMS is adequate due to the either fanservice scenes to the quiet moments of the film to upping the ante when it comes to the huge climactic battle, the animation was decent overall and had no hiccups or errors LA saw. The voice acting on the other hand, if you like hearing squeaking haremette characters fawning over their dates or when their on dates respectively especially from Miku voiced by \'\'Minori Chihara\'\', Yoshino voiced by \'\'Iori Nomizu\'\' or some of the other minor characters in general. So back to LA\'s question from before, \'\'what did LA think of this anime film?\'\'...well it has the same trappings as any other anime film with a new character brought JUST for the film itself, however with little flaws it has and how the bulk of the film is the dates that flesh out the majority of the harem AND gives a one huge climactic battle for the finale. LA doesn\'t hate it per say, but LA doesn\'t love it either, it\'s most definitely better than Date A Live II as it doesn\'t goof around (as the dates ALLOWS them to goof off and it\'s a PART of the anime film\'s plot). Date A Live: Mayuri Judgement by all means isn\'t a terrible film, it could do worse, but for a self-contained anime film from a supernatural slice of life comedy harem anime series...LA wasn\'t expecting TOO much from this film, but LA still enjoyed it as a fan of Date A Live and as an anime film in general.

I would have liked to see more of Mayuri, but I guess her lack of screen time does make sense since, in universe, she was sent down to observe Shido and the rest of the spirits.Art: 8/10Overall, Production.IMS did an excellent job on the art style, seeming to lean more towards the first season's more uncomplicated but crisp art style as opposed to the second seasons' art style. However, the overuse of subpar CG, some of the backgrounds looking messy or blurry at times, and the proportions of some characters' faces and eyes changing from scene to scene bring the score down a bit. Overall, though, a great effort.Sound: 10/10An excellent soundtrack overall, bringing back some of the tracks and OST elements from the previous two seasons, one notable addition being the season 1 opening, while also adding in new songs to help flesh every scene out and really immerse you into the movie as a whole with all tracks sounding spot on and complementing the scenes quite nicely. The voice actors also do a fantastic job reprising their roles, a special mention to Mayuri's voice actor, who managed to fit right into the even while only appearing for a short time.Characters: 9/10The movie mostly follows Shido and the six spirit girls from the previous seasons. With Mana, Kurmin, Origami, The Ratertosker crew and all the other side characters you have come to know and love popping up for gags, cameos, help Shido and the gang out or progress the film's story. With the addition of the movie-exclusive addition of Mayuri helping to round out the roster and bring attention to the overarching storyline of the movie.Enjoyment: 9/10Overall, I really enjoyed the film, the gas with the side characters in the background were fun to follow as well as the antics that Shido and the spirits got up to one the dates gave me a few laughs at times or were just downright wholesome *couch* *couch* Yoshino's. I also appreciated how as someone new to the series, they didn't throw in details or references that only a seasoned reader of the light novels would catch, so It didn't feel like I  missed out on anything.Overall: 9/10If you enjoyed the previous seasons of Date a Live, this is a must-watch. With the Side-story base, feature-length and movie budget, helping to create a film that is basically a showcase of the best the series has to offer so far with some new additions to showcase what else the series potentially has to offer.TLDR: if you enjoyed the previous seasons of the anime, it's much of the same with some new additions to showcase what else the series potentially has to offer. his home city.

I waited literally 2 years since the last DaL related show (season 2), and well, got what I wanted. This is going to be a very hard movie to review..Story : 6/10While watching I was constantly thinking about the multiple ways the story could have been better presented. The main problem of the said story is Mayuri. All of the movies intrigue is based on Mayuri (thus the title), leaving the first 35 minutes literally only fan service, which I don\'t mind. Reviewing the story more would be major spoilers, which is the problem, since you can resume the...story in a sentence. I can\'t be to nitpicky about the story since it is Date a Live after all, and good story is not the top priority I watched this.Art : 7/10Honestly, for a 2015 movie (released JP), it looks bad. The art style remains, but it feels like all the time they used to make the movie was pointless. This is maybe affected by the quality that I was watching the movie in, but the fight scenes all seem rushed, and not a single pause looks good in the fights.The good side are the parts that were not rushed were all well drawn and animated, and had the iconic Hyperdimension Neptunia/DaL/Fairy Fencer F art style.Sound : 8/10Nothing remarkable, nothing bad. The movie did lack some ambient sound sometimes, but it was on rare occasions. The voice acting is all well and good, as it was in the anime.Characters : 8/10This is the most subjective mark that this movie can get. You either give a 1/10, a 5/10, or for Tohka fans, an 8/10. One might say that no character development, but why develop characters who are already fully developed, just like in all anime adapted movies. I already addressed the Mayuri problem in the story part of the review, I can only see Mayuri as a story engine, and not a real character.[POTENTIAL SPOILER] Why the high mark? Well, the main reason is Tohka. The movie gave all the girls their moments, but mainly focuses on Tohka. Since I am a huge fan of Tohka, I liked that a lot. She is the only one that gets wrapped by the story like Mayuri, she is the only one who get\'s the super transformation and she gets the most attention from Shidou. So if you are an Origami fan, or a Mana fan, this mark will be super low.Enjoyment : 6/10It\'s not that I didn\'t like the movie, I found it empty. The ending was one of those ""one more season maybe?"" things, which to be honest may be a possibility (YuruYuri case getting S1, S2, Movie, S3.) I feel like I missed out on the light novels, which surely were a lot better developed. There is still Kurumi who remains a giant mystery. If the movie would follow the Kurumi story from the 2nd season OVA, it would be a lot better. I went in watching without knowing what to expect, an ""OVA"" type movie, or large story progression just like the Love Live! movie. What I got is a mix of 2, which was honestly meh.Overall : 7/10Date a Live : Mayuri Judgement is not a bad movie, it just lacks the ""punch"" and the remarkable moments to make it good.

Now as per the usual Date A Live tradition he must go on dates with spirits! All this happens while he is trying to...figure out the mystery behind the mysterious girl that frequently appears before him.Mayuri\'s character was honestly handled very badly and the ending was predictable and felt forced. If you want us to feel bad for a character you have to give that character some actual screen time and dialogue which this movie did not do.Art: 8/10I really like Mayuri\'s character design. There\'s not much I can say regarding the art and animation because there\'s not much to really say about it other than it\'s good; much better than what we got out of season 2.Sound: 7/10There\'s a lot of reused music from the original series but that honestly doesn\'t bother me too much. Overall the music was pretty nice and I have no complaints regarding it.Character: 5/10OH BOY. This movie needs to get it\'s shit together regarding its characters.While I enjoyed how each of the spirits got ample screen time by each going on dates with Shidou they decided to neglect giving screen time to the one spirit that should matter: Mayuri. She spends more than half the movie randomly stalking Shidou and doesn\'t get any spoken lines until near the end to the point she feels like a flat character.Oh, did you guys want some Kurumi screen time in this movie? She\'s here and she does absolutely nothing. She just casually observes everything that\'s going on and that\'s it other than this one scene where she speaks to Shidou, although it has no importance to plot and it\'s very brief.Enjoyment: 6/10For the most part I enjoyed this movie. It\'s Date A Live so I wasn\'t really expecting much but I at least expected to enjoy it which I very much did.Overall: 5/10Despite the movie being called ""Date A Live: Mayuri Judgment"" the titular character Mayuri isn\'t that apparently important to plot apparently since they decided to give all the movie\'s screen time to all the other spirits.So, should you watch this movie? If your Date A Live fan then yes, but if you hate Date A Live or found it mediocre then you might as well not bother with this movie. figure out the mystery behind the mysterious girl that frequently appears before him.Mayuri\'s character was honestly handled very badly and the ending was predictable and felt forced. If you want us to feel bad for a character you have to give that character some actual screen time and dialogue which this movie did not do.Art: 8/10I really like Mayuri\'s character design. There\'s not much I can say regarding the art and animation because there\'s not much to really say about it other than it\'s good; much better than what we got out of season 2.Sound: 7/10There\'s a lot of reused music from the original series but that honestly doesn\'t bother me too much. Overall the music was pretty nice and I have no complaints regarding it.Character: 5/10OH BOY.

Sorry, but i think i will spoil something.Story (6/10)So I think the story a bad develop. Well i just say that i have guess the storyline. The ending is too simple, but it's still make me want to cry. The date is interesting like usual thought they don't show ecchi so much.Art (7/10)Like usual the art is so beatiful. But, I notice that Shido's face is kinda weird. The proportion is kinda weird, definetily. The studio also have a new design clothes of the spirit that are refreshing my eyes.Sound (9/10)I CAN'T RESIST SWEET...ARMS FOR SUREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECharacter (7/10)The character scene is equal except for Tohka, Kurumi, and Origami. Tohka is the main girl (?) so it's alright. But, Kurumi only appear only for 4-5 minute. It's make me so sad.Enjoyment (5/10)How can I enjoy without Kurumi on here? LOLWell, something that make enjoy is when Kurumi scene. But, Kotori and Miku scene is also enjoyable. But the fighting scene is to bit for me so i can't enjoy a fight so much from the movie.Overall (7/10)I was hype for the movie because i thought Kurumi will have more scene. But it's so far from my expectation. But, still the date is enjoyable. That why the overall is good. Ahahaha.. I'm so sorry for the Kurumi word spam.

I'm so sorry for the Kurumi word spam."", '“The heart of one wavers when you least expect it.”I was really hyped for this movie, after the epic saga that was Date a Live and Date a Live II. Like all great franchises, the high point of their reign over people’s minds and desires is usually with a feature-length movie that would feature our main hero(s) (Shido Itsuka in this case) on the big screen. So how well does Date a Live the Movie: Mayuri’s Judgement fare amongst other movies in the market? Does it stand out as an underappreciated gem considered over that Pixar movie? Does it bomb and leaves the viewer crying...for a refund? Let’s find out!Sound (7/10)Some familiar music cues (including my favourite – named Cycling) from the anime can be heard here, but most of the soundtrack is fitting enough in its use. Three songs, “Date A Live” – a reprise of the original anime’s theme song, “Invisible Date” – played during the ending credits – and another song performed by Minori Chihara right before the title appears - can be heard playing. They are all nice hits, and they seem appropriate contextually. While it doesn’t stand out, it intertwines with the scenes well enough.Visuals (8/10)The visuals are identical to the anime, combined with 3-D computer graphics imagery on the villain. Everything looks generally okay, with attention to detail quite impressive, though watching it in a cinema makes the visuals look kind of washed out. I think they should have done more for it to fit the cinema screen, because it just does not look very crisp. Other than that, with rich colours, good animation, and appealing artwork, what’s not to like?Storyline and Enjoyment (9/10)The story follows our 16-year-old Shido Itsuka, as he continues his dating life – yes, literally a life where he dates girls known as Spirits – earning her trust and then sealing off her Spirit powers by making lip-to-lip contact with each other. In the movie, a new girl is born simply from converged Spirit powers, named Mayuri. She follows along Shido – albeit as a thought-of mirage - as he goes on more dates with our other established heroes, attempting to weaken a mysterious sphere emitting Spirit powers that Shido previously sealed off. Eventually, the build-up leads to an epic fight, as the judgement of Mayuri – who deemed Shido as competent in Spirit-uality (or something like that, I can’t exactly remember) – conflicts with Cherubim’s, which inflicts great damage on the city. Now, the Spirits must team up to defeat him.While the fanservice was indeed played – and to quite a large extent – it was moderated. It was portrayed through Shido’s dates, with throwbacks to past events part of the appeal. This plays a gigantic part to the enjoyment, because this is where the average Date a Live fan will shake in his seat, yet the newcomer to the franchise will wonder what all the fuss is about. Still, however, the movie has its moments which both sides will laugh and cry at, including the ending, and a few other parts.Overall (8/10)A must-watch for fans of the franchise, Date a Live the Movie: Mayuri’s Judgement will not disappoint. With the same charming visuals that graced the TV series and original video animations, epic storyline to continue from the enchanting second season of the TV series, and immersive sound which proves that technology isn’t everything, Mayuri’s Judgement is a joy to watch. It will, however, alienate newcomers to the franchise, so if you haven’t seen the anime series or read the light novels, stay away. for a refund?

There was one thing I noticed, but it didn´t really annoy me, the following, always repeating steps: New spirit lands, new spirit is uncontrolable, shido saves her anyway, the spirit becomes part of his harem.I hoped for something unique in the film, but the first 45 minutes are basically wasted, shido...goes on 6 dates, that are completely irrelevant for the story, although they effect Mayuri after all, I just didn´t see the sense in putting 6 dates in the film, you could do that in the anime, or an OVA or something, but this is wasted time for the story. Mayuri herself, categorized as ""main character"" doesn´t even say a word, until about minute 45. She stalks shido for some reason, but that didn´t really hype me, it just got annoying after some time.The actual ""showdown"" with Mayuri and her angel Kerubiel doesn´t have any sort of buildup, Kerubiel randomly starts attacking everybody, and in the end, Mayuri disappears, and you know what? I was not sad at all when Mayuri was gone. She was designed really good, but... yeah, that is basically everything I like about her, she was there for some reason, and soon after, she was gone again, there wasn´t even any character development for her, I don´t even know why shido cried, when she disappeared... I would be super sad, if Tohka, Kurumi, or either Kaguya or Yuzuru disappeared, because they had at least some sort of character development, Mayuri was just... lame in my opinion, sorry.The Art in this movie is great, I like the style, very detailed, just like in the series. When they animated Kerubiel in the movie, they tried to make something new, and it totally worked, Kerubiel and his attacks all looked really awesome. The sound was pretty much perfect, always some nice background tunes, that make your emotions exactly how they should be in every scene, really can´t complain about anything right there.The story disappointed me, just the story in this movie, everything else was great. The movie was still not bad, I enjoyed it, but not as much as the anime series. goes on 6 dates, that are completely irrelevant for the story, although they effect Mayuri after all, I just didn´t see the sense in putting 6 dates in the film, you could do that in the anime, or an OVA or something, but this is wasted time for the story.

However, it does reuse the exact same formula once again, which is quite boring. It\'s exactly like the anime seasons and I guess the arcs in the novel. It starts with lighthearted comedy with no real plot or anything and all of a sudden, we\'re met with a somewhat explosive ending with a lot of drama and sometimes tragedy. As usual, the drama and tragedy is very unnecessary, even to the point of being something of a detriment since...it doesn\'t fit in well with a story like this that doesn\'t have anything resembling a solid or serious plot/story. It\'s pretty much a new anime season compressed into one roughly third of the usual length, around 4 episodes in length instead of 12.It\'s once again quite enjoyable almost solely because of the character interactions which are lovely. There\'s obviously flaws, but they\'re not as notable as in the main anime thanks to the short duration. I feel like it\'s definitely worth watching it, especially if you liked the original anime seasons.On a side note, I felt like the art/animation was a fair bit better than the original anime, especially notable in the fight at the end, might have something to do with both that it was made later than than season 1 and 2 and that it was a movie rather than an anime season, so I guess more time and resources might\'ve went into it. Oh, and the mc is as much of a disappointment as usual as well, all he can do is shout and throw his selfish emotions around everywhere when things doesn\'t go his way, acting like a baby. He endangers both himself and those around him without caring one bit or considering the situation and his own limitations. Sometimes I have this sadistic desire of wanting to see people close to the mc dying thanks to his reckless decisions and immaturity, or wanting him to die and witness the pain, grief and destruction it would wreak upon everyone around him as he watches in spirit form or whatever. Maybe that\'d wake morons like this up. People like him just shouldn\'t be put into drama/tragedy situations, let him be a romcom slice of life type protagonist instead, that\'s where he belongs. It\'s just notable in the last 20-30minutes though where things hit the fan. Urgh, so incompetent yet has such a big mouth, if it wasn\'t for his planet-sized plot armour, he\'d be dead a million times over, EVEN with the help of all the girls he surrounds himself with. He might as well stay as shiori(""female"" version of the mc when he crossdresses), maybe he\'d actually be useful and have some powers to back his bullsh*t up if he was a female in this anime/novel, since, for some reason, only girls can fight here. Well, the mc will probably be able to use other spirits powers later on, but he shows no desire to learn how to do so even while knowing he has those powers and having used them before, although he does use them more and more often while trying to rush towards his own death in his attempt to sacrifice himself while knowing perfectly well he has no powers to do anything(but this self-sacrifice behavior obviously triggers the girls to power up and save him, wow, so damn bad I cringe at the mere idea). Pathetic mc. He\'s nice whenever combat or drama of any kind is involved. it doesn\'t fit in well with a story like this that doesn\'t have anything resembling a solid or serious plot/story.

This is definitely a character piece, although Kurumi gets very little screen time she is always a joy to watch, Miku managed to make me laugh which I didn't expect, the twins are excellent with my personal favourite, Yuzuru, getting lots of screen time. As for Tohka, well I can't fault her, she's brilliant.The story was a step down from the previous series but the animation is still just as consistent as ever.Overall enjoyable but the ending does drag a little, nevertheless RECOMMENDED. "", 'Overall, this is definitely the worst part of the Date A Live series. There’s a clear distinction between this piece of work and the works of the first two seasons. There was a clear lack of plot in this movie, and the titular character talks for about 10 minutes in the 1:15 movie. You’d have thought you’d have seen/heard more from the titular character right? Clearly Date A Live: Mayuri Judgement doesn’t think so.Plot: 2I’m not sure you can say this has a plot. The plot can likely be summarised in a single sentence, which doesn’t really make it a plot. 2/3 of the movie...is just basically a repeat of the rest of the series with the addition of a single character who.. oh wait.. doesn’t speak for pretty much the entire movie. So there’s not many positives to do with the plotArt: 7As usual, the art’s pretty good, probably since the whole anime is basically fanservice.Sound:6Nothing wrong in particular, but nothing great either.Character: 5There’s very little character development, and I can’t say much without spoiling, but the little character developments were okay-ish. It wasn’t really anything we hadn’t seen before in the first two seasons.Overall: 4There’s nothing great about this movie. Even if you’re watching just for the fanservice, I’m pretty sure you’ll be disappointed by how little there is compared to the rest of the series. So I don’t really recommend it for anyone. is just basically a repeat of the rest of the series with the addition of a single character who.. oh wait.. doesn’t speak for pretty much the entire movie.

So here is a short +- list for this movie and a little more.So. Dont get me wrong, Date A Live is one of these few harem anime that focuses a little more on romance instead of comedy (like for example D-Frag which heavily focuses on comedy). Besides that its one of these few harem anime that I really do love even if they might be...a little shallow and generic, because the anime was fairly well executed and the characters were lovely. So therefore I had some great hope in Mayuri Judgment, but this movie was a goddamn disappointment. Why it was disappointing? Well...:-it felt more like an OVA instead of a movie ( e.g.: only 2 minute long dates, only 1 minute long appearance of origami tobiichi, not much of a movie atmosphere/feeling, ONLY 10 minutes of the character which the movie was named after?!?!?!?)-because Date A Live is a more romance focused kind of harem anime, the missing romance is neck breaking for this anime!! while some kind of intimacy is shown between the spirits and the main character, it never goes beyond the good friends border! it simply felt like the producers were too hesistant to show the true deep bonds and feelings of the spirits to the main character to not upset the fans of each responding character. as a tradeoff the true needed intimacy is missing and the strong points of the anime just drop off-the namegiving character was just a freaking short cameo. like seriously, while having 10-15 seconds of screentime throughout the whole anime at some points, she only had like 10 minutes main screen time at the end of the anime which is really goddamn bad.-at the end of the movie the producers tried a bit too hard, to bring the feelings to the viewers which makes it a major disconnect to the story-scarce explanations which might possibly not clear up any confusion of the viewersall in all it felt like the producers were just too hesistant to make up a good anime. instead they put in all their money in the surface of the movie without providing much content. at least the surface had their good points though:-okayish music-good animations-nice character design of mayuri-REALLY shallow but bearable (average garbage)-while DEFINITELY not well executed, fair premise story i guess?-while she had not much screentime i guess they made mayuri fairly likable to the viewers? (At least I would have liked to see more of her but that might just be my bad taste speaking for me.)in conclusion what i really wanted to write for this review: garbagep.s.: im really struggling with the overall score because MAL says 5 is mediocre while 4 is decent but saying this movie decent is a decent amount too much praise. but 3 is poor and 3 is too hard while poor is a good word for this movie. so basically imma just rate it based on the score i would give out. a little shallow and generic, because the anime was fairly well executed and the characters were lovely.

But I just had to write it seeing that the other reviews right now are praising this pile of trash.As a Date A Live fan, this was a movie I was patiently waiting for for over a year now, and I finally got to watch it yesterday. Now I want my time and money back.STORY - 2Date A Live so far has been: girl appears, Shidou intervenes, Shidou and said girl's relationship develops, girl's powers are sealed, repeat. This was a formula that has actually worked so far in the series...and it was actually quite enjoyable to watch. But despite the name of the movie being Mayuri Judgement, only the last twenty minutes or so of the movie was actually dedicated to Mayuri. The first half of the movie involved going on dates one by one with every girl other than Mayuri, and throughout the movie it felt as though Mayuri was just a background character in what was supposed to be a story arc dedicated to her. Not only this, the vast majority of the movie was fanservice catering to fans of the series and also included many scenes which only serve to remind you of events that occurred in the two seasons of the anime. In the twenty minutes or so of actual plot, everything happens so suddenly that you can't make any sense of why any of this is going on in the first place. Not only that, the story of this movie is completely ignorable and it was written in such a way that it has no significance to the actual story of the series as a whole. It felt like it was merely an extended spin-off OVA. What you'd expect from a theatrical movie release is completely non-existent here.ART - 5The low budget of the movie is easily shown by the art and visuals of the movie. While the transformation sequences looked pretty nice and the CG in the final battle was top notch, everything else looked below subpar.SOUND - 9I would give this a 10 if not for the absolutely horrid song in the beginning of the movie. The background music is lovely and as expected from Date A Live and fits very well in context to what is going on at the time. I've been listening to the soundtrack pretty much all day since I watched the movie. The ending song Invisible Date is absolutely wonderful.CHARACTER - 5The main girl of the movie (Mayuri, as it was SUPPOSED to be), barely got any screen time at all. The character development between Shidou and her and also her character could have been fleshed out in the 72 minutes that the movie ran for but since she only actually spoke to Shidou in the last 20 minutes or so, it felt extremely forced and rushed, and her character ended up being pretty much a blank canvas with a bunch of words quickly written over it. As for the other characters, we have the same old characters from the anime so it's pretty self-explanatory.ENJOYMENT - 6There were some pretty enjoyable and really funny scenes throughout the movie, not going to lie. The entire ordeal of Shiori was absolutely hilarious. But everything that was supposed to be relevant to the plot was terrbily done. I'd give it a 3 or 4 if not for the enjoyable comedy in this movie.OVERALL - 5 (rounded down from 5.4)Honestly, I'm probably just salty over how it's called MAYURI Judgement but I got anything but Mayuri. Here's hoping it was just a quick cash grab for a proper season three. and it was actually quite enjoyable to watch. But despite the name of the movie being Mayuri Judgement, only the last twenty minutes or so of the movie was actually dedicated to Mayuri. The first half of the movie involved going on dates one by one with every girl other than Mayuri, and throughout the movie it felt as though Mayuri was just a background character in what was supposed to be a story arc dedicated to her.

Not only that, the story of this movie is completely ignorable and it was written in such a way that it has no significance to the actual story of the series as a whole. It felt like it was merely an extended spin-off OVA. What you'd expect from a theatrical movie release is completely non-existent here.ART - 5The low budget of the movie is easily shown by the art and visuals of the movie. While the transformation sequences looked pretty nice and the CG in the final battle was top notch, everything else looked below subpar.SOUND - 9I would give this a 10 if not for the absolutely horrid song in the beginning of the movie. The background music is lovely and as expected from Date A Live and fits very well in context to what is going on at the time. I've been listening to the soundtrack pretty much all day since I watched the movie. The ending song Invisible Date is absolutely wonderful.CHARACTER - 5The main girl of the movie (Mayuri, as it was SUPPOSED to be), barely got any screen time at all. The character development between Shidou and her and also her character could have been fleshed out in the 72 minutes that the movie ran for but since she only actually spoke to Shidou in the last 20 minutes or so, it felt extremely forced and rushed, and her character ended up being pretty much a blank canvas with a bunch of words quickly written over it. As for the other characters, we have the same old characters from the anime so it's pretty self-explanatory.ENJOYMENT - 6There were some pretty enjoyable and really funny scenes throughout the movie, not going to lie. The entire ordeal of Shiori was absolutely hilarious. But everything that was supposed to be relevant to the plot was terrbily done. I'd give it a 3 or 4 if not for the enjoyable comedy in this movie.OVERALL - 5 (rounded down from 5.4)Honestly, I'm probably just salty over how it's called MAYURI Judgement but I got anything but Mayuri. Here's hoping it was just a quick cash grab for a proper season three."", ""When it comes to anime movies, content within them is usually something of an issue.  Due to constrained time windows, anime movies have to be able to eloquently tell a story in full if they want to be successful.  Likewise, when it comes to movies that are based off of series' that are well known, keeping the theme and feel of that series while also telling a story also comes off as part of the list of issues that has to be taken into consideration.  (Then there're those recap movies, and we are not going to talk about those ones.)  So,...an original story for the Date a Live series, is Mayuri Judgment.Story:  Back in the world of DAL, we are thrusted back to Tenguu City, the place where our main protagonist of the DAL series, Shidou is given yet another dilemma regarding Spirits, otherworldly spirits that bear the power of angels and, through the magic of harem anime, can only be sealed and defeated peacefully with the power of a kiss.  Now, with the looming threat of a gigantic sphere in the sky looming over the city in a crater he calls home, he must once again go on a date with all of the girls that he has previously conquered in order to avert the ball of energy that rises high in the sky.  (Trust me, it makes a lot more sense in the movie than it does here.)Like its parent story, Mayuri Judgment has what I can only describe as the same story basis as the rest of the series up to this point (Meaning, seasons 1 and 2, or everything up to Miku Truth, if you're reading the LN.)  which is a lot of dates.  Hey, it ain't called Date a Live for nothing.  As the movie is practically all dates for the entire hour and twelve minutes that this movie is, the movie comes equipped with its own doubled edged sword.Since the entire series is basically just dates with the main girls of the series, anything that really has anything to do with Mayuri, the title spirit of this particular movie, is really next to nothing.  And that's really the biggest kicker.  Because the movie is set up in a way where her importance only really comes in later, anything that has to do with her really has no weight on the movie as a whole.  You don't really get much if any quality time with her and it really kicks the idea of having a movie based around her, even if the explanation given does make sense in context to the series.On the flipside, since the show focuses on the dates with six of the main girls in the series, a lot of character refreshment or moments really shine through.  With each date, the personality of each girl featured shines through and gives each of them a little bit of time devoted to them.  Each date is reflective of each girl's personality complete with their own individual quirks and is honestly just a nice refresher for getting back into the series.  Plus, you get a really nice fight scene at the end with all of those wonderful, wonderful character designs.In the end, DAL Mayuri Judgment is a double edged blade to itself.  It doesn't feature the title girl of the series all that much within its entire runtime, leading to a rather rushed and somewhat cliched end.  Yet, even so, what we do get is return characterization, showing us most of the girls one by one on who they are, what their quirks are, and what this series has to offer.Overview:+ Refresher to the series+ Dedicated moments for the majority of the returning cast-  Barely features or devotes time to the title character-  Rushed and unsatisfactory endCharacters:  Honestly, there really isn't much to say about the characters.  All but Mayuri are returning cast members so there really isn't much to say about them.  As I have stated before, most of the 'harem members' of the series (i.e. Tohka, Kaguya, Yuzuru, Miku, Kotori, and Yoshino) have devoted time to them since they all go on a date with Shidou individually.And then we have the real kicker, Mayuri.  Mayuri herself is someone who appears 17 times in the movie before saying her first goddamn line.  (I counted; I know this to be true.)  There really isn't much to her character than to be a plot device.  There isn't much characterization about her (if any) and just feels flat.  There honestly isn't much to say about her simply because everyone only meets her for about 10-20 minutes at what is basically the end of the whole movie, and that's during the epic fight scene.Overview:+ Return of the old cast in good form+ Focused moments for the girls of the series-  Zero characterization on the title characterArt: Like its previous iterations, Mayuri Judgment was produced by Production IMS.  Coming with that studio comes along the beautiful artwork for the Date a Live series.  Complete with all of the beautiful and well designed Astral Dresses and well produced art, Date a Live never ceases to bring forth consistent quality and visuals.In addition, for this movie in particular, IMS created a CGI monstrosity known as Cherubim, and, despite my usage of the word 'monstrosity', it's actually rather nicely made.  Despite being made from CG, Cherubim fits with what is going on with the scenes that it's in and showcases just how stunning this series can look when it wants to.  (Oh yeah, and Tohka gets a new design, and it's really nice.)Overview:+ Good, consistent art+ CGI thing looks and fits well with what is going onSound: When it comes to DAL, the soundtrack is an aesthetic that really shines for the series.  With previous seasons having songs sung by bands like Sweet Arms in addition to really nicely composed battle music, Mayuri Judgment brings a good chunk of those tracks back during sections of the movie.In addition, the movie introduces a new, original ED song for the credits called 'Invisible Date' sung by Sweet Arms.  Similar to the other OP/ED tracks of the series, this track bears in resemblance to them by having a majestic and overall nice tone to the song that is what I consider to be very memorable.  (And that's not just because I have listened to the song several dozen times.)Overview:+ Return of tracks from the series+  New track that holds up the standard for music in this seriesPersonal Enjoyment:  Alright, Date a Live is a series I really, really, really, really, really, really like.  Really.  It's a series that combines some of my favorite genres in anime complete with an intriguing story and nice aesthetics.  I could go on and on, so to shorten it, I like this series a lot, and seeing a movie for it, an original one might I add at the end of the second season made me squeal.  (Not really, but yeah...kinda.)Did I like this movie?Yep.  I enjoyed it.  The rushed end didn't bother me cause stuff like that is standard fare for this series (still not forgiving the 10 episode runtime of season 2) and honestly, because it's just more of Date a Live, I can't not say that I despised it.  Because the movie was basically just Date a Live in a nutshell, there really isn't much criticism based off of my personal feelings simply because that is what the series is about.What didn't I like about this movie?The biggest gripe is Mayuri.  You introduce a new character that's in the title of the movie, is supposed to play a main part in the movie, and it listed as a main character.  And ya don't use her.  See anything wrong here?Would I recommend this movie?Honestly, if you're as big as a DAL fan as I am and don't really give two shits about the flaws, then what are you still doing here reading this?  GO!  GO YOU FOOLS!  On the other hand, if you're someone who has watched DAL and isn't as gung-ho about the series, then watch it if you want to.  As mentioned before, it's basically DAL, it's got the same plotline, same characters, and is really just a refresher for the series before season 3.  (Which at the time of this review, I hope happens.) So really, this movie is just to service the fans of the show.  But when has that ever really been a bad thing, eh? an original story for the Date a Live series, is Mayuri Judgment.Story:  Back in the world of DAL, we are thrusted back to Tenguu City, the place where our main protagonist of the DAL series, Shidou is given yet another dilemma regarding Spirits, otherworldly spirits that bear the power of angels and, through the magic of harem anime, can only be sealed and defeated peacefully with the power of a kiss.

After catching up to season 4, this movie hits differently. I enjoyed how this movie was going for a story that reminisces what made the first season great. If your looking for more Date a Live after catching up with the anime, this movie is a must-watch.StorySolid, I enjoyed the date scenes as we get to see some funny moments in them. Also, I like how it built up to who Mayuri is. The more dates Shido...went on, the questions arose who is this Mayuri girl? Then you get to Shido and Mayuri finally in a conversation, the final battle begins, and man that was epic. It's such a simple plot but it works well for such a short-length film. I wish Mayuri got more screen time but it makes sense why she doesn't. I hope Mayuri returns in Date a Live but that seems unlikely.AnimationI love how they were going toward the season 1 animation to take viewers to the early days. It gave me nostalgia for when I started the show. Seeing this again was a breath of fresh air.Flaws: I wished the movie went into more backstory on Mayuri and Shido spending more time with her. Because she has such a cool design and I feel like she could have so much potential. At least the viewer has to imagine the characters will remember Mayuri in their hearts.

But after watching this movie, it seems so much smaller. Time for a review.We'll start with the pros. The art(8), as usual, is good like the rest of the Date A Live anime series. The sound(7) was mediocre for the movie, it wasn't the specialty of the movie or bad; just normal. That's closest to any praise I can give.Cons: The CHARACTERS(5). All the characters who weren't mains were normal. But, the character that the movie is literally named after(Mayuri) was barely featured until the end. All...she did was look at Shido and his girlfriends walk around until the end, which was almost as bad. Which brings us to the story(6). It's basically the same thing; they go on dates. For about 3/4 of the entire movie. The story weird and confusing to understand when it reaches the end of the movie, but before the ending 1/4 part kicks in, you have no clue why the movie is named Mayuri Judgement.

I've already watched the movie back in 2017 and I decided now would be a great time to give it another try. Does it still hold up? Well, let's hop on and find out.Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryThe movie, much like the previous 2 seasons, isn't that big on the story department. The basic story is about a large sphere composed of Spirit energy appearing above Tenguu City, requiring Shido to date the Spirits again in order to stabilize the sphere's energy and get it to disappear without trouble. Complicating matters is a...strange girl, Mayuri, who is connected to the sphere and follows Shido across his dates.The story is mostly a way to get the dates forwards, and that's where the movie's strength really lies. The story itself isn't bad, but it's not really one of the movie's strongest aspects, especially considering our next category. (6/10)CharactersOnce again, Date A Live proves its expertise at character exploration.

The movie is pretty good at getting you to care about the characters and making you forget about the big sphere floating around.Although she is the titular character, Mayuri doesn't really have a speaking role till the climax.

I get it, the movie has to keep the focus on the Spirits and extending Origami's role would affect the movie's runtime, but it would have been nice if the movie had found a creative way of getting her involved other than just causing trouble in Shido's date with Tohka.Other than that little detail, the character writing in this movie is as amazing as ever.

THIS REVIEW WILL BE SPOILING A FEW KEY HAPPENINGS IN THE MOVIE*thank me laterAlright let\'s finish this up. If you are finding this wondering what I mean, I reviewed everything else in the series and will be giving an overall score for the series as a whole. The last one on the list was this movie. Which was a nice idea when you heard about it at the time but i wouldn\'t say the same thing afterwards. Either way let\'s get into better detail.Story: 6So by name alone you would think there is a new character that is going to do some judging. Except...that isn\'t what it feels like the whole time you watch. For one thing the story is mostly taken up by the main character, Shido, going on dates with all the girls he has collected through seasons 1 and 2. The reason why isn\'t even about said new character, Mayuri, and her judgement. It was just the first thing they could think of to figure out a strange happening. In fact, the judgement part doesn\'t even preform properly or is even explained. It sort of goes, ""I\'m here to judge you."" ""But why are you here to judge me?"" ""Because it\'s time for you to be judged."". Really? That\'s it? The few good things about the story is the it takes place sometime after the ending of season two so it gives the fans more time to enjoy the characters. You even get to know a bit more about some of the new girls from season 2 since each didn\'t get to have time to flush themselves out. So there is that. Wait a minute. It says here that the story is completely original and is not canon to the rest of the story. Well then fuck all the previously mentioned positives, since they don\'t matter. The ending kind just happens too so it\'s a mess from start to finish.Art: 8A much more cheerful section since the artwork was the same from season 1, quality wise. It does dip into season 2 quality towards the end but even that was still good. Fight scenes are also pretty good and well done..... Too bad there is only the one.Sound: 9Bringing back tracks from seasons 1 while including original pieces. One thing I say about this series is that its OST is always amazing in terms of quality. Voice acting hasn\'t changed either. Unfortunately for you dubbed fans though, this movie was never licensed out for an english dub so the sub version will have to satisfy. Or not, there is already enough wrong destribed.Character: 7Another reason people enjoy this show is because the characters are very likeable. And maybe that was the focus here but then the title should of been different. Like I said, the majority of this movie is Shido going on dates with all the girls. So you get to enjoy the interactions between all the characters like you always have and even get to see the season 2 girls get some time in the date spotlight. But the girl you most likely will be wondering about is actually not the new girl, but Kurumi. Yes our fan favorite is here too, but unfortunately not as much as we would of wanted. She pops up four a total of four timesl, three of them as a background character.WHAT?!?! Like I said in the Encore OVA, her charcter is liked so much that crafting a simple side plot about her does better than the season it is connected too. So barely having her is a hinderance to the movie alone and hinderances is something it has already amassed. Origami shows up too, if only to be in the movie as well (I am not joking, we literally could of gone without any of her involvement). It is so brief that I couldn\'t properly think of a logical reason for it. Now you may be wondering about Mayuri. Well just like her judgement, she takes back seat for most of the movie but ops to appear in the background a lot. She literally doesn\'t speak till the last 15 minutes. Sad thing too, because I was expecting to have a movie revolving around HER FUCKING JUDGEMENT.Enjoyment: 7As shocking as it may be to see a 7 for this section, I will admit that I enjoyed the dating part of the movie simply because it kept to what I feel is the charm of the show, humor. I will admit that I was laughing my way through to the end and at which time I sighed and felt dissappointed for the potential that was missed here. If this series ever gets a season 3 (please I need to answer a few more questions and the existance to a manga series is one of them) I have no doubt that they won;t have a hard time surpassing this.Overall: 6This bring the final series score to a solid 7/10. that isn\'t what it feels like the whole time you watch.

However, the movie was a letdown of sorts.Story 6/10The plot wasn't bad, considering they only had 60+ minutes to work with. However, the formula of going on dates happened throughout the first 2 seasons, causing this movie to have a rinse and repeat feel.Art 3/10The art was choppy and inconsistent. It felt cheap, a far cry from the quality art I've come to expect from Date a Live. To make things worse, the 3D sphere stuck out like a sore thumb compared to the 2D art.Sound 8/10The...instrumental pieces used were very good, timed in accordance to the various dramatic scenes, adding emphasis.Character 4/10There wasn't any substantial development throughout the movie and it failed to add depth to the characters.

I was engaged throughout and the foreshadowing piqued my interest.Overall 5/10It was disappointing movie and production felt rushed. However, it was still enjoyable and it had some good points.

The movie is so damn good!*my review verdict might be low but I love the series.Story - 4/10To be honest, there are nothing much to deliver from this movie. It's just simple slice of life of Shido with the girls. It's simple, yet beautiful and enjoyable to watch the characters together. The story of Mayuri is actually quite good, however the whole movie is more slice of life focused instead of having a strong story development. The story in the movie actually pretty short, however it's great.Premise - 5/10Usual Date A Live routine. Most of the...time in the movie are used for dating again, however as I said, it's enjoyable to watch the characters dating and having characterization. Aside from dating, the movie actually have its own messages to deliver from its story. The movie mentioned of human's existence aren't for the day to be ceased, however is to love people that close to you. In short, the movie is pretty fine.Character - 6/10No doubt, characters in Date A Live are lovely. However, I still feel bad for Date A Live Season II for being a trainwreck. Still, characters from Date A Live Season II able to get more screentime in this movie and have more character development. Back in Season II, characters like Yamai Sisters & Miku were only introduced instead going into detail on their characters and personality. The movie did well in bringing up the cast and show more of them to the audience. Also, new character Mayuri is actually fine, despite being just a plot device for the whole movie. Still, this movie having too less of Kurumi & Origami, which kinda disappointed me. But well, remember that all girls in Date A Live are good, even Shidou himself. :^)Art - 5/10Production IMS, I didn't expect much from them. But well, the animation in the movie obviously is better than those in Season 2. (Season 2 is really horrible aside from its enjoyable story. The animation, characters, basically everything were bad in S2) At least the studio didn't designed all the girls look horrible. All the girls in the movie are pretty and lovely.Music - 7/10As usual, the soundtracks in Date A Live are great and matched every moment pretty well, especially all those heartwarming moments. sweet ARMS's theme songs gave me a lot of nostalgia of how much I loved the series.Enjoyment - 8/10It's really enjoyable throughout the movie. Every single moment, every interaction between characters, every word come out from the characters, never bored me. The movie really an enjoyable one. I really like the movie until the level that 1-hour isn't enough at all for the presentation of the movie. I freaking want more!Overall - 6/10Clearly, the entire movie is a movie for fans of the franchise. If you aren't a Date A Live fan, this movie clearly isn't a good one for you.I have been a Date A Live fan for years, so wouldn't be surprise I like the movie that much. I wouldn't say the series is a great one, but clearly Date A Live is one of the best for harem romance genre.

As such, it’s something that can’t have any sort of long term affect on plot which results in it having to operate within a pretty large number of constraints. Still, it does a pretty good job within those constraints wherein while there isn’t any development or progress, it still manages to play on it’s strengths in regards to the characters and action to be a pretty great film.The...first two-thirds or so of the film is Shido going on a series of dates with all of the spirits he’s sealed so far: Kaguya, Miku, Yoshino, Yuzuru, Kotori, and then Tohka. These dates are a bit different from those that have occurred in the main series, wherein while in the main series Shido is wearing an ear piece and receiving directions and support from a major organization, here Shido is handling things on his own. In the main series, said support is generally required as the dates end up getting pulled into all sorts of crazy situations. Here however, they flow pretty much how the participants intend for them to without anything too extreme happening. Thus, they aren’t anywhere near as purely funny as the dates in the main series, though there is a decent amount of comedy, but they’re a lot more relaxing and comfy. Actually going on proper dates allows the film to show off the differences between the heroines pretty well, as well as their differences in chemistry with Shido. Enjoying this relies heavily on the viewer already having built up investment in the cast, but at least for me I felt that this was worthwhile and pretty enjoyable to watch. As a random note, I didn’t like Miku much in the previous season so wasn’t expecting to care much for her here either, but am beginning to grow fond of how she’s changed as shown in the film. Also, while the focus is on the spirits he goes on dates with, the other main characters Kurumi, Origami, and Mana all show up, though they don’t have that much presence.In the last third of the film things get more intense. A larger overarching plot is revealed along with a new character, though the plot and their character arc are then quickly wrapped up. It is a filler film and it’s clear that nothing from it is going to carry over into the main series. Doing a film within those constraints well would either require focusing entirely on the new subject matter and characters as that’s the only way it’d be possible to do them justice, or to accept that the new character simply won’t get enough and focus on the old and canon. This film chose to go with focusing on the characters from the main series, which is a fair enough choice and worked very well with the earlier portions of the film, though it makes the final portion’s plot feel kind of weak. To make up for that, the action in this portion get’s really intense and though it doesn’t get all that complicated or deep, it gets the coolest it’s ever been in the series I’d say with Tohka suddenly getting an awesome new form that it’s disappointing we’ll likely never see again. I won’t say it’s enough to completely override the weakness in the plot of the ending, but it is enough to significantly minimize it, and ultimately it feels like it ends on a solid enough note.The art and animation are solid enough and I think better than the second season, though not by all that much. The OP is a concert by Miku which is solid enough as her voice actress is a pretty good singer. The ED was scrolling white text on a black screen as is standard for films with a song that was pretty good. The soundtrack was decent enough but not particularly memorable. The best track in the franchise, Kurumi’s battle theme Rhapsody Rage, was not present. first two-thirds or so of the film is Shido going on a series of dates with all of the spirits he’s sealed so far: Kaguya, Miku, Yoshino, Yuzuru, Kotori, and then Tohka.

The story is an absolute tour de force, weaving together complex themes of love, fate, and the nature of reality itself in a way that will leave you breathless. The two to three main characters are simply unforgettable, with their nuanced personalities and intricate relationships driving the narrative forward with the force of a freight train.And let's talk about the music. Oh, the music! It's a symphony of sound that will take you on an emotional journey you'll never forget. From the hauntingly...beautiful melodies to the heart-pumping beats, it's a true feast for the ears.As for my enjoyment experience... well, let's just say I spent the entire movie on the edge of my seat, completely enthralled by the stunning visuals and expertly crafted storytelling. It was an experience like no other, and I can't recommend it enough.But honestly, who am I kidding? This anime is a steaming pile of garbage. The story is a convoluted mess, the characters are paper-thin and forgettable, the music is forgettable at best and grating at worst, and the entire thing feels like a cheap cash-grab aimed at gullible otaku with more money than sense. Save your time and your money, and avoid this hot mess like the plague.--------------------------------------Nah, bagaimana saya harus memulai untuk membahas film masterpiece yang disebut Date A Live Movie: Mayuri Judgment ini? Ceritanya luar biasa dan kompleks, menggabungkan tema-tema cinta, takdir, dan sifat realitas itu sendiri dengan cara yang akan membuat Anda terpukau. Dua atau tiga karakter utama yang ada sangatlah tak terlupakan, dengan kepribadian mereka yang rumit dan hubungan yang rumit mendorong narasi maju dengan kekuatan kereta barang.Dan mari kita bicara tentang musiknya.

It was an experience like no other, and I can't recommend it enough.But honestly, who am I kidding? This anime is a steaming pile of garbage. The story is a convoluted mess, the characters are paper-thin and forgettable, the music is forgettable at best and grating at worst, and the entire thing feels like a cheap cash-grab aimed at gullible otaku with more money than sense.

Doraemon Movie 12: Nobita no Dorabian Nights,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2670/Doraemon_Movie_12__Nobita_no_Dorabian_Nights,"['My overall take: Not one of my favorite Doraemon movies, story takes major leaps in logic to work.In this movie, Nobita\'s friend Shizuka gets literally lost inside an Arabian Nights story, so the others have to rescue her. I\'ve never particularly liked this one. Reducing Shizuka\'s main narrative importance to ""damsel in distress"" is already not a winning premise, though this is at least not used as an excuse to sacrifice her characterization. Indeed, she responds to her situation with far more resourcefulness and composure than any 10-year-old should be expected to. (And her situation gets pretty dark, including her being marketed as a slave!)There...are other glaring flaws with the story, however. To start off, Shizuka is trapped inside the story from a physical book, which ends up getting burned, preventing the others from going back in themselves. Doraemon suggests that because Arabian Nights has characters inspired by real-world figures, it\'s possible that they\'ll be able to find Shizuka if they travel to 8th-Century Baghdad by Time Machine. This sounds like a big stretch, but it somehow works. (Uh, what about time-traveling to before the book was destroyed and retrieving the actual book...?) Not only that, but once the protagonists are in Baghdad, their entire search for Shizuka is founded on a series of vague hunches, visions in dreams, and rumors from unreliable sources. It\'s frankly miraculous that they eventually locate her at all.Did I like anything about this movie? Well, the story moves at a brisk pace (if occasionally too brisk), so it\'s certainly not boring. Seeing Gian\'s protectiveness surface when Nobita gets heatstroke was nice. On the whole though, I have to say that Doraemon movies go, this is not one I rate highly. are other glaring flaws with the story, however.

Doraemon Movie 38: Nobita no Takarajima,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35740/Doraemon_Movie_38__Nobita_no_Takarajima,"[""As Nobita hears a pirate story, he dreams of going hunting for treasure himself and using Doraemon's gadgets he surprisingly discovers some undiscovered treasure. The treasure was located on a newly formed island of rock outside of Japan but as they make their way there, they are attacked by a group of time travelling pirates and Shizuka is kidnapped. Now they must rescue her from these mysterious assailants.A new original movie for 2018 even though the pattern's been remake of an old movie followed by an original. Interestingly enough, Genki Kawamura was responsible for the screenplay - he was one of the producers for Your...Name and also The Boy and The Beast.As usual the art is good and this was actually quite a good action comedy. Shizuka gets a lot more screen time than she usually does. They added in a bunch of little riddles in for fun too and movie doesn't forget to empthasise on protecting Earth and its environment as its been with previous movies.Worth a watch for Doraemon fans.

In general, I think this one is pretty good. Gian and Suneo get to do something cool. The Mini Doras have a lot of screentime, which is usually a plus. Quiz the robot parrot, who speaks in riddles, is a fun character.However, I have one major issue with this movie: the fact that about half of it...is taken up by an overdone ""Shizuka gets kidnapped"" subplot. Relative to the amount of time spent on it, this may be the most poorly executed arc of its kind in the Doraemon movies so far. First of all, the reason given for why Shizuka gets kidnapped is frankly very silly. It\'s because the pirates mistake her for their captain\'s daughter, Sarah, who supposedly looks a lot like Shizuka... except the two of them have completely different hair and eye colors. Both this and the fact that Shizuka doesn\'t seem to know any of her kidnappers should have tipped the pirates off to their mistake, but they never properly catch on. Furthermore, when we meet Sarah herself, there\'s absolutely no indication that she has a history of getting lost or running away, making it even more of a stretch for these pirates to immediately assume that she was the same person as this frightened, dark-haired girl that they encountered on a random ship. (One pirate does point out the hair color discrepancy, only to be hastily brushed aside.)In addition, to facilitate this kidnapping, the filmmakers invoke Shizuka\'s disappearing weapon. Right before she is captured, the protagonists are engaged in heated combat against the pirates that have boarded their ship, during which everyone, including Shizuka, is clearly wielding a weapon. We even see Shizuka use hers (the Reversal Cape, to be specific). Yet in the scene where she gets kidnapped, she is suddenly left defenseless on the deck, with no explanation for what happened to her gadget.Okay, let\'s pretend that the reasoning for and circumstances around the kidnapping do make sense. It could at least serve an important narrative purpose, right? Maybe it motivates the other main characters to go after the pirates, starting a new chapter in their adventure... Well, it does, but this turns out to be unnecessary. Shortly after Shizuka is kidnapped, the protagonists rescue a boy lost at sea, who turns out to be Sarah\'s brother, Flock. Having left the pirate crew himself, Flock also hopes to give his sister a chance to escape. That alone probably would have provided more than enough reason for the main characters to help track down the pirates, as it\'s unlikely (at least in the movies) that Nobita and his friends would turn down the chance to help another kid who is in need.All right, but maybe Shizuka could make some valuable contributions by being among the pirates. Perhaps her bonding with Sarah becomes significant— Hmm, not really. Sarah is pretty much on the same page as her brother from the beginning. Well then, maybe Shizuka can use an outsider\'s perspective to help convince the main antagonist not to follow through with his plan— Uh, nope, that doesn\'t happen either. There\'s even a scene where she is the only one present in the same room as the main antagonist, but nothing of that sort plays out. The most plot-relevant thing Shizuka does in this movie (helping Nobita save Doraemon from being trapped inside an energy ball) occurs after she is already reunited with the others, so I am really struggling to see the point of the kidnapping subplot here.To end on a positive note, I do like this movie\'s ending song. It has an unusual style for a Doraemon song, but it\'s got character, and I don\'t hate that it\'s become the current opening theme for the regular Doraemon anime series. is taken up by an overdone ""Shizuka gets kidnapped"" subplot.

To understand what I mean, this episode is filled with firm images rather than good animations.

Fuuto Tantei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48649/Fuuto_Tantei,"[""tl;dr if you like KR W you will love this, if you haven't seen KR W then I HIGHLY recommend watching that firstAre you a fan of Kamen Rider W? Are you itching for more of it? If the answer to even one of those questions is yes, then this anime is for you. It's essentially an all-new story that is set after the original series, featuring the cast you know and love.But first, for those who are unfamiliar with Kamen Rider W: I highly, highly suggest watching it first before you go into this. The anime just assumes that you've seen all 49...episodes and 2 movies of the original series from start to finish, so it does a little amount of effort in refreshing your memory. Some major things are just straight-up unexplained because they've already been touched upon in the tokusatsu, and there are a lot of plot developments and character motivations that will go over your head if you haven't seen the original series at all. Certain scenes also lack emotional impact if you don't fully know the context behind them. Obviously, you're still free to try if you want—the chief producer has said that the anime is indeed made with newcomers in mind, but from what I have seen so far, it feels like the opposite. I imagine the anime will be so much less fun and more puzzling/confusing if you go in blind.That said, if you're already a fan of Kamen Rider W or at least have fond memories of watching it, then you will love this anime. Fuuto PI is both a sequel and a love letter to the original W with a ton of neat little callbacks and references to its tokusatsu predecessor. The story is just what you'd expect from W: A thrilling supernatural mystery with some occasional light-hearted moments. It takes place in good ol' Fuuto, and the anime makes use of it really well. Many characters from the original series, no matter how minor, make appearances here and there in the story. A lot of iconic sets are featured as well, such as the Narumi Detective Agency which has been unfortunately demolished in real life. Both of these things combined make the windy city feel alive and familiar, almost like returning to an old home.Henshin effects are also recreated in a much more flashy fashion than in the live-action, but the anime keeps certain trademark sound effects to remind you that you are still watching the same Kamen Rider you know and love. Some of the music is basically even just 1:1 renditions of the original series' soundtrack and it WILL hit you in the nostalgia bones.It's based on a tokusatsu series, after all, so action-wise, the anime will not leave you wanting. The animation is solid, smooth, and slick—and thanks to it, we get the kind of action that just isn't possible in a weekly live-action drama medium. Dynamic fast-paced fight sequences, bike chase scenes with no regard to Japanese traffic safety laws, et cetera.The only downside I can think of is that the voice actors might take a little while to get used to. The seiyuus do a fine job in bringing the characters to life, but it's going to feel a little jarring compared to the original at first. Just don't go in here expecting to hear Renn Kiriyama and Masaki Suda.(But at least the ED song is sung by the actors of Eternal and Skull, and it SLAPS.)Overall, it's a good, enjoyable anime—just one that is geared toward a very specific audience.

This is a review of someone who went into Fuuto PI blind.Fuuto PI is the story of two private investigators protecting the city of Fuuto from scum and villainy. On the service Shoutarou and his partner Philip are detectives, but when Gaia Memories are involved -a USB memory stick-like devices that turn people into monsters called Dopants- they combine (literally) into the left and right halves of the cities...hero, Kamen Rider W. Using the Gaia Memories for justice the two of them set out to rid the city of Dopants and uncover the mysteries behind Shadow Fuuto and the true identity of their smoking hot assistant and literal simp magnet, Tokime.Now if you’re like me and went into the first episode without any prior knowledge or context of Kamen Rider W then you’ll probably spend most of your time being very confused.It feels like the show was made for those with prior knowledge in mind and it will not hold the hands of newcomers to help get them up to speed. That’s unfortunate, however, once you start to get accustomed to the admittedly bizarre and sometimes confusing world building the show is strong enough to carry itself as its own wacky superhero thing.This is thanks to its strong story direction, the loveably quirky cast of the Narumi Detective Agency, the fun side characters and deliciously over-the-top villains as well as its stunningly good-looking art and animation. Studio Kai did a fantastic job capturing the LA Noire mood of the city along with the amazing OST, bringing the characters to life without compromising the manga’s original art style. The members of the Narumi Detective Agency are all odd in their ways, but together they have great character chemistry and the great voice acting helps brings out the show's great sense of humour.The dopant's designs are all very weird and unique with interest powers such as controlling bugs, becoming nuclear reactors and just literally the power of being drunk, and it’s fun to watch the team fight them whilst uncovering the cases around them.I enjoyed “Fuuto PI”. Unfortunately, the lack of context about its world-building and characters will hamper some viewer's enjoyment at the beginning, and there is a villain who shows off how evil he is by making Tokime take off her clothes which yes, only happens once, but it was very jarring and it is always a classless and tacky writing trick to create tension. However, the more you watch the more the context blanks get filled in and by episode 12 the story feels much more fulfilling. Also, I don’t know any other show where a man's superpower is to turn in a motorbike and that's awesome.Also, I 100% simp for Tokime and the animators clearly do too… and so will you after you’ve watched Fuuto PI.7/10 Good. hero, Kamen Rider W.

Its got the dark, enthralling story, the classic Henshin sequence, Monstrous bad guys, the ""Balls to...the wall"" Explosive(literally) Fight scenes, and last but not least amazing soundtrack. This anime\'s biggest failure is that it isn\'t running for 50 episodes that has a spinoff movie before that final few episodes. Literally everything about this is Kamen Rider take is amazing.

(as in Private Investigator). After reading that you may be thinking to yourself, ""This reviewer clearly won\'t be able to provide an accurate analysis of this series that will sway my intent to watch it or not"". If you are thinking that, that\'s cool by me. I also believe that I have some interesting insight that is worth reading on about.Disclaimer:...I have not read the manga at the time of writing this review.When the Fuuto Tantei anime was announced I had already watched a handful of Kamen Rider series, but had never sat down and watched Kamen Rider W. I did that in the span of about two or three weeks leading up to the release of this anime. I say this to show that I had W fresh in my mind as I watched Fuuto Tantei.This series serves as a faithful follow-up to Kamen Rider W in it\'s themes, plotting, and overall aesthetic. The season is split into mostly stand-alone cases that relate to an overarching plot. Mysteries are presented to our heroes, there are cool-designed monsters that our detectives encounter in the pursuit of solving these mysteries, and they transform into Kamen Rider W together to defeat them. All of our favorite characters from W are back with their catchphrases and quirks. I really appreciate how their development continues to be fleshed out beyond the narrative of W. The new characters are intriguing, but didn\'t have enough time in the season to really get any serious depth. While Kamen Rider W is definitely a kid\'s show aimed to sell toys, this anime is not (even though I would love some figures of the new dopants). There are many dark moments and implications that are much more obvious than what was presented in W.The animation is fantastic, especially during battle sequences. In W the fight scenes were limited by stunt choreography and special effects of the time, so the fights scenes are lot more exciting and fluid when not bound by live-action filming. A lot of the backgrounds are dark, so the vibrant colors really pop. When it comes to the women in the show (excluding Akiko), there\'s a significant amount of fan service. Not my cup of tea, so take that as you will.I enjoyed this show for what is was, it wasn\'t mind-blowing but I had fun with it. I look forward to Season 2 and I hope that reception from this release encourages Toei to localize more Kamen Rider content to the West. I also hope this show encourages new fans of Kamen Rider to check out other entries in the franchise.Now, count up your sins! and watch Fuuto Tantei!Thanks for reading!

It's also interesting that now its doing 3 episodes this time instead of 2 episodes on the whole cases which is not bad since it will pull out a plot twist that someone else is involve in the crime scene and stuff but man does the action look so good!!! Even the transformation sequence is legit insane!Would I say I...recommend this anime? Yes and No!Reason being is because this is a sequal to the live action series Kamen Rider W. So if you watch the show already then yes you can watch this anime causes if you don't you're just gonna be hit with alot of question and confusion on what's going on.

It takes place after the series finale (along with the movies) of Kamen Rider W. It\'s a pseudo-sequel of that beloved series. To answer the short question of ""Do I have to watch Kamen Rider W to watch this?"" the answer would be no. This 12-episode anime made it so that the characters are reintroduced properly so that old fans and new watchers will appreciate them and the plot at hand. There are certain callbacks and references to the plot in Kamen Rider W but most of it is just subtle...or non-relevant to the plot. This anime also introduced us to Tokime which is a stand-in for watchers not familiar with Kamen Rider W by showing her reactions to things like the transformations, the relationships between characters, and more. Overall, the characters have great chemistry and the anime managed to adapt the dynamic of the original cast very faithfully to its source. As expected from a Kamen Rider-related media, the plot is mostly episodic and it changes from episode to episode but there\'s an overarching plot linking these random cases to the antagonist of the series.The only bad thing about this series is that there\'s not a lot of action scenes and it doesn\'t justify the excitement you feel when you watch Kamen Rider W. On the contrary, this anime did justice to Kamen Rider W\'s transformation and riding (the bike) scenes; ironically enough, the original Kamen Rider W didn\'t really give a lot of badass motorcycle scenes unlike this anime.I highly recommend watching Kamen Rider W after this one not only because it gives context to the characters, but because the original series is really interesting even if you\'re not a fan of tokusatsu in general. or non-relevant to the plot.

It really was enjoyable.Things started to get rather boring and tripe writing, the writing just took a huge dive into the swimming pool.The story is surprisingly interesting. it had a really interesting premise of Phillip and his partner, Shotaro.

The 2nd half had been boring though. It lost it\'s sparkling charm that stood out of all of the outstanding voice acting, good animation, and a banger of a song. Another issue would be fanservice, because Tokime\'s Melons would literally be shown in the middle of a fight.The characters are really likable. Specifically Phillip. He\'s pretty much the character that\'s all smart, and he has this special charm to him. Shotaro was pretty unlikable at the start, but he came out to become a character I liked too.The animation was good. But not outstanding. There was CG and weird looking motorcycles, and the art could look pretty unpleasant at times. Other than that, awesome fights.I would say the same for the sound. It\'s the same old sound effects, nothing interesting. It fit wells with whatever\'s happening, just like the music.

However, if you're not, I would be hesitant. As someone who had no prior knowledge of Kamen Rider, I was totally in love with the first episode. It was stylish, the characters were intriguing, and things were kept fairly serious. However, the second episode quickly changed things up by adding the Kamen Rider elements of transforming into the hero with different cartridges that gave different powers. While I could see this being fun, this isn't what I was hoping for in this show, and it didn't seem to match with...the more serious detective stuff. If you do try this show out, know that the first episode is fairly misleading and not very representative of the rest of the show.

I don't know anything about Kamen Rider culture in general, but the idea of two dudes being genius Power-Ranger-detectives is slightly-outlandish-but-entertaining, if nothing else.I was immediately drawn into this show because of the amazingly jazzy soundtrack, complete with badass sax riffs and an incredible ED (including the visuals!). The animation and art style are also pretty interesting because of the constant transformations that have to do with their Kamen Rider identities. The voice actor (Tachiki Fumihiko) behind the transformation sound effect deserves...a raise because anyone else sure as hell wouldn't be able to make a USB stick sound badass. Barring this though, I don't know if there is much else to be seen here.Frame and sound reuse seems to be weirdly pervasive in the work, despite all of the creative style oozing from the show. The same battle track seems to play for a good 50% of serious fights, and reused visuals (and SFX) during transformations are fairly evident.On the whole, the story starts off as an incredibly immersive mystery, complete with a red herring and a satisfying conclusion (and a hot girl-).

WHat makes this feature so great is it is just so enjoyable to watch. you can see this many times and it will not get old.  Broly is a great villain.  He is the very definition of what a super sayin should be. powerful, destructive and completely psychotic.  Broly stops at nothing to defeat Goku and his friends.  The story line is also very enjoyable   overall this...is a truly great DBZ feature that any anime fan can enjoy is a truly great DBZ feature that any anime fan can enjoy', ""Welcome to the complete and utter letdown that is Broly. For a non-canonical character, Broly receives a massive amount of praise. People often cite this movie to be the best DBZ film. Not only is Broly not the best DBZ film, Broly is just plain bad.I don't have nostalgia for DBZ. If you do feel free to put your hands over your ears and exit the review. I first watched DBZ (as well as the original Dragon Ball) in 2015. I loved Dragon Ball and DBZ was great as well, albeit with a lot of faults. So I do enjoy the series a lot.The main...issue with the movie is Broly. Broly represents everything that was creatively wrong in DBZ. He shows up and is completely invincible until time is running out on the feature. Most of this movie is the Dragon Ball Z trope of Goku and friends getting their butts kicked until (literally) the final 5 minutes of the movie. It's not even a back and forth affair. For some this makes Broly a cool bad ass. For the rest of us, we see it for what it is. It's the same played out lazy fight scene Dragon Ball Z thrived on, except this time it monopolizes a feature length film.Broly's backstory isn't special either. I am certainly glad they explained how another Saiyan is wondering around, but that doesn't make it intriguing. I think the movie wanted you to feel for him a bit, but then it switches back to Broly in the present time acting what I would describe as foolish and you feel nothing. Broly has nothing interesting about him. He is just a goofy monster.Should you watch this movie? Of course. It's part of DBZ history. A lot of people love it and you need to at least give it a watch.

Broly is a fearless monster with no fellings at all, the true essence of any saiya-jin warrior. As the story goes, Goku gets to fight against him and, in my opinion, this was one of his toughest battles, since Broly had unlimited power, besides being a lot stronger.As in many other battles, Goku doesn't give up, even after taking serious damage. He brings hope to everyone when everything seems lost and keeps fighting,...even if it costs his own life.I don't recall watching any of Broly's movies when I was a kid, so this was really worth of my time. Seeing him for the first time was incredible and I can't wait to watch his other movies. even if it costs his own life.I don't recall watching any of Broly's movies when I was a kid, so this was really worth of my time. Seeing him for the first time was incredible and I can't wait to watch his other movies."", 'Dragon Ball Z Movie 8 The legendary Super Saiyan is the best Dragon Ball movie so far and the first Dragon Ball film with an actual movie length of 80 minutes giving the writers enough runtime to craft a fantastic story.The movie\'s premise is about Paragus, another Saiyan survivor, inviting Vegeta and his friends to Planet Neo Vegeta to rebuild what Saiyan\'s lost and with Vegeta finally becoming a king. Since Vegeta isn\'t interested, Paragus baits him with a warrior with immense power: The Legendary Super Saiyan who up to this point in the anime version was hyped as a warrior that appears once every...1000 years. Even at the beginning of the movie, the power of Broli was hyped up as even King Kai gets terrified enough to ask Goku for help.Before the real review starts, there is a big misconception about the movie and its lead villain Broli as many think he has no depth and has a lame backstory, mostly stemming from a fan parody by Team4Stars who seem to have a personal grudge against the character. But there is a reason why Broli was and is still as popular as he is since if he hadn\'t a personality or was a bland villain, he would be forgotten like Super 13 or Bojack. But instead, Broli spawned 4 total Dragon Ball movies and was popular enough to get 3 new incarnations of his character: Broly (from Dragon Ball Super movie Broly), female Broli (from Dragon Ball Super) and Bio Broli (from the Dragon Ball Z movie Bio Broli).These so called ""facts"" by the fans will be debunked in this review.This movie does a great job in redeeming the Super Saiyan form as in the anime it was claimed to be a form that appears once every 1000 years, but over the course of the series there are multiple characters to take the form. Not to mention, this suppose unbeatable form gets rendered useless in the face of some robots build by an army Goku destroyed when he was a kid. Basically, Super Saiyan was downgraded into a mere power up instead of a mystical form that appears in the time of need that can\'t be stopped. Thus the REAL Super Saiyan brings it back to its near undefeatable glory.Broli does what Broly (from DBS) does better backstory wise as his connection to Goku is build better since they were born the same day instead around the same time giving the concept of destiny being involved more believability. There are many symbolisms that can be drawn out by it and the movie plays with the idea of who and what the legendary Super Saiyan really is:- Broli has the power of the legendary Super Saiyan and is destined to destroy the universe. He embodies everything what Saiyans prior to DBS existing stand for but on a higher magnitude.- Goku has the spirit and potential of the legendary Super Saiyan and destined to save the universe. He embodies everything what Saiyans don\'t stand for, a warrior with a kind heart and got the benefit of being trained by various martial art masters.In other words, one rejected his Saiyan nature and the other fully embraced it. If anything, Broli is a perfect counterpart to Goku and possesses more than just looking like him what many ""Evil Goku\'s"" try yet fail.Even their upbringings clash as both are exceptions to how Saiyans are treated after birth. As usually Saiyans with low power like Goku are sent to places with no real challenge as Saiyans with high power levels, the elites, are treated with respect. Goku was sent to a planet where he got the benefit to be trained by literal gods while Broli was meant to be executed because he was too strong hence being dangerous.Broli is one of few characters who is muscular in Dragon Ball and can be taken serious as a threat. He takes full advantage of his body and the movie makes sure that the viewer can imagine the feeling by each impact delivered by his attacks.Broli was portrayed as an unmovable force, like many villains prior, he took attacks head on without any damage. But unlike those prior villains, Broli actively walked into attacks giving the feeling that nobody can stop this monster and proving his self confidence.Personality wise Broli shines in this movie. At the start, you won\'t see it because of a mind control device that actively prevents Broli from thinking. Once he transforms, Broli shows his true face in one of the best transformation sequences in the franchise which is terrifying in any language you view this movie in. Broli is a psychopath who enjoys torturing his opponents and breaking their battle spirit. Each action he does is done with that in mind as he would ask someone how much they care about a certain person hinting his next target basically showing Broli understanding others\' feelings and wanting to destroy them. Broli\'s dialogue has hidden intentions giving him a lot of depth many modern fans don\'t give him credit for.The most terrifying thing about Broli is however that one cannot escape his wrath as many characters believe they escaped him only for him to appear and crush their hopes the last minute.Paragus is one of two characters that show how terrifying Broli is. During the movie his pride and love for Broli gets shown but also his ever lasting fear which proves King Vegeta\'s decision right forcing Paragus something he never intended to do at the beginning. His main goal is to take revenge against Vegeta which conflicts with his fear about losing control of Broli.As a villain, Paragus is also very effective despite not having the power to oppose the good guys since he is far in power to many major character involved in this movie. So he has to find other means to defeat them.The other character terrified of Broli is Vegeta as Broli represents everything Vegeta wanted to be. Vegeta as a character, since he is royalty considered himself to stand above all Saiyans which is why he has a massive grudge against Goku. However, Broli\'s entire existence challenged this idea even more by having a power that makes Vegeta look like a mere insect despite not having royal blood. And thus tackling the concept of class vs talent and status vs power.Future Trunks serves as the voice of reason for Vegeta and since this movie is about the mightiest Saiyan, there is a necessity to have all Saiyans involved that can put a fight.Goku in this movie represents everything Broli stands against. Despite all the torture Goku received, he still didn\'t back down from Broli. Even back when they were babies, Broli could sense something in Goku others couldn\'t and the movie showed it in various ways as both babies fought by crying which in many cultures symbolize guts and being in good health. And it can be reasoned with that Broli associates his execution attempt with Goku beating him back then. Goku also served as a motivation for Vegeta to step out of his shell and face his fears.Visually the movie stands out too. Since the battle takes place at night, the characters wearing bright outfits stand out. Especially Broli who has a unique color pallet even by modern Dragon Ball standards making him stand out in every single panel shot with the dark blue sky in the background. There are also many Broli shots that let the character fill the entire screen seen from below making him look even more imposing.Lastly there environment plays a massive role in this movie. Not just visually but also as a massive disaster is threatening everyone aside from Broli through it adding a time limit in addition to the fight where victory seems to be impossible to archive.The environment also played a role moreso in combat itself as it lures the viewers and combatants in false security before Broli manages to catch up and torment them.Even tho this movie is amazing, there are some criticism. That being Piccolo being in the movie who basically exist to safe Gohan. However, he still was one of few characters that directly talked to Vegeta trying to convince him to participate.Another negative might be how Broli lost which is through a similar mean to other movies. However, in this fight it seems more reasonable to show what Goku has over Broli adding a fitting end to conclude the film and the use of fate in how  and where the attack was delivered. The movie has a lot of comedic scenes. They are funny but not in a memorable way since some seem to be referential ones which many viewers won\'t get. But the jokes don\'t overstay their welcome nor do they ruin the atmosphere too much especially since some of the characters have a good reason why they act so goofy despite a monster being let lose. Lastly the popularity of this movie also ends up being its downfall since it lead to several sequels which ruined this legendary character like retconning his transformation to an upgrade of Super Saiyan instead of being what Broli becomes when he turns Super Saiyan and devaluing the theme of fate from this movie.And this movie is not possible to fit to the main storyline as Goku and Gohan, who look like they are from the Cell Saga, use their base form in this movie instead staying Super Saiyan the whole time.Overall, if you care about finding out more about Saiyan culture, see more quality character development for Vegeta and a movie that explores more than just the fight against a strong villain this movie delivers on all fronts. Not to mention of its great use of all characters involved. This movie is a must see. 1000 years.

But instead, Broli spawned 4 total Dragon Ball movies and was popular enough to get 3 new incarnations of his character: Broly (from Dragon Ball Super movie Broly), female Broli (from Dragon Ball Super) and Bio Broli (from the Dragon Ball Z movie Bio Broli).These so called ""facts"" by the fans will be debunked in this review.This movie does a great job in redeeming the Super Saiyan form as in the anime it was claimed to be a form that appears once every 1000 years, but over the course of the series there are multiple characters to take the form. Not to mention, this suppose unbeatable form gets rendered useless in the face of some robots build by an army Goku destroyed when he was a kid. Basically, Super Saiyan was downgraded into a mere power up instead of a mystical form that appears in the time of need that can\'t be stopped. Thus the REAL Super Saiyan brings it back to its near undefeatable glory.Broli does what Broly (from DBS) does better backstory wise as his connection to Goku is build better since they were born the same day instead around the same time giving the concept of destiny being involved more believability. There are many symbolisms that can be drawn out by it and the movie plays with the idea of who and what the legendary Super Saiyan really is:- Broli has the power of the legendary Super Saiyan and is destined to destroy the universe. He embodies everything what Saiyans prior to DBS existing stand for but on a higher magnitude.- Goku has the spirit and potential of the legendary Super Saiyan and destined to save the universe. He embodies everything what Saiyans don\'t stand for, a warrior with a kind heart and got the benefit of being trained by various martial art masters.In other words, one rejected his Saiyan nature and the other fully embraced it. If anything, Broli is a perfect counterpart to Goku and possesses more than just looking like him what many ""Evil Goku\'s"" try yet fail.Even their upbringings clash as both are exceptions to how Saiyans are treated after birth. As usually Saiyans with low power like Goku are sent to places with no real challenge as Saiyans with high power levels, the elites, are treated with respect. Goku was sent to a planet where he got the benefit to be trained by literal gods while Broli was meant to be executed because he was too strong hence being dangerous.Broli is one of few characters who is muscular in Dragon Ball and can be taken serious as a threat. He takes full advantage of his body and the movie makes sure that the viewer can imagine the feeling by each impact delivered by his attacks.Broli was portrayed as an unmovable force, like many villains prior, he took attacks head on without any damage. But unlike those prior villains, Broli actively walked into attacks giving the feeling that nobody can stop this monster and proving his self confidence.Personality wise Broli shines in this movie. At the start, you won\'t see it because of a mind control device that actively prevents Broli from thinking. Once he transforms, Broli shows his true face in one of the best transformation sequences in the franchise which is terrifying in any language you view this movie in. Broli is a psychopath who enjoys torturing his opponents and breaking their battle spirit. Each action he does is done with that in mind as he would ask someone how much they care about a certain person hinting his next target basically showing Broli understanding others\' feelings and wanting to destroy them. Broli\'s dialogue has hidden intentions giving him a lot of depth many modern fans don\'t give him credit for.The most terrifying thing about Broli is however that one cannot escape his wrath as many characters believe they escaped him only for him to appear and crush their hopes the last minute.Paragus is one of two characters that show how terrifying Broli is. During the movie his pride and love for Broli gets shown but also his ever lasting fear which proves King Vegeta\'s decision right forcing Paragus something he never intended to do at the beginning. His main goal is to take revenge against Vegeta which conflicts with his fear about losing control of Broli.As a villain, Paragus is also very effective despite not having the power to oppose the good guys since he is far in power to many major character involved in this movie. So he has to find other means to defeat them.The other character terrified of Broli is Vegeta as Broli represents everything Vegeta wanted to be. Vegeta as a character, since he is royalty considered himself to stand above all Saiyans which is why he has a massive grudge against Goku. However, Broli\'s entire existence challenged this idea even more by having a power that makes Vegeta look like a mere insect despite not having royal blood. And thus tackling the concept of class vs talent and status vs power.Future Trunks serves as the voice of reason for Vegeta and since this movie is about the mightiest Saiyan, there is a necessity to have all Saiyans involved that can put a fight.Goku in this movie represents everything Broli stands against. Despite all the torture Goku received, he still didn\'t back down from Broli. Even back when they were babies, Broli could sense something in Goku others couldn\'t and the movie showed it in various ways as both babies fought by crying which in many cultures symbolize guts and being in good health. And it can be reasoned with that Broli associates his execution attempt with Goku beating him back then. Goku also served as a motivation for Vegeta to step out of his shell and face his fears.Visually the movie stands out too. Since the battle takes place at night, the characters wearing bright outfits stand out. Especially Broli who has a unique color pallet even by modern Dragon Ball standards making him stand out in every single panel shot with the dark blue sky in the background. There are also many Broli shots that let the character fill the entire screen seen from below making him look even more imposing.Lastly there environment plays a massive role in this movie. Not just visually but also as a massive disaster is threatening everyone aside from Broli through it adding a time limit in addition to the fight where victory seems to be impossible to archive.The environment also played a role moreso in combat itself as it lures the viewers and combatants in false security before Broli manages to catch up and torment them.Even tho this movie is amazing, there are some criticism. That being Piccolo being in the movie who basically exist to safe Gohan. However, he still was one of few characters that directly talked to Vegeta trying to convince him to participate.Another negative might be how Broli lost which is through a similar mean to other movies. However, in this fight it seems more reasonable to show what Goku has over Broli adding a fitting end to conclude the film and the use of fate in how  and where the attack was delivered. The movie has a lot of comedic scenes. They are funny but not in a memorable way since some seem to be referential ones which many viewers won\'t get. But the jokes don\'t overstay their welcome nor do they ruin the atmosphere too much especially since some of the characters have a good reason why they act so goofy despite a monster being let lose. Lastly the popularity of this movie also ends up being its downfall since it lead to several sequels which ruined this legendary character like retconning his transformation to an upgrade of Super Saiyan instead of being what Broli becomes when he turns Super Saiyan and devaluing the theme of fate from this movie.And this movie is not possible to fit to the main storyline as Goku and Gohan, who look like they are from the Cell Saga, use their base form in this movie instead staying Super Saiyan the whole time.Overall, if you care about finding out more about Saiyan culture, see more quality character development for Vegeta and a movie that explores more than just the fight against a strong villain this movie delivers on all fronts. Not to mention of its great use of all characters involved. This movie is a must see.', 'This is the best dbz movie ever made, this movie had the best dbz villian and it is well written and hands down it had one of the best english soundtracks. Broly will forever be my favorite dbz villian, he is very overpowered and strikes a lot of fear into his victims, his behavior is more ruthless than the new dragonball super broly, i definitely prefer this version even though its non canon. I still enjoy watching it over, i still feel like broly should have been a canon character in the dbz anime. Its the best movie in the broly trilogy 100% ', 'This review contains spoilersThe movie of ""Dragon Ball Z Movie 08: Moetsukiro !! Nessen, Ressen, Chougekisen"", is in my humid opinion, entertaining, it is not an excellent film by far, but it fits with the things that I appreciate from a movie of Dragon Ball ZThe history of the film is, to say the least, interesting. In the movie it shows other 2 warriors of the almost extinct Saiyajin race, the way of presenting them and their motives are very far from the archetype of common enemy (which is not bad), since the first antagonist of the film, Paragus is someone who wants to reconstruct...the whole planet Vegeta, is a goal that, despite sounding outlandish and idiotic, it makes sense if you consider the scenario they were in, Frieza had died and his soldiers too (taking into account that his father died and that, if he became canonical in the film, Cooler, Frieza\'s brother had died), they had nothing to lose and everything was conveniently suited for Paragus to carry out his plan.Therefore I consider that the motivations of the first villain of the movie are justified and logical, also it is different motivation to the other enemies (although their objectives were false, but by that time they were very good).The bad thing is that after the villain changes to the typical ""I have a super powerful ally and with the governor the universe"", this type of enemies is too common in the movies and in the very series (except for the Dragon Ball with Goku small), this is passable because the antagonist motive goes to something deeper in Broly\'s personality. Broly has a special grudge against Goku and this is due to a big problem they had when they were very young, not because Goku has frustrated their plans or destroyed their ambitions, the problem Broly has with Goku is much more interesting and justifiable than that of other enemies------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The characters in the film do not stand out, this is because the characters are the same as always, the only ""remarkable"" new characters are Paragus and Broly.Goku does not show changes, Vegeta does not, nor does Krillin and a long etcetera. This is not particularly bad since being a franchise film that left many chapters behind it is understandable that it does not have evolution, it would feel very strange and unnatural (although this applies much more in this film for the time and moment in which he left).Paragus and Broly are enemies with an interesting story, but it can be easily incoherent, it is assumed that Broly has a power of 10,000 ki, it is only said that he is the legendary super Saiyan and that is never explained, Paragus was not very special and it is very strange that he was the father of the legendary Saiyan, this after all is only a convenience of the author. Broly is saved from a super nova occupied by Frieza and survives with his father because his power was very immense (which I think is a great exaggeration), his story had potential, but was pretty wasted.On the other hand, the design of Broly, the approaches given by the film, its range of colors and design cohesion in a spectacular way.As the film always tries to focus on its attacks and muscles to inflict respect (which is very necessary if we take into account that the villain is the legendary Saiyan), even when the film takes up the experiences of Broly the film is about to make it look like a very powerful monster that simply has fun destroying planets (a special scene is like the one that is going to exterminate a small alien race, but instead prefers to change the trajectory of its energy ball to its planet to destroy it in front of all its inhabitants).You could say that the range of greenish colors that Broly gives to his attacks and hair is aesthetically good, is very differentiated from the other Saiyans of the series and also when transformed releases a green wave that fits very well to add something epic to the sceneIts design is something that has much to do with the focus of the camera and the same series gives the character, his design of someone weak and harmless to his muscular design and more evil is spectacular, from the simple as the fact that his pupils are lost until his suit that gives him a mystical air they look good, it can be seen from a distance that he is the legendary super saiyan.The bad thing is that Broly does not give off a new or attractive personality, its base form has almost no personality and its form in legendary super saiyan is limited to just saying ""Kakaroto"" and not much more, it is superb, it is selfish and evil, come on, The aforementioned archetype of the enemy may well suit his personality, but it does not take away the fact that his personality is already very predictable and quite boring. In general Broly was very unused, excellent design, but unfortunate personality.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The scenarios of the film are basic, they are not surprising nor is it something that fits perfectly with the battle, they are not bad, but they are not good either, you do not feel a very good atmosphere due to the very powerful that they did to Broly reaching seem absurd, although this is easily forgivable because of how the battle was developed on the stage, all the characters being beaten by Broly while he sent it to any building to make them suffer, at least they knew how to use the stage, but it was not perfect (obviously ).The soundtrack is fine, personally I love the soundtrack of Dragon Ball in general, in Broly\'s film this factor is well used, especially in battles when it is shown how powerful Broly is, this generates a good contrast.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A little about the end:At the end of the movie they defeat the antagonist in a very impractical way, the only thing that happened was that Goku asked for energy from the others while giving him a beating (something quite common), at least his power up had a justification, besides creating a scene that can be exciting for some people, seeing Goku defeating Broly is something that is quite disappointing, but this is compensated by the way they focus the punch and see the characters giving Goku the energy despite that they knew they could lose------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The movie has some inconsistencies; how the fact that the master Mutenroshi has been drunk for about 2 days, Broly\'s past or why Paragus left the planet in a very carefree way that caused his death. But if we remove that the film can get to entertain enough, to last an hour takes its time in battles and animation is well implemented with the antagonist Broly, the story, although it has notable failures, is entertaining and can reach generates a great interest for the historical value Saiyan that present the 2 antagonists, scenarios and acceptable soundtracks. the whole planet Vegeta, is a goal that, despite sounding outlandish and idiotic, it makes sense if you consider the scenario they were in, Frieza had died and his soldiers too (taking into account that his father died and that, if he became canonical in the film, Cooler, Frieza\'s brother had died), they had nothing to lose and everything was conveniently suited for Paragus to carry out his plan.Therefore I consider that the motivations of the first villain of the movie are justified and logical, also it is different motivation to the other enemies (although their objectives were false, but by that time they were very good).The bad thing is that after the villain changes to the typical ""I have a super powerful ally and with the governor the universe"", this type of enemies is too common in the movies and in the very series (except for the Dragon Ball with Goku small), this is passable because the antagonist motive goes to something deeper in Broly\'s personality.

The movie doesn't drag in any spots too heavily which helps, especially given the movie's short run time. There are some slightly nonsensical bits that you'll just have to suspend your disbelief a little more than usual for. Also, the comedy in the movie is not always funny and doesn't quite add much to the movie. In short,...the comedy segments feel shoehorned in a bit and don't really work to the movie's favor. However, such segments are brief and don't totally ruin the movie besides. In its way, this adds the charm of the movie even if it doesn't quite succeed at being funny. The art is successful and pleasant to look at, as much as the series was. Many familiar faces return as well a couple new ones and all look good. The music in this movie is the usual mix of standard Dragon Ball Z fare, which is good, and the music stands up well. Most of the movie is devoid of music altogether, though, which is a little off-putting but not wholly detrimental. The music is good, there just isn't much of it in play here. Despite any faults, the movie is good action-packed fun. It moves along at a healthy clip, there is lots of fighting and such action. The ending is a little anti-climatic of a finish for all the rough fighting that there was, though. This was slightly disappointing in that respect. Overall, a good and fun action movie in the Dragon Ball Z fashion. the comedy segments feel shoehorned in a bit and don't really work to the movie's favor.

The biggest problem was the severely rushed atmosphere of this movie. I do understand that the movie was only an hour long, but if they are going to choose a plot that would say, normally take hours and hours to complete if it were an arc in the series, trying...to fit the story into a one  hour movie did not work for me. My favorite thing about Dragon Ball Z was the slow story-telling, it never tried to jam too much information at once and was always an easy watch, which was one of the things that made the series for me, but the movie was the complete opposite. Still, there were moments that still captured that care-free pace, such as when goku would take time out to just eat himself half to death for a few minutes, or when he was taking time out to be whipped by Chi-chi. Yes, not the most entertaining scenes, but I the shoving of the story down my throat would cease for a few moments during these scenes.The second biggest problem was the characters personalities, especially Vegeta. Other than a few fleeting moments, it felt like Vegeta\'s in your face personality was almost gone completely. There were points were it seemed like everyone was just dragging him around (Literally at one point!) and he had nothing to say about it. I felt like I was watching a Vegeta on anger management drugs, and that\'s not the character that I came to love! Then there was the little trio that came along- Trunks, Gohan, and Krillan (and Roshi and Oolong but who cares). Their role was very boring. In fact, I can hardly remember it because it was just... dull. Yes, their little adventure did help uncover the ""mystery"" of Planet Vegeta and the Legendary Super Saiyan, but it was still unentertaining and the aliens slaves they helped were a COMPLETE eye soar. Yellow and pink put together on a creature that is already hideous was almost eye-searing for me. Goku was at times rather funny as he was in DBZ but it came off too strong several times, I was starting to think Goku got too hungry and happened to eat some happy grass while out in the woods helping some dinosaurs. Roshi and Oolong were as annoying as always and and Chi-chi was as menopausal as ever, king kai was still being the professional peeping tom that he is, and unfortunately due to poor CD quality I missed a portion of Piccolo\'s scenes so I can\'t speak for him, but all that being said I GUESS the characters balanced out to a decent portrayal of the whole gang. Still, Vegeta being one of my old favorites, I was disappointed about how boring he was even though he was playing a seemingly important role.Okay, it\'s time to address, to put it quite simply, everything else. Yep, all that other stuff. First, the idea of the story wasn\'t half bad, and the twists always brought my attention back to the movie right when my interest would begin to stray. It\'s just too bad they had so little time to tell it, I think even a half hour more would\'ve benefited this movie greatly. The art I was very pleased with. I guess you could say the style was a bit more like the earlier arcs of the Dragon Ball Z series rather than the last one, or two, I don\'t remember, but I was also happy about that because I liked the style in the beginning of the DBZ more. The music was okay, but my sister did not like it because she preferred the music in the series and was hoping for something similar. She has pointed out in the past how the music in DBZ was like animation for your ears- for every punch, kick, and throw, the instruments would play something to emphasize it. In this movie, I didn\'t pay much attention to whether the music still did that frequently or not, but it did seem that it was just plain soundtracks playing instead when I was listening, and one of the first things she mentioned was that she was not pleased with the music. The new characters weren\'t too bad. Paragus was pretty obvious from the very beginning, although I wont say how. I\'m not a big fan of lying manipulators, but he played his crappy part well. Broly was a silent type, And interesting because he was more mysterious and he had an oddly different look to him,  his face immediately made me think of the blank, peaceful expression of Android 16, but that\'s because he was  hoped up on personality tranquilizers, and I\'m not gonna lie, he really needed them! The ending seemed rather abrupt to me. This may have been due to the slight skipping right before the end, but it just didn\'t have much flare to me, and gave no sense of accomplishment or satisfaction.ALRIGHT! Last but certainly not least is the fight scene, one of the most important points of the movie. This may be considered a spoiler, sort of. The big fight scene was.. well, kind of pathetic. My CD was skipping through parts of it, but the parts went like this: Vegeta crying and moaning on the ground while spreading flowers about himself to prepare his deathbed, while the mysterious Legendary Super Saiyan ran around with a fly swatter and flattening everyone with his beefy arm that was bigger than Goku and laughing or screaming maniacally, never really saying much of significance. Then everyone took timies out to hold hands and give their life blood to the cult leader, but Vegeta forgot to take the previously mentioned anger management drugs that morning, and at this point his withdrawals and feelings of hopelessness ceased, so he was back to being butt hurt over goku being stronger than him, and refused to share his glowing green life jellies with him. Then my CD proceeded to skip through Vegeta\'s intervention were he was verbally spanked by everyone, and he made the final decision- did he share his life jam, or did he continue to cradle his knees and stick his tongue out defiantly at Goku? You\'ll have to watch to find that out, and then you can decide what you think of how the fight ends after that.All of those elements combined, I have gave this movie and average overall rating of 5 (Mediocre), the individual ratings being:Art: 8 (very good)Story: 6 (fair)Sound: 4 (decent)Character: 4 (decent)Enjoyment: 4 (decent) (Although at many times it was more of a 3 (poor) I decided to be nice since Goku did make me laugh.)And that gives you an average overall rating of 5.2! (r5).This is the first DBZ movie I have seen.I would probably never watch this movie again unless I was trying to show someone else the points of it that were not good.and I would not recommend it to someone unless I know they are not picky and don\'t mind rushed work. to fit the story into a one  hour movie did not work for me.

My CD was skipping through parts of it, but the parts went like this: Vegeta crying and moaning on the ground while spreading flowers about himself to prepare his deathbed, while the mysterious Legendary Super Saiyan ran around with a fly swatter and flattening everyone with his beefy arm that was bigger than Goku and laughing or screaming maniacally, never really saying much of significance. Then everyone took timies out to hold hands and give their life blood to the cult leader, but Vegeta forgot to take the previously mentioned anger management drugs that morning, and at this point his withdrawals and feelings of hopelessness ceased, so he was back to being butt hurt over goku being stronger than him, and refused to share his glowing green life jellies with him. Then my CD proceeded to skip through Vegeta\'s intervention were he was verbally spanked by everyone, and he made the final decision- did he share his life jam, or did he continue to cradle his knees and stick his tongue out defiantly at Goku? You\'ll have to watch to find that out, and then you can decide what you think of how the fight ends after that.All of those elements combined, I have gave this movie and average overall rating of 5 (Mediocre), the individual ratings being:Art: 8 (very good)Story: 6 (fair)Sound: 4 (decent)Character: 4 (decent)Enjoyment: 4 (decent) (Although at many times it was more of a 3 (poor) I decided to be nice since Goku did make me laugh.)And that gives you an average overall rating of 5.2! (r5).This is the first DBZ movie I have seen.I would probably never watch this movie again unless I was trying to show someone else the points of it that were not good.and I would not recommend it to someone unless I know they are not picky and don\'t mind rushed work.', 'I have to say, at one point, I thought this anime was going to be half decent. Primarily, it has a story that, though painfully transparent, is quite complex when measured against other Dragon Ball Z movies. They actually spend about half the movie (rather than the usual 5 - 10 minutes) setting up the inevitable brawl that we all know is coming. But having gotten everything set up, this movie is actually let down by the fighting. It\'s just so... uninspiringly dull. The way Goku seems to be only half seriously going about his usual job of kicking villains\' butts and the way they...keep throwing in crappy jokes meant that in the end they completely failed to create a decent battle atmosphere. There\'s also a certain consistency missing from the movie. For one thing, Vegita\'s change of heart is so badly done I was completely unconvinced. And if they could transfer ki like they did in this movie, why the hell did Piccolo have to do it the harder way in the last Dragon Ball Z movie that I watched (movie #4)?? Speaking of Piccolo, his appearance is becoming kind of boring and predictable too - he makes this surprise entry in the middle of the battle in this movie... except it\'s no longer very surprising when I\'ve seen him make exactly the same kind of entrance in just about every other Dragon Ball Z movie that I\'ve watched. They really need to think up some new ""twists"". And the ending... I can\'t believe how badly this movie failed at creating a climax at the end. It just sort of... ended, and that was that.This movie COULD have made it up to a 5. Hell, it almost made it up to a 6 at one point, but it goes downhill so fast in the last few minutes that I had to do some serious down marking. keep throwing in crappy jokes meant that in the end they completely failed to create a decent battle atmosphere.

The other elements of the movie were poor foundations for the story. Before I had seen this movie, the story sounded fair (6) but with how everything else turned out, it's only a 1.The art is good. It's obvious you're watching Toriyama-style. DBZ is a big show so it's not as if they can afford to concentrate their budget on one movie.The soundtrack is fair. The English and Japanese audio tracks fit depending...on your tastes/mood. With the English dub, you get bgm that's loud and frequent. Sometimes listening to the rock after a while made me feel irritated but it fits fine.As for the Japanese track, I prefer Goku's dub voice since I've heard it a lot longer having the dub to watch when growing up. The original BGM is much quieter than the rock used for the English track which let me focus on the animation a lot more. When anyone was yelling, I liked having the English rock going on compared to the less energetic original bgm where sometimes there'd be none playing.After about a third into the movie, we learn more details about the legendary Super Saiyan and how the people affected by it feel. It was here I was let down. The characters didn't seem as impressive anymore. I didn't enjoy this as a movie anymore but down to the level of a filler.I'm not unattracted to the sequel or the rest of the movies I have yet to watch. It'd be great if the sequel turns out to be a lot better than this one though it won't be the next DBZ movie I check out next time. It'll have to wait until I see another first. on your tastes/mood.

Right in the midst of the confrontation against Cell, and knowing how their world is in danger thanks to his presence, Goku happily accepts Kaio’s petition to investigate and deal with a threat coming from the southern galaxy without even knowing how much time this is going to take him, and Vegeta, who only wanted to fight Cell as soon as possible to prove himself, receives an invitation of another saiyan survivor called Paragus not only to become the king of a restored saiyan empire in a new planet, but also to fight against the legendary super saiyan who, according to Paragus, is causing havoc in the aforementioned galaxy, represents a threat to the new empire and Vegeta is the only one who can defeat him. The saiyan prince, who always heard stories about him, doesn’t even ask him why he would represent that since he was supposedly one of theirs, and tempted by the possibility to restore the glory of his race, also accepts to leave the same as Goku, both completely forgetting about Cell’s imminent threat and whose name, despite this, was curiously never ever mentioned throughout the entirety of this movie, as if that threat had never existed in the first place.How is the audience supposed to buy this? Was it really that hard to add just a tad of credibility by just dedicating a few lines of the script to this situation? Just a simple “hey guys, let’s make this quick, remember we have to go back to Earth soon to fight Cell!”? I know this lack of credibility and realism is present in many DBZ movies, but that is still no excuse. Anyway, once they arrive on the planet, they meet Broly, the son of Paragus and a very peculiar saiyan survivor characterized by a suspicious calmed and gentle personality (an uncommon trait for the saiyan race), but who in reality was hiding a monster inside that was going to cause a lot of troubles for the Z team.It just boggles me how Broly can be one of most beloved and popular villains among the DB fans. He is totally uninteresting, even for DBZ movies standards, or more precisely, was made uninteresting in the way. He could have been an intriguing villain. As someone who was overthrown and sentenced to death by his own people -given the threat he represented to the King for being born with an enormous power he had never asked for-, condemned to wander through the galaxies living in inhospitable conditions and who was later mind-controlled by his own father who wanted to make use of his colossal strength for his selfish purposes, he had a lot of valid reasons to be angry inside, to seek for revenge, and the potential to become more than just your average forgettable DBZ movie villain who wanted to conquer the world or something…was always there. But unfortunately, the movie failed to take advantage of this potential at all by presenting him at first as this enigmatic robotic dude who doesn’t say anything, doesn’t do anything besides making these wacky angry facial expressions whenever he stares at Goku (in such a way that it feels almost as if he was programmed to do so) and by then turning him into a dull over-muscled beast with just 2 brain cells: one that he uses to destroy and kill everything in his path, and the other one to yell: “Kakarott!”. And this was everything the movie did with his character, the famous Legendary Super Saiyan!We never get to know how he really feels or what he thinks about everything he has had to live, what his true motivations are, because he never speaks a single relevant line about himself; when he’s not the beast, his mind and behavior are under control (with a machine that the movie never even bothered to tell us how his father invented or how does it work, not even a single simple and quick explanation: it just does!) and when he becomes the beast, he doesn’t (and maybe, he just can’t) say anything about himself either, he just limits to yell: “Kakarott!”, leaving everything to speculation and allowing for some people to believe that, given the few-friends face he put to Goku and the obsession he develops towards him, the reason of all his anger was as stupid as he couldn’t bear Goku crying all the time next to him when they were babies, when the case could have perfectly been that, for some reason, he was to him just the embodiment of all the suffering he had to go through. Things are, since the information provided was so little and confusing, we could never know, losing all the opportunities to make the audience feel anything for him. At the end of the day he’s a completely shallow character, nothing else but a killing machine that likes destroying everything in his way pretty much like how Kid Buu was, except this time not even half charismatic and “lovable” like he was.The other aspects of the movie weren’t better. First, no matter how uninteresting your villain is, you can always arrange some exciting action scenes, which also wasn’t the case here. The confrontation (that takes half the movie) was incredibly tedious and flat, failing to create any tension or genuine excitement, so much that you just wanted the Z team to finish the job quickly to get back to Earth and resume their conflict with the much more interesting Cell.Speaking about Cell, Goku’s complete carefree attitude like if he didn’t have to solve this situation as soon as possible because Dr. Gero’s creation was waiting for him, not giving weight to the threat, was not believable. Goku was never that dumb! (At least not in the Z era). Vegeta acting out-of-character, easily surrendering after noticing Broly’s superiority, and as the prideful warrior he always was, also didn’t make sense; that was never part of his personality. Gohan, who was supposedly as powerful as his father (or even more) by this time, didn’t do much besides being passively part of the final solution and helping the alien race from the harsh labor conditions under which they had to work for Paragus, the same as Krilin and Trunks. And Roshi and Oolong, who had absolutely nothing to do here, were also included in the quest just for the sake of adding unnecessary comedy, which was terrible, unfunny and totally forced, doing no favor.Finally, the ending of the movie feels like…”well, let’s end this, whatever way, and let’s get out of here quickly”. After a tedious, over-stretched fight, we had a rushed conclusion with the climax literally happening in the last minute before credits start rolling and goodbye.Art and animation are pretty good, and in fact, better than the actual main series. But every single DBZ movie also does, so this is nothing particularly special here. Though I have to say I liked the greenish design of Broly’s hair and aura, which highlighted his status as an advanced and superior super saiyan. The music included some of the main series tunes (at least in the Japanese version, don’t know the dubbed one) but somehow I feel it was just ok, it couldn’t emphasize the intrigue and the action enough as opposed to what the main series always did so well.To sum up, “Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan”, was just a total letdown. It promised to be one of the best but at the end became one of the most lackluster of all the old DBZ movies. To be fair, most of them are, but as one of the most relevant given its direct connection with the franchise’s most important storyline (the saiyan race), in this case the result should have been better. It missed the opportunity to leverage the legend of the Legendary Super Saiyan (forgive the redundancy) Vegeta was always talking about during the Frieza arc and was painfully boring, as opposed to the other two Broly based movies (“Broly: Second Coming” and “Bio-Broly”) which at least were funnier to watch since they featured the naughty kids Goten and Trunks going in an adventure and were considerably more enjoyable. I’ll honestly never understand what the DB fans found so good and entertaining in this movie and in Broly, who to me was never anything else than an over-muscled, 2 brain-celled beast obsessed with Goku for God knows why reasons, and I’m really hoping the upcoming movie, this time canon, could do something more interesting with the character and his backstory. 4.5/10. a continuity break) or unnaturally interferes with it in a questionable way, failing to build much interest in the audience due to the sense of irrelevancy and/or discontinuity, and this one is no exception.

Admittedly, I was very interested when coming into this because it's a really nice concept; the true Super Saiyan of legend who finally appeared to lay waste to everything in his path. I thought it was a very good move to introduce this killing machine as the real deal, in oppose to the good natured Goku whom was supposedly the legend. Despite the premise of this feature movie, in the end, it's nothing more...than the usual Dragonball Z; bad guy shows up, everybody gets beat up, etc. The movie could have been a little more than a mere beat'em up.The plot follows Goku and Vegeta as they separately try to discover the whereabouts of this monster. Paragus assists Vegeta but it becomes quite clear he has other intentions. While this is going on, Gohan, Trunks, and company, begin to unravel the mystery of the ruined planet Paragus claims to be rebuilding as the new Planet Vegeta to begin the Saiyan empire anew.The production values are on the level of Cooler's Revenge. There are some nice character designs with Broly being the absolute best. I mean this guy is a muscle bound juggernaut, and he looks like he can kick some serious ass left and right, in which he does. Seriously, this guy probably has muscles in his shit. The animation is a bit more vivid than the TV series, and even though there are traces of the reused cels simulating action going on, there are some good physical moments and entertaining action scenes. The soundtrack also uses several groove metal songs from notable bands, such as Pantera and Haji's Kitchen.The story was actually interesting since Broly didn't immediately fall into the typical villain role, which is someone who was plain out to rule the universe or something. There was obviously a reason why he snapped. Too bad Broly eventually becomes just another villain and joins the ranks of various villains of the DBZ universe as missed potential, and the character only becomes far worse in later sequels. The plot is pretty slow, plus it has a very weak script. There's this ultra cheap effort to keep the identity of the Legendary Super Saiyan secret from the viewer, when the title of the movie completely gives it away.Things pick up when the action finally kicks in. Plus there's various attempts to squeeze in the usual comedy in various spots. Unfortunately, the ending was very weak though; I just didn't like the cheap feel of it at all.In the end, Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan is an average DBZ movie at best. It will only be truly valuable to fans of the series.

In the entire series we think Goku is the legendary super Saiyan who Vegeta kept rambling about during the Frieza saga but then we meet Broly who totally demolishes everything and anything in his way.The concept of a character so powerful so early in the series was pretty great to me. Before all the super saiyan 3 and Vegeto fusions and stuff this was like the best enemy ever. Broly is just some quiet character till he becomes enraged and then he is this hulking...energy overflowing planet destroyer that the entire cast of DBZ has to fuse power with just to defeat.I think the fights in this movie are the best in this franchise and by far the most entertaining part of watching in any movie that came before or after except in maybe Brolys second coming which was another great movie. Tho the first is always the best in my opinion cause the concept was just fresh and new to me when it came out.That what we assumed about the main character was horribly wrong and that the super saiyan was not some hero, he was actually the greatest enemy they could imagine(at the time)I have to give this only a fair rating since it is not filled with a colorful plot,amazing art or even great music but the action and concept was just great to me. I suggest this movie be your first in the DBZ library. energy overflowing planet destroyer that the entire cast of DBZ has to fuse power with just to defeat.I think the fights in this movie are the best in this franchise and by far the most entertaining part of watching in any movie that came before or after except in maybe Brolys second coming which was another great movie.

He moans about it for the first half and then they fight about it for second half. About half the fighting is yelling and moaning for no reason. ALSO! the dude gets gigantic for no reason.Yep that is the plot!The sound is j..j...just bad because literally its just moaning, THATS ALL!!!! THATS ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Oh my god the characters are just dudes who ffffffight. Geehhhhhhhhh why???Really do not waste your time on this, it made me want to slit my wrist.

The story had a lot of potential, but failed in the execution.  After whining for the majority of the movie, Vegeta decides to give his power to Goku after a lot of pouting; Gohan and Trunks are basically useless in this movie (despite Gohan being around the same level of power as Goku). And to drive the nail in the coffin, there\'s a friendship power-up to save the day against all odds, probably the worst, most unoriginal thing a shounen can do.There are some good points about the movie: it has an interesting premise, the atmosphere feels ominous and foreboding, and we...get Broly, an iconic figure in DBZ. But the movie overall presents itself in an awkward way, from its bad pacing to our characters having flat personalities.Art: 9/10. Great art and animation; the Broly fight is brutally intense.Sound: 7/10. I watched this in the dub with the English OST, and I really liked the heavy-metal tracks played during tense moments. Although, at times the soundtrack didn\'t complement what was going on in the movie at allCharacter: 3/10. Everyone in this film comes off as one-dimensional and bland compared to their actual Z counterparts. Vegeta in DBZ is a prideful prince who holds himself above all else; when faced with someone of superior strength, like Frieza or Android 18, he\'ll keep fighting until the end to prove his dominance. Yet here, Vegeta takes one look at Broly and just falls on his knees and says ""We\'re all doomed!"" I get that Broly is the pinnacle of your race Vegeta, but Frieza literally wiped out your entire race and you still had the courage to fight him until you were down on the ground. Why are you choosing now to be a coward?Also, as I mentioned before, most of the Z fighters in this movie like Gohan and Trunks only have a few lines of dialogue and are just meaningless. Goku himself doesn\'t really have a personality in the film; even his eager-to-fight character trait is missing here. He just gets beaten up alot and then gets a power-boost in the end.Broly might have the least (or most) personality of all, depending on how you look at it. When he\'s not the legendary Super Saiyan, he\'s just reserved and does nothing at all; as the legendary Super Saiyan, he adopts a more psychotic personality and enjoys hurting others. For a psychopathic, unfeeling villain, he does alright.Among all this, there\'s no character development or any meaningful sense of conflict at all. The only reason Broly goes crazy on our heroes is because, and I\'m serious, Goku cried in the bed next to him when they were both babies. I don\'t get why they used this when there was an actual good backstory in parallel with this. Basically, when Broly was born King Vegeta feared he would overthrow him, and so he ordered Broly and Broly\'s father Paragus to death. Broly was able to save himself and Paragus from death. This would culminate Paragus\'s hatred for Vegeta, and I guess it also made Broly somewhat unstable/psychotic.If the movie focused on this, it would be a more reasonable motive. It would make Broly a more humanized character with an actual intention and would develop an interesting conflict between Broly and the Z fighters. All in all, the characterization of our heroes and villains and how they (didn\'t) develop was the weakest aspect of the film.Enjoyment: 6/10. The action scenes were great, and the introduction of Broly\'s LSSJ form was a high point in this movie, but all in all the awkward pacing and lack of character personality made this somewhat of a chore to get through.Overall: 5/10. Alot of what makes DBZ great is absent in this film. The characters we love are watered-down, with most being irrelevant except for Goku, and the conflict in this film is one of the most contrived and superficial I\'ve seen. get Broly, an iconic figure in DBZ. But the movie overall presents itself in an awkward way, from its bad pacing to our characters having flat personalities.Art: 9/10. Great art and animation; the Broly fight is brutally intense.Sound: 7/10. I watched this in the dub with the English OST, and I really liked the heavy-metal tracks played during tense moments. Although, at times the soundtrack didn\'t complement what was going on in the movie at allCharacter: 3/10. Everyone in this film comes off as one-dimensional and bland compared to their actual Z counterparts. Vegeta in DBZ is a prideful prince who holds himself above all else; when faced with someone of superior strength, like Frieza or Android 18, he\'ll keep fighting until the end to prove his dominance. Yet here, Vegeta takes one look at Broly and just falls on his knees and says ""We\'re all doomed!"" I get that Broly is the pinnacle of your race Vegeta, but Frieza literally wiped out your entire race and you still had the courage to fight him until you were down on the ground. Why are you choosing now to be a coward?Also, as I mentioned before, most of the Z fighters in this movie like Gohan and Trunks only have a few lines of dialogue and are just meaningless. Goku himself doesn\'t really have a personality in the film; even his eager-to-fight character trait is missing here. He just gets beaten up alot and then gets a power-boost in the end.Broly might have the least (or most) personality of all, depending on how you look at it. When he\'s not the legendary Super Saiyan, he\'s just reserved and does nothing at all; as the legendary Super Saiyan, he adopts a more psychotic personality and enjoys hurting others. For a psychopathic, unfeeling villain, he does alright.Among all this, there\'s no character development or any meaningful sense of conflict at all. The only reason Broly goes crazy on our heroes is because, and I\'m serious, Goku cried in the bed next to him when they were both babies.

I was expecting to hear an idiot screaming that name every 10 seconds, but I was surprised. This movie isn\'t bad, and if the plot device was more intelligent and some pointless characters had fewer scenes, then I would rate this movie easily 8/10, but sadly not.Anyway, let\'s get into the positives and negatives. LSS Broly is a non-canon movie, meaning it is anime original, and Broly doesn\'t appear in DBZ manga. However, he appears in Super manga, but he\'s ""redone"" into a more interesting character.My...positives from LSSB:1, Art and sound in DBZ coat, easy positive.2, The main fight is pretty entertaining most of the time.3, I am going to give a plus for the TRY to make Vegeta a spotlight for this movie, but it didn\'t last :(4, That small interview with Chi-chi and Goku was pretty nice and refreshing to see them do some ""normal"" human stuff.My negatives from LSSB:1, Goku\'s crying is the plot device. Wth? That is the worst, the most boring excuse for the villain to have a reason to hate Goku. It only made me laugh at this pathetic reason. How does that even work? Are Saiyan children able to memorize events from an age of below 1 year?2, Drunken master Roshi and some Z warriors on an alien planet. Why? Why was this even the part of the movie? It\'s just pointless wasting of time and potential to grow Broly, Paragus or Vegeta\'s spotlight. I can somehow understand the picnic at the beginning of the movie, but I just can\'t stand they went into the ship to travel on ""New Vegeta"". Only to be there and do nothing and add weirdness to the movie.3, Paragus. What was Paragus trying to do? Kill Vegeta or what? Paragus sent Vegeta with Broly to a different planet alone and had a small villain laugh. I was expecting to see a fight between those two or see Broly returning without Vegeta. Nope, nothing happened. This could add some tension and importance to Paragus. His only role was keeping Broly under control, which didn\'t work out anyways, cut him out of the movie and you won\'t miss anything. Yes, the sun was a time bomb, but c\'mon you have an insanely strong Broly, but you try to kill Vegeta with the freaking sun? ALSO, that wouldn\'t work out anyway, because Goku has his Instant Transmission, so the sun added literally 0 tension. The only difference would be some dead slaves bodies, MCs would have lived.4, Goku saves the day. C\'mon, just let someone else be the hero, let it be Vegeta, Piccolo, Gohan. This is just like every single other movie before Broly, with Dead Zone being an exception.5, Trunks was in this movie only because it\'s in the Cell Games saga. His impact on the story was 0%.Summary:It\'s not a bad movie. It is an interesting movie, that could have been done way better if Goku\'s crying wasn\'t the plot device and if we could cut Drunken ones from an alien planet and have someone else be the ending hero. Also, it would be a plus if Broly tried to kill Vegeta on their subjugation quest.Final Rating: 6/10, I\'ve enjoyed this movie. I was pleasantly surprised, and I think I can recommend you to try this movie. positives from LSSB:1, Art and sound in DBZ coat, easy positive.2, The main fight is pretty entertaining most of the time.3, I am going to give a plus for the TRY to make Vegeta a spotlight for this movie, but it didn\'t last :(4, That small interview with Chi-chi and Goku was pretty nice and refreshing to see them do some ""normal"" human stuff.My negatives from LSSB:1, Goku\'s crying is the plot device.

Before you DBZ dick riders get on me, don't get me wrong, I, myself am a DBZ dick rider. I've been watching the show since I was a child and love DB DBZ and DBS. But you aren't gonna come on here and just lie. One major flaw of the movie is that Broly is practically invincible for the entire movie, then, literally in the last 3 minutes of the movie...Goku beats him in one punch after absorbing the energy of the other z fighters. Another thing I found wrong with the movie was the music. The music does not match a single scene, maybe its different in the sub, but the music in the dub was absolutely abhorrent. Its just shitty rock music with horrible vocals that seems out of place in every scene. They also ruined Vegeta. Vegeta's supposed to be this prideful, never giving up even down to the final breath, badass, but they turned him into a whiney bitch baby for almost the entire movie. For most of the movie he's just sitting their crying about how there's no point in fighting when they're going to lose anyway. Then when he finally starts fighting back against Broly (randomly i might add) He gets his shit rocked immediately. This movie isn't near being a decent movie and its certainly not the best DBZ movie. Goku beats him in one punch after absorbing the energy of the other z fighters.

There are some minor problems with the story, but overall I think it works fine, though the plan does seem a bit strange. The story actually gets a lot darker than any of the other movies. They shove in some unneeded comedy bits, which kind of take away from some more serious moments, but maybe they felt it was needed to balance the tone. You have a sympathetic backstory, yet the characters went on to do such terrible things they themselves aren't really redeemable.There's a good amount of action, and you see...an enemy that's just completely overpowered. He's almost like a slasher villain. Thankfully not too much time is spent on extra characters, and what is shown is actually relevant to the plot and enjoyable enough. I like the little bird babies.This is completely separate from the dragon ball super Broly character and universe or timeline. It is connected to the second and third Broly movies DBZ Movie 10: Broly Second Coming and DBZ Movie 11: Bio-Broly but they're terrible. I would only recommend watching this and the DBS movie. an enemy that's just completely overpowered. He's almost like a slasher villain.

For me.The first DBZ movie since Dead Zone to be legitimately pretty good; there\'s an actual emotional core buried in here somewhere, and the story mixes it up as a kind of mystery plot intesecting with the fights, not dishing out on the brawling until the final thirty-ish minutes. The production design for New Planet Vegeta is really cool, and the twisty narrative is classic Akira Toriyama-style silliness (though it\'s clear he himself wasn\'t that involved).It could have ascended to greatness except for a few factors holding it back-- first off, the main villain plot is a bit weird...and could have used some touching up in the writer\'s room before the final draft; there\'s also an extended flashback in the middle that spoils everything pretty early on, and it isn\'t very well-placed because the characters are nowhere near finding out and there isn\'t enough audience tension created from it. Second, this movie is 70 minutes long, the longest DBZ movie yet, and you can really feel that length as the final battle goes on a bit too long. There isn\'t QUITE a ""Goku gets a genki dama and blows up the bad guy"" ending, but it\'s still too drawn out for its own good.Still, despite that, this is the best movie in the series so far, with a fairly compelling plot and villains memorable beyond five minutes after the movie ends. For people who aren\'t big fans of Dragon Ball this might fall flat, but for anyone else, it\'ll work well.And for my running continuity check, this one is luckily already voided by the apparently canon Super Broly movie that came out this year, so I don\'t have to lament that much on how this, like most of its predecessors, doesn\'t fit anywhere in the timeline. It\'s the same reason as why Super Android 13 probably doesn\'t work-- Gohan trying to get into cram school again, and Trunks being there-- but even more egregious this time because Trunks has long hair, implying this takes place in the seven-day gap where Cell has started the Cell Games and the entire world is in a massive panic as the world nears its end.

It delves into both the scenery and the characters, including the powerful force of the villain.The fight scenes are very good, with each character, even Piccolo, battling against Broly. The destruction of the scenery during the fight blended well and had various changes in terrain.It's a shame that in some scenes we see Goku being comedic, as this is a high-risk situation and there's no room for funny expressions, only seriousness.Vegeta and his interactions fit well with the context, as he's obviously more influenced by the tradition and myths of the...Saiyan race. This generates an atypical fear of the Saiyan and creates a humiliating scene.Certainly, the most important focus of the movie is the character of Broly, who has a very cool design and, when he transforms, becomes an unstoppable monster that increases his power infinitely. Broly has a sadistic characteristic that fits well with his transformation, and this is demonstrated in the fights and in the destruction of the enslaved alien planet.The way the fight ends is very simple and bad, something that is repeated in many DBZ movies. It's not easy to swallow, considering Broly is a very powerful character.Anyway, the animation has the same quality as Z, and the soundtrack is also the same as Z.Overall, this movie manages to create a good fight, realistic interactions for the characters, but with a poor conclusion Saiyan race.

Healer Girl,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48857/Healer_Girl,"['""Kind-hearted, powerful songs heal the world. These are beautiful miracles sung by humanity.""And thus, the marriage of musicals and humanity exist to help heal people, an absurd idea that just surprisingly works wonders all on its own to create its own masterpiece niche, directed by the same person whom brought you Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I can hear you say: ""That almost sounds like an overkill.""This is the core tagline of this show, and truthfully, I have a head-aching dilemma when it comes to shows like these. You see, it\'s easy to watch seasonal anime with the usual predictable Isekai shticks and some other genre copy-paste...shenanigans, so much so that it\'s easy as balls to write reviews for it like a robot from start to finish. But when it comes to unique shows like Healer Girl...I find that I have to reverse-engineer the entire process, stop and think things through to concoct one well and comprehensive article that everyone certainly will agree to (NGL, also a cheap way to be the show\'s definitive top review). Not just because this is my personal AOTS that\'s already a masterpiece right from the start, but just like Extreme\'s song: ""More than words to show you feel, that your love for me is real"", Healer Girl has taken the special place in my heart for a multitude of reasons.It\'s a well-known fact that Mondays are unanimously the worst day of the week, giving rise to the infamous term ""Monday Blues"". And in this packed Spring season, Studio 3Hz is back with yet another original anime, and Healer Girl is the one that has consistently surprised me the most and above all, even more so that\'s done by people whom had few hits and many misses. Plus, it\'s only made more perfect as the only lone show airing on a Monday (in Japan) to literally ""heal"" the Monday Blues away. So for that, this show gets a plus for standing out in the most unlikely of circumstances.Music has actually been proven to provide a multitude of health benefits in the form of music therapy, and what better to marry music through the one word that resonates with what has been meta-trending in the anime scene recently: Healer, healing. And there\'re many moments of soothing voices and musicals in Healer Girl that truly makes the show stand apart and embody what makes this so special with immaculate, palpable love for music. And what a joyful little series Healer Girl was, I even have to think that this easily puts Disney\'s High School Musical to shme. And of all the ""Spy × Family"" and ""Ya Boy! Kongming"" roaming around being the general AOTS and dark horse of the season, there\'re bound to be hidden gems if you look hard enough. Nevertheless, I\'m still very floored and baffled at how this show is under-appreciated for cultivating a niche audience so much that it\'s a literate hidden gem all on its own, and I certainly don\'t mind if it was intentionally made that way, because it is just that.So then, what is Healer Girl all about, for the few of you that actually cares about this hoopla of a show that peaks of surprises galore from start to finish? Well, as the title proclaims, literally girls training at the Karasuma Vocal Medical Insitute to be healers through music, where the healing of illness and injuries via songs is a special technique that improves the mental health of both patients and doctors. And it\'s in this premise that such ""Healers"" strive to sing when called upon to respond to the health and anxiety of patients and doctors alike. It\'s everything else that are just ""more than words can say"" to even explain what\'s going on in this show. The best way that I can put this is through the words of PhenomSage: ""a pretty silly, absurd and childish premise, but...BUT, BUT, BUT, BUT, BUT, that\'s where you\'ll be led astray because the premise is indeed all of this, but this is EXACTLY what gives Healer Girl it\'s whimsical and fun charm."" And if you\'re the type who\'s a fanatic of Disney IPs like High School Musical, I can certainly promise you that Healer Girl delivers the shenanigan-filled musical feels that embraces all of that silliness through love and music in a way that\'s infectiously joyful and worth sing-a-long sessions for days on end.And what makes Healer Girl so wonderfully made in the musical expressivo way are through its characters, done by Princess Principal\'s character designer Yukie Akiya:The literate Healer Girls:- Kana Fujii (VA Karin Isobe, Just Because!\'s Mio Natsume);- Reimi Itsushiro (VA Marina ""HoriMari"" Horiuchi, relatively new Seiyuu);- Hibiki Morishima (VA Akane Kumada, TenSura\'s Eren);- Sonia Yanagi (VA Chihaya Yoshitake, relatively new Seiyuu);- Shinobu Honosaka (VA Miyu Takagi, Wake Up! Girls\'s Miyu Okamoto);Their Healer teacher and friends:- Ria Karasuma (VA Ayahi Takagaki, Symphogear\'s Chris Yukine)- Shoko Nagisa (VA Hisako Tojo, Yatogame-chan Kansatsu Nikki\'s Toshika Jin)And just because there\'s been a resurgence of new Seiyuus lately, doesn\'t mean that quality can\'t be compromised, because it can feel rough for some whom aren\'t used to a main or supporting role. However in Healer Girl\'s case, I would like to beckon this as more of an experimentation for especially the 5 main girls whom vary in experience that pales in comparison to the only well-known Seiyuu here that is Ayahi Takagaki. Despite that, their VA performances here are truly nothing short of stellar, that really compliments well with the show\'s themes being a full-blown musical series that sounds just as nice and heartwarming.To say that I\'m very blown away by a Studio 3Hz original series yet again since the days of 2017\'s Princess Principal, and the marketing for Healer Girl being ""a bold, new form of musical healing animation"", it certainly has eclipsed every embodiment of showcasing limited animation, but letting its visuals do the work, which I\'d tell you, Healer Girl has ACTUAL SAKUGA of unlimited potential that goes beyond the quote of ""a picture paints a thousand words"". And director Yasuhiro Irie definitely understood that assignment, because his directing is just outstanding, for real. Even with the widely-hated scriptwriter-cum-series composer Noboru Kimura\'s script on this (which does feel cheap at times), thankfully this show is saved within the cusps of the FMA: Brotherhood director whom knows how to make something good out of the bad.Easily the most impressive aspect of Healer Girl has gotta be the music itself, since this is what drives the show\'s thematics, supported by Ryo Takahashi of Void_Chords fame. Every episode has its own insert song, which can range from the usual impromptu healing when people are in danger, or something like mere dialogue, which I have definitely NOT seen music mixed in with dialogue that hearkens the High School Musical feel done in anime before. It can sound serious, but in certain episodes like the sports festival where the main healer girls conduct their participation in running and song, that is where I feel the potential really hits its stride by being fun and interconnected that it almost feels funny, yet surprising how this could\'ve worked so brilliantly well.The high point for me, is gotta be the OP and ED. The ED first out of the way, it sounds good and as what you would typically expect of an ending song. But the OP, HOLY GOD THE OP...HOLY WOWSERS it is the most MAJESTICIALLY-sounding opening song ever, that I instantly fell in love with it the first one I\'ve listened to it, and subsequently on repeat like I was on 7th Heaven! Because it does not just look beautiful with musical tapestry all around, but the vocals are just outstanding that just strikes a chord to my heart, not to mention that the ""Healer Girls"" group is just basically the character VAs altogether. If only Ya Boy! Kongming\'s OP didn\'t exist this season, then this would\'ve been my No. 1 OP of the season (2nd place is already better than never) bar none, but maybe that\'s just me since it instantaneously healed me from the get-go.Mark it when I say that Healer Girl is SERIOUSLY, criminally underrated for a show that\'s not for everyone, but for those whom can appreciate this anime, musically-inclined or not, may it bless your heart being a personal great-to-near-masterpiece of a work that you\'ll never forget. As for myself, I know I\'ll never, EVER, forget this spectacular show that came out of nowhere to make my Mondays better alleviating the Blues, and I pray that it does the same to you too. shenanigans, so much so that it\'s easy as balls to write reviews for it like a robot from start to finish.

Even with the widely-hated scriptwriter-cum-series composer Noboru Kimura\'s script on this (which does feel cheap at times), thankfully this show is saved within the cusps of the FMA: Brotherhood director whom knows how to make something good out of the bad.Easily the most impressive aspect of Healer Girl has gotta be the music itself, since this is what drives the show\'s thematics, supported by Ryo Takahashi of Void_Chords fame. Every episode has its own insert song, which can range from the usual impromptu healing when people are in danger, or something like mere dialogue, which I have definitely NOT seen music mixed in with dialogue that hearkens the High School Musical feel done in anime before. It can sound serious, but in certain episodes like the sports festival where the main healer girls conduct their participation in running and song, that is where I feel the potential really hits its stride by being fun and interconnected that it almost feels funny, yet surprising how this could\'ve worked so brilliantly well.The high point for me, is gotta be the OP and ED. The ED first out of the way, it sounds good and as what you would typically expect of an ending song. But the OP, HOLY GOD THE OP...HOLY WOWSERS it is the most MAJESTICIALLY-sounding opening song ever, that I instantly fell in love with it the first one I\'ve listened to it, and subsequently on repeat like I was on 7th Heaven! Because it does not just look beautiful with musical tapestry all around, but the vocals are just outstanding that just strikes a chord to my heart, not to mention that the ""Healer Girls"" group is just basically the character VAs altogether. If only Ya Boy! Kongming\'s OP didn\'t exist this season, then this would\'ve been my No. 1 OP of the season (2nd place is already better than never) bar none, but maybe that\'s just me since it instantaneously healed me from the get-go.Mark it when I say that Healer Girl is SERIOUSLY, criminally underrated for a show that\'s not for everyone, but for those whom can appreciate this anime, musically-inclined or not, may it bless your heart being a personal great-to-near-masterpiece of a work that you\'ll never forget. As for myself, I know I\'ll never, EVER, forget this spectacular show that came out of nowhere to make my Mondays better alleviating the Blues, and I pray that it does the same to you too.', 'While idol shows are extremely popular, we haven’t got many, if any musical anime. This makes Healer Girl one of the most unique shows I have seen in a very long time as well as one of the most enjoyable. An absolutely lovely hidden gem of Spring 2022.Musicals are not something I’m usually into. I normally find the random breaks into musical numbers to be cringe and uncomfortable to watch, so for a show to make me love that really speaks volumes to the writing. Unlike live action musicals, Healer Girl actually takes a pretty intuitive approach to incorporate the acts into the show. Instead...of the girls just randomly breaking out singing ala High School Musical, music is used to heal people in this world. In addition to regular medical personnel, so called Healer Girls are brought along to ensure the successful outcome of operations. The songs that are performed are always accompanied by beautiful visuals, lovely animation and of course some really amazing vocal talent, making them a treat to watch.As with any wholesome and cozy show, the characters are the biggest sell of the show. Each and every girl in this show is waifu material and generally loveable. Personally, I fell in love with Reimi from the moment she appeared on screen. By far one of the best girls of the year. The other girls all have unique backstories and bring something different to the table creating an awesome experience.As I said before, Healer Girl was easily the most slept on show of the season and it’s a shame. It really was such a nice way to start the week and lived up to its title by offering some nice healing after a long weekend. I will really miss the girls, performances and that gorgeous art style.Healer Girl gets 10 notes out of 10. of the girls just randomly breaking out singing ala High School Musical, music is used to heal people in this world.

And to think this was the anime that made me do that... I\'m smiling again just thinking about it.Now, before I review this anime, because I am 100% sure that a lot of people skipped this series and wrote it off as ""generic moe sol anime but with healing"", I just wanna say that technically you\'re not wrong for thinking that. What I\'m trying to say is that this anime is not for everyone. If you hate music anime, then this isn\'t for you. If you hate female protagonists then...this also isn\'t for you. Are you still here reading my review? Good. Now let\'s start breaking down why I think this is the Best Anime this season (and possibly the Best Anime this year).First, is the plot. It\'s not the strongest plot out there ngl. It even started pretty generic with the protagonist (Kana) showcasing her abilities, as well as the concept of this whole show. Healing via Singing. This type of concept is not unique to this anime, but it\'s definitely the first series to dedicate a whole anime just for the concept alone. And I have to say, they handled the healing via singing thingy pretty well. There\'s not a point in this anime where the girls healed someone via singing and broke my immersion, because the singing ability is still grounded in real-life rules. For a simpler explanation, the singing is strictly for helping the patient lose their pain or calm their nerves. In other words, they\'re like a band-aid and an anesthetics in one package. They\'re not like the go-to solution to every pain and disease, no. That job still goes to doctors, and the Healer Girls are mostly there to assist the doctors.These things are so simple yet so effective to make the world feel believable in my opinion. And that is this anime\'s strongest strength. Another one of its strength is the pacing. Each episode have perfect pacing that perfectly handles the conflicts in that episode. My only complaint is how in a certain episode in the latter half, they kinda f*cked up the whole sequence of cuts with present and flashbacks which is kinda confusing. Other than that, it\'s all perfect.Then the characters. The characters here are all interesting and likable. Sonya is definitely the Best Girl for me. But all of them are all good girls that deserve headpats for how hard they work. They each have their development throughout the series which makes their growth a joy to watch. And their interactions with one another and how different they are from another person are also fun to see because it shows how they aren\'t just one-dimensional cardboards that can be replaced with anything. They\'re not complex and full of nuisance kind of characters, but they are still well-written characters. The side characters as well are memorable characters that had some kind of impact on the story and the characters, whether it\'s to develop them or to further the world-building of the series.Let\'s move to the animation department. It\'s amazing. This is probably the best animation that I\'ve seen that is not ufotable, kyoani, wit, or mappa. This is just that good. Its fluid with its every movement, and it barely has off-models in each frame. The art is also very consistent which is always a plus in my book. The direction too is pretty well-done. There are always meaningful and interesting shots, as well as a beautiful sequence when the girls start singing. It\'s just a joy to watch.Then lastly, the music. I\'m not someone to be considered when talking about music, but I know good music when I hear it. And this anime has plenty of bangers in its catalog. The ost, insert songs, opening, ending... all of them are so good. And that\'s to be expected from a music anime. But this is just so great, definitely up there with Love Live music imo.Overall, I just love how solid the foundation of this anime is. It has a strong concept that greatly integrates with irl mechanics that keeps my immersion from breaking. The cast is strong and full of interesting personalities. The animation and music departments are all top-notch. It\'s just an anime with minimal flaws, and that\'s why I think that this is the Best Anime this season.(9.6/10) this also isn\'t for you.

Animation, characters, sound, etc. are all strong. It's a well-thought-out idea that also feels refreshing.Story: Pretty simple and non-episodic.  While you essentially get dropped into the middle of things, it eases you into the world and feeds you information in a way that you don't feel lost. One of the strongest aspects is the comedy, it hasn't been too dramatic so far. Possibly the most unique thing about Healer Girl is the singing and how it's used while having normal conversations. I feel like that's one of the most fun things in the episodes so far....Pacing felt neither slow or fast. I think most would say the story is predictable but I thought it had a nice flow to it. 8/10.Art: Again a lot to be impressed by. While not entirely consistent or polished, the animation and drawings are strong. Color and character designs are very good. Things like cars that are hand drawn which is something you don't see often. During the climactic moments, it hits a remarkable peak that really blew me away with it's animation.  The reason I didn't score the Art higher is because I think the backgrounds & compositing are a tier below from what I praised about it. It's not poor but just good. 8/10.Sound: I love the voice acting from all of the characters. Especially when you consider the difficulty of the role and that they are also doing the singing portions instead of having a different seiyuu. The OST, insert songs, and singing conversations are playful, fun, and enjoyable. When the singing is not playful and used in a more serious manner, like aiding a person in need, it instead feels more caring and has a beautiful aura to it. 10/10.Character: Impressive considering it's been 3 episodes. A number of characters are likeable and distinct. It's not just 1 or 2 standouts that are carrying the show. Even the character that I had considered the weakest previously already has an episode where she is given more screen time. I wouldn't call the characters deep but are well fleshed out considering the episode count. A fun dynamic with all of the characters whether it's between friends, teacher-students, or rivals. Most of the student characters have separate strengths/weaknesses that further builds their character. I believe there's potential for them to grow much more in the future as well. 9/10.Enjoyment: I've been enjoying how unique Healer Girl is. Whether it's the directing, the character dynamics, or the more beautiful intimate moments I've found the episodes engaging and fun. If you typically dislike CGDCT or the idea of spontaneous singing every once in a while, Healer Girl might not be for you. However if you have always wanted a musical anime or want something bright, funny and lively, definitely give it a try. 10/10. Pacing felt neither slow or fast.

The majority of the runtime is spent doing typical CGDCT stuff like school festivals or summer vacation stuff. i.e. going through the motions without doing anything special. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but when you're me and you've watched a...ton of the stuff, it all ends up blending together and the one thing that would have otherwise made this show stand out just doesn't do enough.So, what? The girls do end up singing a lot, but most of the healing is delegated to emotional healing, i.e. singing songs to make people feel better, as opposed to actual healing, which as I said only happens a handful of times throughout the whole show. There are plenty of other shows where the main cast also sing to make other people feel better in one-off episodes, so already the defining feature, the very core of the whole show is rendered moot.Then again, maybe I'm being too harsh. I really like the MCs and the songs are really well done, particularly the OP. But at the end of the day Healer Girl is an unremarkable, if nothing-wrong show that never tries to exceed expectations or to stand out in a genre swamped with many other similar shows. But hey, they'll sing a song and make you a bit happier, and isn't that all that matters?No. No it doesn't.6/10 ton of the stuff, it all ends up blending together and the one thing that would have otherwise made this show stand out just doesn't do enough.So, what?

And from the very first episode, it definitely felt that this show had the potential to become something special.The concept of Healer Girl is fairly straight forward - it\'s a show about girls that heal, through the power of music....My first thought was that this show would be done in some sort of fantasy setting, so it was a nice surprise seeing that these elements were actually incorporated into a modern, normal life setting. Though simple, finding an original and unheard-of concept used in a music anime was a nice change of tune.At its core, the show is a slice-of-life about cute girls striving to chase their dreams, with each of them having their own motivations for choosing the path of becoming a Healer. The three main characters have good chemistry with their own unique personalities complimenting each other, and the rival and supporting cast have so far also been fairly fleshed-out.Now for the main focus – the music. Combined with the voice acting, they have all been done phenomenally. The seiyuus present a very convincing performance on both spoken dialogues, and song segments especially (also worth noting that the main 4 are the ones that sung both the OP and ED), they are all definitely very talented both as singers and voice actresses. From the incorporation of singing in fun casual conversations à la musical theatre, to the more serious choir-like healing sequences, it definitely feels that you – as the viewer, are also being soothed by their melodies as they sing. It is without a doubt, the strongest aspect of this anime.The art and animation are fairly well-done, especially during movement or dancing sequences which flow naturally. Backgrounds are nothing too special, but it gets the job done and even has the opportunity to shine in certain scenes. As for the main character designs, I quite like their color schemes, it fits the characters’ personalities well.However, if there would be something I feel that is lacking, it would be the lore and worldbuilding. I think it would be nice to see a full explanation of the concepts of healing through music, such as explaining how certain songs get healing properties, or rules and limitations needed to make them work. This can make for a more immersive experience, but has only been teased in little snippets of dialogue. The current story arcs and plot points can also feel a bit out of pace sometimes, but so far hasn’t led to any serious issues. Despite its flaws, the potential for a fleshed-out story is still present, so we’ll just have to wait and see how it wraps up.Overall, the comedic, serious, and musical moments of Healer Girl all work together to offer an enjoyable experience, and watching it feels much like drinking a nice blend of coffee that fills the cup of a slow Monday morning. If you’re looking for a lighthearted, comfy, feel-good show to start the week, and are a fan of cute girls doing cute things, definitely do give this one a shot.

People could make anime and manga for pretty much anything, from simple, slice-of-life stories with little to no conflict, or they can go balls to the wall wild and come up with the absolute craziest premises you can think of, and Japan would have no problem putting them on TV. I mean, where else can you find an anime about a general from imperial China being reincarnated into modern day Japan and helping a girl pursue a music career? Or a show about a bunch of buff dudes using sentient...monsters named after famous songs and bands to fight each other across generations and family trees? Or about a guy who fights crime while his head is literally a chainsaw? Or a show about a spy, an assassin, and a mind-reading child becoming a fake family in order to fulfill a mission sanctioned by their government? So the fact that Japan just recently made a cute anime about high school girls using singing acapella as a means to heal peoples\' injuries and have it be treated as a valid medical pursuit, along with basically making it a musical at points, should be just as fun and interesting, right? Ehh...Healer Girl is fine for what it is, but it stumbles a lot in terms of how it handles its premise and many other things.Me saying that Healer Girl is about high school girls singing as a means of healing people medically is not an exaggeration. Basically, three young women—Kana, Reimi, and Hibiki—work at a medical clinic in a small town as apprentice healers alongside their famous mentor Ria. In this world, singing and music can be used as medicine and has been officially recognized as a valid medical pursuit. Kana in particular is eager to become a healer after having been saved by one as a child, and is determined to follow in their footsteps. But so far, she and her friends are trainees and still have a lot to learn before they can earn their licenses. They also have to deal with a rival healer from another clinic, Sonia, who is determined to beat Ria at her own game, and their own personal flaws if they want to grow as healers.So...yeah. Healer Girl is basically an anime musical in the vein of Sing a Bit of Harmony, complete with characters bursting into song at completely random times, even when it\'s not needed. I mean, when your whole premise involves having magic healers work side by side with surgeons, pharmacists, and traditional medical doctors, and leaning very heavily into the musical themes, it\'s kind of inevitable. Now, the premise by itself is actually pretty interesting, and Healer Girl does manage to do things with it, from showing the main trio actually learning the ins and outs of healing with song, having them actually partake in singing while an actual surgery is going on, the limits of what they can do at their current level, and so on. Plus, Healer Girl also manages to smartly avoid going the pseudoscience route in the vein of ""You can cure cancer by singing!"" by empathizing that healing with song isn\'t without its drawbacks, and that even in the show\'s universe, advances in medicine still can\'t cure everything. On that note, I can definitely respect Healer Girl for going all in on its premise and having a more nuanced, holistic approach to health care. The colorful, smooth animation also helps with this, making for some great visuals and imagery...though, whose bright idea was it to have the main girls have two-colored hair? It just looks weird!Of course, that doesn\'t always mean Healer Girl sticks the landing, and if you couldn\'t tell by the rating, there\'s lots of areas where the show really stumbles. For one, Healer Girl as a show is extremely cheesy, treacly, and saccharine. The whole show is a bright, candy colored piece of fluff where any and all conflicts are resolved pretty easily, leaving it without much in the way of tension, and any resolutions it does offer are pretty anticlimactic. The middle section especially suffers, with the sports and cultural festival episodes being the most egregious offenders, what with having the characters sing-talk for 80% of the former, and somehow being able to flawlessly play instruments while wearing full body animal costumes in the latter. Both were completely ridiculous and really dumb. There are also times when Healer Girl seems to have very little regard for following its own rules. In one episode, when the main trio sing to soothe a surgeon\'s nerves, which has all the complexity of your typical Disney fairy tale wave a magic wand and get your happily ever after, they sing in a closed room, but in another episode, the girls sing WHILE in the operating room, not wearing any masks or scrubs or anything of the like, just three feet away from the surgeons and the operating table. Uh, hello?! Did the staff behind this show just forget that hospitals have strict hygiene rules, especially when surgeries are being conducted?! Say what you will about Gray\'s Anatomy, at least that show didn\'t feel the need to have surgeons and nurses not wear scrubs and masks while in the operating room! I\'m pretty sure anyone who doesn\'t wear masks or scrubs while in the operating room would get fired for putting a patient\'s life at risk for infections if they did that. Basically, at times Healer Girl goes all in on its premise, but also makes serious missteps and undermines itself at times to the point where your suspension of disbelief is broken and you can\'t take the story seriously anymore.The characters by themselves are perfectly fine. Nothing groundbreaking, since they start off as pretty blatant archetypes at first, and their character development is pretty predictable as well. Most of the side characters don\'t really do much, with Shinobu being the biggest victim of this, though I do appreciate that the anime put in the effort to give Sonia more depth to her over making her another typical alpha bitch stereotype. If there is one thing that the show does manage to nail, its the chemistry between the main trio. By themselves, Kana, Reimi, and Hibiki are pretty stock standard, but their interactions and banter do feel genuine and organic, and they actually feel like a close-knit group of gal pals who do everything together and truly cherish each other...though Reimi\'s whole exaggerated, obsessive, crush-like worship of Ria is pretty creepy and annoying. Plus, the show also gets some points for having plenty of adult women as respected leaders in the medical field. But as it stands, the characters have about as much depth as the cast in every Love Live series ever, which is to say...not much.Plus, for a series that banks itself on its music, the actual songs are pretty...dull. I mean, I liked most of them, but many of the songs are the exact same boring acapella ballads but with different lyrics, with very little in the way of variety. On one hand, I could understand not wanting to have the healers sing or play heavy metal music during an operation on a patient, as that\'d probably ruin a surgeon\'s concentration to the point that they\'d put their patients\' lives at risk, but nowhere does the series make any mention of this in-universe. Every single song is just plain generic, well sung as they are, and feel copy-pasted from other ones that came before it. It says a lot that the actual background music feels more inspired than the actual songs. Then again, I do listen to the opening theme song a lot, so I\'m a complete hypocrite, and other shows have done far worse than Healer Girl has, so I don\'t want to be too hard on the show.Basically, Healer Girl is sweet, saccharine, treacly, nice and fluff. Nothing groundbreaking, but nothing really bad either. It stumbles a lot, but it does have its heart in the right place. Healer Girl as an anime is perfectly wholesome, though doesn\'t have much to offer than that, but it could be a great anime you can use to get your preteen relatives into anime for the first time. The show feels like it was made specifically for girls, so it\'d be a nice gateway anime for your daughter, kid sister, niece, or what have you. It may be a little too overly sweet and sugary for me, but Healer Girl is better than most if you\'re into anime about cute girls singing wholesome ballads and want a nice musical to bop your head to. Also, can you believe this is directed by the same guy who directed Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood and Kurau Phantom Memory? monsters named after famous songs and bands to fight each other across generations and family trees? Or about a guy who fights crime while his head is literally a chainsaw? Or a show about a spy, an assassin, and a mind-reading child becoming a fake family in order to fulfill a mission sanctioned by their government? So the fact that Japan just recently made a cute anime about high school girls using singing acapella as a means to heal peoples\' injuries and have it be treated as a valid medical pursuit, along with basically making it a musical at points, should be just as fun and interesting, right? Ehh...Healer Girl is fine for what it is, but it stumbles a lot in terms of how it handles its premise and many other things.Me saying that Healer Girl is about high school girls singing as a means of healing people medically is not an exaggeration. Basically, three young women—Kana, Reimi, and Hibiki—work at a medical clinic in a small town as apprentice healers alongside their famous mentor Ria. In this world, singing and music can be used as medicine and has been officially recognized as a valid medical pursuit. Kana in particular is eager to become a healer after having been saved by one as a child, and is determined to follow in their footsteps. But so far, she and her friends are trainees and still have a lot to learn before they can earn their licenses. They also have to deal with a rival healer from another clinic, Sonia, who is determined to beat Ria at her own game, and their own personal flaws if they want to grow as healers.So...yeah. Healer Girl is basically an anime musical in the vein of Sing a Bit of Harmony, complete with characters bursting into song at completely random times, even when it\'s not needed. I mean, when your whole premise involves having magic healers work side by side with surgeons, pharmacists, and traditional medical doctors, and leaning very heavily into the musical themes, it\'s kind of inevitable. Now, the premise by itself is actually pretty interesting, and Healer Girl does manage to do things with it, from showing the main trio actually learning the ins and outs of healing with song, having them actually partake in singing while an actual surgery is going on, the limits of what they can do at their current level, and so on. Plus, Healer Girl also manages to smartly avoid going the pseudoscience route in the vein of ""You can cure cancer by singing!"" by empathizing that healing with song isn\'t without its drawbacks, and that even in the show\'s universe, advances in medicine still can\'t cure everything. On that note, I can definitely respect Healer Girl for going all in on its premise and having a more nuanced, holistic approach to health care. The colorful, smooth animation also helps with this, making for some great visuals and imagery...though, whose bright idea was it to have the main girls have two-colored hair? It just looks weird!Of course, that doesn\'t always mean Healer Girl sticks the landing, and if you couldn\'t tell by the rating, there\'s lots of areas where the show really stumbles. For one, Healer Girl as a show is extremely cheesy, treacly, and saccharine. The whole show is a bright, candy colored piece of fluff where any and all conflicts are resolved pretty easily, leaving it without much in the way of tension, and any resolutions it does offer are pretty anticlimactic. The middle section especially suffers, with the sports and cultural festival episodes being the most egregious offenders, what with having the characters sing-talk for 80% of the former, and somehow being able to flawlessly play instruments while wearing full body animal costumes in the latter. Both were completely ridiculous and really dumb. There are also times when Healer Girl seems to have very little regard for following its own rules. In one episode, when the main trio sing to soothe a surgeon\'s nerves, which has all the complexity of your typical Disney fairy tale wave a magic wand and get your happily ever after, they sing in a closed room, but in another episode, the girls sing WHILE in the operating room, not wearing any masks or scrubs or anything of the like, just three feet away from the surgeons and the operating table. Uh, hello?! Did the staff behind this show just forget that hospitals have strict hygiene rules, especially when surgeries are being conducted?! Say what you will about Gray\'s Anatomy, at least that show didn\'t feel the need to have surgeons and nurses not wear scrubs and masks while in the operating room! I\'m pretty sure anyone who doesn\'t wear masks or scrubs while in the operating room would get fired for putting a patient\'s life at risk for infections if they did that.

A show that takes on the genre of musical theater in a serious way, it has just enough depth to keep it from being entirely light and fluffy, though it yearns to find its full voice.You will know if you want to go through the rest of the show by the time the opening on Episode 1 ends. The theme of this show is right there in the title, ""healing"", which is also representative of its specific anime subgenre, Iyashikei. Not only does the story revolve around...the healing power of music, it\'s meant to make you feel good above everything else. This does unfortunately mean that it holds back on dramatic and powerful exploration of its mixed medical-magical setting.Being neither a comedy nor a drama, the characters are mostly defined by their likes and goals, which are fairly well realized. I never purely felt that any of the main cast was a pure archetype, and the tight web of relationships says a lot of subtle things about each of them. It\'s a testament to why Iyashikei stories are popular, despite not having traditional forms of overwhelming conflict. The director of this show also directed Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood so you know he has the chops to make a lot out of a little.The show\'s look is very appealing, though there are very few truly incredible moments of animation. What it is able to do is wring out a lot out of the climactic musical sequences, even if they are a little bit held back by the simplicity of the frame count. Magic truly feels magical and actual spontaneous singing - integrated into the story - is given a directorial care that really pulls you into the moment. It\'s effective musical theater that\'s only able to use spectacle occasionally, but very well.What\'s clear about Healer Girl\'s story is that it\'s more about *themes* than plot. This is a real shame because there\'s a lot of world details that are calling out desperately for more exploration. The relationship between healing and the sciences, the various forms which Healers are able to observe as they sing, why unpracticed healing needs to be regulated. All of these details are only lightly touched upon, creating a certain air of mystery but begging for proper development. What we get instead is learning about the building blocks of the main girls, why they got into the profession and why they have the bond they do now. It\'s depth that is used to make the little details and interactions shine for than the main center of the story.The overall theme of healing begets perhaps the biggest narrative point to the show, passing knowledge on. Learning is at the center of every episode in some way or other. There\'s experimentation, problem solving, formal and informal training, mentorship, and inspiration. These are not delved into as much as they should be, again only hinting at what\'s possible if the show took a more dramatic tone. It perhaps would have been good if the songs were more crafted to explore that, but despite actual wording in the show saying that the content of a song was important, they tend to be more generally uplifting rather than targeted, save for a few cases.Healer Girl does a lot with the concept of a musical anime that people who like musicals will love. There\'s always a song in each episode, all interestingly placed with their own unique narrative purpose. It makes me relish the potential of these two forms of storytelling, while also acknowledging that what we were given was plenty enjoyable by itself. Taking Healer Girl on its own terms as the specific something it is, I do truly think it\'s worth your time. At the same time, the biggest flaw of the show is the tepidness to go further with its best aspects to lean too hard into the type of genre it is. I\'ve never wanted a sequel or spiritual successor to something more than this show.(Side Note: This anime was also made under very amiable circumstances, according to the director. While it doesn\'t have the \'oomph\' presentation of something like Bocchi the Rock! or even Flip Flappers by the same studio I can still see the love put into the production and I think it\'s important to relish ethically-made shows even if they aren\'t the most impressive.

Healer Girl was so enjoyable I felt it was time to finally break that streak.It found a great way to blend the mundane with the majestic. The table stakes aren't saving the world here, they're saving your neighbor or family friend with the power of the Healer songs. Still Healer Girl does a great job of drawing you in as you become attached to the characters and their journey to grow and improve.The music and art were definitely my favorite parts of this show as the characters singing...conjures up beautiful landscapes visualizations of their songs healing power.It gets off to a bit of a slow start but after a few episodes I was hooked.  This is on pace to probably be my anime of the year. conjures up beautiful landscapes visualizations of their songs healing power.It gets off to a bit of a slow start but after a few episodes I was hooked.  This is on pace to probably be my anime of the year."", ""Disney Pseudoscience.Healer Girl is a fun, slice-of-life, moé shows about three high schoolers pursuing a medical career by becoming “Healers”, doctors(?) who can heal people using only the power of their singing voice.Well-animated and very colourful, there's a lot to like about this anime. The core three apprentices Kana, Reimi and Hibiki have excellent character chemistry from beginning to end and their interactions are both charming and amusing. The fourth poster healer Sonia who is Kana's more experienced healer classmate is very underutilised which is probably for the best because, in all honesty, her presence can get a bit insufferable.The singing is notable...because it’s not just tied to their jobs as healers. The three of them can just burst into song over literally anything and the animation is so crisp and whimsical that you’d be mistaken in thinking this anime was made to be a Disney+ exclusive. It’s cute, charming and sometimes funny as it’s very clear the girls are ad-libbing lyrics. It’s a nice touch.However, the show is very light on story and actual character development so after a couple of episodes the song-and-dance formula starts to get stale. When that happens you start to think about the actual lore and logistics of a clinic that has a doctor sit and sing (presumably unaccompanied) at a patient with a broken leg before giving out medical advice and the world-building starts to fall apart. The show doesn’t confirm whether or not these singing powers are actual magic or powers so when you watch a literal open-heart surgery scene with girls dressed in white singing at the surgeons you can help but feel the concept has turned a bit stupid.

No biggie if it’s not your thing.', ""In a season with so much good anime to watch it may be easy to overlook and even disregard some of the less popular shows such as Healer Girl. Luckily, I was fortunate enough to have stumbled across one of this show’s many songs in an online forum and thought it might be worth checking out. I was pleasantly surprised to hear about the premise of the show and decided to give it a try despite not having heard much about it from any of my friends or really any of the internet for that matter.Story: 6I think the idea of music having healing properties...is quite nice. As a musician myself, I absolutely love the incorporation of music into magic systems and lore, especially since that means we get to enjoy a show that puts its music front and center. Unfortunately, I feel that the story and the world Healer Girl takes place in don’t reach their full potential. At several points, the show misses the opportunity to expand or explain the musical healing process and instead chooses to pursue a more slice-of-life storyline. I think this leaves the world feeling a bit shallow in terms of lore which consequently fails to really immerse viewers. Story arcs seem to progress at a moderate pace with some minor pacing issues that lead to big, emotional moments a bit too soon for them to have their full impact. Nonetheless, later episodes have proven the show is capable of carrying out good story telling with the Aoi-san arc.Art: 7The art in this show is pretty good. While it’s not quite up to par with some of the other shows of 2022, it doesn’t disappoint. The characters look pretty good with only minor dips in quality from time to time. Personally, I am a fan of the art style, but I can imagine some viewers not being too impressed with this shows visuals given the state of animation in modern, high-budget anime like Komi-san and Love is War.Sound: 9I think it’s fair to say that a show about the healing power of music is expected to have really good music. Well, in this respect Healer Girl truly delivers! The opening and ending songs are fantastic, and the various musical numbers and other original songs throughout the show really enhance the story telling. I think the creators struck a nice balance between serious and lighthearted music and as a result the music never gets old despite nearly every episode having two or so original songs. Ultimately, the music really gives the show the extra push it needs to be something that I would genuinely recommend to music lovers. All the vocals (voice acting and singing) are done by talented musicians, several of whom are J-pop artists, so the overall quality is solid.Characters: 7The major characters in this show, Kana, Hibiki, and Reimi, are all students at a healing clinic studying under their mentor Ria Karasuma. The three girls get a fairly equal amount of screentime and focus throughout the show giving the sense that they all belong in the role of main character, but it is clear from the beginning that Kana is the true main character, as the story mostly centers around her growth as a healer and the various challenges she faces along the way with Hibiki and Reimi supporting her as close friends. These three main characters are a great pairing in my opinion; they all have their own faults and strengths, but when they're together, they support each other are stronger for it. However nice these characters may be, the quality of a show isn’t only defined by its main characters, but also its side characters, and unfortunately Healer Girl’s side characters don’t meet the same quality markers as Kana, Hibiki, and Reimi. Minor characters such as Sonia and Shinobu seem lacking in many respects, and I find it difficult to really care much about them in the grand scheme of things. Even when entire episodes are dedicated to them such as the school festival arc, they still come out on the other side feeling rather one-dimensional. Other minor characters aren’t very memorable and don’t seem to have a purpose at many times other than to simply provide dialogue to further the story. Luckily, this gets better as the show progresses, and by the latter half of the season we start to see some of the recurring side characters have moments that start to build them into a more fleshed out persona.Enjoyment: 8Despite some of its flaws, I genuinely enjoy watching this show. It delivers an interesting story with relatively good characters and great music. If you’re in the market for something light hearted and happy that doesn't require a large amount of emotional investment, then Healer Girl is something you’ll probably enjoy!

And  its just too realistic (for me) and characters looks pretty good especially Hibiki-chan my fav with some minor dips in quality.The series  seems fair to state about healing power music is expected to have a good music which is they aimed it perfectly and quite unique.Overall, I just can't believe how beautiful this anime is the visuals, the songs. It's just amazing. I was in awe in how...the surgery was portrayed in the song (referring to episode 9). It was absolutely perfect! The post credit scene was cute too. the surgery was portrayed in the song (referring to episode 9). It was absolutely perfect!

Can't really think of a show like this to be honest as it feels more like a musical than anything at this point.Story: The only real overarching storyline is of the three girls training to become a full fledge healer.  Everything else is episodic as they treat different people each episode all while learning the intricacies of being a healer.Art: The characters are well drawn but where the art really shines is during the song portions.  The way the...imagery changes as they sing when things go from good to bad and bad to good is great.  The ground crumbling away from the patient when their condition worsens only to be rebuilt and turned into a vast meadow by the end is great.Sound: Show is very much a musical as the sounds of the instruments change with the condition of the patient and the girls sing to correct any of the negative changes and you can hear as when a patient starts to stabilize the music becomes more cheerful/hopeful.  Then there's just the times when they sing for the sake of it and it feels very musical like.Characters: Each one of them has their own reasoning to be a healer they also have their own unique personalities.  Seeing how they interact with each other and try to help each other when they feel down and cheer them up is fun to watch.Overall probably one of the most unique shows to come out in some time with a premise honestly I thought would have been done by now seeing as we have tons of shows related to music, but I can't think of another or at least one with an atmosphere like this. imagery changes as they sing when things go from good to bad and bad to good is great.

Maybe that's my fault for not double-checking how many episodes this season would have, but in my defense, it's a bold move to have your final episode involve splitting up the central cast and sending one of them to the other side of the ocean. That's something you usually have to spend at least two episodes on! That surprise may also be why I'm kind of split on this final episode.On the one hand, it does a pretty solid job of wrapping things up in a way that feels satisfying without precluding the possibility of a...continuation. There's no sequel baiting, because Healer Girl isn't a show about plot to begin with, but it's clear that while our Healer trio have hit a significant milestone in their journey, there's still plenty more left for them and Ria to do. We do get one important reveal – that helping Kana on that plane all those years ago was what inspired Ria to fully dedicate herself to Healing – and that's a great way to bring this whole story full circle, at least in a thematic sense. After all the times we've seen Ria working as their mentor, it's a touching reminder that helping these girls grow is also fulfilling to her as well.Likewise, our trio just happening to be on a plane with a young girl having an asthma attack stretches the limits of dramatic convenience, but also this is Healer Girl. If you have that much cynicism over something like that, you probably tapped out back when they had the catgirl maid concert. This show has long been willing to sever the reigns of realism for the sake of schmaltz, and I wouldn't want it to stop in its final half-hour. Cheesy as it is, it's also a sweet way to show just how far our girls have come from the start, and to signify them reaching a new stage of their journey where they can begin paying forward with the things they've learned from their mentors.On the other hand though, this episode introduces a ton of cool ideas that just don't get the time to breathe, because whoops we also have to end the series. They send Kana all the way to the United States for her month-long internship, and we see basically none of it. Hibiki spends a whole month sitting in on surgeries and studying with doctors, but it's all shown in a brief montage. Reimi goes to Sonia's clinic and they have a duet but we never even get to hear it! These are really exciting concepts you could build a whole story arc around, allowing the girls to grow and change while apart. Yet we just have to accept that it all happened off-screen because we still need to get these healer blobs on an airplane for the closing segment. There are still a few solid moments – Reimi's reasoning for cutting her hair (and Sonia being adorably tsundere about it) stands out in my memory – but on the whole this is a bizarre way to tease really interesting story ideas that are just glossed over, and it definitely deflates this finale for me.On the third, mutant hand extending out of my shoulder that's constantly doing jazz hands, it's hard to stay too angry at this episode/show when it has the gall to end it on a full musical number. And by that I mean it's not just the characters dancing and singing, nor is it merely a Healing Image. Going by the eyelines and reactions of every non-Healer character, it seems like Kana, Hibiki, Reimi, Sonia, and Shinobu are flying over the city through sheer power of song. The cynic in me wants to complain about this weird break from literalism, but that part of me has been in the ICU since episode three, and the rest of my psyche was too busy looking out the window and seal clapping to listen to it. This is the perfect move for Healer Girl to end on, throwing realism out the window for a pure explosion of sentiment, music, and indulgent animation.And that seems to be it for this colorful, fluffy bundle of cotton candy. A few times now I've compared it to Love Live!, and at the end that still feels like a pretty apt point of reference. While it stumbled more than a few times with heavier drama, at its core Healer Girl has mostly succeeded in being the bubbly, musical, unerringly sweet show it set out to be. Like anything sweet, it can definitely be Too Much at times, but to belabor one last musical metaphor, it's like a bubblegum pop song: simple, effervescent, and just the perfect kind of catchy to stay stuck in your head until the heat death of the universe. continuation.

Bottom line: it\'s quite good! The singers harmonize well and the instrumentation is meant to be emotive and at times tearjerky, but you\'re not going to find a whole lot of straight bangers on the level of Zombieland Saga Revenge (S2). It is nonetheless a pleasant entry in the genre of music anime.Story (6/10): The premise is fairly simple. There is a semi-magical branch of medicine that can be done with singing, and each of the episodes revolves around the main characters (healers in training) helping people, including each other, with...their songs and learning more about music and themselves. Most of the episodes follow the ""someone needs healing but standard medical treatment isn\'t available"" pattern [enter magic music Healing], but a few episodes are dedicated to exploring different settings, skills, and character backstories. There was one particular episode where the plot seemed quite contrived to establish a ""reset"" by the end of the episode, but I\'m nitpicking.Being semi-formulaic is by no means a crime, but if you are looking for a deep overarching, consequential plot or a really deep character exploration, this ain\'t it. It\'s good, but nothing to write home about.Characters (6/10): As is the case with many anime surrounding niche interests/disciplines/fields/whatever, each of the main characters as well as most of the supporting cast is color-coded and represents some aspect of that discipline in which they are especially skilled... and most of them don\'t really have many more character traits than the couple they need to fulfill that role. They did do a nice little character exploration of their inferiority complexes and imposter syndrome later in the season, but for the most part each of them stays in their box. All together, the cast harmonizes well, but individually their characters don\'t have an abundance of exploration or development. The fact that one of the character\'s main traits was ""simp for sensei"" got on my nerves for a bit, tbh, but even she gets some last-minute self-reflection. Overall, good, not great, but with a sizable cast and only 12 eps to work with, what can you do?Art (8/10): The art is overall very pretty. There\'s a little too much ""green field with lakes"" for my taste in all the infinite musical ""images"" that the Healers can propagate, but they\'re well done and expand on their repertoire as the series goes on and do a fascinating visualization of a surgery assist later on. The OP is animated very well... perhaps too well, as their effusive hand gestures honestly creeped me out on my first few viewings. The characters are animated very well overall, and the animators knew how to draw the eye away from scenes where they needed to cut corners for one reason or another. All in all, the visuals accompanied and enhanced the music skillfully and brought the most out of their characters while also not necessarily being breathtaking. Quality stuff.Sound (8/10): This is a music anime, and the singers are good. That\'s the most important thing in my book. The voice actors give good performances for their limited characters as well. There were an abundance of songs used (at least one new song per episode) both in Healing and as a narration device, which the musical-lover in me enjoyed. That being said, I wasn\'t necessarily blown away by any one of the specific performances. They were all pretty, competently to very well done, and fit what was happening in the story, but there is a limited range of emotion involved in many of the songs. The subtitle of the series is ""Kindhearted, powerful songs heal the world"", and virtually all the songs in the series fit the ""kindhearted"" description. Again, nothing wrong with a series accomplishing exactly what it sets out to do, but I do feel like there was a missed opportunity to explore via music some of the frustrations and feelings of inadequacy that the show at least cursorily explored.Overall, this was an enjoyable series about cute girls singing cute magical songs to help the people around them while learning a little bit more about themselves.

I had a good time with it, though it did not heal my COVID. 7/10', 'I hated everything about this show, from the first minute of this show I already hated it. There will be spoilers for a few things so bare that in mind and everything I write about will be extremely personal and subjective as to why I hate it. If I wanted to go into extreme detail, outlining everything I disliked about it would be to long and take to much time but I will go over a few things.Firstly I hate the interactions of every character. Every interaction between them feel superficial and bland. An example, in the last episode when the red hair girl goes...to America her friends get worried because she is not messaging them and then they go to America to visit with a dumb music montage and low and behold her phone is dead and other is out of range and she has this wow omg what a surprise and then explains why afterword and her blond hair friend is like wow this is dumb. The reason I hate this and every single interaction in this show is pretty simple. Firstly its generic, you can see how everything is going to play out from start to end which isn\'t always a bad thing but it\'s so stale and adds nothing new for me. Secondly how they act, in that example their so fucking loud and hyper, talking at mach 10 speed. Something about that really annoys me and irritates me plus added bonus with the dumb sound affects added to the surprise and realization annoy me as well. Last part of it is their voices, I hate their vocal characteristics. Their tone, pitch, volume, pronunciation, rhythm, and the pace at which they speak annoy me to no end. This is just one example of a long list of many but it\'s time to move on.Another thing I heavily dislike is the music. I do enjoy musicals, Sound of Music is a great movie and most Disney movies are okay but every time they break out into song in this series it makes me wanna die. I know it\'s their job to sing and be a ""Healer Girl"" but I hate it. When they were singing not once but twice during 2 separate surgeries I just died of cringe and not even a funny type of cringe just pure and utter cringe. I know some people enjoy their songs and voices but I hated it, didn\'t enjoy the songs, they are good singers but I didn\'t like their voices and having to hear it multiple times an episode in the most cringy ways made me actually wanna shove pencils into my ears.I obviously don\'t like the characters either. They feel so fake like their made of plastic. Nothing original about their decisions, personalities, behaviors, or their dialogue. To me everything about them was annoying and bland. Let me explain this with my least favorite episode of the entire series, episode 11. Their angry because they are failing at their singing and throughout the entire episode their depressed and get mad at each other. Red hair girl thinks she\'s the issue and says they are better then her and should do it without her which annoys me. Blond hair girl doesn\'t understand and disagrees and lashes back which causes a riff in their relationship for the rest of the episode until they have just the worst back and forth I had to listen to. They all talk about how the other is better then the other, how wow your so much more impressive then me and then no you are more impressive until they all come together in harmony saying ""because you\'re both so good! I really love your singing! And I\'m so jealous"" Then have the hehehe we all like each other and now we are friends again cliche which I hate every time I see it.In conclusion if you dislike generic and bland mediocre looking girls trying to do cute things then don\'t watch this. I would still give the first episode a try to see if you might enjoy this and it might be right up your alley but for me it wasn\'t and I never wanna see anything about this show again. to America her friends get worried because she is not messaging them and then they go to America to visit with a dumb music montage and low and behold her phone is dead and other is out of range and she has this wow omg what a surprise and then explains why afterword and her blond hair friend is like wow this is dumb.

Hottarake no Shima: Haruka to Mahou no Kagami,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5998/Hottarake_no_Shima__Haruka_to_Mahou_no_Kagami,"['Anime, like many other media, is a veritable Pandora\'s Box when it comes to finding something entertaining. What you think about a given show may range from outright loathing to blissful wonderment - you never know until you start watching.Every so often though, something will come along that will give you hope for the future of the medium.For starters, Hottarake no Shima ~Haruka to Mahou no Kagami~ (or, Oblivion Island: Haruka and the Magic Mirror), is possibly the most visually arresting 3D movie I have ever seen (and before you ask, yes, I have seen Avatar, and no, I wasn\'t overly impressed by that Dances...with Wolves crossed with Battle for Terra rip off). Over the years the 3D genre of anime has been woefully misrepresented, however Oblivion Island looks set to not only change the rules, but the entire game.The story, in brief, is about a girl called Haruka, her accidental meeting with a young fox spirit called Teo, and her subsequent adventure in a land where forgotten things are taken.One of the nice things about Oblivion Island is that its based on a concept that is both very simple and very familiar. Everyone has, or knows of, something that may have been treasured during childhood, something that has become lost or forgotten along the way, and everyone who has lost something will wonder where it went. It\'s to the credit of writers Adachi Hirotaka and Sato Shinsuke (who also directed the movie), that they were able to use this premise to create a tale that is both charming and wondrous.Given that this is a movie one would expect there to be a certain ""shallowness"" to the actual plot, and while this is true to a degree, Oblivion Island posits a fantastic, yet strangely plausible (in terms of stories that is), idea for the viewer to ponder once the film has ended. That said, there is a certain amount of predictability in the story that may not sit well with some people, however I found that when taken alongside the visuals these moments were nothing to be overly concerned about, especially given that the screenplay was designed with the visuals in mind (the scene with the gramophone is one example of this).The area where this movie really shines though, is its visuals. Oblivion Island is quite simply breathtaking in many respects, and the viewer may be forgiven for thinking that Production I.G. is simply showing off (yes, it is that good). The movie makes extremely clever use of 3D and CG to fool the viewer into thinking that certain scenes were produced by ""normal"" animation practices. Once the story shifts into Teo\'s world though, the whole thing changes from visually clever to drop dead gorgeous. In terms of design, Oblivion Island is right up there with the best in its usage of colours, shapes, textures, objects and characters, and throughout the film it\'s apparent that a great deal of thought has gone into its production. The quality is so good in fact, that it easily rivals the other visually sumptuous shows like Iblard Jikan.Oblivion Island is also no slouch when it comes to animation. The characters move well, and possess some of the most emotive features and faces I have seen in 3D animation - ever. Creatures and vehicles also move in a very fluid manner, and while there are moments when the action is nothing short of dizzying in its complexity, the quality of the visuals is nothing short of superb.Sound is another area where Oblivion Island really excels. The seiyuu perform extremely well throughout the movie, and bring a degree of individuality to each of the characters. One thing that did surprise me is that the role of Haruka is actually played by Ayase Haruka, who is a fairly success live action actress in her own right. The usage of a screen actress rather than a voice actress works well though, and the Ayase performs the role with aplomb.The movie also makes very good use of music which varies from playful ditties to dramatic scores. That said, the film is notable for the scenes when there is no music as this not only allows the tracks to have more of an impact, but also creates another difference between Teo\'s world and the real one. In terms of effects, Oblivion Island really pushes the boat out. While there are numerous noises and sounds used throughout the movie, each is crystal clear to the ears, and it\'s because of this clarity that the sound doesn\'t degenerate into a cacophony when voices, effects and music clash.Now given that this is a movie, it\'s fair to expect that there would be little in the way of development where the characters are concerned. Oblivion Island is surprising then, in that both Haruka and Teo receive a fair amount of development over the course of the film. In many respects this is actually a coming of age movie for both Haruka and Teo, and while there\'s a certain amount of formula to their growth, it\'s nice to see it done well (for a movie that is).In all honesty I found this a surprising film, in particular because of its visuals. The story is engaging, and the characters have a charm and appeal that is rare in a 3D movie. One thing that I did like was the fact that the film had a certain ""dark"" quality that, when taken as a whole, reminded me of shows like Neil Gaiman\'s ""Coraline"" and ""Mirrormask"", and Tim Burton\'s ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""The Corpse Bride"".Probably the most surprising thing though, is that while everyone has been raving about Hosoda Mamoru (Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo, Summer Wars), being a contender for Miyazaki\'s crown, Sato Shinsuke along with Production I.G. have appeared from left field with a movie that is at least as good as anything made by either Hosoda, Ghibli, or any of the other contenders.Only time will tell if the game has truly changed, however with Oblivion Island both Sato and Production I.G. have most definitely levelled the playing field. with Wolves crossed with Battle for Terra rip off). Over the years the 3D genre of anime has been woefully misrepresented, however Oblivion Island looks set to not only change the rules, but the entire game.The story, in brief, is about a girl called Haruka, her accidental meeting with a young fox spirit called Teo, and her subsequent adventure in a land where forgotten things are taken.One of the nice things about Oblivion Island is that its based on a concept that is both very simple and very familiar.

In terms of design, Oblivion Island is right up there with the best in its usage of colours, shapes, textures, objects and characters, and throughout the film it\'s apparent that a great deal of thought has gone into its production. The quality is so good in fact, that it easily rivals the other visually sumptuous shows like Iblard Jikan.Oblivion Island is also no slouch when it comes to animation. The characters move well, and possess some of the most emotive features and faces I have seen in 3D animation - ever. Creatures and vehicles also move in a very fluid manner, and while there are moments when the action is nothing short of dizzying in its complexity, the quality of the visuals is nothing short of superb.Sound is another area where Oblivion Island really excels. The seiyuu perform extremely well throughout the movie, and bring a degree of individuality to each of the characters. One thing that did surprise me is that the role of Haruka is actually played by Ayase Haruka, who is a fairly success live action actress in her own right. The usage of a screen actress rather than a voice actress works well though, and the Ayase performs the role with aplomb.The movie also makes very good use of music which varies from playful ditties to dramatic scores. That said, the film is notable for the scenes when there is no music as this not only allows the tracks to have more of an impact, but also creates another difference between Teo\'s world and the real one. In terms of effects, Oblivion Island really pushes the boat out. While there are numerous noises and sounds used throughout the movie, each is crystal clear to the ears, and it\'s because of this clarity that the sound doesn\'t degenerate into a cacophony when voices, effects and music clash.Now given that this is a movie, it\'s fair to expect that there would be little in the way of development where the characters are concerned. Oblivion Island is surprising then, in that both Haruka and Teo receive a fair amount of development over the course of the film. In many respects this is actually a coming of age movie for both Haruka and Teo, and while there\'s a certain amount of formula to their growth, it\'s nice to see it done well (for a movie that is).In all honesty I found this a surprising film, in particular because of its visuals. The story is engaging, and the characters have a charm and appeal that is rare in a 3D movie. One thing that I did like was the fact that the film had a certain ""dark"" quality that, when taken as a whole, reminded me of shows like Neil Gaiman\'s ""Coraline"" and ""Mirrormask"", and Tim Burton\'s ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""The Corpse Bride"".Probably the most surprising thing though, is that while everyone has been raving about Hosoda Mamoru (Toki wo Kakeru Shoujo, Summer Wars), being a contender for Miyazaki\'s crown, Sato Shinsuke along with Production I.G. have appeared from left field with a movie that is at least as good as anything made by either Hosoda, Ghibli, or any of the other contenders.Only time will tell if the game has truly changed, however with Oblivion Island both Sato and Production I.G. have most definitely levelled the playing field.', 'Oblivion Island is a movie that pops a question in my mind after I saw this movie; Why can\'t we get original and creative films like this on Hollywood? Well that\'s because nowadays, Hollywood is nothing more than a bunch of lazy dumbfucks that rather make garbage for the audience, while original movies get the middle finger by the audiences and they don\'t ever get mentioned again for generations to come. Oblivion Island gives hope that originality in filmmaking isn\'t dead and Production I.G has created a film filled with so much wonder and creativity that it deserves to be seen by the whole world...and not just the US.The story is about Haruka, a 16- year old girl who lost her mother at a very young age and forgot all about the mirror that she had as a gift from her mother. Feeling guilty for not taking care of it, she decides to visit the shrine to pray for the return of her mirror to Lord Anari and which according to a real life Japanese legend, if a precious item was lost to you, an offering to Anari may bring your precious item back to you. Later on, she follows a strange little fox into the woods and when she founds a small pound between the rocks, she gets sucked in into Oblivion Island, a world where everything is built around objects and items that were neglected by their rightful owners. Now, Haruka and her new friend Tao decide to find the mirror before The Baron, the ruler of the island, gets his hand on the mirror first and use it to destroy the island in order to make a new world.While the story in Oblivion Island is not incredibly complex, it does have an incredibly deep theme that is rarely seen in movies these days: The theme of neglect. Oblivion Island\'s message is about never neglecting our precious childhood objects, since this film takes place in a world where items like broken dolls, mirrors, stuffed dolls and other kinds of objects are abandoned by their owners for no reason and that is sadly true to be honest, since nowadays parents buy toys for their kids cause it\'s ""hip"" and ""cool"" like the commercials advertised, instead of being gifts that you\'re suppose to take good care and treasure them like when you were a kid back then. The story combines real-life Japanese folklore with a mix of Alice In Wonderland storytelling to the film and it does feel like I\'m watching an anime film of Alice In Wonderland, but about a world of abandoned objects instead. The main characters are pretty good. The chemistry with Tao and Haruka is heart-warming and their friendship develop well enough throughout the movie that you will care deeply for them, even that little plush doll Cotton is a very simple yet deep symbolic character in the film (which you have to see for yourself in order to understand it since I don\'t wanna spoil the film for you). The other characters are mediocre at best, plus the villain is weak and uninteresting, as he just wants to take over the island in order to make a new one.The animation by Production I.G is breathtaking. The amount of creativity and effort put into the animation will make Studio Ghibli jealous and the designs of the characters are magnificent. The island is also a stunner, the way the place is made is just unbelievable and did I mention that this film was in 3D when it was released in Japan? Cause if I watched this in 3D, my eyes would have been blown away with so much color and detail. The music is good, but not as jaw-drooping as you would have thought it would but to give credit, it does offer some gorgeous piano tracks that brings a lot of emotion to the story. The English dub for Oblivion Island is not that bad, Christine Marie Cabanos and Cassandra Lee were perfectly cast with their roles as Haruka and Tao, while Patrick Seitz delivers an awesome over the top performance as The Baron that gives the character enough charm than the Japanese version and Julie Maddalena gives a heart-warming performance as the doll Cotton. As for the other voices.... Well, they were ok, but their voices did not even fit for the characters at all and they come off goofy and bland.While it\'s not a masterpiece like other anime films, Oblivion Island has enough charm, originality and effort that some of the flaws can be overlooked, thanks to the charm of the story and the message it\'s trying to tell to it\'s audience. If you want a movie that\'s rich with imagination and creativity, I highly recommend this film to every animation fans of all ages. See this film cause we won\'t get a creative film like this in the US for a long time. As for the Oscars and The Academy Awards, they better nominate this movie or bad things will happen to them... and not just the US.The story is about Haruka, a 16- year old girl who lost her mother at a very young age and forgot all about the mirror that she had as a gift from her mother.

The book tells a story of a man whose treasured comb was returned to him by a fox after offering an egg at a shrine. The townspeople begin offering eggs to the shrine in hopes of having their items returned as well, but little do they know that the foxes are actually responsible for stealing the items that are considered 'forgotten' by...the people. Haruka assures her mother that the hand mirror she received as a present won't share the same fate, since she'll treasure it forever.Flash ten years into the future, where Haruka is now a teenager. Her mother is no longer around, and she seems unsatisfied with her workaholic father and her disinterested friend. For a change of pace, she visits the shrine to pray for her hand mirror to be returned, since, as expected, she forgot about it and subsequently it had been lost.Haruka falls asleep at the shrine and wakes up to a scrounging fox-like anthromorph. The fox grabs some stray items, including Haruka's keychain, and scurries off. Haruka follows the creature into a parallel dimension, where the fox panics and tries to disguise her, or else he could get into trouble for leading a human to their world. After escaping danger, the fox tells Haruka to return to the human world, but she insists on staying to look for her mirror.Haruka promises to give the fox, who introduces himself as Teo, her keychain if they find her mirror. He agrees and they set off to search for it. On the way, Teo is bullied by three street-gang members, and Haruka helps him get away. The bullies guess - correctly - that Haruka is a human, so they head off to expose her.There's a pointless scene where the bullies chase Teo and Haruka which leads to the only funny moment in the movie, where their cylindrical vehicle flies off a roof, lands sideways on a tower, and slides down it, like a ring-toss game at a carnival. Teo and Haruka escape to a theater that is performing a play with one of Haruka's forgotten toys - don't ask why - and the bullies bust in, despite not knowing that their targets were in the theater. Haruka reunites with her toy, named Cotton, and the bullies chase her while causing a lot of property damage, even though she had already revealed herself to be a human, which calls into question the bullies' motive for chasing them in the first place.The duo escapes and retires to Teo's house, where Teo reveals that the mirror is in a underground thieves lair - why he doesn't reveal this earlier when they're searching for the mirror is anyone's guess. Teo then steps outside where he's kidnapped by the evil Baron, who tells the fox to use Haruka to get back the mirror so that he can steal it. Of course, Teo will be rewarded handsomely.The next day, the pair travels into the lair and the movie is tragically cut short when their cart derails and a giant stuffed monster forces Haruka into a pit of lava, killing her instantly - that is, until the lava is revealed to be syrup. The teenager climbs out and rips the stuffing out of the monster to discover that her mirror is inside of it. She retrieves the mirror and attempts to escape with Teo, but they are headed off by the Baron, who kidnaps Haruka to be a slave and steals the mirror.The Baron reveals his plan to use mirrors to control a robot army (mirrors are like a power source), and then proceeds to administer an amnesia gobstopper to Haruka by means of a Rube Goldberg machine. This gives Teo ample time to sway the townspeople into committing treason against the Baron, and they use Teo's reward money to build a plane that will propel him to the Baron's dirigible.Meanwhile, Haruka's toy, Cotton, rallies an army and inexplicably boards the Baron's airship without having any means to do so. The baron dismembers the sentient toy, and Haruka escapes into Teo's airplane. Then, amidst cannonball fireworks and balloons, Teo's airplane crashes into and disables the Baron's airship. The film then goes into a metaphysical sequence which explains the moral of treasuring memories, after which the Baron is defeated and Haruka retrieves her mirror and returns to the human world.So that's Oblivion Island. Haruka and Teo are the only characters who have more than a few lines, the plot is full of holes, and the story, for the most part, is unoriginal. For a children's movie, Oblivion Island is not charming, interesting, or funny. There are no attempts at puns or jokes at all, and since there is hardly any gripping drama, the movie ends up being a sort of fantasy adventure - the kind you might see if you had a high fever.

However, the visuals are absolutely stunning, essentially making the art and animation the only attractions of the film."", ""Oblivion Island is a CGI animated film that was released in 2009 to commemorate Fuji Television’s fiftieth anniversary. As it mentions boldly on the DVD case, it went on to win three animation awards, and became nominated for two others. This is quite a feat, seeing how it’s basically another Alice in wonderland type story, and those have become pretty much a dime a dozen in recent years. But looking past that, when the film is taken at it’s own merits, did it really deserve those awards? Let’s take a look.The movie opens with a stylized piece of animation that tells the audience about a...race of fox spirits who sneak around your property, stealing any of your possessions that’ve become neglected or unloved. This story is being told by Haruka’s mother, who’s being visited by her husband and daughter on what will soon become her death bed. Haruka says she won’t get visited by the foxes, because she takes care of her possessions, including a beautiful mirror that her mother gave her. I wonder where this is going.Fast forward about ten years, to when Haruka is a sixteen year old student, her father is working hard to support her, and right off the bat, Haruka comes off as a very unlikeable character. She walks into the house with a friend from school, sees that it’s still a mess, and complains that her father doesn’t clean the house often enough. She’s pissed that he drank her ginger ale, as well as at the fact that he’s rarely home. Because of his job. Where’s the Facebook Parenting guy when you need him?Looking at her clock somehow reminds her of her mother’s mirror, which she lost several years ago, so she visits a shrine to the fox spirits to ask for it back. Her keys fall behind the stairs to the shrine, so she crawls underneath to get them back. She places them on the step, but before she can get out, a fox spirit runs up and takes them, offering us our first actual plothole of the movie(wait for it). She follows him to the base of a tree, where she gets sucked into the Land of the Lost. At least that’s what i’m calling it. She meets up with the terrified fox, and accuses him of theft, but he reassures her that he doesn’t steal. He reclaims abandoned and neglected objects.Okay, so there are two plotholes here. First of all, yes, he just STOLE her keys, which had only been on the step for a few minutes. not abandoned, not neglected. And despite being a fox, he didn’t notice her there less than a foot in front of his face. DidAalan Grant write that scene?  And I’m sorry, but if these fox spirits were really this careless, we’d have captured at least one by now.Okay, back to the story... She promises to give him her keys if he helps her to get her mirror back, which she believes must be down here. This is where the plot finally takes off, and trust me, it has more holes in it than Spongebob Squarepants eating swiss cheese in the middle of a shootout.Production wise, Oblivion Island is pretty underwhelming. It’s a fully CGI movie, so it doesn’t have the typical anime problems... Like low frame rates and frozen images... But it’s still really cheap looking. The style and quality of the animation seem like an awkward cross between Mr.Stain in Junk Alley and a Kingdom Hearts cutscene. The artwork is colorful and highly detailed, but at the same time bland and gummy looking. There are times when it breaks away from this happy color palette long enough to really shine, like the real world scenes, and a giant skeletal beast that they deal with late in the movie, but for the most part, this movie is visually unremarkable.The story is well paced, and never boring, but the amount of contrived plot twists and broken physics rules that they had to use to tell the story is just absurd. Despite his species being prevalent in the opening animation, and the basis of the entire japanese myth, Teo’s the only fox spirit we ever meet. At one point in the movie, Te’o has to give a speech about humans not being all that bad, although he’s the only character in the movie who was ever afraid of her. He shows them a wind-up toy plane she built, and they react like they’ve never seen one before. Her mirror was supposedly stolen from the Baron by some mysterious underground thieves, but when they go underground to retrieve it, there’s nobody down there who looks capable of such a feat. Just creepy dolls, slimy bugs, and a sorta-cool giant monster that looks like a cross between a rancor and an ugly quilt.But my real problem with this movie, above all else, is the ending. As ridiculous and dumbly-plotted as this movie was, it could have been saved by having a smart ending. As it turned out, when they came back to the surface with the mirror, the Baron was waiting at that location... Somehow... and takes it, along with his new prisoner Haruka. Now, this is what I was hoping would happen;Upon entering his castle, Haruka notices that the Baron really does love and treasure her mirror. It’s like a comfort blanket to him. Being without it for so long has driven him mad, and having it back, his life is complete again. She realizes that she doesn’t need some mirror to remind her of her mother, because the memories in her heart are enough. She agrees to leave this world empty handed, but not empty hearted, as she’s taking a valuable life lesson, and several steps towards maturity, along with her.Of course, that doesn't happen.  A won’t tell you exactly what actually happens, but to put it in broad strokes, The Baron is a Bond villain, and the mirror is a MacGuffin. The entire third act of this obviously eastern-inspired movie is nothing but an explosion of westernized cliches. Haruka learns to appreciate her father and her possessions, but she never really grows or develops as a character, because *Spoiler alert* she got exactly what she came for.I own a 12 inch stuffed Bulbasaur that my father won for me at a carnival when I was little. I love it, treasure it, and still own it. It’s on my dresser as we speak. But if one of my little cousins saw it and fell in love with it, I’d surrender it in a heartbeat. Why? Because when you grow up, your childhood relics deserve to be with someone who needs them more than you. Toy Story 3 nailed this idea, and in a different way, so did Labyrinth, both of which are American movies.Overall, it’s a pretty bad movie by all accounts, but it’s not terrible. It’s watchable. It’s safe and entertaining for younger audiences, at least those who are young enough to watch The Santa Clause without asking any questions. I give this movie a 5/10. I don't think it really deserved any of those awards it won, but it's worth a rental. race of fox spirits who sneak around your property, stealing any of your possessions that’ve become neglected or unloved.

I find it exciting and refreshing that more child-friendly anime is being licensed stateside.A brief overview of the story is that 16 year old Haruka travels to another dimension where neglected items are used by its inhabitants, as the citizens cannot make anything of their own... so they use what humans no longer care for. Haruka wants to find her late mother's hand mirror, and thus begins her journey. The story is very straightforward and simple, which is appropriate for the target audience.Before putting the DVD in I admit that...I was a bit apprehensive about the computer animated art style. Once I started watching though I really enjoyed the art. I guess I feared having to sit through a whole movie with what could have been poor CGI, and thank goodness it was anything but that. The film is visually very attractive. You'll even see some bits of scenery in 2D, but it doesn't look misplaced or jarring. Also, the music is really fantastic; I loved the music and was rather impressed. There were some very nice orchestral and instrumental pieces. The pop tune during the ending credits was welcoming as well.As a children's film this really is fantastic. The plot is very basic and simple however, so if you can't sit through a kids' film in the first place I would steer clear. I also want to mention that the ending was sweet too! I would recommend this to anyone wanting to see a creative, yet traditional children's movie. I was a bit apprehensive about the computer animated art style. Once I started watching though I really enjoyed the art. I guess I feared having to sit through a whole movie with what could have been poor CGI, and thank goodness it was anything but that. The film is visually very attractive. You'll even see some bits of scenery in 2D, but it doesn't look misplaced or jarring.

Idaten Jump,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1316/Idaten_Jump,"[""This anime is simply amazing! I find this so interesting that this anime was the reason for me waking up early in the morning. It's hard to find the series online so my only resource is the TV. I've learned some Bike techniques from their tips and I just enjoyed the show. The Story was good, the art was good, characters were interesting and simply I give it a 2 thumbs up! "", 'Idaten Jump, I got bored on day and thought it would be about... Puppets jumping off cliffs...  But since I was so bored I decided to watch it, I was pulled in right away.  Fascinating story with lovable characters (Mainly Hosuke the Owl.)  Interesting villains (Gabu Samejima.)  I would recommend this show to anybody in a heartbeat. ', 'So You are going to watch it. Let me tell you why this anime is so great.This is one of those anime which ever aired in INDIA.So, I watched it when it was airing in India....and at that time, I didn\'t know what the hell anime is.First of all, don\'t look to the stats of this anime on MAL and on any other Animelist sites like Anime-Planet or Anilist or Kitsu....they are absolutely misleading. In India atleast 100k people watched it when it aired back in 2013-14. And maximum.....I can estimate that almost 2 Million people watched. And I am telling you....Everyone loved...this anime and its characters. But on MAL it is in the completed list of only 6k people....Lol it is so less.Whatever, Let\'s get to the point, I am thinking not to spoil you...so I will present what I liked majorly about this anime:•Story__10/10:Yes, The story is absolutely a unique one. The concept and story is supernatural but there are not much plot holes in it. The Author tried his best to make it enjoyable and less unbelievable.The Story is about SHO YAMATO who loves MTB riding. In the first episode it is also shown that he is really a very great rider and he learnt all the skills from his father who was a Legend in MTB riding but was mysteriously disappeared. Sho has very good & helpful friends and in Episode 01 it is also shown that The MTB training ground(named X-Zone) takes them to some strange place or some other world...which is a mystery. The place where they have been placed has a lot of mysteries. And there are a lot of plot twists that makes it a real masterpiece which can never be created again.The Story really has something different....which is really hard. Its current rating of 6.9 on MAL makes me sad at some point.•Characters__10/10:Oh yeah, The main thing in this anime is its characters, There are a huge no. of characters in this anime and all of them are so nicely written characters.....the Character development of Sho Yamato is really one of the best of all times. The story does justice with its characters. All the characters have a MTB and the speciality of The MTBs are that they do have same traits as that of their Riders.This anime is built around the MTBs...so without telling about them, this review can\'t be accomplished.There are MTBs for each and every character in this anime!And the Supernatural power of the Bike is what is the main trait of its Rider. The MTBs resemble its rider\'s character. The Supernatural Power of MTBs is called IDATEN JUMP/IDATEN GO which is used by the rider in tough situations during the Idaten Battle.All the bikes have emblems in front of it. The Emblems are Normal ones then SILVER & GOLD....And there is only one PLATINUM EMBLEM which is in the bike of our Protagonist__Sho Yamato\'s FLAME KAISER.My personal Favorite character from this anime is ""Kyoichi Shido"" who is the brother of ""Makoto Shido"". He has a Idaten Bike named ""Thunder Emperor"" & his existence is kept hidden in the beginning phase of the series while he becomes a key role player in the middle of the series; In my opinion he was the most amazing rider of MTB in the series even though Sho Yamato, the protagonist had more amazing stats & all round success.•Music__10/10:Ah...it gives me chills still after 6 years when I re-watch it. They have made best quality music for each and every emotion...when enthusiasm...a rocking music...when any emotional scene...a very sad music...when any Mystery scene...a Psychological music.Special Thanks to YASUHARU TAKANASHI for Such Such great OSTs.Till now In my knowledge there are 35 OSTs officially released....there might be more.....I don\'t know whether 35 are the total or there are some other too. But I remember each & every OST of this anime even after 6 years. Its emotional music is really which hit me to the core.I would recommend you to search some of its OSTs on Youtube - ""Omoide"", ""Tobe"", ""Sho no theme"", ""Each Feeling"", ""Sentimental Battle"", ""OST 06"" & ""OST 25"".You can actually visit ""Best OF Anime OST\'s"" - a youtube channel to listen all the 35 OSTs.•Art__10/10:Don\'t get me wrong....This anime was a 2005 release. And it was adapted by PRODUCTION IG....my second most favorite studio.As this is a Supernatural Anime....The Art really suited it. The color selection is what I noticed is the unique one. Well Art is Art....even a lot of Bad storyline anime also have great Art and animations so it really doesn\'t matter when The Story is good. The art and animation in this anime is really better than many anime of present time.•Enjoyment__10/10:I really really enjoyed it for the first time when it aired. And whenever I re watch it....It becomes more close to me. The combo of great ART-STORY-CHARACTERS-MUSIC makes it really enjoyable. Even if you don\'t like the concept of the story....still You will enjoy it.There are a lot of plot twists which can drive you crazy....The character development seems very natural...like it is real!All the characters develop a bit after their every race.•Overall__10/10:Yes....This is literally a Piece of Greatness. It deserves more praise. But as I said its rating is really not good on Animelist sites.But there is a fact....This anime didn\'t suffer.....It aired in different countries and earned a lot of money and it is one of those anime which didn\'t get pirated by pirate sites. So In Stats on ANIMELIST sites it doesn\'t seem famous and rich in its sale. But in reality it is one those anime which are famous and earned enough money & praise.Anyways...I can\'t say that My review will make you watch this anime...but All the way I tell you to just give it a try....and atleast watch first 25 episodes so that the story will get on its fastest pace.I just want its stats to be good and not misleading. This anime needs to get popular on MAL and other Animelist sites. And As I said....it is already popular and loved by people no matter if doesn\'t get it officially.Have a nice day.....Give it a try whenever you are free and want to watch some supernatural and new concept. I wish you will enjoy this anime.^_^ this anime and its characters.

Mysteriously, one day while racing with their friends they somehow sucked into another world and their new exciting adventure to return to their home begins.Their journey is filled with great encounters as they head towards the legendary racing city.The one great thing about this anime is the chemistry between the three...main characters.

I am so habituated to it that it bothers my ears to hear English dubbed anime episodes. I don't like dubbed versions as these are not able to keep the original characters vocal and emotional quality as per the anime creator's ideology. For instance, baka yaro is used to convey the frustration of the character but at the same time the speaker tries to hide his or her admiration for the one at the receiving end. I am lecturing so far on this because Idaten Jump is...not available online in Japanese version with subs. It is available in Latino and Hindi. Hindi is my national language and rationally speaking with the experience of watching 300 anime series, that Hindi dubbing perfectly synchronized with the characters emotional projections. You can compare it at the end of the series where the Japanese voice over is not dubbed.I started watching it reluctantly assuming that it would not appease my mom as it looks childish. My mom does not like pokemon which we favor. (she is in her 50+). So my sister's son  (10 year old)  implored  and pressured us to see this as he already watched it in Nick India TV channel.  We are happy that we watched it.Story:  Sho yamato a 12 year or so boy is mad about  MTB (MounTain Bike) racing. For this his loyal friends Takeru (mechanical help) and Makoto support. One day when they were playing in the racing field named X-zone constructed by his late father, these friends along with the other players present at the field get sucked into a black miasma cloud. Hence they get transported into another dimension called X-zone. In order to come back to real world one has to gain 10 golden emblems (which are at front of the cycle ) and must be won through idaten MTB race competitions.  It seems that Sho's bike Flame Kaiser has a Platinum emblem, which was the savior of the world and hence many come to challenge him. This is the gist of the story but as it progresses, like other anime it gets linked to saving the world.Characters: Two characters are very vibrant in this series. One is Makoto's brother kyouichi and Yuki the genius mechanic. Kyouichi in my opinion is more valiant and powerful than Sho. His maneuvers with his MTB and his control over dark personality are admirable. He thinks beyond others in creating opportunities to solve the problems. In one episode in order to save his sister and sho etc, from his dark self, Kyouchi writes the solution on the window panel, provides escape plan and even goes to the length of sacrificing himself during his dark self's  competition with sho. Yuki's character is mysterious till the ending couple of episodes. She comes in assistance to our heroes and it is not clear how she knew sho's whereabouts and his crisis. She pops out when they were in pinch.Another character i forgot to mention is Taiga brother of Sabu (the egoist), who is given less importance in the series though he is also powerful, as equivalent to Sho. Another one is ninja okio ( i do not remember his name clearly) whose sister is hospitalized. You will respect him when he trains Ayumi, sho's brother with practical guidance. I think he is the correct brother to Ayumi than Sho in guiding him in his journey.Art: Perfect for this genre.Enjoyment: It will keep on entertaining you till the last 3 episodes. I might have given 10 if the ending is too rushed and no visual clarity in the story about how the evil perished at last. not available online in Japanese version with subs.

Kaikan Phrase,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1021/Kaikan_Phrase,"[""I still have a &quot;hang-over&quot; over Nana so I was browsing for some animes thats relevantly similar to it. Came across Kaikan Phrase but had a dout coz its quite old. But I somehow ended up watching it and have no regrets at all.The story started of  typically. A little bit slow but as it progresses you'll find yourself hooked. There's a lot of character development that would make one kind of attached to each band member. It was focused more on the band, on have they struggled, how they developed they're relationship to each other and  how they overcame the obstacles...they faced. It was pretty touching and inspiring. The &quot;love story&quot; started of a little bit late but for me it was just the right timing. You'll see how love can change someone.Sound is ok, because the anime was done in 1999 so the music is a liitle off my taste. But I most probably  would have liked it better if I saw the anime at that time.I'll give the characters an outstanding. Each one of them has different characteristics that would make different kind of people relate to them. Nobody stood up annoyingly or overly dramatic. Even the female leads character was done just appropriately.Obviously I had a fun time watching it. Time well-spent! 44 episodes just not enough. they faced. It was pretty touching and inspiring.

Unfortunately, the anime production removed the one redeeming feature of the story completely!The artwork is very dated, for something produced in the 90's, it looks like something from the 70's, and while they give us a lot of background on the other members of the bands, they water all of it down! This manga is really ONLY interesting because it's racy and because of the very titillating relationship between the characters....The anime story line made changes from the manga that sterilized everything that was interesting or compelling out of it.It comes off as a big yawn and if you have read the manga, don't bother with the anime - you'll be disappointed.  If you have watched the anime, now go read the real deal in the manga - it's 1000 times better.

Whilst the band is discovering itself at the grass-roots level we’re frequently made to listen to their sounds, composed of catchy tunes Midnight Crow and Datenshi Blue (which are sang by the real-life Lucifer band – clever of the producers to...make an actual band as counterparts for the anime band). The ballad Dakishimeru hokani also leaves quite an impression as it pops up from time to time when the characters go through hardships.The manga starts off with the female protagonist Aine Yukimura but in the anime she isn’t involved until half-way through the series. Once Aine and the lead vocalist Sakuya meet though the story picks up pace; on the highs and lows of becoming and being big in the music and media scene, ending practically every episode on a climax- yes you just have to watch the next episode (it’s a vicious cycle).The art of Kaikan Phrase is as expected from animes made in 1999; it is pretty good and you get used to it after the first few episodes.It would’ve been better if there was a bit more romance in the anime though- would’ve done justice to Mayu Shinjou the mangaka but I guess the emphasise was meant to be on the music world for this anime instead. But otherwise it is quite the enjoyable watch, where we never quite know what Sakuya will say or do- his level of confidence is beyond measure.

I have to say I enjoyed both the anime and manga but the anime is much more different than the manga. They totally go off script and change a lot in the anime. Personally , i prefer the manga. I usually prefer anime to manga so that is huge for me to say.Anime- focuses more on the journey of the band rather than the relationship of the main manga characters. I think hey did this to try and divert from the really adult themes the manga has. 1997, so that should tell you...why they needed to cut out a lot.  The anime is very innocent compared to the manga which I think is where the anime loses it for me. The manga has some very intense, sexual moments that really draw you in but the anime has NONE of that. Overall though, I still enjoyed it so I wouldn't cross it out. It starts very slow, the art SUCKS in the beginning  but its tolerable. I was really starting to get bored and was going to stop watching it, but than i read that aine (female lead) gets introduced in epi 22 which is where it starts to really pick up for me.If you have seen NANA (phenomenal btw!)  and liked it, than you will like this also. If this anime was remade now and stuck to the manga story lines woooo baby! it would be FIRE.Overall, show is a good watch. I highly recommend reading the manga though so you can see the comparison.

', ""read the manga before I watched this anime, and based on what I thought of the manga, the show is very different. Thinking about how smutty the manga is, the anime contains surprisingly little romance, even though there certainly is some.I was a bit sceptic about the art at first. I didn't really like the art in the manga either, so it might not be a surprise that I wasn't fond of it. Though, after a while I started to get used to it and then it was just amazing. The music is better than I expected, and I found myself really enjoying listening...to it.Also, the story is wonderful. It shows a lot of the pressure that a big band have to go through to get what they want, their struggle to keep themselves on the top and how cruel the media can be. For an ordinary human .. it's just something we can't imagine. It's also amazing how they can capture such feelings in just a 20 minute long episode.[WARNING, THE TEXT BELOW CONTAINS SPOILERS]I hope they will release a second season of this anime, because I thought it was way to short to represent the manga which has over 100 chapters. And the ending was really frustrating, because you really want to know how they are going to make it in London and if they are going to be able to go from being an underground band in the UK to have a single reaching top 1. Are they going to win over all the other artists, when they originally are from Japan and some of them don't even know a sinlge word english? And if they are able to , are they going to have that famous guy making them go international? And when are they going back to Japan? What happens between Aine and Sakuya, what are their future going to look like? Is Lucifer going to disband after they reached the top?That's something I really want to know so if there isn't going to be a second season .. then I'm going to kill them ;D to it.Also, the story is wonderful. It shows a lot of the pressure that a big band have to go through to get what they want, their struggle to keep themselves on the top and how cruel the media can be. For an ordinary human .. it's just something we can't imagine. It's also amazing how they can capture such feelings in just a 20 minute long episode.[WARNING, THE TEXT BELOW CONTAINS SPOILERS]I hope they will release a second season of this anime, because I thought it was way to short to represent the manga which has over 100 chapters. And the ending was really frustrating, because you really want to know how they are going to make it in London and if they are going to be able to go from being an underground band in the UK to have a single reaching top 1. Are they going to win over all the other artists, when they originally are from Japan and some of them don't even know a sinlge word english? And if they are able to , are they going to have that famous guy making them go international? And when are they going back to Japan? What happens between Aine and Sakuya, what are their future going to look like? Is Lucifer going to disband after they reached the top?That's something I really want to know so if there isn't going to be a second season .. then I'm going to kill them ;D"", ""In short, 'Kaikan Phrase' is about a band 'Lucifer' that strives to get famous. 'Kaikan Phrase' starts with Santa and Yuki quitting their old band and starting a new one.That isn't so easy if you want to make a wonderful band.In this anime there are beautiful drawings, Lucifer's songs are great, Sakuya's voice is outstanding. Every member of 'Lucifer' has their own unique character, especially that mysterious Sakuya Ookouchi, but even he who seemed a very cold guy at the beginning, is able to fall in love. "", ""The reason why I wanted to write a review on this anime is because it has only a few and people might want to hear more opinions. As it is an old anime, Kaikan Phrase is not so well-known. Yes, the animation might not be at it's best, yes there is no HD version and the sound is not perfect but this anime has the charm most old anime have.I have began reading the manga just recently and for those who look for something similar, you might be disappointed because this anime is not focused on romance even if it includes some. I honestly...like the anime better than the manga because it focuses on the band and has some real character development. The truth is, you get attached to the characters because each member of the band is a different typology and you automatically will find someone similar to you (for me it was Santa).I was doubting the anime the first few episodes because the main character was a little annoying but as time goes by everything changes and you find yourself hooked.Of course I take in consideration the fact that it might not be everyone's piece of cake but for people who like music and realistic/slice of life anime I think this might be a good idea. It's a story about a building friendship and trust and about fighting to protect a dream. I hope you found this review helpful and that you might give Kaikan Phrase a chance ٩(^ᴗ^)۶ like the anime better than the manga because it focuses on the band and has some real character development.

The difference shocked me. It focused more on the characters and the making of the band. Until Aine came into the picture I actually really liked it.The thing I liked about the manga is that you can create the music of the band to you\'re liking in you\'re head, so in the anime you really have to like the music to think they\'re amazing. It\'s an old anime, quite long with 44 episodes, and the tech part is very old, a little hard for the eyes.After Aine was...introduced I was already forcing myself to watch it. I didn\'t like how they portrayed love between Sakuya and Aine, there was no ""spark"" between them. It looked rushed, as soon as she came, he changed. No questions asked.You can see the characters truly develop and rise to the top. Their struggles to realize the dream of being on top of Japan\'s music industry. introduced I was already forcing myself to watch it.

Their struggles to realize the dream of being on top of Japan\'s music industry.', ""I was reading through some recommendations for a good manga online and saw the manga at first, read through it before and was planning on reading it again since I had a lot of chills and giggles throughout the manga and I didn't even know that there was an anime for this not right after I went and look in this site. Anime wise it was good but left through a lot of good parts from the manga and they never really finished the anime too. I was hoping for some continuation but regardless I was a little disappointed on how it turned out. "", 'Ah, just skimming through the screenshots of this anime gives you the nostalgia surrounding that age-old dream and idea: if you believe in yourself and work hard enough, you can achieve anything you set your mind to. If you’re not too old to root along for a small band raising to the roof, “Kaikan Phrase” might be up your alley.I can’t quite remember why I put this on my list. I think it was recommended to me by someone when I mentioned I hadn’t watched much music anime. Truth be told, if you notice the aesthetics, it’s not much to look at. The anime was...aired in the late 90s but the quality was terrible to stream wherever I checked. You’d have thought it was even older. So if you’re someone who would be irritated by that, you might want to be wary of this, because even later they start putting English subs over the Chinese subbed version and the audio quality is taken from VHS, etc.If you’re here for the right reason, though, which is to listen to some music put around a plot, you might be around for a treat. To be honest, the music is better than the plot hands down, but the story wasn’t something that made me tear my hair out (at least not all the time). I enjoy watching characters become better people, improving themselves and then making the most of their dreams. I can’t speak as if I were in a band, but I imagine that these conflicts do happen day-to-day in the music industry.It was a little too convenient to see four of the members come together in the first episode or so, but Sakuya the vocalist seemed to be impossible. I pretty much hated his character for being so difficult and stubborn in the beginning. He was the typical brooding male that wanted to do things his way and had a hard time showing his feelings. He was good at giving insults and seemed to care only for himself. But I guess that’s how musicians can be sometimes. But I do remember them taking quite a while to recruit him just because of his attitude.Once things got going, though, of course I expected everything to go smoothly. The music industry is harsh, and unless their band Lucifer stood out, not just with their looks, but also with their skills, talent, and emotional music, they would stay unknown. They fought through haters, rivals, jealousy, and the hardship of teamwork. I can’t say that the conflicts they went through as a band were cliche… I mean, what else is there? You’d expect for there to be competition among bands, jealousy between bandmates, differences in opinion for stuff like musical arrangements and lyrics, etc. They were resolved within a good amount of time and without too much fuss.What I complain about most, though, are the other cliches. If you missed it in the info, this is also a shoujo anime. Unfortunately, it’s subject to those shoujo stereotypes. You can guess who in this show has a relationship with the high school lyricist they pick up. They say cheesy things to each other once the ship is canon, and the problems they face do threaten to tear them apart as they try to keep their relationship hidden from the public. There wasn’t enough to make me drop the series, though. The shoujo cliches mixed with the band plot can be a little bit entertaining, though.Of course, it’s only natural to have every band member have a different hair color so viewers tell them apart; it’s a classic anime strategy. Nevertheless, that also helps differentiate their personalities as well. The leader of the band is the laid-back and calm Yuki, whose hair is long, smooth, and dark purple. The drummer Santa has a shock of chestnut hair that imitates his quick temper but powerful beat on the drums. The bass guitarist Towa has long golden locks, perfect for his nonchalant personality that is still bent on arranging the perfect music. Atsuro is originally a brunet but dies his hair a surprising magenta later in the series. He’s an avid guitarist that makes mistakes occasionally but definitely has skill. And Sakuya, with the most normal hairstyle, speaks volumes with his voice and bright blue eyes.They’re a fun bunch, I have to admit. The only time I was annoyed with them was when they were trying so hard to recruit Sakuya, and he was being a big butt about not joining and insulting them all the way. Once he gave in and joined to make the best music, though, they were quite a team. Of course they experience their ups and downs—Santa and Sakuya’s personalities clashed all the time, Atsuro was really downhearted when he messed up, etc.People might have complaints about Aine, though, the lyricist that shows up later. She seems like a typical shoujo protagonist to me, always trying to do the right thing and feeling completely crestfallen when things don’t go as planned. I think she’s probably better in the anime than the manga, though, based on what I’ve heard from other people, but viewers can see that later.I don’t think I can comment much on the animation and artwork since the quality is so terrible. I can only hope that when it aired, it was much better than what I watched. I can complain, though, about their stances when they performed. Most of you are probably familiar with moments when guitarists get into the music and throw their heads back, etc. Unfortunately, for the first few performances, the band members don’t have any different poses. Sakuya throws his body around awkwardly, Yuki tosses his hair the same way, Atsuro holds his guitar at a weird angle, and other things like that. I don’t play any of those instruments, but as a musician myself I do know there’s more to performing than what this anime shows. Later on there is more to see, but I remember feeling disappointed with how they started out. I might chalk it up to beginners’ shows, though.The band members are popular not only for their music, but also for being handsome, and I do admit that they are. Aside from their longish limbs and thin torsos, they can be pretty attractive. Towa’s hair is so distractingly flowing and shiny, and Sakuya always carries that aura of effortless coolness. I can only imagine that this anime looked really good when it came out.I really did love the OPs and EDs, and I think it’s rare for a viewer to like everything they hear. What’s interesting about this anime is that the producers actually hired a real band to perform these songs and “become” Lucifer to give the show a little bit more realism. The real band played for a little bit after the anime ended and disbanded later, but I still think it’s impressive they thought so much to put this together. Japanese rock from the 90s is still cool.Furthermore, it’s good that the songs that the band composes and performs are so great. The driving point of the plot is Lucifer’s rise to fame through talent and cooperation in the band. It would be inexcusable to have them make terrible music. All their pieces except one feature Sakuya as the vocalist, and while I wouldn’t say his voice is as phenomenal as the other characters make it out to be, his mellow tone and ability to meld with the band’s flexible style (not just rock, but also some slower ballads) is just as important as the tunes themselves. I don’t play the guitar or drums, so I can’t comment too much on the sound with more knowledgeable critique, but a good majority of the time my ears liked it. I think one piece was in a weird key, but all of them were head-jamming and seemed pretty cohesive.The soundtrack isn’t bad, either. There’s a little piano tune they keep playing during emotional moments that I liked from the start. It was from a piano piece that Sakuya performed and sang in at a private club, a pretty and wistful melody that rang a chord in all its listeners. Other pieces were not as memorable, but just as fitting for the anime.Hmmm, I can’t say that I would love this anime enough to read the manga, but that’s mostly because I heard it focuses a lot on Sakuya and Aine’s relationship and excessive smut. For the love of humanity, DO NOT PICK UP THE MANGA if you cannot tolerate sex and rape. The anime takes almost a whole new take on the manga entirely, being more about the music. There’s also the fact that since it’s manga, it won’t be accompanied with music, so I’ll have to imagine it in my head. Furthermore, it hasn’t exactly been very binge-worthy for me until the end.All in all, it’s not a bad anime to watch, but it’s nothing I’d sing praises about, either. It well builds the ambience of a small-town band making its dreams come true, but it can be pretty cheesy about it and doesn’t bring anything new to the table in terms of music production. Perhaps in its day, it WAS the newest thing around, though. I have a feeling it was popular in its release. It’s a pleasant memory to watch, though, and I rather like seeing the band become better friends as they grew. aired in the late 90s but the quality was terrible to stream wherever I checked.

To read the manga and then watch the anime, I was dissopointed. The first half of the anime is all about the band, who they are (but not their lives), how they get together. Truthfully, I was not intrested in them at all. I wanted to know more about Aine and Sakuya. What was happening with them. They threw in peices of the other band members stories too. I would have liked to have side stories about the other memebers too, because as much as I loved...Anie and Sakuya, the other characters stories were intresting too. I would say read the manga and skip the anime. You wont want to put the manga down. Anie and Sakuya, the other characters stories were intresting too. I would say read the manga and skip the anime.

And I think it because of the order of them, that I couldn't't give the anime a higher mark than a 7. I began watching in December but after 18 eps I felt as if I was  forcing to watch each I found these ones quite repetitive and found myself being easily distracted by other thing and I left it for over 2 months before telling myself I had to finish the rest. And I was hooked! 26 eps in under a day and yes I went...totally fan girl (squeal and all) when Aine and Sakuya finally met!  It is an older series and of course the animation or at least the version I watched was very poor quality and nothing to what we expect from more recent animus  as was the audio but its worth sticking out if its something you find irritating as it does me.But I would strongly recommend watching the anime then reading the manga to fully enjoy how great the anime really builds itself up into. totally fan girl (squeal and all) when Aine and Sakuya finally met!

Himouto! Umaru-chan R,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35376/Himouto_Umaru-chan_R,"[""Himouto! Umaru-chan's second season could be one of the more underappreciated comedies out there.It's safe to assume anyone who's considering picking up this anime has already seen the first season. My biggest gripe with the first season of Umaru was that the character herself was, for lack of a better word, a complete cunt. Even though her brashness gave the anime its spirit, the second season does a much better balancing act with the many faces of Umaru. The rest of the characters are as entertaining as ever. I certainly wouldn't have made it through the first season if it wasn't for Ebina and Kirie,...for example. Himouto!'s second season truly earns a perfect rating in the character department.People love to diss any type of series for lack of development, and this was especially true for the first first season. Does the second season do anything to remedy this? You could say the show ends the same way it started, but some things undoubtedly changed along the way.While the first season introduced us to these characters, the second season is much more focused on exploring their friendships and group dynamics. It was quite rewarding to finally see these lovely people properly hitting it off and bonding together. I was especially surprised by the change in the overall tone, as for every goofy scene there seemed to be an equal amount of emotional ones. In particular the feeling of nostalgia was heavily explored. The 2nd season made me feel a range of emotions. The end result was as tasty as eating chips and chocolate with the occasional sip of cola.On the flipside these emotional moments never truly lead us anywhere. The story of Himouto! (if there is one) is fractured and all we get are random everyday events. The scenes are usually loosely connected, but never in a meaningful way. This kind of structure is natural for a comedy, but it certainly doesn't let the series tap into the full potential of the more serious moments of Himouto!. Still, this could change by the end of the series, which is why I'm definitely keeping an eye on possible continuation.Overall, Himouto!'s second season was a very refreshing take on comedy. If you enjoyed the first season you should definitely check out this one as well, as it has all the strengths and less weaknesses. The characters are better realized and still extremely endearing. They even gave us a banging ED, so go check it out. for example.

While not always having laugh out loud moments, each episode delivered and I always ended up with a heartfelt smile.*Semi-spoilers and Personal Analysis*Many people describe Umaru as bratty and annoying, but upon closer inspection I believe she...is actually trying to make up for a strict and perhaps unhappy childhood. While it is never actually stated, we see some hints here and there that the siblings parents are not actually engaged in their children's lives, meaning that they are either dead (in case of the mother) or uninterested in them (in case of the father).We know from the first season that Umaru only actually developed his 'indoor' persona after a year of living with her older brother, and while we do see her throwing tantrums with some of her friends she doesn't really act in a mean way other than with her brother. Even then she is shown to express guilt when pushing things too far and feelings of loneliness whenever he is not around. To me this is actually a sign of the deep emotional attachment she has to him as well as her emotional development.You see child prodigies with strict childhoods tend to develop child-like traits later in life. Add to this the fact that their age difference is 10 years, and it is clear that the relationship they have is not of siblings but that of a parent/child. Some examples in Taihei's commitment to cooking so that Umaru can eat healthy food, teaching her responsibility while playing an addicting game, and being strict when he really needs to.Young parents should relate to this 'look at me' attitude of small children and I think this is what will make this series enjoyable for them. For the rest of the cast I also enjoyed the teams of social developments, such as Kirie dealing with social anxiety, Sylphyn 'be loud to make friends' attitude and Ebina's awkwardness at being a country girl living in the city. is actually trying to make up for a strict and perhaps unhappy childhood.

Here we go! `(^.^)´When I read that there would be a sequel to Umaru-chan I felt very happy and excited. Now I could look forward to meeting the characters again and hopefully get to know more about Umaru-chan and all the others in the upcoming sequel. Though I was a bit worried about how this show would be different to the first one, my worries was blown away after finishing Himouto! Umaru-chan R.I can gladly tell you that this show was even better than the first one!If you are looking for something easy and...light to watch, with a dash of humor in it, this is hopefully what you are looking for. The art is very good, I have nothing to complain or point out about it. The only thing that I wish this show would have is a stronger story. I love the simplicity of Himouto! Umaru-chan R, but I think it could have been even better if the studio went deeper into exploring some of the main plots. Now they are only scratching on the surface and it annoys me a little. I want to know more.To put it simple, this is a show for those who wants a light hearted, enjoyable, sometimes hilarious slice-of-life show. For me, the main thing about this show is the developing of the characters who I came to like very deeply and identify with.I hope we will be re-united with Umaru-chan and all her friends soon, and I also hope this review was helpful for someone. light to watch, with a dash of humor in it, this is hopefully what you are looking for.

Umaru-chan R, but I think it could have been even better if the studio went deeper into exploring some of the main plots. Now they are only scratching on the surface and it annoys me a little. I want to know more.To put it simple, this is a show for those who wants a light hearted, enjoyable, sometimes hilarious slice-of-life show. For me, the main thing about this show is the developing of the characters who I came to like very deeply and identify with.I hope we will be re-united with Umaru-chan and all her friends soon, and I also hope this review was helpful for someone.', ""PLOT: Season 2 continues off with the momentum! This time, Umaru decides to take a leap of faith & be more outgoing with her friends. Her adventures gets more interesting with the encounters they deal with in every episode. Not a lot has changed to be honest...CHARACTERS:Umaru: Sweet, kind, funny, adorable, cute, lazy, intelligent & a total foodie. She still loves video games and anime. Surprisingly, I'm still impressed on how she can have so many personalities while her friends noticing & still maintain good grades.Taihei: Caregiver & older brother of Umaru. He's responsible & does a lot of cooking in the house. We get...to see him with his friends at work more this season.Slyphin: Umaru's rival & UMR's friend, she loves Japanese culture & is very competitive. She is also very kind & caring when it comes to her family & friends.Ebina: Umaru's friend & neighbour, still shy & adorable, but has growing feelings for Umaru's brother.Kirie: Umaru's friend & (technically) Chibi Umaru's Master lol, she's kind & caring too but at times can have a bit of an intimidating look. She is an aspiring artist & has a complicated love-hate relationship with her older brother.OVERALL: Even though not all has happened this season... It is still a fun anime to watch. Umaru is still adorable where a lot of us can relate to her, her personality & mannerisms. I just hope one day she can reveal her identity as UMR & her himouto (chibi-self). to see him with his friends at work more this season.Slyphin: Umaru's rival & UMR's friend, she loves Japanese culture & is very competitive.

Instead of talking about specifics, I'll just directly point out the main reason why this season was unbearable:The brother main character keeps to himself the location and phone number of a brother of one of Umaru's friends, and they've said they've been looking for the whereabouts of that brother for 10 years. The brother MC notices the brother has the same last name as her, has the same hairband as her, acts like her... but doesn't bother simply asking that brother if he was related...to her or not. Why you may ask? They never explain why. Which makes the brother MC an inconsiderate dumbass, and any shipping with Umaru's friend feel infuriating, when I was happily routing for them the first season.This season has less funny moments, and more emotional ones, and the emotional ones never lead to any gratifying conclusions. This season tried to shove too much generic, uninteresting friendship sentimentality instead of fun times with Umaru in her room.This show does not deserve our affection. I liked this show cause it was funny, but if you really want to give me all these emotional moments and have me genuinely like these characters, then no. Umaru is unlikable since she keeps these identities secret from her friends, purple-hair friend is unlikable since she's always spiteful to those around her, blue-hair girl is generic in how happy-go-lucky she always is, and the brother MC, as mentioned before, IS A DUMBASS.Red-hair girl was this show's saving grace for me, but since they keep shoehorning the romance between her and an idiot, it becomes unbearable.Less funny, more generic, unsatisfying, uninteresting slice of life bullsh*t. If you want this type of comedy with great characters, just skip this season and watch Lucky Star. to her or not. Why you may ask? They never explain why.

Umaru-chan herself is starting to realize her laziness, and the other characters—they feel more characterized than before.Don't expect new characters—it's the same thing, except twice as better. We get more screentime for the side characters (like Sylphynford's brother) and more relaxing scenes. We get to see more of UMR, and we get to see Taihei and Ebina-chan together.The art style is the same thing as it was before, and the sound is also the same thing as it was before. I liked the opening and ending songs more...than the previous one, though.Umaru's laziness is still there, except twice as lazy (and twice as hate and murderous intent I want towards her loli side).My overall enjoyment for this show is great, it's because it's greater and have more fun than the first season. This is a good anime to watch when you're bored, if you don't have any problems with Umaru, that is.It's okay to watch the first season, because I think this isn't a second season at all—more like a reboot. than the previous one, though.Umaru's laziness is still there, except twice as lazy (and twice as hate and murderous intent I want towards her loli side).My overall enjoyment for this show is great, it's because it's greater and have more fun than the first season.

I knew I wasn’t going to like it, yet in the end, I had no choice but to see it as I was running low on space on my HDD and had to delete something. You can see from my score that I didn’t like it quite much (as I had expected). After I finished watching...the second season, I was torn between giving it a 5 or a 6. In the end, I gave it a 6 because I appreciated the animation, and the sound wasn’t half bad. Were it for the characters and plot alone, the show wouldn't have gotten anything above a 4.::: Story :::The story of Himouto Umaru-chan is repetitive at best. When it comes to plot, it is nonexistent. Or maybe it was me who couldn't grasp it. Yet, after going over the other reviews, I came to realize that most of the negative ones come from people with the same opinion as me. One can argue the plot is about the titular character, Umaru, overcoming her inner identity and revealing it to her friends. However, this never happens in the course of the series (I haven't read the manga). There is even one episode (the second one of the Specials), where the revelation of her secret identity is teased, but the episode ends rather anticlimactically and this revelation never happens, as Kirie stops Umaru just when she is about to tell them. Talk about convenient.::: Art :::I have to admit that the art of this show was decent, to say the least. It wasn't anything groundbreaking, mind you, but it wasn't disastrous either. The colors were vivid and the animation was smooth for the most of the show, and I didn't even see the Blu-Rays - just the regular TV release. The art isn't getting more than a 7 though, because the character designs weren't anything original and memorable, except maybe Umaru's inner self, although I understand they were probably trying to stick to the original manga art.::: Sound :::Usually, when it comes to sound in an anime, I can only think of songs (OP/ED songs, insert songs, maybe some soundtrack). I don't know how people judge VAs in anime. I can't. I mean, when it comes to this show, I didn't find any of the voices grating or sounding out of character, but that's it. I don't even know what a voice must be to sound out of character. When it comes to the songs and the soundtrack though, I have an opinion. Generally, the OP songs of both seasons were annoying at best. They were both sung by Umaru's VA and described how much Umaru likes to lounge around, eat junk food, and exploit her brother. Yeah, I'm not kidding here. The EDs, especially the first season's, were okayish. Nothing spectacular or eargasmic again. Yet, the 6 goes for the soundtrack, as there was one particular score I really liked.::: Character :::I think it's fair to say the characters were this show's worst aspect. I could put up with everything else, from the repetitive story to the annoying songs. Yet, the characters were what made the experience unbearable for me. I'm writing this review mostly to express my utter disdain for them. Well, mostly for Umaru. Honestly, after all the anime shows I've seen in my life, I've never before come across such an irritating character. My irritation grows even further when I see that many people actually liked her and even RELATED to her! I mean, WHAT?! How can someone such as Umaru be relatable in any bloody way?The thing about Umaru is that she is sporting two different identities that, when combined, make her the most irritating person in the whole world, anime character or not.When Umaru goes out, she is a model student with perfect grades (always gets 100 on tests), outstanding at all kinds of sports (she can beat the captains of all school sport clubs), and with fine manners (she is generous and kind, and simply the perfect human being when it comes to personality). Not only that but she is so exceptionally beautiful and perfect that all boys swoon over her and all girls admire her and want to be her friends.However, when she goes home, she dons her favorite hamster hood and transforms (yes, and no one but her brother can recognize her) into a 40-centimeter-tall orange blob of a sluggard, who doesn't do anything but watch anime, read manga, play games, eat junk food, and drink cola. A lot of cola. And this continues for the rest of the day before she goes to sleep. If you think I'm exaggerating, go watch the show and see for yourself.The thing is, her outer and her inner self are in total discord. For instance, I don't understand how a person can constantly lounge around, eat junk food and not gain any weight. Umaru doesn't only not gain any weight - no, she has the most perfect body of all girls her age. Not only that but she is exceptional in sports. I mean, seriously?After watching the show, I did my research and found out that Japanese students spend at least two hours per weekday on homework, and even three hours on Sundays. Yeah, right. Throughout the show, I didn't see Umaru study for her classes at all (except that one time before the finals), let alone do her homework. From the OP of the second season it becomes somewhat clear that her brother Taihei is doing her homework, but when I thought about it, it didn't click together entirely. Because what about when Taihei works overtime and comes home late at night and is so exhausted that he goes to sleep right away? Or when he goes on business trips and doesn't come home for days? It would mean Umaru goes to school without homework. And she still maintains perfect grades. Right. You know what, if I go to school without having done my homework even one time, I'll get a straight F. No excuses. No compromises.However, what irritates me the most about Umaru is her childish personality. The spoiled brat would cry for trifles, and would always get whatever she wants by crying and throwing tantrums. Honestly, every time I saw her rolling on the floor and crying because she wanted a particular game or magazine, I wanted to turn into an anime character, get into the show, and kick her snotty ass out the window. And the worst part of her character is that she never changes. Yes, she makes a few friends throughout the show, but she never musters the courage to tell them about her inner self. So in the end, her story becomes pointless and never teaches you anything (except maybe that it's fine to pretend to be who you are not, and then to be a total drone when no one sees you).Which brings me to the other main character I didn't like - Umaru's brother, Taihei. It seems the trend in modern anime is for the male characters to lack backbone. Throughout the whole series, I just wished for Taihei to man up and give a good lesson to his younger sister. However, instead of doing it, he kept on spoiling her. He would buy her anything she wanted, from games and anime DVDs to a new car! Yes, in the first season, Umaru saw a commercial for a car, told Taihei she wanted it, and he immediately agreed to buy it. And if it weren't for Taihei's fear of driving, he would have actually purchased it. Just so Umaru can use it to lounge in the backseat. Because that's why she wanted the car in the first place.Some people may argue with me and say that Taihei loves Umaru and that's why he spoils her. Well, guess what! Spoiling a child out of love is the worst thing a parent (or an older sibling in this case) can do. If the child never learns to accept failure and denial, what is their life going to be when they grow up and have to live on their own? I mean, Umaru isn't planning to always live with her brother and rely on him for everything, is she? That would be pretty savage of her. But knowing her, I wouldn't be surprised if that's what she is thinking.If it weren't for his backbonelessness and inability to stand up for himself, Taihei would have been a likable character. He is smart, and we even see some of his backstory at school, where he was a model student with perfect grades. However, unlike Umaru, he actually spent his days studying to be on top of his class so that he didn't do anything else and didn't nurture any hobbies of his own. And he wasn't admired for being the most handsome boy. On the contrary, he had average looks.Now, I'm in no way saying that having average looks is crucial for a character to be relatable. However, what is crucial is for the character to make sense. We never learn about Taihei's lifestyle out of school, so I can't say for certain that it fully corresponds to his looks, but judging by his obsession with studying, he couldn't have had a lot of time to think about his appearance. However, Umaru deliberately doesn't care about her appearance and at the same time she looks stunning. Moreover, she doesn't study at all, but still somehow is the top-grade student at school. This is what doesn't make sense and makes her an annoying character. I mean, if such a person existed in real life, they would live without a single care in the world and would be always happy and contented with their life. Therefore, such person shall not exist.Anyway, moving on to the rest of the cast, I can only say they were as bland and unimaginative as any character in a low-profit anime these days - cardboard cut-outs sporting stereotypical personalities (although, as far as I know, the show did well in sales). They contributed to nothing and had no goals of their own except for befriending Umaru. Yeah, that's right. Both Sylphin's and Kirie's objectives in the anime were to befriend Umaru (Kirie even wanted to protect her, wtf?). Kirie actually had a goal of her own, but she barely pursued it in the show and it still involved (surprise!) Umaru. Both Kirie's and Sylphin's brothers were stereotypical characters as well, although they got so little screen time I even forgot to mention them at first.Ebina was maybe the most realistic character in the anime, but she was extremely downplayed and turned into a stuttering laughingstock so that even when she had good moments in the show, they weren't able to erase the damage her character had already taken. For example, near the end of season two, we learn that Ebina's bad grades come from her panicking during tests and being unable to concentrate. Once she managed to get rid of her panic, her grades majorly improved. However, since this happened almost at the end of season two, her one instance of being smart wasn't able to make up for the shame of a dumbhead she had been before. Yet, since she wasn't constantly fixated on Umaru, I would say she had some charm that made her tolerable for me.The show even introduced another character in the middle of the second season - Hikari. Honestly, when I first saw her, I thought she would be a very good character - a formidable opponent for everything Umaru was. However, being introduced so late in the show, she barely had any screen time and when she did, she was mostly doing one and the same thing - trying to claim Taihei for herself (she even called him 'Onii-chan'). Her lack of screen time really disappointed me and I hope the studio releases a third season where Hikari's character is better explored. But please, don't make her lose to Umaru in any way. PLEASE!::: Enjoyment :::After my ranting about the characters, I think it's time I continue with the next part of this review. All in all, I didn't enjoy this anime, and Umaru was the primary reason for this. However, I can't deny the fact that I marathoned the series in one night (as I always do with 1-cour shows), and was almost unable to feel the time that had passed. This means the show didn't drag on and although the story was repetitive, each episode had enough stuff going on so that I wasn't bored before I had finished it. Anyway, the show being a comedy, I can't remember many moments that struck me as particularly funny. I think I only managed to laugh two or three times for both seasons, and it was a half-hearted wry laugh. Seriously, I couldn't find anything FUNNY about Umaru and her relationship with her brother, but I managed to find many ANNOYING things about it. With that said, at least the show managed to squeeze some emotional response from me, be it a negative one.::: Overall :::To wrap it up, I didn't like Himouto Umaru-chan, and was constantly pissed off at the titular character. I wouldn't recommend the show if you're looking for a good comedy. However, if you are looking to ride the hype train (which seems to be gone already at this point), I advise you to watch the anime, as it is one of those shows that spawn endless discussions (or at least memes) for a good period of time. So, if you want to have a common topic to discuss with your friends (and if you want to better understand the memes going around), this show is for you. the second season, I was torn between giving it a 5 or a 6.

So, if you want to have a common topic to discuss with your friends (and if you want to better understand the memes going around), this show is for you."", ""How the days go fast indeed, not only in the show, where 12 episodes cover a whole year,s but only in real world, where 12 episodes felt like a lightning flash, something about this show that really distinguished is from any other, even the first season feels like a stranger in comparison, your favorite references are still present, the wholesome jokes is as lively as ever too, but what's the real new thing is “actual plot”, not going to lie, the first season, was so vague, pointless stuff occurring in a typical slice of life comedy anime, but this one has a strange addition, you...can really feel a progression in the story, the characters are doing something for once, they are developing as times goes by.- Story (7.8/10):12 episodes that follow the life of a slacker, Umaru-chan, the perfect girl in the eyes of many along with her brother Taihei, while interacting like they siblings they are, they make some changes to the people surrounding them, they influence them to improve, to change their personalities, and enhance their treats, like for example with the shy unpopular Ebina, who gains confidence, and the lonely Kirie-chan who wins friends she can depend on, from time to time, there are those little glimpses of few character's flashbacks that really help clear things out, and desyphers the way they are. It's really satisfying how they dug up their past, only to make them seem connected somehow.- Art (8/10):I haven't noticed any differences between this animation, and that of the first season, both are great and colorful, very lively and wholesome, ever wondered how could a drawing be wholesome? Here it is, how the characters are drawn, how the backgrounds blend so well with the atmosphere and everything, something that this anime does so well, is the representation of food, yes you heard me right, food looks so much more appealing in anime and manga, but in this particular show, it's done so well that it makes you believe it was done by purpose, and that's just one example.- Sound (8/10):I can't think of a better fitting score for this, just like the first season, the same wholesome tracks play all the time, nothing new, or at least that's what I think, I really like the opening, it was one of those openings that are really odd and unlikable at the beginning,but I really grew to love it, and the same can be said about the ending song.- Character (7.8/10):Your same old characters, but less annoying (yes, looking at you Sylphinford freaking Tachibana), and more likable, like Kirie-chan, what really helped raise the quality of the characters is the way they developed into the best, Bomber and Alex got some more screentime, and so did Kanau, I thought that was great, there were few other characters introduced, like family members, some of them were really interesting, but some of them were just not welcomed, of at least that's how I felt when I first saw Hikari.- Enjoyment (8.5/10):One might argue that this anime is just a waste of your precious time, a waste of resources and energy, it has no story for it, nothing at all, BUT, this second season, looked much more dynamic, it felt like the studio learned from their mistakes, and improved upon them, I really enjoyed every bit of this anime.- Overall (8.02/10):Yes, the decimal precision matters in the score.Would I recommend this anime?

Umaru-chan got a second season which was pretty surprising for me, but I have to say that the series is pretty decent and kind of enjoyable to watch.This series is kind of enjoyable, it makes you laugh sometimes but its also kind of boring and annoying, like its predecessor. The art and story are pretty decent and nothing out of ordinary for a slice of life. The best thing about this anime is the characters, which they are pretty cute and really enjoyable to watch. For a slice of life anime is pretty good and enjoyable but somites it gets lazy and...boring.I recommend to watch this anime if you enjoy slice of life and comedy but be bearable with the main protagonist and how enjoying she can get. I honestly enjoy this season than the first one.(￣ω￣) boring.I recommend to watch this anime if you enjoy slice of life and comedy but be bearable with the main protagonist and how enjoying she can get. I honestly enjoy this season than the first one.(￣ω￣)', ""It looks like there's some kind of jinx on the second seasons of popular anime. First it was New Game!! and now, Himouto! Umaru-chan.The story continues with the daily lives of our favorite Himouto, Umaru and her friends. It's not an continuation from the first season, but more like a new series on it's own. The characters are all still in their high school and enjoying their lives, and the show tries to capture a glimpse of it.While the first season was a hilarious comedy, the second season tries to make it a bit more serious and fails. I am not saying that it's...all bad, but I expected better. There's less of good laughs and more of moe moments, which are bit too much irritating for me.The art is good as expected and nothing much to say here. Ebina-chan sure looks cute when she blsuhes tho.The anime falls a bit flat when it comes to the sound. The OP and ED are not at all good compared to the first season. I've seen better OSTs thsi season too.The character is one point where the anime tries to shine. Himouto! Umaru-chan R takes all your favorite girls and shows their bonding. Kirei-chan specially has developed a lot and so has Ebina-chan when it comes to her feelings. As for others, Taihie and Umaru remains the same lovable brother and sister. Bomba sure is entertaining. As for Sylphin, I never liked her much and to add it, there's one more new character here, Hikari. I don't think I like her much, yep.Overall, if I had to say, I'd give this a 6. A poor score, considering how much I loved the first season and the specials, but that's it. Himouto! Umaru-chan R is as bland as it can be, with little or no laughs.

We're finally past the focus on the paradisiacal and gimmicky otaku life of Umaru and her dual personality. The focus now is the development of the characters' friendship and their daily life together. A lot more time is dedicated to the other girls and their problems and concerns, which actually makes Umaru more relevant and interesting as a character since this time around she can be more than something for her older brother to bear and clean up after it. We get a chance to see her more of her behavior as a friend and...how she tries to improve the lives of the people around her… except her brother's life that is, she is still a toy hoarder and can't clean up after herself.Now that Umaru, Kirie, Tachibana and Ebina is officially a group of friends, that's where the series goes; There's a getting together for christmas episode, getting together to go to the poll episode, going to the amusement park together, getting together to see some fireworks, going to the beach together, the works. The interactions are more varied and have a better pace, but don't expect too much. It's a very episodic anime. Like before, all problems the characters have are superficial, it’s either there for a joke or to be easily overcome. Everyone has a kind heart and everything works out in the end.

Now, me saying that might make me look like a dumbass, but I've had the feeling that I was watching a 24-episode anime, instead of a 2-season with 12-episodes each-type-anime. Apart from that, it was still as enjoyable as the first season, still as funny and I'd recommend it if you want to watch something to relax your mind off of some stressful events in life.Umaru's back at it again, and it seems that she won't let go of her habit in a long...run.

When I came across the first season, I don\'t know why but I was so hooked that I binged the entire thing so fast, since then I was really hoping for a sequel and I am GLAD we got this cause it is so enjoyable and just what I needed after watching some serious dark anime like Made in Abyss.I usually say for anime like this, there is really nothing much to break down, They are just made for you sit back and have a good time, but in modern anime, shows like this...are so over saturated that a lot of time you can\'t give them a pass, They force a bunch of bad jokes and stereotypical cuteness at your face with a bunch of lazy ass characters that makes it seem like they are just trying to sell the show using a formual instead of giving you something to have a good time, and that\'s why a lot of these shows that use the same formula are so painful to watch but Himouto Umaru chan is just so organic, they do use a similar formula and it has it\'s fair share of cliched scenes, but using that they have constructed something that is so worthwhile.Part of what makes Umaru chan work is how effortlessly relatable it is, you gotta admit that there is an Umaru in all of us, she is the child in us that just wants to laze around, eat junk food and have fun all day and there are so many scenes that just make you go like ""Ah, That is so me!"".Also Why this show is good is this environment that is being created, it almost makes you want to go live there, that\'s how you know a slice of life is working. The different characters placed in this environment and the impact they have on the different personas of Umaru makes it seem like a superhero character and the interesting ways he hides his identity and reacts when he\'s not himself, apart from all the fun and jokes, this is the element of the show that really captivates you.Coming to the jokes, This shit is hilarious! You gotta be super serious to think this is not funny lmao, while I would say the second season isn\'t nearly as funny as the first one, they make up for it by kind of really exploring the other characters which I thought was really interesting and the way they connect these characters together and create circumstances really add to the flavor of the show. One gripe I do have about this show is the pacing of it, like they would build up scenes for Christmas and then go all the way to new year. Like what\'s the rush man? calm down gahdamn.Nothing much to say about the Art and Music, I usually skip the OP and ED. The background music does it\'s job but it\'s nothing to talk about, the Animation is cool, It is pretty consistent throughout and gives you that laid back and jolly feel so I will give them credit for that, The true magic is the voice acting, Hats off to the voice actors, they don\'t sound cute or funny just to be that, they deliver the jokes in a way that makes it feel genuine and 10 times funnier than it should be.Overall man this was a great season and I am really hoping for the announcement of a 3rd one, This is one of those shows you wish never end.

Character developments2. Character backstories told3. Umaru not as annoying as in first season4. More heartwarming than first season...Cons:1. Not for those who doesn\'t like moe Slice of life anime2. Umaru still can be kinda annoying at times3. Character ships hinted, but didn\'t progress<LONG REVIEW>Himouto Umaru-chan is an anime I stumbled upon in 2015 because of how popular it was back then. As a fan of moe Slice of Life anime myself, of course I had to watch it. After watching the 1st episode, at first I didn\'t really like it. I didn\'t like Umaru\'s character at all. But after watching a few more episodes, I found out that I actually enjoyed watching this. It\'s cute and the as a sister Umaru-chan is very like a sister in real life, a brat that no one likes. She isn\'t moefied to the Sagiri level and that\'s what I thank this anime for.Now where Umaru 2nd season stood out from it\'s previous season was in it\'s characters department. We got a lot more character backstories told to us this season to make us care about them. Each backstories told was surprisingly very heartwarming. I especially like learning about the characters when they are in their childhood days. They are very cute and likable. Character developments also took place more often in this season. You get to see characters getting past their old self and revealing a new side of them. Quite entertaining. At least the characters this season aren\'t as cardboard as they were in the first season.The OP and ED theme also stood out to me. The OP theme, if you read the lyrics, suits the anime pretty well. It\'s Umaru herself in the lyrics. The ED theme stirred quite a craze in Chinese Anime Streaming Site Bilibili where a lot of people are doing dance covers of it. I also found the ED to be  very catchy. The voice acting is great! The voice actors and actresses did their best to make the character feel realistic. The BGM aren\'t anything special, so no comment on that.That\'s pretty much it that made the 2nd season better than the first. This is a Slice of Life anime so no story is needed. The art and animation remained what it was like in the first season, no major changes. So ya, overall, what makes the 2nd season stood out more was thanks to its characters. They were well developed and were well built up. So if you hate the first season because of the shallow characters then watch this, I heard a lot of positive reaction from people who didn\'t like the fist season and fellow manga readers, so don\'w worry. That\'s it for my review. Thanks for reading. :) Cons:1. Not for those who doesn\'t like moe Slice of life anime2. Umaru still can be kinda annoying at times3.

This may not seem like a good story for an anime but hear me out, this anime is hilarious!Umaru Doma is a girl that's popular in school, she has good grades and friends, however, when she comes home, she turns into a lazy monster, a spoiled brat who gets everything from her brother. This is the second season of Umaru causing chaos and while I enjoy both I think the second season does a better job with the characters, especially Umaru. The second season doesn't do...much to change the story but it does have little side stories like Umaru's childhood friend Ebina trying to express her feelings to her crush, which adds to the comedy.If you want a good comedy I would suggest watching Himouto! Umaru-chan and the second season, but I'll admit that this series isn't for everybody. If you don't mind a little sister being mean to her older brother for a couple episodes then I think you would enjoy Umaru-chan much to change the story but it does have little side stories like Umaru's childhood friend Ebina trying to express her feelings to her crush, which adds to the comedy.If you want a good comedy I would suggest watching Himouto!

I watched the first season again-again every weekend after the hard work. I was so happy when they announced the second season. So let see my short review about this.I am happy because they didn't change the settings (same place, same soundtrack, same design), just new Himouto-s. Or at least I hoped for it. In the first season we already got to know how Himouto is our Umaru, and I thought there will be new ways to show this kind of lifestyle. This season concentrated about...the minor characters what I like very much (as a video gamer I always sorry about in a narrative video game that we can't get to know better these kind of characters), however it lacks of funny moments and that's why I rewatched the first season all the time because of these Himouto moments which are missing now.The one thing is that I dislike, or I mean the one I dislike in the season is the character of Hikari. She was very annoying and useless character, I see her as a lame or wannabe Himouto. After I saw her for the third time I couldn't stand it anymore and skipped those scenes with her in it.However I hope they will continue this anime because I still love it (see the romance of Ebina and Taihei, the progress of Kirie). So yeah it was a little bit of downside from the first season, but you will like this one too ;) the minor characters what I like very much (as a video gamer I always sorry about in a narrative video game that we can't get to know better these kind of characters), however it lacks of funny moments and that's why I rewatched the first season all the time because of these Himouto moments which are missing now.The one thing is that I dislike, or I mean the one I dislike in the season is the character of Hikari.

So yeah it was a little bit of downside from the first season, but you will like this one too ;)"", 'Himouto! Umaru-chan R is showing more dimensions to itself than the first season did...in a good way.Ok, so as a person who was highly skeptical about the first season and the major problem/dilemma of the main protagonist Umaru Doma voiced by Aimi Tanaka and her ""himouto-ness"" and oddly by the end of the first season LA warmed up to it, LA wondered if this second season that appeared ut of nowhere will stick the same old scthick or try some different. It tried something different.For sure, the Himouto-ness of this second season is still there with Umaru being her usual self and all with one...actual obstacle in the way but that a bit later. The actual improvement of this second season comes to the form of the character development and fleshing out of Umaru\'s friend circle of Kirie, Ebina and Sylphinford along with ALL their family members and LA does mean ALL. Kirie by FAR gets the majority of the stage presences in this season and though LA didn\'t like Kirie from the first season being the highly reserved and shy character she definitely opened up this season by interacting with nearly EVERY single character even outside of her click. Ebina gets into a bit to her older brother which sets out Ebina\'s twice shy romance with Taihei with the help of Kirie. Sylphinford gets some again in the form of her family members along with her usual antics with UMR and Umaru.Now for that obstacle Umaru faces, it\'s in the form of another little sister archetype Hikari Kongou voiced by Inori Minase vying for Taihei\'s attention for some reason and this obviously annoys Umaru to no end wanting Taihei all to herself. We do get to see who she is and what relation she has to Taihei and even though she\'s a rival to Umaru, she\'s VERY similar to Umaru personality wise (just without the himouto scthick). Which actually adds to the fact that Umaru DOES care about Taihei as a family member due to Hikari being in the picture even if many of Umaru\'s exploits led to some of her ulterior motives for her, Hikari acts as a good counterbalance to Umaru.The animation done by Doga Kobo is expected moeness and instills the same flavour from the first season, to be expected they also did the first season. There isn\'t much notable things to talk about for the animation as it\'s pretty much the same quality from the first season.The voice acting is obviously the same but like LA said about Kirie, LA obviously started to notice Kirie\'s voice actor Haruka Shirashi in the process and due to her character opening up, we get to see more of her range though it\'s the typical shy and hauntingly nervous, she does flex her vocal chops more this season. LA really likes Nana Ebina voiced by Akari Kageyama as a character even with her vocal archetype not being LA\'s type but she did quite well as well. Once again though some people might find her annoying but LA quite enjoyed Sylphinford\'s voice actor Yurina Furukawa and like from the first season injected that zany flair into this season with her opening her range as well for some of the more solemn moments of this season.There isn\'t a doubt that Himouto! Umaru-chan R is a vast improvement from the first season for LA and sure some people might think that just because of the character development gets flesh out means as much, but considering the first season\'s character development was more or less showing Umaru\'s himoutoness and her excessive laziness bringing in that divided towards people about this anime (like LA), showing more of Umaru\'s friends and their developments as characters was a welcoming change that LA didn\'t mind that Kirie or Ebina or Sylphinford had some focus as they desperately needed it otherwise they would have turned into one-note running gag characters.LA didn\'t expected a huge change to the structure of Himouto! Umaru-chan as a series but this change was enough for LA to still stick to Himouto! Umaru-chan even with her shortcomings as a slice of life anime looking at Himouto. actual obstacle in the way but that a bit later.

Which actually adds to the fact that Umaru DOES care about Taihei as a family member due to Hikari being in the picture even if many of Umaru\'s exploits led to some of her ulterior motives for her, Hikari acts as a good counterbalance to Umaru.The animation done by Doga Kobo is expected moeness and instills the same flavour from the first season, to be expected they also did the first season. There isn\'t much notable things to talk about for the animation as it\'s pretty much the same quality from the first season.The voice acting is obviously the same but like LA said about Kirie, LA obviously started to notice Kirie\'s voice actor Haruka Shirashi in the process and due to her character opening up, we get to see more of her range though it\'s the typical shy and hauntingly nervous, she does flex her vocal chops more this season. LA really likes Nana Ebina voiced by Akari Kageyama as a character even with her vocal archetype not being LA\'s type but she did quite well as well. Once again though some people might find her annoying but LA quite enjoyed Sylphinford\'s voice actor Yurina Furukawa and like from the first season injected that zany flair into this season with her opening her range as well for some of the more solemn moments of this season.There isn\'t a doubt that Himouto! Umaru-chan R is a vast improvement from the first season for LA and sure some people might think that just because of the character development gets flesh out means as much, but considering the first season\'s character development was more or less showing Umaru\'s himoutoness and her excessive laziness bringing in that divided towards people about this anime (like LA), showing more of Umaru\'s friends and their developments as characters was a welcoming change that LA didn\'t mind that Kirie or Ebina or Sylphinford had some focus as they desperately needed it otherwise they would have turned into one-note running gag characters.LA didn\'t expected a huge change to the structure of Himouto! Umaru-chan as a series but this change was enough for LA to still stick to Himouto! Umaru-chan even with her shortcomings as a slice of life anime looking at Himouto.', 'I found the sequel to Himouto! Umaru-chan much better than the 1st season. I found the first one just ok, however because I need anime to just binge and binge and binge while I do my hobbies like knitting, I still watched season 2.Much better. Each episode was refreshing and a nice change of location and scene. We got to see Umaru in several other outfits and states, with more character interactions and also a better juicier plot.It sounds contradicting for a slice-of-life to have a juicy plot, but I feel like a slice-of-life should at least be a bit more exciting and...have that productive ""it\'s another day!!"" vibe, cus it\'s a slice-of-LIFE, and we want to see someone with an exciting life, not a boring one. have that productive ""it\'s another day!!"" vibe, cus it\'s a slice-of-LIFE, and we want to see someone with an exciting life, not a boring one.', ""I don't know what that R stands for but it has done wonders to Umaru Chan compared to the first season! Himouto! Umaru-chan R goes more into the relations of the rest of the cast compared to exceedingly showing Umaru and Taihei which is where you see too much of the bad side of Umaru (ex - Guilt-tripping and awful treatment) Even those interactions have been improved as she actually seems to show regret and even admits to faults at times which in the previous season was a rarity. What could have caused this? I'm going to go out on a limb and say that...R stands for restorative because that's a synonym for wholesome. Seeing the girls and their older siblings build better bonds is a treat to the soul. This season features much more of the cast being supportive of one another and if you are into that kind of stuff I would highly recommend Himouto! Umaru-chan R.

Umaru-chan R."", ""tl;dr: A solid continuation of the lighthearted series that's similarly amusing but now has just enough plot to make you want to know how things progress.This is a continuation of the story of Umaru that pretty much picks up exactly where the first season leaves off and continues in the exact same way. As before, there isn't really any overarching plot, but rather its the story of Umaru and her friends as well as their brothers plus a couple other characters simply living their lives, and just as before it's similarly quite amusing and enjoyable to watch. Things to note this season though that make...it different from last season is that it feels like there was more progress in terms of things actually moving, in that character relations actually seemed to develop a good deal and it was nice seeing them learn more about each other and become closer friends. In terms of romantic relationships it didn't move that much, but it felt like it was getting to a point that it would get moving, which is actually a bit annoying, but I did enjoy what they did so far. It actually did set up some plot points, wherein I was really interested in what would happen when certain things were revealed to certain characters or certain characters who hadn't met before finally met. In the end none of it happened, and with the way the show is structured to be honest I have no idea whether it actually was close to happening or that's just wishful thinking, but I was surprised how interested I was in the direction things were going and not just the comedy. Though I should note that doesn't diminish any of the strengths it kept from the first season, wherein the show is still greatly light and relaxing with characters that are still adorable to watch and its still greatly amusing to watch their various skits.The art and animation were solid and I don't mind the chibi aspect as much anymore. The OP I thought was kind of weird audio wise, but visually it was solid. ED was solid.

Rather than, say, my personal preference for genre or art style.I think this series as a whole is somewhat of an unacknowledged gem. Why? Most who discuss it acknowledge its popularity, often with some degree of annoyance. The show is known for Umaru's obnoxious character and for being generally standard fare moeblob SoL packaged in such a manner to make it ripe for seasonal success but ultimately forgettable.I understand this take, I just kind of disagree with it.A good part of the show is...standard slice of life hijinks with an upbeat tone and decently executed comedy. But Umaru gives us some more meaty substance to chew on too, beneath it all.I'll note that, additionally, the show at least gives us basic conflicts between characters, differing motivations or desires in scenes to give us an idea of where it's going or what the joke or punchline is going to be. This is more than I can say for some moeblob SoL--where the point and purpose is just to generate gifs of cute girls doing cute things and call it a day.So what is that substance? After all the silly hijinks and playing out of the usual tropes, the show gives us some space for some really genuine emotional warmth and intimacy between its characters.It hits us with OST 39, which I will link,  https://youtu.be/Kunj2Uzy0Bg?t=3459, creating an atmosphere and a tone for a lot of tender kindness and human goodness. None of it feels particularly fake, it seems like a proper addendum to the silliness that makes up much of the show. It gives the characters space for a little more depth, and to characterize them as appreciating and caring for one another in a way that befits the relationships they have nominally as friends or siblings.It's nothing earth-shattering or revolutionary, but that little bit of warmth and emotional intimacy gives the show some humanity and realism that elevates it above simply being a moeblob SoL gif generator. standard slice of life hijinks with an upbeat tone and decently executed comedy.

The anime is calm , the characters are whimsical and it never takes itself too seriously neither does it suddenly forces something serious on us.The story is calm and just tells the story about a perfect girl who is a lazy brat in the background and how people meet and talk with her. Slowly we see her making friends and honestly through her own personality bring changes on the lives of people she meets through her kindness or innocence. It\'s a light hearted cartoon. The most ""serious"" theme it gets close to is how...time changes but even that is never too serious. The charecters simplicity also compliments this style.The characters , though they have their own struggle , the struggles are simple. Some deal with shyness , Some deal with inability to make friends while others just deal with social anxiety.Initially the charecter sometime might come across as too simple but it\'s not too bad. By the end i honestly had grown attached to all the characters and their simple nature.I would genuinely say watch this anime. Watch this to see something light hearted and simple. We have enough troubles in our lives so you might as well just calm down. time changes but even that is never too serious.

But unfortunately I cannot say the same for the second season.Without making the review too long, I will say that I don't care about Umaru's group of friends, all of whom are very annoying. The entire entertainment value of this anime was the goofy but sweet things Umaru did during the time she spent mostly in her room and the relationship she had with her older brother. While character development is very important in fictional stories, Umaru-chan is not that kind of story and it should have stayed the way...it was. In short, I would have prefered to watch mostly Umaru herself, just like in the first season, rather than Umaru's three idiotic and annoying friends.It's not something so hideous that you should definitely not watch it, but I can't recommend it either. it was.

I hope this anime opens doors for more josei adaptations.', 'The Ice Guy and His Cool Female ColleagueWhat comes to mind when someone mentions vanilla romance anime? Is it Horimiya? Is it Toradora? Well, I can now faithfully present to everyone The Ice Guy and His Cool Female Colleague. This anime is so vanilla it could be watched by an 8 year old. There is no foul language, no fanservice, and no devious characters. But does all of this translate into a good show? It really depends on the execution.We meet Himuro who is the son of an ice spirit as he begins working at some random cubicle company. But while walking to his...first day of work, he gets so nervous that he accidentally freezes himself. This leads to a chance encounter with Fuyutski who talks to him and eventually calms him down and he is able to thaw. They go their separate ways but soon, they find they work for the same company.The show details their progression as they slowly discover how they both have a huge crush on each other. We also focus on some of the side characters as they also form their own side relationships. Every trope is present in this show. The fireworks festival episode, the beach episode, it’s all there. Even though they are overused, they still provide at least some sort of entertainment. While it sounds like the setpieces for an interesting show on paper, this anime fails to do well on any of these points.The sole reason for this is that the characters are just massive NPCs. Mainly Fuyutski, she talks like a robot and the only positive trait I can say about her is that she is cute. But visual appeal can not save a character when they have the personality of a wet sock. In truth, I find the side characters to be far more entertaining than the MCs. The reason for this is likely that they are far more outgoing and loud. This opinion is purely based on subjectivity but regardless, they are far more captivating.Himuro is the “ice guy” mentioned in the title. He is by far my least favorite character in the entire series. His interactions with Fuyutski mirror that of a middle school boy trying to talk to his crush. He is mentally 11, I don’t see any good traits about him. He just fucking sucks, there is no other way he can be described.One of the worst parts about this show is that it takes barely any time to focus on the other characters. There was one episode that focused on the side characters and that was it. Any other time the side characters were featured were when they were tagging along with Fuyutski and Himuro’s elementary school field trip activities. In fact, they are often used as plot devices to get Himuro and Fuyutski closer to a confession which will happen when Rent-A-Girlfriend ends. A lot of the time, the fox furry girl just comments on how much she ships Himuro(Whom I will now call ice guy) and Fuyutski(whom I will now call wet sock because I don’t feel like spelling out Fuyutski) and the other random dude is kinda just there. It’s obvious that he likes the fox furry girl and even though he also has a chalkboard for a brain, him and the fox furry girl still are better to watch than the MCs.Many romance animes such as Love is War and Your Lie in April are so popular because they focus on not just the romance but every character’s interactions as a whole. For example, in Love is War, we see Ishigami slowly build up his confidence as he learns to befriend those around him. This type of formula in romance animes work because every characters gets a chance to shine. If you don’t like one character, that’s great because now you can watch an episode where a different individual is the star of the show.And in Your Lie in April, we see Arima build his confidence back up playing the piano with Kaori there to support him. The main characters deserve time to build themselves up without solely relying on their relationship with the other MC to make themselves a compelling character. In Ice Dude, the only character development seen is the snail’s pace that Himuro is taking to eventually confess to Fuyutski.Sadly, in The Ice Guy and His Boring Female NPC, ice guy and wet sock are the only two characters attention is focused on. The show attempts to insert comedic moments but none of them hit and it feels like even the characters don’t find it funny. Sometimes, there is a show that is so shitty that it will keep you watching. The phrase “So bad it’s good” can be aligned with many works of fiction such as Euphoria or The Emoji Movie.Well, toss all of that out the window because that phrase can only be implied to shows that actually have moments that keep you watching. The Ice Brain and His AI-generated female servant is so appallingly boring that it has taken all of my willpower to even continue watching the show.All in all, this show is about as entertaining as watching two chipmunks fight over a piece of hamburger meat from a Double Quarter Pounder. I was in a stupor most of the time watching this show and it adds nothing to the already oversaturated genre of rom-com anime. Do yourself a favor and never ever watch this show.:) first day of work, he gets so nervous that he accidentally freezes himself.

Do yourself a favor and never ever watch this show.:)', ""Not too long ago, I came to the conclusion that most romantic comedies these days falls under several formulas: the girl falls for a guy or vice versa through certain circumstances, character growth follows for the two main leads, and eventually a narrative story that dives into their relationship. In truth, The Ice Guy and His Cool Female Colleague doesn't avidly avoid these type of writing although it adds additional elements to attract the viewers' attention.Based on the josei manga of the same name, it's delightful to realize that the cast consists of adult characters. It avoids the high school setting that adheres to...every teenage drama imaginable. Instead, this anime takes place in an office environment where realistic circumstances brings together characters. The spicing on cake is the supernatural element, most humorously crafted with the icing on the cake. I do mean that in a literal way as our main male protagonist Himuro suffers from a case of freezing himself. Through emotions, he sometimes gets into a frenized state. The anime explores his emotions and feelings as he connects with other characters, most noticably his co-worker Fuyutsuki-san.The Ice Guy and His Cool Female Colleague takes a somewhat risk when adapting its premise because unlike standard rom-coms, it attempts to create a story that defies the logic of nature. Let's face it, a character getting frozen is not something we often see in romantic comedies too often. The same goes for youkai and fox spirits although one could argue that they exist more commonly by today's standards. Still, the anime does gets to a rough start with our two main characters having very similar personalities: stoic, reserved, yet also honest with each other. However, it is shown through Himuro's character that his outer apperance is more of an exterior that hides his timid side. Behind that face and personality is a shy man who is also a hopeless romantic. On the other hand, main female protagonist Fuyutsuki is much harder to read as she shows less emotions and avoids the gag of freezing herself. She's in much more control of her own emotions although throughout the show, we do see warmer sides of her. The character growth for both characters is a slow, and in some ways, a painful journey. I don't see this in a negative light but I'd also suggest viewers to keep their patience in check. Personally, I'm not the type of viewer that sticks around for an entire duration of a show to see if the two can even hold hands together.Among its character cast, not everyone has the similar stoic face as our protagonists. Characters such as Komori, Katori, and Yukimin are quite the opposite with their energetic personalities. The anime draws in animal motifs with supernatural features to further its gimmicks. Let me just say that this show attempts to balance out the colorful cast. Komori is a gold standard for bringing in the energy into the show. She displays an aura of playfulness and is never shy to be open about her feelings. Yet, the anime takes a very lighthearted approach to our character interactions, and rarely dives into a deep emotional drama. Even during heartfelt moments between Himuro and Fuyutuski, they are at most lighthearted with a feeling of gentle care.At this point, you're probably asking yourself if watching this rom-com is worth it for the story. After all, it falls under standard rom-com formulas and some episodes does put our cast into date-like scenarios. These include but not limited to amusement park date, going to the beach, shrine visits, and even Halloween theme contests. Common logic designates that the author wanted to bring our two main characters together as long as possible. It's everyday scenarios such as going to the amusement park together that allows people to bon. At its most basic form, the anime does a decent job at defrosting Himuro and Fuyutsuki's personaliteis. There are geninue moments when the two displays affections towards each other. Most viewers who sees these would interpret it as romantic but one could also it as a deeper connection. Nonetheless, the most important way to enjoy this show is how you approach it.The collective efforts of studio Zero-G and Liber ultimately gave us this rom-com with an unorthodox cast of characters. Judging on the technical quality, you won't be blown out of the water but will see the charm of character emotions. The most evident way to see this is the reactions of our main leads, such as Himuro blushing furiously when his emotions reaches its peak. The studio efforts made these characters react such ways to show their personalities as much as possible. Otherwise, the supernatural elements of the show feels like a letdown that overstayed its welcome. Trust me, the youkai and fox attributes quickly wears its magic off and brings little substance to the show overall. And also, there are lots of cat moments in this show, so I hope you like cats.It's no masterpiece for sure. In fact, The Ice Guy and His Cool Female Colleague hits some of the bare miminum themes for a romantic comedy. Yet, I do praise the author for daring to bring in some unnatural elements in an office environment with adolescents. Having finished this show, this definitely could've been better. You'd just have to limit your expectations with this one. every teenage drama imaginable.

You'd just have to limit your expectations with this one."", 'This show poses one really good food of thought: Wouldn\'t it be cool if people from ancestral spirits commune with one another just like the typical ordinary daily life, from work to home and hanging out together? It is that imaginative.If you thought that you\'re having a close resemblance of WotaKoi while watching this show, you\'re exactly right, though in some good and bad ways. This is mangaka Miyuki Tonogaya\'s Koori Zokusei Danshi to Cool na Douryou Joshi a.k.a The Ice Guy and His Cool Female Colleague, which is just Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii a.k.a Wotakoi: Love is Hard for Otaku, but fantastical like...because of how the premise is set up. It\'s been close to 5 years since WotaKoi dressed up to the 9\'s towards the anime scene, and people still to this day, gush about its greatness in many a certain way, though not as much right now with how so many seasonal anime are pumped out these days. That said, if you are looking for a close alternative to WotaKoi through watching this show, hear me out before you make a decision.Adult-casted workplace series are a dime a dozen, but in context to this show, it\'s considering modern-day classics like WotaKoi, or even as far back as the Working!! a.k.a Wagnaria!! franchise back in the early 2010s. You might say it\'s just a narrative plot on how these are usually set up with the characters anchoring the series, and I can agree with you on that, though the execution depends on whoever you ask if it\'s either decent or not. Such is the case of this show here, which features people whose ancestors were spirits. The main couple (as you can tell) are dubbed the Ice Guy and the Cool Female Colleague: the Yuki-Onna a.k.a Snow Woman descendent Himuro and the regular human that is Fuyutsuki, with a calm and collected spirit. Himuro, for better or for worse, shows his feelings through snowstorms / blizzards: the stronger the blizzard, the greater the affection. The both of them were hired by the same company and starting off a new job, and it\'s the basis of this interaction that Himuro slowly falls in love with the somewhat oblivious woman who loves flowers and cats, and has a cat named Nyamero. You could say that she is a descendent of a cat spirit, and I\'d like to believe so that she is just the calm and cool human that she is, just hanging around with the bunch of regular and spirit-descendent humans. Himuro has a younger sister named Yukimin, and she is the idol streamer that has her fanbase as well, though she lives off with her seemingly innocent older brother.The side cast of the show are also what makes and breaks the series, and I\'m just both glad and disappointed that they were not shown much to create the same diversity and effect as WotaKoi does, or maybe it\'s that I input in myself a modest expectation going into this show. Like the main duo, there are both regular and spirit-descendent humans: the typical Saejima, the playful Fox spirit Komori, the outlandish Phoenix spirit Katori and the manager Otonashi, and not forgetting their department boss and company president, which as you\'ve guessed it, is also a spirit-descendent of the Buddha and the Nurarihyon (yokai). Saejima is a sharp guy, and Komori\'s the playful woman, so these two are peas in a pod of self-awareness, especially since they are close towards Himuro and Fuyutsuki, with the former being lovestruck whenever Fuyutsuki appreciates him at every corner to let them have their own lovey-dovey scene. For Katori and Otonashi, I love how Katori is this unhinged man shining like a star at everything, owing to his Phoenix descendent traits, while Otonashi is just playing along with his traits like a mother caring for a child. I especially loved how WotaKoi got the side cast formula right the first time, so being full of expectations and looking towards this show for the exact same, I quickly learned that shows like these need the side cast for the series to perform at its best, and though WotaKoi aced the execution, this show was mild on that portion, choosing to bias for the main couple instead. That\'s not to say that the main couple are uninteresting, because they really are forging the humans, both typical and spirit-descendent together in its own way, which I am totally fine with the interactions of the character cast. But the diversity of the side cast is just as equally important, and somehow this show missed the mark, at least for me. You can love or hate it the same way it\'s presented here.The production side is an interesting one to say the least. A collaboration between Zero-G and Liber, it\'s a decent effort for a rather rom-com like adaptation that has its moments, especially with Himuro\'s constant blizzarding and snowman-ing of feelings objected towards the people around him. Even more so, the staff are not really that known for their prowess in such a show like this. Director Mankyuu kinda suffered a long drought where he didn\'t direct anything else other than the iD@LMASTER franchise of SideM and Cinderella Girls, and this was way back before the 2020s. Scriptwriter Tomoko Konparu last worked on last year\'s Love All Play, before then also suffering the same drought where shows like Nil Admirari no Tenbin and Kakuriyo no Yadomeshi were the rage back in Spring 2018. This is Miyako Kanou\'s first time doing character design work, before all of her prowess in the animation space as mainly key and more recently directorialship, and it\'s got a style that I kinda quite like though. Music composer Ruka Kawada helmed shows like the Kiniro Mosaic and Gochuumon franchises a few years back, and you can quite tell that it was definitely geared for a more girlish-centric OST since this manga was made for the Josei a.k.a adult woman demographic. In many a sense, there\'s not really that much to direct this towards its best, but all the effort here shows that they just need to do a good work, and they did it.The music here is what I\'ll give praise to the show about. Takao Sakuma\'s ""Frozen Midnight"" for the OP is very catchy, alluring and comforting to the musical senses, and I would say that it\'s one of the better OPs of the season, in a slew of not a lot of standouts. This is the same for Nowlu\'s ED Rinaria, which after coming off from last season\'s ""Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman."", has struck gold again with a song that\'s lovely with the tunes, as it is to listen to no end.Overall, for a show, which Crunchyroll advertises as the ""heartwarming workplace where a snowy-white romance blows in like a blizzard"", I definitely didn\'t feel like the descendent of the Cupid that constantly gets my heart love-shot for rom-com shows like these. If anything, the show tries to play it safe since it\'s coming off from the manga, and this is a safe show where you could just pick it up and relax to, no problems at all. It\'s just that you have to manage your expectations for this show being a lesser WotaKoi, but yet with the same amount of whimsical fun that only this show has its flex on the docket.It\'s a decent chill pill, but hey, you may like it. because of how the premise is set up. It\'s been close to 5 years since WotaKoi dressed up to the 9\'s towards the anime scene, and people still to this day, gush about its greatness in many a certain way, though not as much right now with how so many seasonal anime are pumped out these days.

MAL reviews tend to review anime like all anime should be a generation defining masterpiece, I will be upfront and say that Ice Guy isn’t that. Not at all. But what Ice Guy is though, makes the anime worth watching!What Ice guy is aiming to do: be a nice fluffy rom com with an adult cast of loveable/interesting characters, it does well.Characters/Story:I can’t stress how much I love that...this show has an adult cast, it’s such a nice change of pace compared to the run of the mill high school romances we get every season and the older I get, the more I appreciate a story set outside of that setting.The character interactions are warm, cute, and funny – which I think is the main highlight to this show. You fall in-love with the characters.The characters in Ice Guy are beautifully done character design wise and all the outfits they wear are such a nice touch. The supernatural aspect of the show, with some of the characters being descendants of spirits makes for an interesting twist to the usual office romance, but the show doesn’t rely on it as a crutch. In-fact, especially in later episodes I thought the small additions to how Himuro-kun expresses himself was a great touch & added to the story.There isn’t anything huge that happens in this story! It is a slow burn, based around slice of life everyday happenings, so in that sense I’d temper your expectations – however, it is not a boring watch by any means.All the romances in the story get their chance to shine, and I think that’s another great aspect of the show – do I wish certain romances were explored further? Yes! But I hope a season two, if it ever comes to fruition solves that issue.The story does feel incomplete, but the source material isn’t done yet so that makes sense – but I think that’s a big weak point story wise.Animation:I don’t think Studios Liber & Zero-G had much budget to do this show, however, even with that limited budget I think they made the show look fairly amazing. The environments are warm, and they do immerse you into the world of the show. There are random episodes where the quality does seem to drop a bit, but I guess that’s expected.The eye animations they did in this show were great, and super expressive. I think this is one of the strongest aspects in the animation department.TLDR:Is this going to be a life changing watch? No. But is it nice to put on after a long day at work? Oh. 100% yes.

I am so starved for adult romance that show cases a light hearted and healthy relationship. I really like Wotakoi and the budding romance within Saint's Magic is Omnipotent (which granted I had issues with, but that is not the point).I was actually disappointed by the end of the anime, it felt like a romance tease all the way through with no payoff....Art 8I really enjoyed the art on here, the characters were all so beautifully drawn to me especially Himuro and Fuyutsuki. I think otherwise the non-human characters stood out more, except the president of the company, she honestly matched the color scheme of Himuro despite being a different non-human creature.I also really liked some of the scenes with Himuro's ice involved, I thought in some places it was cutesy in other places it was beautiful.Sound 7Okay for real the OP fucking goes hard, that shit slaps so much. It is truly a vibe. It feels cool like the main character Himuro. Like the intro just feels icy in a good way. The ED was fine, it was a little jazzier, with less flashy animation, its cute and simple.Character + story 4.5?I am mixed here, because honestly everyone felt a little lacking in depth. Honestly the only person we really get background on is Fuyutsuki and that is only a snippet of her and what she was like in school, which was cold and stoic. I feel like she was the typical shy girl who doesn't recognize her feelings for Himuro.Himuro, the only note I have here is what is up with him turning into a literal child when he gets too warm, that felt weird and out of place and kinda creepy. Like he internally had an adult voice, but externally he had  kid voice. It was weird, and even weirder for him to crush on Fuyutsuki while he was in kid form and her just be like oh he was adorable, like what? When he was in that stage both times Fuyutsuki had to take care of him, and not like in a romantic way or it felt weird to even think of it in a romantic way because h was literally a child. Like she literally had to buy a kid ice cream so he could age back up to himself. Or take care of a kid when he got a fever.  She literally even tells him that it is not safe for kids to walk alone at night?!!!! Like wtffff, and these are the people I am supposed to be rooting for to get together, also there is a moment where he falls on top of her in kid form and she blushes, shr fricken blushes and it's supposed to be this awkward cute moment, but he is a literally a kid??? So I am just like this is creepy and not romantic at all. nuh uh I am weirded out, this is not it, not even remotely it or cute. It felt like she was his mom or older sister caretaking in those moments and not in like a romantic way because he was in literal kid form, I am sorry I cannot get over this fact.Otherwise he is a good looking guy who gets very bashful and reacts to things depending on his emotions with varying types of snow, snowmen, blizzard, icicles, etc.I like Himuro and Fuyutsuki's dynamic besides the whole kid thing which honestly put me off and kind of ruined the anime the character rating would have been at least a 6 had there not been this whole weird kid dynamic.  It's otherwise cute and I was really looking forward to seeing their relationship progress, and we got little snippets of a budding relationship, but then by the end not even a single confession. It felt so dragged out with no payoff. It got slow and kinda old, I felt very strung along by the last episode.Other characters/coworkersHonestly everyone else fell kinda flat. There is the running joke about their chief being like Buddah and (I had to look up the other characters' names because they were kind of forgettable besides design). Saejima and Komori are another pairing that seem to be hinting at a potential romance but that also goes nowhere. Katori  is actually memorable as he is the descendant of a phoenix, so he is constantly bright and outputting fireworks, I enjoyed him as a character.a Him and Otonashi are a senpai and kouhai relationship and Katori is chasing after Otnoashi, but it seems Otonashi has no interest at all, and so if there is a budding relationship between the two at first glance it seems a little bit forced and like it isn't going to go anywhere. It feels more like she treats him like a baby bird she needs to look after.This anime really had the potential to be a cute romance story between coworkers, but it really went nowhere. So the story was meh.By the end I was like I really sat through this hoping for anything and got nothing, it wasn't even like I was left with a warm cozy feeling, just bruh type of feeling and like it felt pointless to sit through. Like slow burn romance can work, but some payoff needs to occur, like as the viewer there has to be more than just tiny morsels of romance, and as the story goes along substantial progression within the relationship. This show was literally barely breadcrumbs. It felt more just like hints, sprinkles of something that lead to nothing. I ended up bored at the end, questioning again why I sat through this anime. At the end they were like I am glad I met you and have grown because of you, which felt more like a friend confession then anything romanticConclusion 4Again I have mixed feelings about this anime. The characters are likeable enough and I was really rooting for the main two characters to get together, but at the end of the day the story went nowhere, their romance went nowhere, it leaves something left to be desired.  Also seriously that whole turn into a kid was absolutely unnecessary and just weird and creepy, so be warned. Like I said earlier had the whole weird kid thing not been introduced this anime would have been rated at least a 6, but I really couldn't get past it and it was so off putting that the rating went drastically down. But if you can get past that and also like slow burn romance then this is for you? Either way I definitely won't be watching this anime again .And I probably won't check it back out if there is a second season.

How did the writter managed that feat? Well first of all, like I said in the beginning, there is no character development.Second the romance\'s pace is slower than me on Sundays.Third it didn\'t really bring anything new to the table, there are a lot of other rom-coms that did what this anime tried to do, but way better.Fourth the last episode was...a real drag to watch, it felt right from the start that absolutely nothing would happen.Fifth if you take the very little, and I mean pea-sized, romance from this anime it absolutely dies out. It has nothing.

Ok let me explain what I mean by ‘dry romance’. It’s like the difference between dry humor and other kinds of humor. Kind of like deadpan comedy, it’s comedy delivered without gusto or any kind of inflection. These are just my personal definitions but what I consider the difference between deadpan and dry humor is this: deadpan humor focuses on juxtaposing absurdist comment/situations in a tone that makes them seem totally serious, while dry humor takes a more casual approach to the delivery (closer to sarcasm). The reason I’m bringing all of this...up is because while one of these characters does take the love very seriously and has all of the absurd anime reactions you’d expect from an anime, the show is very laid back, casual and cool with its delivery. I don’t know if this was intentional, because it could be seen as the creators just not giving a damn, but the way this fantastical world and the romance is shown so mundanely and casually actually works in the show's favor. It’s possible I was just tired out from all the overly energetic shit, but this rom com just felt so much more mature. I mean it’s not really, but Fuyutsuki in particular was just so refreshing with her laid back attitude that she made the atmosphere of the show just so easy to watch. The color palette was bland, the music was quiet, the line deliveries were calm and serene, even the mystical elements were just ordinary and the romance itself was just chill and casual. All of this created such a welcoming atmosphere. Like more just a cute day in life rather than a cringefest of crazy children. Himuro’s mystical powers aren’t this dazzling thing, but just a cute quirk. It’s dry and that’s just what I needed. Now some of the side characters are really annoying and almost break the casual vibe, and I won’t pretend like it’s super deep or anything, it’s just a show with a nice atmosphere. It’s still love, but not all love has to be super romantic.

Like a slice-of-life anime, it has a slow pace and there is not much romantic progress other than cute daily things. Most romance anime, especially the manga-originated ones are examples of this stability that it feels like it\'s a loop going nowhere. But in reality, life goes on and I mean, something significant needs to happen at some point. But in this kind of series all we have is fluff, both parties feel the growing love but they don\'t take charge but keep it the way it is. So will...there be confessions, I think the answer is obvious.

It's not encumbered by drama, it's not concerned about having a plot, its comedy is circumstantial and matter-of-fact. The soundtrack is downbeat and the characters are never on guard around each other to support the idea that you're supposed to be taking this show easy. It's about normal people hanging out and that's it. In all it's a pretty comfy package, if played a little too safe for its own good (maybe a lot too safe).As said, there is no plot to speak of...and things end just about where they started. What you get is a slow drip of insight into the characters and the setting, which can be interesting but doesn't materially affect much. You find out this is a soft fantasy setting where everyone in the office reports to Buddha, the MC is a snowman on his mom's side, and one co-worker has deployable fox ears. Otherwise this is contemporary Japan and most people are still pretty normal and have normal problems to solve. From there the romance begins with the cast neatly subdivided into 3 couples who all have their own things going on. And that's where it stays for the whole series. On one hand the low stakes do make it easier to watch casually and enjoy it as a wind-down show, but on the other hand you could probably watch in random order and not miss anything. This is fine from a SoL angle but this kind of non-commitment does hurt it as a romance because there's no point to any of this if they can't decide whether they're in a relationship. It has the ongoing romance manga problem where it's too scared to break the status quo and potentially end the story, so it strings things along forever. Not a show-stopper but when people dislike the show this is probably what they're talking about.Most of the show is dialog so there's not much to talk about technically. There's no feats of animation happening here, although some interesting compositing is used to make the eyes a little more lively. It's not bad looking but most of the characters have the same deadpan stare all the time just because that's their personality. Some shots are recycled to the point where you wonder if you've already watched this episode before because it's the same set of exterior shots again. No obvious defects or mistakes, though.On the whole: I watched it, I didn't mind it. It's not a must-see show but it occupies its micro-niche of easygoing office romance well enough.Also the fox girl is voiced by Rudeus from Mushoku Tensei and you will never be able to un-hear it.

It's also incredibly refreshing to have the big two main characters be actual adults, participating in a mature relationship that requires the balancing of work and personal lives.

Honestly I would be surprised if there was any character development at all. Watching the dynamic between Himuro and Fuyutsuki is super entertaining. Fuyutsuki, who doesn't realise she likes him, treats Himuro very kindly and every time this happens Himuro causes blizzards, snow, creates tiny snowmen etc. Whilst Himuro falls head over...heels for Fuyutsuki, the dense MC in him comes out but in this case it works very well, as Fuyutsuki is for the most part emotionless.Mixing an adult workplace scenario, with supernatural yokai people is a nice fresh thing to see.The show is just very comfortable and wholesome, with a good cast of characters. Fuyutsuki has quickly risen to be one of my favorite romcom leads. Himuro having a kansai accent was also surprising but worked very well for his character.The animation was good but nothing standout. It managed to capture the vibe of the show, elevating the source material.Speaking of which, the anime did not adapt everything one-to-one which I am fine with. There are some chapters skipped and rearraged but overall the story flowed well and it turned out nicely.Both the OP and ED are great, especially the art they used for the ED just captures my heart. The OST was also pretty good.The one thing I can condemn about this show is that the final episode was a bit of a letdown after what happened in episode 11.Aside from that its a very comfy, wholesome and super underrated show. heels for Fuyutsuki, the dense MC in him comes out but in this case it works very well, as Fuyutsuki is for the most part emotionless.Mixing an adult workplace scenario, with supernatural yokai people is a nice fresh thing to see.The show is just very comfortable and wholesome, with a good cast of characters. Fuyutsuki has quickly risen to be one of my favorite romcom leads. Himuro having a kansai accent was also surprising but worked very well for his character.The animation was good but nothing standout.

This is a office romantic anime. To be honest, I enjoyed it a lot. The slow, soft and comfy romance between Himuro and Fuyutsuki is very warm indeed. But I also enjoyed very simple, short bu hart-warming romance between Komori and Saejima also. It's very sweet to watch. One particular scene I always adimire and very sweet to me was when Himuro starts blizzarding with any reason Komori gives a funny laugh, it's really fun to watch that simple and short clip. Not to mention when Himuri melts and become like a kid, that part was nice too....Other two characters are Katori and Otonashi are not get much screen time, but it's sure that katori likes Otonashi but since he acts like a kid Otonashi just don't buy that. Other character are not that important but they made a good vibe inside and outside office. It's nice to see a fiction world in Japan where people can enjoy a peaceful time in office but in reality it's the opposite, becuase it's a office.It's a great anime and I am glad that I watced it, really admire the arts and dialouges. Story is fine, anime gave me a slow vibe by the way and its totally fine for me atleast. i don't know that they would make another season or not but i hope this anime gets a sequel. Peace!

I haven't felt like watching another episode for weeks now and it's already nearing its end, mostly because the story hasn't really given me anything to anticipate. I'm basically just watching two timid individuals struggling to express/confess the mutual feelings they have for each other in every episode with no obstacles whatsoever other than themselves. But to be fair, it's supposed to be like that since it's a romance Anime so, I totally get it. And those sweet, innocent, wholesome cheesy moments are actually this Anime's main point.I just wish they did...something more on the side seeing as they've had 2 side characters sitting on the backseat and barely been relevant since the beginning, just so the romantic moments of the 2 MCs didn't feel quite redundantly a drag. I think a new character debuted where I left off who I'd assume will be more involved with the MCs and shake things up a bit but, it's not enough to pique my curiosity at this point.With all that being said, I think romance fans would probably appreciate this. But rom-com fans in my opinion would do best to take a pass with this to avoid mistaken expectations of this Anime having some comical aspect to it.I'd probably try to complete this someday (my backlog enters the chat :P). But for now, I'll just wish everyone who follows/followed this series a lovely time with it.

Why does it have such a high rating anyways, the main characters pretty much have the same boring personalities. To be honest I think the fox girl would have made the better mc and had a better story than 2 mc. The story made no progress at all, no confession, no kiss, just holding hands. I hoped the last episode would be a little interesting,...but nope, the guy gets sick and the girl doesn't even need to take care of him, he takes a nap and heals in 1 second, THE END! but nope, the guy gets sick and the girl doesn't even need to take care of him, he takes a nap and heals in 1 second, THE END!"", 'I walked into watching this anime expecting something like Wotakoi, and was sadly mistaken. now I know it’s common for the main couple in a series to not get together in the end (which can be very disappointing), but when our characters are actually fully grown (not in high school) and very clearly into each other, it’s just annoying not seeing any progression in the relationship. at least that’s how I felt about this series. I would have been happy with some kind of advancement in the relationship but that would probably take another full season. one of the things I really enjoyed about Wotakoi...was that the secondary couple/characters were very well written and were interesting to say the least. don’t expect that from this series. the kitsune girl is just plain annoying, her love interest has no redeeming qualities, the phoenix was just such an unnecessary character in general. he literally brought nothing interesting to the table and was just so unfunny. the animation was okay and the character designs were mid at most. I pushed through til the end with just a little bit of hope and it just fell flat for me. the one good thing I will say about this series is that I did really enjoy the chemistry between our main characters.

The two main characters were really cute and had a fun dynamic. It’s not often you get a series where the male lead is a soft blushing fellow always getting embarrassed and freaking out over his love interest. And the way it’s expressed using his “Yuki-onna” heritage was super fun (especially the snowmen). In fact, the whole ‘fantastical creatures’ aspect of the series, with many of the characters being descendants of famous Japanese mythical monsters (?) was a cool premise. The only problem I really had with this series is focus; I would have loved it if...we could have seen much, much more of the main pair, and less of the side characters. The side characters had their own charm, but they weren’t nearly as interesting to me as the main guy and gal. Adult, office romances, are few and far between, and having screen time divided up among all the various office-people caused me to kind of lose interest. Needed them to spend more time on the title folks. All in all, a fun read. I believe the manga for this has recently been licensed; I may check it out, but not sure yet.

First of all,  I’m so glad it aired in winter 2023 season because considering the season and the anime name, it really imparted warmth instead.As for the show, if you’re into shoujosei then you’re going to love it a lot but if you aren’t into those demographics then it’s probably going to bore you due to the pacing etc. So do take a note of that.Anyways I loved it and if I were to say then it has the vibe of wotakoi (kind of). Just the vibe, nothing...else tbh as wotakoi had better animation, budget and pacing etc. So if you watch it with expectations of it being similar to wotakoi then you’ll be disappointed. The best thing about this show is there is literally no drama no love triangles, just wholesomeness. This surprisingly had a supernatural element wherein certain characters are descendants of mythical beings and channel their emotions based on their ancestors powers. For example, the ml, himuro is a descendent of Yuki-onna (snow women) so depending on his state of emotions etc he’d end up causing a blizzard etc. So these elements made it very intriguing. The fl fuyutsuki is a normal person (tsundere probably) and she accepts himuro for who he is so their chemistry sets off and the anime is just them chilling out. Himuro’s kansai-ben was such a treat especially whenever he went “mecchaaa-kawaiiiiii” along with a blizzard and a shamisen (I guess) bgm. I adored those parts so much! There isn’t even a process of them falling in love or confessions and stuff because they already are or rather they don’t care labelling their emotions. You won’t see them mulling over stuff like oh does he//she like me or how do I confess etc. They just seem married to everyone including the viewers…it is great in that sense.The animation was great but I think around the middle I felt as if they weren’t showing much expressions at all, at first it definitely seemed cool but later it did feel stagnant. This series is not something you’d want to binge watch as you might get bored at times since they’re just chilling, watching movies, hanging out with colleagues so nothing unique there….but if you watch it like any slice of life anime then you’ll enjoy it!

A descendant of a snow woman - Himuro, who isn’t good at controlling his powers and often creates snow and ice related phenomena when he’s overwhelmed with emotions, and a human woman - Fuyutsuki, who works with him. For 12 episodes we watch them work, interact with their coworkers, getting close to each other, witnessing the tension between them rise only to… get absolutely nothing...out of it. The show even gives You a pretty big F-U by mocking the monomyth - ending the show in the exact same place it started.Let’s look at our main duo:Himuro - basically the viewer's avatar. We experience the world and plot mainly from his perspective. He is a descendant of Yuki-onna - a yokai from japanese folklore who is known for a beautiful visage and wandering during a snowstorm to drain weary travellers of their life force, breaking into people's homes to freeze the inhabitants and sometimes (depending on the region) she also has some motherly virtues. Most of her traits depend on the region the story is told. So yeah… pretty awesome lineage if You ask me. As for Himuro, he is calm and mostly collected on the outside, but inside he's like a pubescent teenager, often screaming with joy in his inner voice. As most anime protagonists he also lacks anything that could be considered a personality. He’s just nice and kind. That’s it. Despite having a childish and almost exalted inner life he doesn’t let it show. The only “hint”, and I use this term loosely, is the fact that when emotions get the better of him, he unwillingly creates a variety of snow or ice related phenomena. Those vary from having literally frozen feet, to whole body freezing, a localised snow storm and even creating diamond dust. There is something alluring with the contrast between his inner and outer self. The problem is his childish persona becomes annoying pretty fast, like by episode 2 I had just enough of it. As a character he’s an awesome idea with a very mediocre execution.Fuyutsuki - the human girl who befriends (and a bit more) Himuro. She’s the second protagonist of the show and there are moments when we witness the plot from her perspective. Unlike Himuro she doesn’t have a contrasting inner life. She’s basically what You see is what You get. She’s calm and collected on the outside and on the inside. That said, she's not heartless. She’s a very compassionate person who cares about people around her and often goes out of her way to help Himuro. She does have an obvious soft spot for him but is so inexperienced with close relations that she’s unable to name her own feelings. That’s her annoying part. Despite obvious actions and even the ability to verbalise her feelings (granted her understanding of them is a bit lacking so she doesn’t interpret them as romantic) she acts like a complete moron aka the way to artificially prolong the moment our dynamic duo will finally confess their romantic feelings for eachother.The show serves 4 supporting characters (yes, 2 more pseudo romantic pairs) who are boring af. They are flat cliches that You find in any romcom. I can stomach Komori and Saejima but Katori and Otonashi are totally pointless. Good thing that the latter two aren’t seen all that often. But when they are… god… I just wanted to fast forward to not have to suffer their existence. They are by far the worst written pair of the show and if someone were to erase them the show would be better for it. That said, Komor and Saejima aren’t all that great by any means. One has a crush on the other but the show won’t let them do anything about it because.. Reasons? That said, they annoy me a little less than our main cast's interactions. Just a little.When it comes to the writing the show blows his load in the first episode. The most original part is the coexistence of humans and descendants of yokai. The problem is that apart from Himuro’s blizzards, the show doesn’t really do anything with that setting. There isn’t any drama about it, no conflict, nothing. You work with an angsty Sub-zero wannabe and that’s just another day at the office. I’m not saying there is something inherently wrong with it, but why create such an awesome universe if You’re not going to utilise it? As it stands the show would probably work equally well if You’d change Himuro’s yokai powers with some kind of psychological issue. Maybe a gynophobia like it was in “Mayo Chiki” or if You want something less cliche use asperger syndrome or BPD. The show would lose absolutely nothing if You did. Actually, now that I think about it a BPD character could work even better.Another thing is that despite having an adult cast they still have pretty childish interactions. The will-they-won’t-they dynamic is basically the same as in any teen romcom. Yes, they are pretty open with how they feel (apart the romantic part) about each other and have no problem in telling how much they cherish each other but that’s about it. They do nothing with it. Even someone as dense as I am, when it comes to real life romance, would get the point. Especially after what happens in the last two episodes. Thanks to that the show overstays it’s welcome. At some point (for me it was episode 5 or 6) the show stops being interesting because You know it will go nowhere. You already know who has a crush on who and You know that it will just revel in its own romcom status quo bullshit. In a show with competent writing we would have at least 2 dating couples by episode 9. In this show we have… people who despite having desires do nothing about it. The most painful part is that they have zero excuses about why they do what they do. Unless all of them are psychopaths who think “Love is War” is a manual and not a comedy the writer is just incompetent.That said… I did get some enjoyment from the show. Yes… it overstays its welcome… a lot. Probably more than even “The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten”, it is entertaining for the first few episodes. If You can forgive and forget the blue balls ending it serves and You don’t give much importance to writing I think You can find this show worthwhile.It's just that I can't really recommend it with a clear conscience out of it. The show even gives You a pretty big F-U by mocking the monomyth - ending the show in the exact same place it started.Let’s look at our main duo:Himuro - basically the viewer's avatar.

There is something alluring with the contrast between his inner and outer self. The problem is his childish persona becomes annoying pretty fast, like by episode 2 I had just enough of it. As a character he’s an awesome idea with a very mediocre execution.Fuyutsuki - the human girl who befriends (and a bit more) Himuro. She’s the second protagonist of the show and there are moments when we witness the plot from her perspective. Unlike Himuro she doesn’t have a contrasting inner life. She’s basically what You see is what You get. She’s calm and collected on the outside and on the inside. That said, she's not heartless. She’s a very compassionate person who cares about people around her and often goes out of her way to help Himuro. She does have an obvious soft spot for him but is so inexperienced with close relations that she’s unable to name her own feelings. That’s her annoying part. Despite obvious actions and even the ability to verbalise her feelings (granted her understanding of them is a bit lacking so she doesn’t interpret them as romantic) she acts like a complete moron aka the way to artificially prolong the moment our dynamic duo will finally confess their romantic feelings for eachother.The show serves 4 supporting characters (yes, 2 more pseudo romantic pairs) who are boring af. They are flat cliches that You find in any romcom. I can stomach Komori and Saejima but Katori and Otonashi are totally pointless. Good thing that the latter two aren’t seen all that often. But when they are… god… I just wanted to fast forward to not have to suffer their existence. They are by far the worst written pair of the show and if someone were to erase them the show would be better for it. That said, Komor and Saejima aren’t all that great by any means. One has a crush on the other but the show won’t let them do anything about it because.. Reasons? That said, they annoy me a little less than our main cast's interactions. Just a little.When it comes to the writing the show blows his load in the first episode. The most original part is the coexistence of humans and descendants of yokai. The problem is that apart from Himuro’s blizzards, the show doesn’t really do anything with that setting. There isn’t any drama about it, no conflict, nothing. You work with an angsty Sub-zero wannabe and that’s just another day at the office. I’m not saying there is something inherently wrong with it, but why create such an awesome universe if You’re not going to utilise it? As it stands the show would probably work equally well if You’d change Himuro’s yokai powers with some kind of psychological issue. Maybe a gynophobia like it was in “Mayo Chiki” or if You want something less cliche use asperger syndrome or BPD. The show would lose absolutely nothing if You did. Actually, now that I think about it a BPD character could work even better.Another thing is that despite having an adult cast they still have pretty childish interactions. The will-they-won’t-they dynamic is basically the same as in any teen romcom. Yes, they are pretty open with how they feel (apart the romantic part) about each other and have no problem in telling how much they cherish each other but that’s about it. They do nothing with it. Even someone as dense as I am, when it comes to real life romance, would get the point. Especially after what happens in the last two episodes. Thanks to that the show overstays it’s welcome. At some point (for me it was episode 5 or 6) the show stops being interesting because You know it will go nowhere. You already know who has a crush on who and You know that it will just revel in its own romcom status quo bullshit. In a show with competent writing we would have at least 2 dating couples by episode 9. In this show we have… people who despite having desires do nothing about it. The most painful part is that they have zero excuses about why they do what they do. Unless all of them are psychopaths who think “Love is War” is a manual and not a comedy the writer is just incompetent.That said… I did get some enjoyment from the show. Yes… it overstays its welcome… a lot. Probably more than even “The Angel Next Door Spoils Me Rotten”, it is entertaining for the first few episodes. If You can forgive and forget the blue balls ending it serves and You don’t give much importance to writing I think You can find this show worthwhile.It's just that I can't really recommend it with a clear conscience"", 'Can a Yuki Onna descendant get a cold? Of course not. The thought alone is ridiculous! - Almost as ridiculous as the whole show.It started out interesting with our maincast being a group of human office workers mixed in with supernatural beings. And this is were it stopped being interesting. They did next to nothing with the supernatural element of the show. This could have potentially been very interesting to learn about the quirks of those supernatural descendants, but it was mostly used as a background animation, nothing more. There was no attempt to create some kind of conflict between the normal humans and the...supernatural ones. This could have been a fun show about a romance that conquers the differences between the two races and maybe misconceptions about each other, but it just went nowhere. The main character calls forth a minor snow storm about three times an episode but nothing is done with it. Not some malfunction of the equipment, not a cleaning lady that is fed up with him or something besides the ""hey, you\'re snowing again"". After a few episodes I was as bored of it as the main girl seemed to be for 90% of the show.Also the romance went absolutely nowhere. As innocent as both characters were it felt like watching a romance about grade schoolers, not young adults that joined the work force and go to a drinking party. The main character has been in love for a year by the end of the season and he is as close to a relationship with the girl as Myanmar is to a healthy economy. It will probably take another 5 seasons for any of the two to confess their feelings and another 3 for their first kiss. To me it was pretty much a waste of time and I\'m still struggling between a 3 or 4/10. supernatural ones.

The main couple can’t get together too soon, because that would turn away viewers who exclusively watch for the romance, but it fails to offer the viewer anything else to distract them from the lack of romantic progression. This mainly happens because Japanese romantic “comedies” tend to disregard the “comedy” part entirely, or at least so it appears to the average western viewer.Consider shows like How I Met Your Mother and Friends. Regardless of how you feel about these shows, it’s hard to deny that a lot of their viewership sticks around...for more than just seeing couples get together. The fact that the entire show isn’t centered around a romance, but instead seeing the cast interact makes the actual moments of plot significance far more engaging. You see, Koori Zouksei Danshi to Cool na Douryou Joshi also makes it cast interact, but fails to not make every interaction a drag. There’s no life in these characters. The “funny moments” are typical anime gags that don’t land on any of their western audience and as a result the romance itself becomes less interesting. When the dialogue is something the viewers just have to “sit through” to get to the “good bits” you have failed as a writer in my opinion and this show is a perfect example of that. I have a soft spot for the romance genre as a whole, so I sat through the first 4 episodes. However, eventually they started taking screentime away from the main cast and instead giving it to an equally boring set of side characters. This made me drop the show. for more than just seeing couples get together.

Legendz: Yomigaeru Ryuuou Densetsu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1590/Legendz__Yomigaeru_Ryuuou_Densetsu,"['When I first heard about Legendz from a random forum I thought to myself ""This show looks to kiddy, it can\'t be that good for 50 episodes"". Boy was I wrong!I\'ve heard others put this show down for that same reason, but trust me. The childish look of the box art and some of the art is misleading, though the artstyle is a little weird at first glance, after watching and completing this anime there were many beautiful scenes and characters. An incredibly wonderful story starts to take place as you watch and get further into the show.One would first suspect this is just a...silly show about kids and their dragons born from toys, but after watching more and more you begin to realize the in-depth serious and dark story that is foretold as episodes go on. Once you think the show starts getting to silly, next thing ya know something big happens and more of the mystery\'s are revealed. Or maybe you think its getting to serious at one point? Well just around the corner they\'ll let some fun comedy loose or back-story about your favorite character.Even characters that seem meager and unimportant have a role to play in this pleasant anime. Maybe you even think, ""boy that persons cruel"", and then before you know it you begin adoring that character more and more as things are revealed throughout the story. I can assure you everything has a place in this anime, from the silly comedy, wonderful story, the fun characters and all of the different kinds of Legendz you get to know through Legendz: Tale of the Dragon Kings.All \'n all I hope more people can give this anime a chance as it is quite underrated.Its got everything one could enjoy for a show about 4 close friends and their adventures with their Legendz. silly show about kids and their dragons born from toys, but after watching more and more you begin to realize the in-depth serious and dark story that is foretold as episodes go on.

After finish watching it (including CD drama), I found that, the cover of anime is COMPLETELY MISLEADING, with its awkward character design, I thought that it was only focus on its hilarious...comedy, boy I WAS wrong. I had never expected it would be deconstructed like this. It\'s not a general kids show, no, it\'s not even appropriate enough for kids. Maybe kids\' standards in Japan were different, thoughStory: 9/10I found the first half series being lighthearted with its hilarious gags also a lot of character moments in it. Let\'s see, the story is about Legendz, mythical creatures that people believe that they were real and really existed long time ago. Just like in real life, the legendz are mythologies. Only, in this, on the setting of time, the legendz are being reborn for some reason. The reborn of these legendz were first represented with the creation of Talispod, one of kids\' toy developed by dark WiZ company in order to make children happy. It was later called Legendz battle by the kids, showing virtual legendz appearing from talispod and you began to do like sword fight with your friend. The problem was shown later that some of legendz appeared in human world for REAL. Here comes some of questions like: ""Why legendz appeared for real? What\'s the reason of it? What\'s Legendz War and how come it happened?""Yeah, the first half of the series didn\'t explain too much about the problem, but there\'re indeed some clue where it\'s going to be very serious some time later. We got a team rocket-wannabe who were commanded to steal Shu\'s talispod, because he had a real and special legendz with him, Shiron the Windragon, and maybe have a connection with the later story, yeah he did indeed. They are doing quite similarly like what pokemon\'s team rocket do every episode, only in this, they\'re not too annoying. Things became more complicated when there\'s something revealed about the existence about 2nd Windragon, which was clearly awkward. Also following the reborn of legendary earth, water, and fire elemental legendz.Things got more complicated when there\'s explained about legendz war, where it happened when the nature of the earth has been diminished, being desolate because humans\' doing against the nature of earth, their darkness in their heart and their negative emotions and legendz began to fight the personification of the aforementioned darkness, resulting destruction to human world and being reset. Now that\'s going to be happened again on Shu\'s era where humanity have been grown more complex with technologies and so on, also it\'s told that the technologies that human created had harmed the nature of earth badly. Later it was told why Shu and his friend were chosen to be saga and why they must face these things completely. Humans later have expected legendz to be dangerous creatures, threatening, resulting them expressed negative emotions that has brought back the deep darkness of the world and being reborn to destroy the existence of life on earth. How they will stop the disaster and how they can overcome the real darkness of the world, it depends on what they do in order to survive.The stories were thought provoking enough for kids show, showing how deconstructed they are, also darker and edgier than most of kids show. From the existence of human being with its technologies that apparently bring destruction to the mother earth to the negative emotions of human that had brought back the true darkness of the world. It\'s simply intriguing and you need to think a bit to make it reasonable.Characters: 9/10The main character here, Shuzo Matsutani is kind of typical shounen who is silly, and kind of annoying but hilarious. But, well, it was a bit different of our typical shounen characterization, after all. Even though so, he had a lot of awesome and sad moments too, and interestingly he saved everyone from the worst situation with his silliness, that\'s just an unusual moment seriously.His family problem wasn\'t that serious, his father and mother are simply just wanting their children happy at all cost, none that all. After the first half episode, there\'s an episode when Shu for the first time really felt despair. He didn\'t want to make his parents worry about him and he didn\'t want his parents especially his mother to be involved with legendz war. He got quite serious development in these moments.Second main character is Dino Sparks, who is introduced on around first 5 episodes. I found his character being special, what I mean is he\'s a rich person but he isn\'t happy at all because his activities had to be scheduled so even he can\'t play outside like what most kids do on their age, also he had serious family problem, where his mother left home because of his dad\'s doing and mistakes. It simply made Dino hates his father because of that. Later it was shown on 1 full episode about Dino\'s father, Bruno Sparks character moments and his past. When he remembered the fondest moment with his wife, and his dream to make toys to make kids happy. We really get his character development after it, made him brave to talk to Dino and said ""I\'m sorry, Dino. I wasn\'t a good father for you. I realized that I\'ve made mistakes that have made you sad all this time. I won\'t ever let it again to you my beloved child."" Damn, that\'s really touching seriously. Also eventually in the second half episode, Dino\'s mom had back for long time but had her appearance changed from slim to big fat. Even though so, Dino didn\'t lose his love to his mother, also Bruno, her husband until last episodes. ""Despite what you look like, you\'re my wife and I will always love you."" That\'s what I got from Bruno Sparks, what a beautiful and touching moment.Next is Mike McField. I really like the characterization of him. He\'s a nice guy who want to be nice to everyone, evoking them when they\'re in problem, and he love natures very much also he\'s addicted to hamburger. He\'s the first person that able to talk to Dino, the lonely rich guy and even can become friend with also sharing his favorite hamburger with him. He\'s the type of sympathetic person who can understand someone\'s feeling and also nature\'s feeling. That\'s why he\'s being chosen as Tsuchi no Saga (Earth Saga) because his deep love with nature. He got some serious problem with his feeling when he\'s transformed into a griffin and going berserk hurting each other. He felt despair after it happened, thinking that his friend would never forgive him of what he had do with them. He got quite good development after episodes, though, only not as strong as Dino. Also he had less moments with his family.Next is Meg Sprinkle. She looked like an annoying girl at first, yeah. She made some of funny gags with her Meg Chop for many times, I really enjoy it. She seemed to be the least focused character, but not until her changed mind about her impression to legendz, especially when she finally met her partner legendz, Zuou. She didn\'t accept him at first, because she thought legendz were cruel, and had made her sad. But it went through time and eventually she can overcome those feelings. Still, she didn\'t have much time about her moments with her family.Next is Halca Hepburn. She\'s the one that I can said, got the most character development than all and having deep characterization out of the other characters. She\'s the one who loves legendz very much, hoping legendz becoming real and apparently her dreams come true. At first she was so crazy about legendz, like a nerd. But thing got changed in her mind, her impression of legendz after seeing them becoming threatening to humanity especially for the kids, though she was misunderstood. We got to see her change from crazy to legendz, joining Ranshiin to destroy the existence of legendz in the world. Things got changed again when she finally met her dad, who was also loving legendz when he\'s still younger. There\'s also thing that explaining their past about reading books about legendz, explaining it like a dad telling a fairy tale. What become worse after that is her dad was the one behind these problems. From a legendz lover become the one that willing to destroy the existence of legendz forever. He has a reasonable motives, though, only it\'s kind of silly. This made Halca feel in despair anymore, thinking what she must do to save her beloved ppl. But after that, she became developed and she was the one that had stopped the disaster, along with Shiron and Ranshiin.Last but not least, for the minor characters. This is where I found that Legendz CARE SO MUCH of its minor characters, even there\'s an exclusive episode which told us about the story of some of minor characters after it disappeared from the episodes. Even the team rocket-wannabee, they got so much development and the thought of ""they\'re cruel people just like team rocket in pokemon"" in our minds doesn\'t prevail anymore. They also had understandable motives why they did those mission to steal Shu\'s talispod, and eventually resigned from dark WiZ company and began to help Bruno Sparks to make children happy with their toys. I can conclude that they just want ""kids to be happy."" Even the parents here had their role of how they rescue their children, what they\'ll do to protect their beloved children. All people cooperate with each other to stop the disaster, even the main human villain himself. This was really intriguing in character section.Sound: 8/10I liked the song Kaze no Legendz, it\'s just wonderful. Also Mou Donimo Tomaranai was also unique ending. Most of their soundtrack were classic jazz, which really give us the american things in it. The last ending song was very sad, and it really match with the moment on last episode..Art: 7/10Despite being a 2004 anime, the art was reasonable, though. But the problem is, the design of characters were MISLEADING. People will seem it more likely a family comedy with many gags on it. I knew they\'re trying to make people surprised, I really appreciate their motives of making this anime.Overall: 9/10There\'s simply no one like Legendz out there, although I found the overall of the series being similar to Digimon Tamers, especially its plot, both are REALLY awesome. What I really enjoy especially in this series is that, even though on a very serious situation, they can make you laugh. What a mixed feelings, from the silly-but-fun comedy to breaking the 4th wall. Everytime when something\'s getting serious, they did put the gag on the right time, so while you\'re enjoying the gags, you didn\'t lose the feeling of enjoying its seriousness. I remember in some dialogue ""We have to blahblahblah..."" ""Huh?? but it wasn\'t written in the script.."" It made me really LOL, seriously, without losing the seriousness.Despite its seriousness and hilarious things, this series actually had given me some life morals. We, human often don\'t know about what we did to the earth of our creation of many stuffs, even we often don\'t care about nature. This series actually want to tell us that ""Things that destroy the humanity are the human itself."" It was true after all, seeing what we had done to the mother earth in real life and how sad the earth was feeling when it\'s being hurt.I was very sad that this kind of wonderful anime is quite underrated and even on quite low score, 7.4. People should give it a try for sure, don\'t just judge the cover from the art style and also its earlier episodes. You\'ll find it wonderful if you understand more of this series, seriously.I hope this review helps, thanks.. comedy, boy I WAS wrong. I had never expected it would be deconstructed like this.

I remember in some dialogue ""We have to blahblahblah..."" ""Huh?? but it wasn\'t written in the script.."" It made me really LOL, seriously, without losing the seriousness.Despite its seriousness and hilarious things, this series actually had given me some life morals. We, human often don\'t know about what we did to the earth of our creation of many stuffs, even we often don\'t care about nature. This series actually want to tell us that ""Things that destroy the humanity are the human itself."" It was true after all, seeing what we had done to the mother earth in real life and how sad the earth was feeling when it\'s being hurt.I was very sad that this kind of wonderful anime is quite underrated and even on quite low score, 7.4. People should give it a try for sure, don\'t just judge the cover from the art style and also its earlier episodes. You\'ll find it wonderful if you understand more of this series, seriously.I hope this review helps, thanks..', 'If you want a meaningful, sensible, non-childish upgrade and update to the ""pokemon/digimon"" franchise, without the ridicilousness of the ""mons"" being human entertainment property, this is for you - the Legendz, along with humans, drive the plot, but at the same time, the human characters as well become more and more lovable as the series goes on.If you want to laugh, cry and be surprised over and over again, and if you like anime where every character has character, becomes an important part of the plot, and develops throughout the series, this is for you. Here is a great series that has a serious message,...but doesn\'t take itself too seriously either: the humour is Always there, but (most of the time) it doesn\'t ruin the immersion, fortunately.The plot and ""scheme"" is deceiving and surprising, and it actually makes sense unlike with Digimon. Everything that happens fits in. That\'s all I can say without major spoilers. Compared to all Digimon seasons, which I have regrettably watched, this series has far, far superior plot and characters, and the Legendz are the main characters (more and more throughout the series) and make the majority of the meaningful decisions in the anime. I cannot explain all the differences without spoiling the plot but let\'s just say, the series is NOT what it first seems. As far as I understand, the manga pretty much does not have anything to do with this anime, on many levels - fortunately, as the manga isn\'t very good as far as I can tell.That being said, you might (probably) not like all the characters in the beginning, and the art style probably seems childish at first when it comes to the human protagonists. The very beginning of the series (especially the first half of episode 1, and the first two episodes) will probably make you question how special or good this anime is going to be - but after that, the humour (ep.3) and plot really starts to kick in. Plot-wise, in the episode 13 your jaw may drop. Whatever you do, don\'t drop Legendz because of the first two episodes - practically zero plot background is given in those two episodes, but everything that happens makes sense in the end.And that\'s the thing with this anime; half the time you\'re expecting something completely different, and then something absurd or serious happens. And even still, some things you would expect and hope to see, and they will happen eventually. The beginning episodes of this anime probably seems shallow, but like I said, this series is surprising over and over again.The music is.... pretty damn good. There\'s only one opening, and at times, it feels too cheerful for the series, especially after main plot turning points - but the ending (Dounimo Tomaranai) kicks major ass. The in-series soundtrack is swing and jazz/jazzy, at times smooth, at times lively, and groovy cheerfully upbeat in the action sequences (also with epic synth sections that you cannot find in the OST, that play in key battles/turnpoints) - overall, I would say ""atmospheric"", as the plot happens in Brooklyn, NY.Despite having actual plot, there is no excessive, out-of the place drama - which makes the series more realistic and approachable. When the drama happens, oh boy, is it dramatic - and then again, unexpected humour kicks in. I adore this series both in its golden character interaction and surprise factor, and lack of meaningless drama.Overall, this series is very heartfelt, interesting (throughout the series, amazing achievement) and enjoyable, without going overboard on any aspect (except for silly humour with Shuu in the beginning episodes). Whatever you do, don\'t skip this one because of the first two episodes - this anime unfolds itself in very surprising ways, and the character interaction (including all the voice acting) is superb.

But also starting from first episode the comedy showed off its fast pace, from the character interactions you could tell the main cast genuinely cared for each other, and the attention to detail with the plot was great, so the fact this was made for promotion you just forget.It especially hurts because the anime showed it *could* deal with character emotions in a believable way. The times it did...so were touching.And yet the moment they tried to do large-scale serious drama everything started to fall apart. Despite how careful they were being with character actions, the main cast started acting very out of character when it most mattered (serious moments). This also goes for side characters, every single one acted in ways a person would never act during the serious arcs.So while the anime does keep up this façade of good comedy and character interactions for a long while, it decides to head into a more war/fighting related plot, which would be fine if it wasn't for the dubious writing. Or maybe it's dubious in my eyes, but it was written like this because Legendz is ultimately a kids' show. But that's also an excuse, in the beginning they could keep up the quality while at the same time remaining as serious as a kids' show can be. It really feels like halfway they gave up on good writing and just added whatever a kid would find cool.My point is: don't be deceived by thinking it will deal with things in a believable way. As long as you expect kids' show developments and actions from both characters and the plot, you may avoid the bad impression this ended up leaving on me. so were touching.And yet the moment they tried to do large-scale serious drama everything started to fall apart.

Sadly there isn't any English subs :(I think there is in Spanish, Arabic and a bunch of others.

The anime of today are drastically different than the past and that's true, especially the slice of life genre since MWS4N is exactly that.MINOR SPOILERS AHEADThe anime stars the duo Natsumi and Izumi: Natsumi is the 4th grader mother of the baby Mirai, and Izumi is Natsumi's young adult aunt who aspires to become a famous Shounen mangaka. These two are forced to raise baby Mirai after a time slip that caused Mirai's teleportation to their time. Izumi and Natsumi are then forced to raise Mirai until they...can find a way to bring Mirai back to her time. Natsumi throughout the course of the anime learns to mature more rapidly than children her age, since she has to raise her own child, keep that a secret, AND attend school full time. Izumi as well finally learns to confront her responsibility as an adult, and look after both Natsumi and Mirai as a guest in her own sister's house. This anime's beauty comes from its art style that perfectly represents the 90s, and from its colorful characters who make the episodes enjoyable. At the end of each episode, the characters develop tremendously as they learn from their mistakes, with Mirai playing the greatest role in all of this, being the trouble maker that she is. Mirai has a great resemblance to her grand aunt Izumi as well as taking her love for mischief from her (SPOILER) father Daisuke.Daisuke is revealed around episode 13-14 to be Natsumi's father(although none of the characters actually realize that), he as well starts to show his fatherly instincts and learns to love and care for Mirai and her mother.

Kure-nai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3358/Kure-nai,"[""Kurenai is the 08 spring anime I had the highest hopes for, and I surely wasn't let down by it.The artwork in the series is amazing. The main reason for this is the coloring - it's so vivid! It's sharp and varied colors, something which - as of what I've experienced - is unprecedented. The detail may skimp a bit now and then - which drags it down to a 9 (yes, I wanted to give it a 10). Oh, and the OP theme animations is pretty whacky - which is both good and bad.The characters are as colorful as the animation is, even the...minor characters. I really liked that, because it makes it oh so more realistic. And it's not only the characters as individuals, but also their relationships which I really loved. That does cover well up for the lack of character development that a 12-episode series is pretty much doomed to have.The story in itself is very good too. It starts out very slice of life-ish, going with an episode-by-episode format, where Murasaki learns how the real world looks - after all, she's just escaped from being locked into a house with the most woman-discriminating family I've ever heard about, both in fiction and real life. But that being said, the episodes were great, because so much seemed to happen - often they featured parallel stories with Murasaki and someone else (often Shinkurou's two female neighbors) in one, and Shinkurou in another one. Halfway into the series, and a few episodes more, the series takes a drastic turn, and the more dramatic sides of the show starts to unfold, in contrast to the often light and comedic moments of the earlier episodes. It all culminates into two-three episodes with much action and drama, and an end which you're either gonna love or hate - I can't say more without spoiling anything.The soundtrack is jazzy, and fits right into the scenes and the mood. Personally, I liked it, but it wasn't anything spectacular, and if you don't like the jazzy type of soundtrack, you can find comfort in the fact that you often don't notice it at all.I really enjoyed this series, both because of its mix of many genres, special animation and wonderful characters, but also because of the calmness this anime presented. Even during the most intense scenes - either emotional or action-packed - I found it to be very calm. Personally, I think that gave the series that little extra which made me love it so much.To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =) minor characters.

I found Kure-nai, and decided to give it a try. The OP scared me, and I almost turned this into an instant &quot;drop.&quot; Really glad I didn't, because this show was a rare find.StoryWith only 12 episodes, it can be difficult to turn out that perfect storyline. Even so, they did a good job. The show is focused around the inner struggles and relationships of and between a seven-year-old aristocrat girl and her bodyguard, a poor, sixteen-year-old high school student. Nothing mind-blowing, but a sufficient premise...all the same. However, it's paced very well, fast when it needs to be and slow when it's appropriate. I never felt the series get dull.Realize that this is a both a comedy and a drama, and in my opinion, it does an effective job at being both. However, there is some action mixed in. It's enough to give the series an interesting push, but it seldom drives the story. Adrenaline seekers, you will be disappointed. That said, I thought the action was handled quite well, and the fighting that does occur are some of the most intensely emotional scenes within.Art/SoundWhile the media of the show was pretty high-quality, it has a tendency to go into estrogen overload mode, and that proved a bit trying for me. Pastel colors, curvy lines, and high heels galore. I got more used to it as I went along, but I still skipped the OP and ED most of the time. But that's an issue of taste, and in all honesty, it really wasn't all that bad. It was actually pretty well-animated, too.I didn't care for OP/ED songs themselves, and I felt that most of the background music was pretty unmemorable. I say that because I really can't remember much of it at all. I know the music effectively aided the visuals, but it's probably not what I'd listen to standalone. However, there is one song that struck me, one usually played during the most intense moments of the anime, and it has stayed with me the way few can: a lonely, haunting piano playing a melody as beautiful and sad as the tune of an old music box. This alone may be enough for me to get the OST.CharacterThe characters were strong. Certainly Shinkurou and Murasaki were done well, but the support cast was also impressive. In only 12 episodes, there wasn't quite enough time to really delve into most of them, and it could be argued that only a handful of the characters actually play any sort of vital role to the story. But even without seeming &quot;significance,&quot; they take the story and make it alive. Shinkurou and Murasaki have friends and neighbors, personal lives, and human bonds with the people around them, and it is those they interact with that gives the series its feel of realism. I found myself interested in the side characters, and I think I could watch Kure-nai again even just to see more of them. I was also impressed with how they took such an overbearingly female cast and a story with romantic undertones and prevented it from taking on &quot;harem&quot; clich&eacute;s. The support characters all seem to represent different aspects of and attitudes toward life, and each gives the series a unique insight into the story.Shinkurou and Murasaki were even stronger characters, though. They, too, were very human, and at times painfully so. Murasaki, the lovable, huggable bundle she is, has led a life that has left her bizarrely mature in some areas and frustratingly impossible in others. Shinkurou, for all the good in his heart, has his own set of shortcomings, and sometimes you find that he's not the fearless hero you want him to be. The relationship between them, however, is the best part of the show, and before you scream pedophilia, know that the relationship does not, at least in my opinion, carry sexual undertones. It's really quite a clean and healthy situation between them. Creepy people, you too will be disappointed.As far as my personal opinion on the series as a whole, I'd love to give it a 10/10, but I do feel it wasn't really masterpiece-level as far as sound and story go. Didn't keep me from enjoying it like one, though. Definitely one I'll be buying if/when it ships overseas.This isn't a series that I would recommend to everyone, but it is a series that I consider amazing. If you're not sure, pick up the first episode, stay with it until the end, and see if you'd like to watch more. Maybe you'll love it, maybe you'll never touch it again. At any rate, it's definitely one that's worth trying. all the same. However, it's paced very well, fast when it needs to be and slow when it's appropriate.

Murasaki, the lovable, huggable bundle she is, has led a life that has left her bizarrely mature in some areas and frustratingly impossible in others. Shinkurou, for all the good in his heart, has his own set of shortcomings, and sometimes you find that he's not the fearless hero you want him to be. The relationship between them, however, is the best part of the show, and before you scream pedophilia, know that the relationship does not, at least in my opinion, carry sexual undertones. It's really quite a clean and healthy situation between them. Creepy people, you too will be disappointed.As far as my personal opinion on the series as a whole, I'd love to give it a 10/10, but I do feel it wasn't really masterpiece-level as far as sound and story go. Didn't keep me from enjoying it like one, though. Definitely one I'll be buying if/when it ships overseas.This isn't a series that I would recommend to everyone, but it is a series that I consider amazing. If you're not sure, pick up the first episode, stay with it until the end, and see if you'd like to watch more. Maybe you'll love it, maybe you'll never touch it again. At any rate, it's definitely one that's worth trying."", ""::QUICK REVIEW::Story: 5 (For an ass kicking bodyguard, this guy is feckless)Art: 8 (Some anim. are laughable but overall its beautiful)Sound: 7 (Sound was good... can't think of anything else)Character: 7 (Shinku X Murasaki are the only 2 worth watching)Enjoyment: 4 (Don't watch it for the action... you'll get 'boned')Overall: 31/50 = ~6 (...what is that car doing THERE?!?!?)::FULL REVIEW::After reading through all the reviews, I have noticed there is nothing but praise about this show, and only one review that doesn't really explain the faults of the show. I'm here to fill in that gap. Personally I felt this show suffered from anime-itis. Don't...know what that is? Read on dear reader...Kure-nai in essence is, a rom-com of the 'brother/sister' sense. As you already know, Kurenai is supposed to protect Shinkurou from her plutocratic family. On the outside, it sounds like a very serious anime. It even boasts a fairly impressive backstory explaining how everything is run in the Kuhouin family. Specifically in regards to religion, polygamy, and sexism. But don't be fooled. The main story is only found in the first few episodes and the last 3 episodes. So what about the other ~6 episodes? Just typical bodyguard/vip antics and a little shounen on the side. All that is good and fun for a little bit of grins and giggles. But this show is littered with so many bad ends and inconsistencies it starts to become laughable. Bad ends in terms of only a complete idiot that doesn't value his life or the life he's protecting would do something like that. In terms of the many inconsistencies I found, feel free to read the episode discussions and find my name since they're 100% spoilerish.On a technical sense, this is a very beautiful looking anime in high definition. It was so great I was actively trying to find faults in the animation and all I'm going to say is that you will laugh out loud when Kurenai puts his 'serious' face on. Other than that, they manage to have a large number of licensed products in this show, namely Maserati and Mercedes-Benz gained my interest. Another thing to notice is how the rooms at the apartment compliment the characters perfectly in style and function. And they did a real good job in making Kurenai's apartment completely dilapidated thats very unfit for a princess.Speaking of princess Murasaki sure does act like one. Most people loved her from the beginning, but I'm betting its because she gets naked more than once in the first 3 episodes. As for me, I loved to hate her. The attitude towards others was something I would beat ('time out' for political correctness) my child for. But of course, since its a shounen-ish rom/com, I'm sure you can guess the outcome. The characters are a double edged sword, some you will love, others you will hate, but most you will love and hate at the same time. Thats another strong point of the show though The character chemistry between Shinkurou and Murasaki is something that most viewers don't see very often. Unfortunately, at times, some viewers can feel a little uncomfortable at some of those two's actions but apparently in this day and age its fairly acceptable. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it. As for the support cast, they are just that... support. The show will act like they're important, but in the grand scheme of things, it just comes down to the Shinkurou and Murasaki show. People can say the support cast are unique, if you can call a poorly dressed emo, a horny college girl, a languid bodyguard, or a plain-sight undercover (oxymoron) agent as unique.I really, really, REALLY tried to enjoy this show considering how many people kept telling me how great it is. But there are so many episodes going off on a tangent. It also got me disappointed so many times at so many different outcomes that, after a while I just lost faith in rooting for the good guys. And for icing on the cake, 1/2 of the final episode is just pure ridiculousness. I certainly felt gypped, especially when they didn't exploit the back story as well as they should have.Why does this suffer from anime-itis?A) If you show me a fascinating plot with a deep background story, don't bother putting a romantic comedy in as fillers.B) The pacifist bodyguard character is played out.C) Ending takes a crazy turn down unrealistic alley.D) Short term outcomes becomes very predictable and uninspired.E) ...ITS 12 EPISODES!!

There are some that will begin this series without knowing what to expect but one thing I can assure you, is to expect a very intriguing and fairly entertaining short series.The beginning of this series is fairly confusing and can make it difficult to understand what it&rsquo;s all about, as it seems like a bunch of random events; however what is easy to grasp is the main story. Shinkurou Kurenai is a high school student who undertakes numerous odd jobs and becoming a bodyguard for Murasaki Kuhouin (daughter of a powerful plutocratic...family) is the newest job he decides to take on. During this time the two grow strong bonds with each other, as Shinkurou becomes sort of a parental guardian, but then something more to Murasaki. Each episode does a fine job in focusing on a random issue, yet sometimes it can seem so random that it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense (the musical). Nevertheless this is a short series that&rsquo;s worth every minute, except the ending, which does leave a few things unclear.For a short series, it does boast a strong cast of peculiar characters nevertheless I believe it to be the best thing about this anime. Shinkurou Kurenai is a dispute mediator, with a very troubling background and Murasaki Kuhouin is a secluded pompous girl, who&rsquo;s longed to see the outside world. These two a forced into the current situation they are in, by the enigmatic adults they are involved with. Not to forget the friends of Shinkurou who very interesting and provide a bit more to the show.What stood out to me, in this series, was the lavish animation. The distinctive backgrounds and plush scenery were extraordinarily detailed. Also the character designs were nicely crafted and smoothly animated, however their definitions were very inconsistent when moving around. As for the music, Kure-nai sure has a good calming soundtrack but it is fairly unnoticeable. The appealing OP and ED themes are the tunes that you will notice, not to forget the amazing SFX.Overall Kure-nai is a very uplifting anime about being bound by customs and wanting to protect someone; although it can be difficult to determine the true nature of this extravagant series. This series provided a good deal of comedy; shown through the characters&rsquo; interactions and also some drama through the characters&rsquo; experienced hardships and gripping dialogue. Surprisingly there&rsquo;s also a great deal of action, in this carefree anime, so there&rsquo;s plenty to satisfy anyone taste.

This uneveness isn't even a case of certain elements of the series being handled better than others; Kurenai is both pleasing and disappointing in every one of its aspects. The animation is distinct but marred by noticeable low-quality moments, the characters are as engraging as they are entertaining, and the plot moves from being confusing to entertaining to downright stupid. There are no triumphant highs or deep, dank lows in Kurenai, but this anime does enough seesawing between entertainment and disappointment to lead to a mediocre viewing experience overall.Kurenai...does do some things right. This show's biggest strength is its complex setting, which the viewer is thrust directly into from the very first episode. The characters and their actions make little sense at first, but each of their personalities and histories is revealed as the series progresses, leaving the viewer with a very thorough understanding of the situation by the time of the climax. Another one of Kurenai's most enjoyable aspects is the relationship between Shinkurou and Murasaki. The boy-suddenly-acquires-loli plot device has been used in other works, but it's handled well here. The most enjoyable moments of this show and found in the midsection of the story, where Shinkurou is simply trying to get through daily life while putting up with Murasaki's eccentric behavior.It's a shame that the staff had to throw in some hamfisted attempts at action and heavy drama into the mix as well, because Kurenai does well enough up until these scenes are introduced. It's not that these moments don't belong in the show, because they are most-likely included in the light novel source material as well, but they are handled so poorly that I almost wish they were left out. During these scenes, whatever was interesting about Shinkurou is brushed aside to make way for a bland &quot;I'll protect you&quot; male lead, and towards the end of the show, none of the characters behave consistently. The series finale is especially insulting because it absolutely trashes the intricate plot that was being weaved up until that point with a complete cop-out of an ending. It just might be better to stop watching this two-thirds of the way through.I wouldn't say that I wasted six hours of my life watching Kurenai, but I wouldn't suggest that you set aside your valuable time for this. does do some things right.

I honestly wasn't expecting all that much, although the screencaps I had seen looked fairly impressive art-wise.Story: Fairly original, actually, though it definitely reminds me of a darker Aishiteruze Baby. Of course, the show hasn't progressed all that far, but if it continues as it's been going, I'll have no complaints. It looks like some interesting things are up in the next episodes.Art: Not the standard anime fair, but I'm really liking it. The OP animation was really different. The actual show itself has very fluid and subtle animation, which I happen to enjoy a lot.Sound: I...didn't particularly notice the background music, but the ED was pretty snazzy in my opinion.

Okay, to be fair, it only became horrible after episode 8. At the beginning I was rating it a 10 and placing it among my favorite animes. The plot was somewhat unique, and there was the mystery as to exactly what the girl was running from, and shinkuro's past. But as the answers start to become revealed by each episode somehow in the 9th episode the author of the anime has no idea/clue where to take the anime. The action goes downhill, which is disappointing since it is supposed to be an action genre and they turn a possible bourne...ultimatum-type action genre down to something you see on madtv (basically ridiculous). And just the way it ended was soooo pathetically random, I was just speechless as to how irritating it was. The only part that made my mood any better was the last 2 seconds where the focus was on shinkuro.Anyways, if you MUST watch this anime watch it to episode 8, and skip to the last episode 12 if you even feel like finding out how it turns out. Otherwise, I recommend not to even waste your time on this anime since you will be horribly disappointed. ultimatum-type action genre down to something you see on madtv (basically ridiculous).

It's not Kaiba in all its glorious artfaggotry but it's definitely not Soul Eater either. Most viewers can already gather from the first episode that over-the-top shounen battles are not what this show is about. Basically, Kure-nai is a story about two characters growing up, while discovering which kind of power is the kind that really matters. The kind that really matter accroding to Kure-nai is not a Kamehameha or a Rasengan, but the ability to make your own decisions, finding your place in society on your own and upholding your...values at any time. You know the deal.Main character Shinkurou Kurenai could definitely use some of this &quot;power&quot; as he is an orphan, having lost both of his parents in a terrorist attack. He's currently employed by a woman by the name of Benika Juuzawa, working as a so-called &quot;dispute mediator&quot;. Which is a dangerous job; Shinkurou's activities include beating up Yakuza and protecting various people from harm and even though he's only 16 years old, he does a great job of it. In hand-to-hand combat, you do not want to face Shinkurou since he's been trained in a secret, clan-specific type of martial arts and has some type of special weapon in his body to boot. One day he asks Benika to assign him a more complex mission, hoping to impress her and get some extra money out of it while he's at it. Benika then wants Shinkurou to protect a little girl who appears to be the heir to a traditional family called the Kuhouins. Only later Shinkurou finds out about the cruel ways of the Kuhouins and why exactly he was chosen to protect the girl.Now the one thing which carries this story is the bond between its various characters, most notably between Shinkurou and Murasaki Kuhouin, the seven-year-old girl. This relationship is so touching it really leads you to believe this is a romance anime about these two characters, but as one is only 7 and the other is 16, you can see this is not the case. It is really hard to describe how these characters exactly relate, but it is a very interesting bond they share nonetheless. Both characters possess loveable personalities, Murasaki being the cheeky preschooler with an extraordinary take on modern society and Shinkurou being the caring and somewhat indecisive pushover who slowly takes the form of an strong and admirable parental figure. Kure-nai is a story about its characters and the characters are great. Not to say the rest of the show is bad, but this aspect really saves it from mediocrity.The first half of the story is decidedly lighthearted as we see Shinkurou and Murasaki interact with their environment in a slice-of-life sort of fashion. This is where the 8 for &quot;enjoyment&quot; comes in. While even these early episodes aren't particularly humorous I found them very enjoyable, once again thanks to lively characters such as Shinkurou's roommates Tamaki and Yamie. After a while though, the happy-go-lucky atmosphere grows old and especially episode 6 felt particularly forced. From that episode on however, the story turns gritty, new information regarding Murasaki's family comes to light and the family itself shows up as well, in their attempts to take Murasaki back at all costs. Shinkurou's situation becomes pressured and he starts to question his own strength after realizing how this job was probably more than he could handle. After seeing Shinkurou has grown in his determination to finish what he started and protect the ones he cares for most, Benika also finally starts to show her human side. By the end of the story the viewer will also find out a little about what exactly drives her, though it's really kind of an afterthought compared to Shinkurou's story.The final episodes however, are undeniably silly at times. At some point there is a carchase in the snow which in my opinion was entirely unnecessary to the plot and really was there just to entertain action-fans who stuck with the show until the very end for some unknown reason. The ending itself was pretty powerful in my opinion because it was unexpected and it made me think if the characters had really made the right decisions, however at the same time it was very unrealistic and it would've been much better once again, if Brain's Base would've just toned down on the violence and ever-apparent murderous intent everywhere in the final episode. There was much more hand-to-hand action than usual near the end, which wouldn't have been bad if it wasn't for two things:Firstly, it was important to the story the combat was done unarmed, to really see the link between one's physical strength and ones inner strength. This has been done really well overall, but when you really look at just the story and not all the themes woven into it, it really begs the question why not a single person opted for a firearm throughout the show. One 9mm handgun could've easily turned the tables on Shinkurou.Secondly, this show is not Gurren Lagann. Art-wise, Kure-nai looks excellent, but the animation quality was rather inconsistent. As mentioned before, there weren't a lot of challenges for animators to overcome as the show mainly revolves around its dialogues, but when things heated up, the animation disappointed me greatly. It always caught my attention at the moments that really mattered, and that's never a good thing. At first I was really impressed by Kure-nai's visuals but the aforementioned issues turned my rating down to a low 7.Lastly, let's discuss sound. The first thing that will definitely catch the viewer's attention in Kure-nai is the OP. Not because of the music, but because of the visual style. If you want to know what I'm talking about you really have to go and see it for yourself. My problem with this OP is that while it's certainly not generic (which is almost always a good thing), it doesn't suit the show's feel. At all. The ED is a little better but far from a reason to watch the show in itself. It seems Brain's Base realized this after a while and they decided to fix this. How? By completely removing the OP and ED. That's right. From around episode 7 on, this show has no OP or ED. Which is sort of lazy. The last time I can remember watching an anime with no OP was FLCL.However, FLCL still has its excellent ED and overall J-rocky soundtrack going for it. Kure-nai only has some instrumental tracks which are hard to notice while watching, but most of the time there's just silence. Which also works. In that regard, Kure-nai's &quot;sound&quot; isn't all that bad, but the Kure-nai OST is definitely not a must-have.Overall, Kure-nai didn't exactly turn out the way I wanted it to. With this show, Brain's Base does some things not many studios have, but the the themes and morales that encompass the entire show sometimes really cause its credibility and plot to suffer. At some point, Kure-nai turns almost Shakespearian in its approach, with long, complex dialogue, even from seven-year-old Murasaki. I'd say these are things that are good to know beforehand, and that is also the reason I write this review. I hope that after reading this review, you will have an idea of what to expect from Kure-nai and perhaps you will be able to enjoy it even more than I did, because I had to figure all this out along the way.Kure-nai's a great change of pace from the more generic shounen and high-school series, but in the end one's opinion of this show is really something personal. Shinkurou and Murasaki's story was touching enough to me, but there's no saying if this goes for all viewers out there. Still, if this sounds like your kind of show, don't miss out. values at any time.

One 9mm handgun could've easily turned the tables on Shinkurou.Secondly, this show is not Gurren Lagann. Art-wise, Kure-nai looks excellent, but the animation quality was rather inconsistent. As mentioned before, there weren't a lot of challenges for animators to overcome as the show mainly revolves around its dialogues, but when things heated up, the animation disappointed me greatly. It always caught my attention at the moments that really mattered, and that's never a good thing. At first I was really impressed by Kure-nai's visuals but the aforementioned issues turned my rating down to a low 7.Lastly, let's discuss sound. The first thing that will definitely catch the viewer's attention in Kure-nai is the OP. Not because of the music, but because of the visual style. If you want to know what I'm talking about you really have to go and see it for yourself. My problem with this OP is that while it's certainly not generic (which is almost always a good thing), it doesn't suit the show's feel. At all. The ED is a little better but far from a reason to watch the show in itself. It seems Brain's Base realized this after a while and they decided to fix this. How? By completely removing the OP and ED. That's right. From around episode 7 on, this show has no OP or ED. Which is sort of lazy. The last time I can remember watching an anime with no OP was FLCL.However, FLCL still has its excellent ED and overall J-rocky soundtrack going for it. Kure-nai only has some instrumental tracks which are hard to notice while watching, but most of the time there's just silence. Which also works. In that regard, Kure-nai's &quot;sound&quot; isn't all that bad, but the Kure-nai OST is definitely not a must-have.Overall, Kure-nai didn't exactly turn out the way I wanted it to. With this show, Brain's Base does some things not many studios have, but the the themes and morales that encompass the entire show sometimes really cause its credibility and plot to suffer. At some point, Kure-nai turns almost Shakespearian in its approach, with long, complex dialogue, even from seven-year-old Murasaki. I'd say these are things that are good to know beforehand, and that is also the reason I write this review. I hope that after reading this review, you will have an idea of what to expect from Kure-nai and perhaps you will be able to enjoy it even more than I did, because I had to figure all this out along the way.Kure-nai's a great change of pace from the more generic shounen and high-school series, but in the end one's opinion of this show is really something personal. Shinkurou and Murasaki's story was touching enough to me, but there's no saying if this goes for all viewers out there. Still, if this sounds like your kind of show, don't miss out."", 'Kurenai is a show that blends several different story elements together. It\'s an action thriller, complete with secret organizations and trained teenage operatives. It\'s a story of personal growth, with the two main characters learning what is most important to them and how to fight for it. It\'s a slice-of-life with quirky characters and hints of romance. This all adds up to a 12 episode show that gives you a good taste of each, while managing to tug on your heartstrings from time to time. Yet, unfortunately, for all the juicy morsels it offers up, Kurenai is oddly un-filling. There is a feeling Kurenai could...be better had it developed some of its ideas further, and cut off some parts that were needless. The result is uneven, yet ultimately rewarding enough to warrant a watch.Some suspension of disbelief is required to fully accept Kurenai\'s story, though that can be said for a lot of anime. Our protagonist, the titular Shinkurou Kurenai, is a regular high school student at first glance. However, outside of school, he works as a mediator for an underground organization; a ""problem fixer"" of sorts, as he puts it. His next assignment is a big one, he must look after a precocious 7-year old girl named Murasaki Kuhouin, who escaped the cruel fate of women of the Kuhouin clan with the help of Kurenai\'s mentor/employer, Benika. This will be no easy task, as the Kuhouin clan is searching for their runaway. The other meddlesome tenants of Kurenai\'s apartment building don\'t help matters, either.The focal point of Kurenai\'s plot is the relationship of the two leads. Kurenai and Murasaki are interesting all on their own. Kurenai was orphaned at a young age, when his parents died in a terrorist attack. He has a deep admiration for Benika, and he aspires to be as strong as her one day. He works under her in order to reach that goal. Still, he is rather meek and humble, and doubts himself. Murasaki is articulate and mature for her age, forced to grow up quickly by her clan\'s traditions. She\'s also rather haughty from being pampered, and naïve about the outside world which she was raised to have no connection. The bond between the two is one of mutual growth. In the case of Murasaki, she learns from Kurenai (an the other tenants of the apartment building) the mannerisms and ways of common people. She also learns do deal with strong emotions as the relationship between her and Kurenai deepens, as well as how to truly treasure a relationship. For Kurenai, Murasaki becomes someone to fight for, someone to protect. This not only drives him in his attempts to grow stronger, but builds his convictions; even to the point of defying Benika if he must.It is good that the relationship between Kurenai and Murasaki is strong, because it is ultimately what holds the show together. The narrative of this show is not the best constructed; it consists of very loosely structured arcs, which can become unfocused. The mid-series episodes in particular are meandering and sort of aimless. This does not mean there is no development, Kurenai and Murasaki\'s relationship grows slowly, but the plot just sort of comes to a halt. The episodes themselves aren\'t unenjoyable, there are some fun situations and misadventures. However, the novelty of seeing things like the residents of Kurenai\'s apartment building practicing for a musical wears thin quickly. It is a godsend when the plot finally gets moving again in the last third, though the use of coincidence in kick starting the plot is a bit irksome. From there, the show delivers some hard-hitting emotional scenes, majority of the show\'s fights, and a mostly satisfying conclusion.The supporting cast is a bit of a mixed bag. The brightest piece in the bag being Benika, who fills her role as Kurenai\'s mentor and employer very well. Their relationship is somewhere between business and personal. She holds the reins loosely on Kurenai and her other subordinates, but doesn\'t hesitate to exercise authority when it is necessary. She genuinely cares for Kurenai, but keeps a professional distance from him most of the time. Kurenai\'s mischievous land-lady, Yamie, is fun comic relief. As is equally as mischievous college student Tamaki. Their shenanigans with Murasaki provide most of the enjoyment in the meandering middle episodes. The same cannot be said for Kurenai\'s schoolmates/ potential love interests, Yuno and Ginko, who are essentially just window shopping. Both have feelings for Kurenai, and neither goes anywhere. The Kuhouin provide some note-worthy villainy, mostly from Murasaki\'s menacing older brother Ryuuji and the battle-crazed Lin, but aren\'t given all that much screen-time.This show was animated by Brain\'s Base, but before they hit the peak of their popularity, and is one of their lesser known works. The show is a testament to the studio\'s quality work even before it gained notoriety. This show looks really good. The character designs are distinct, vibrant, and expressive. Murasaki\'s design in particular is fantastic; it hits the right balance of childish youth and demure beauty to illustrate both Murasaki\'s age and her upbringing. Benika\'s casual and yet commanding appearance fits her perfectly, as does the very formal look of her subordinate Yayoi. Ryuuji looks every bit the well dressed sleaze he is, and Lin\'s facial expressions are fittingly deranged. Kurenai\'s design has a bit of bishounen flavor to it, but is still distinctive compared to the worn generic designs that plague all too many male anime leads. The animation overall is good too, but there are some rough spots. These rough spots are most evident in the show\'s fighting scenes; characters don\'t move quite as fluidly as the trained combatants should. Sometimes their movements look kind of unnatural. Editing-wise, the transitions into fights sometimes feel choppy or abrupt, though some of the editing also makes up for the animation short-comings.The music is dominated solemn orchestral and jazz pieces. Piano in particular is heavily used in the soundtrack. Usually, a show will have more energetic pieces with high tempos for action sequences. However, with a few rare exceptions, this is not the case in Kurenai. Slow solemn pieces are often used for fights, and remarkably, this actually works. The melancholic tone of the music is used to give gravity to the fights, making them serious and visceral occurrences. At times the music choices can get a bit tiresome as a few tracks are often repeated, many times in the same episode. However, this does what a good soundtrack should do: support the visuals and content of the show.Kurenai is a solid little show worth watching despite its various flaws. At its core is a strong central relationship that carries the show through its rough patches and remains endearing throughout. The middle episodes do drag and lose focus, but once the plot pulls itself together, it delivers some emotionally gripping moments that really accentuate the relationship between the two leads. It even throws in a few good laughs and fights when it is at its best. be better had it developed some of its ideas further, and cut off some parts that were needless.

This is a difficult task, and if handled improperly, it can tear down the whole story, which in fact happened in this anime. While it executed the slice of life part well, blending in the action was poorly done to say at least, resulting in major plot holes, as well as an unnatural story progression. This anime would have been much better off by focusing...on the slice of life aspect, yet sadly didn\'t.~Story~The premise of Kure-nai is simple: 16-year-old Kurenai Shinkorou, a master martial artist and professional mediator, yearning for better paid jobs, receives a request from his boss Benika to protect the young 7-year-old girl Murasaki Kuhoin. Mystery surrounds both the girl and protagonist himself, which possibly ensures a great story. This sadly not the case, as it jumps from action to a prolonged slice of life setting, than to plunge once again in the action scene; which disturbs the overall continuity of the anime.As stated earlier, the slice of life moments in this show were well executed, which in this case was presenting somewhat realistic character relationships in addition to satisfying crafted everyday life events. Viewers observe how these two main characters interact between themselves and their environment, as well providing some background stories for the little Murasaki. These interactions and events can be amusing at times, which is enhances the atmosphere the anime is trying to portray. However, there is often also typical school type situations which viewers are used to see in romcom school comedies, which can be a drawback.Now as mentioned earlier, Kurenai needs to protect the girl from her powerful family, yet there is a problem to this: the viewer isn\'t provided with enough knowledge of the family to understand the reason why she even needs to be protected, even after it is revealed nearing the conclusion. Consequently audiences never or hardly ever feel any kind of tension whatsoever whenever something happens to her, be it wandering out on her own, or going out with the protagonist.This brings me to the drama aspect of Kure-nai, which was poorly executed and difficult to take seriously due to various reasons: first of all, the fact that a teenager is protecting a little girl from a very rich and powerful family while attending school normally and leaving the kid alone is a huge flaw already. Other issue was the continuity of the show, that either totally focused upon action/drama or just switched to normal everyday life events. Then there is the fact that the protagonist himself is a pretty useless bodyguard, which raises the question why he even was assigned this job. Finally, the motives and characters themselves were shallow, but I will treat this topic below.~Characters~There is a handful of characters present in Kure-nai, naturally being Murasaki and Kurenai of utmost importance. Murasaki is a young, talented martial artist and naturally being young makes it difficult for him to live on his own, consequently working as a professional mediator. His past is explored upon very superficially, and the motives on why he has this particular job are weak as well. Then there is Kurenai, a girl from a rich family with elitist behaviour; she undergoes the most character development and fleshing out of the whole cast, though her sudden change in lifestyle: from a rich environment to a dirty little room.The secondary characters are of importance as well, yet these undergo near to zero character development or fleshing out. This jars the narrative of the anime, as they are one-dimensional characters with very lacking motives, which seems to make them out as simple plot devices. The friends of the protagonist, as well as his boss felt redundant in the anime.~Animation and sound~The animation of Kure-nai was well executed, as times very well done with fluid character motions, as well as the environment. This could not be said about the background, which was well drawn in the beginning, towards the end being of lesser quality, especially when comparing it with the character\'s detail. Character design were slightly different from what anime viewers are used to, but was rather lackluster in fact, being the defining feature their hairstyles, as faces of the main cast were basically the same. This was however a small drawback.The voice actors performed their role well, matching with each character voices, though at times emotional states of these didn\'t come over too well. The soundtrack used was nothing outstanding, yet fulfilled its purpose in creating the different atmospheres it was trying to relay to the viewer.~Enjoyment~What started as an interesting and amusing anime, changed for the worse as it progressed through a badly handled blending between slice of life and action; the character were no great help either in providing a somewhat realistic story, yet what ""saved"" it from being a disaster were the slice of life moments present its duration. I personally think this would have worked much better if it focused on the slice of life aspect. In addition, the protagonist should have been an adult rather than a teenager, as this makes it very difficult to take the series seriously, in addition to the additional question that arises as how a simple teenager could be taking care of a 7-year-old girl without arising suspicion.So do I recommend this anime? Honestly I don\'t; I have grown to dislike the school-type of setting more and more, which may have influenced significantly. Naturally, for newcomers to the anime scene all this issues wouldn\'t bother that much, yet for the more seasoned viewers, I would say stay away from it.Thank you for reading. on the slice of life aspect, yet sadly didn\'t.~Story~The premise of Kure-nai is simple: 16-year-old Kurenai Shinkorou, a master martial artist and professional mediator, yearning for better paid jobs, receives a request from his boss Benika to protect the young 7-year-old girl Murasaki Kuhoin.

It really did. So I was kind of prejudiced against the first episode. But I soon realized, that the opening is the only bad thing so far- everything else is greatly enjoyable.The stories are really sweet,the characters authentical, especially Murasaki is a surprisingly pleasant character. The background music supports the animation almost perfectly. Kure-Nai is would be my first-choice-series to watch after an exhausting day of work. It's relaxing but still entertaining and exciting. "", ""A few years down the line Kurenai won't be remembered as a classic, hell I doubt many people will remember it now; it deserves more attention. But maybe it should be remembered as a classic. I believe kurenai has the biggest advancement in quality in production of anime ever.Going in I didn't know what to expect, when I loaded up the first episode I was a little taken aback by the OP and my expectations were lowered a little, it seemed kurenai wasn't the type of show I might have been looking for at the time. But the OP is deceiving, catchy but deceiving. The...second blow to my expectations came in the first few minutes with an apparantly supernatural element. &quot;another crappy super power anime&quot; I thought. But I soldiered on and by the end of episode 2 I was hooked. Kurenai is a breath of fresh air.At first I wasn't sure what it was I liked so much about it but eventually it dawns on you. The characters, are having conversations. In every anime up till now, everything I've watched has had statements with arkward pauses inbetween, you might not have noticed it but after watching kurenai you might. The secret is, and to my knowledge kurenai is the first to do this, the show is animated based on the voice actor's recording. Finally the actors are released from the shackles of arkward animation timing, and the result shines. Kurenai is wonderful to listen to, you can hear more emotion in the voices than ever, lines are said at the right pace and I felt like the actors had even been allowed some improvision in the script to fit their characters. The advantages don't stop there, so far kurenai has the best lip syncing of any show i've seen (not so say it's perfect, far from it) but the dialogue flows wonderfully and there are conversations with 3 people at a time (to fansubbers regret) which help give the show so much character.Kurenai isn't a one trick wonder.The art is above average, with some varied enviroments beautifully drawn (especially towards the end), although a good amount of the show is set in one or two locations. The animation however, is not amazing. Although usually the characters move quite fluidly in some high movement episodes you can see they were stretching the budget and some of the animation becomes a little arkward. Some of the fight scenes look a little silly as well but in general the show has good art direction. The characters are all very uniquely drawn and you can see some of their personality in how they move, more subtely than other shows.Before I talk about the characters, I should explain what type of show kurenai actually is. kurenai is not harem, despite being surrounded by woman. Kurenai is not a super power show, despite Shinkurou arguably having one. Kurenai, to me, is primarily a coming of age story for Murasaki and Shinkurou. It unravels the show using a mixture of comedy, drama and action (to a lesser extent).The story is good. It uses the past of some characters to explain their motivations while others are revealed as the story progresses. Although the story is initially quite sinister, it lightens up to the Shinkurou - Murasaki relationship for the bulk of the series, before taking a darker dive than I was expecting for the climax. The story is paced well and serves its job well enough, the really great thing about kurenai is the characters. it's a little bit of a shame this show wasn't given a longer run. I know theres more manga material out there (which it follows, except for the ending which they had to improvise). On that subject, the ending wasn't the best ever, without giving too much away it seemed like a compromise was made which didn't really fit with the circumstances and the attiturdes of some of the characters but it does tie up the show and leave some space for a sequel (please?).During the &quot;slice-of-life&quot; part of the show you learn about Murasaki, Shinkurou and his neighbours, friends and &quot;employer&quot;. The character's all have a fun, strong personality without exaggerating to the point of Naruto or something. Infact subtelty is one of my favourite part of the show. It doesn't shout everything at you, rather it treats you like an intelligent viewer more than most and lets you make your own conclusions. The character history is incomplete, and a lot is implied, much of it through dialogue.The humour in the series is great, amazing. Cross gender jokes without &quot;haha she fell and you saw her panties&quot; and the most mature humour i've ever seen in an anime. Episode 6 put me to tears actually and the show is littered with funny dialogue.So I better end this ridiculous wall of text here. Kurenai is one of the best shows I've ever watched and if other shows took a page out of its book the quality of animes would increase greatly. Huge kudos to brain base, the creators. I refrained from giving it a 10 for its flaws but its definitely close. So in conclusion watch this because it might be the best under appreciated show ever and then get everyone else to watch it so it gets the attention it deserves. second blow to my expectations came in the first few minutes with an apparantly supernatural element. &quot;another crappy super power anime&quot; I thought.

On that subject, the ending wasn't the best ever, without giving too much away it seemed like a compromise was made which didn't really fit with the circumstances and the attiturdes of some of the characters but it does tie up the show and leave some space for a sequel (please?).During the &quot;slice-of-life&quot; part of the show you learn about Murasaki, Shinkurou and his neighbours, friends and &quot;employer&quot;. The character's all have a fun, strong personality without exaggerating to the point of Naruto or something. Infact subtelty is one of my favourite part of the show. It doesn't shout everything at you, rather it treats you like an intelligent viewer more than most and lets you make your own conclusions. The character history is incomplete, and a lot is implied, much of it through dialogue.The humour in the series is great, amazing. Cross gender jokes without &quot;haha she fell and you saw her panties&quot; and the most mature humour i've ever seen in an anime. Episode 6 put me to tears actually and the show is littered with funny dialogue.So I better end this ridiculous wall of text here. Kurenai is one of the best shows I've ever watched and if other shows took a page out of its book the quality of animes would increase greatly. Huge kudos to brain base, the creators. I refrained from giving it a 10 for its flaws but its definitely close. So in conclusion watch this because it might be the best under appreciated show ever and then get everyone else to watch it so it gets the attention it deserves."", 'Once in a while you come across anime from which you expect pretty much nothing to begin with but you see a couple of episodes and find yourself having the urge to continue watching until the very end. ‘Kurenai’ was one of them for me.The story revolves around Kurenai Shinkurou, a high school student who works as a dispute mediator. He possesses abundant martial arts skills and accepts requests from his employer Juuzawa Benika to resolve trifling conflicts and the like. When he demands for something more challenging, Benika consigns him the job of protecting a seven year old kid, Kuohouin Murasaki who belongs...to a highly influential and plutocratic household- the Kuohouin family. Having no clue about the young girl’s background, he accepts the job after a bit of hesitation. How Murasaki responds to the world of the commoners and forms bonds with the people around her while constantly battling against the depressing memories of her mother and life at the Kuohouin household are the main focus of the story.While the plot, in itself, may not sound much unique or intriguing, the way it is carried out is quite good.  For a short anime with twelve episodes, it was an enjoyable watch.  The premise of the first few episodes is Murasaki learning new things and getting acquainted with the people related to Shinkurou, and how she finds joy in little things which she was devoid of. Every episode was fun to watch and none of them felt boring. Not to forget, there were a few moments which were quite amusing to me.The cast is entertaining to say the least. The characters are so vibrant that you can’t help but like them. The protagonist Shinkurou, the cheeky Murasaki and their neighbours— they are such an interesting bunch. One character I personally didn’t like was Houzuki Yuuno, not only because it is infuriating to see people who try hard to gain attention but also because she didn’t seem to have much of a role except that of following around the protagonist. Well, every harem anime needs one I suppose. On that note, this isn’t exactly a harem. While it will be incorrect to say that harem doesn’t exist, it is more or less a side dish which is good in this case at least.The OST is average. Most of the soundtracks were barely noticeable. The only soundtrack that I like is ‘Wasureenu Omoi’ (look for it in Youtube) which played during a dramatic scene in the last episode if I remember correctly. The OP is nothing great either and the same goes for the first ED. The second ED on the other hand is catchy and I liked it.The art is sharp and vivid, and the animation is done really well. The backgrounds are simple yet attractive.

For one thing, the plot is not believable.  A girl must go into hiding, and thus she is given to a high school student who is absent half the day.  She is freely taken into public places, her appearance is not changed, and frequently there are moments where disbelief cannot be suspended at the actions done with this girl who is supposedly ""in hiding"".  This could be ignored if the characters were very good.  The lead, Shinkurou, was interesting enough, but very few of the...other characters are.  Murasaki is alright, but somewhat repetitive.  The female love interest is dull, while another, more interesting female character from Kurenai\'s school is ignored for the most part.  Frankly the series simply feels a bit aimless. other characters are.  Murasaki is alright, but somewhat repetitive.  The female love interest is dull, while another, more interesting female character from Kurenai\'s school is ignored for the most part.  Frankly the series simply feels a bit aimless.', 'Preface: The Kure-nai anime is a truly underrated gem of the medium; it is a shonen that transcends the limitations and trappings of its demographic into something adult and intelligent, and into what I find to be one of the best shonen anime of all time and it also happens to fall into that 1% of ""anime adaptations that are better than the manga/light novel/visual novel they are based off of.""*I would go into length about the differences between the anime and manga, but it would be too extensive for this review, so I\'ll have it on file if anyone wants clarification later*When I...heard about Kure-nai back in \'08 and read up on the premise, my tastes were too underdeveloped at the time and I dismissed it as some dull slice of life (in a laymen sense) story that wouldn\'t satisfy my adolescent male cravings for boisterous shonen action. A few years later, as my tastes have become more refined and open, I come across a review on the series  and decide to take a look at it and seeing that it was a rather favourable review, I decided to check it out under the assumption that it was almost purely slice of life (again, it a laymen sense) which I was more accepting towards. Ironically, it turns out that Kure-nai does have action in it; some of the most visceral, well choreographed and intense martial arts I\'ve seen in an anime that is. With that said, the action was a great bonus, and for those of you at the very least looking for some quality martial arts battles, then definitely give Kure-nai a shot for the fighting and stay for the story. I think that it can serve as a nice entry way into good storytelling in shonen anime and other anime in general. As to why Kure-nai is such a great anime and happens to be my current #3 top anime, let\'s dig into the meat of the review shall we?Story: Kure-nai, at its core, is a simple story; a young man working as a part time mediator is assigned an additional job on the side to take care of the young daughter of an aristocratic family while trying to juggle his job as a mediator, his school life and his home life where he lives in a shoddy apartment with 2 other eccentric patrons. Our titular ""protagonist"" Shinkuro Kurenai is the 16 year old mediator in question whose parents were murdered when he was young and he was rescued by his mentor and fellow mediator Benika Juzawa, who left him in the care of the Hozuki family household where he would learn their style of martial arts and get a special bone blade transplanted into his elbow for emergencies. He eventually moved out of the place and found an apartment on his own with the payments from his job as a mediator to support his stay. Then there\'s the other most important character in the anime, Murasaki Kuhoin, who is seen being taken (rescued) from her family\'s manor at the start of the series by Benika and her assistant Yayoi Inuzuka, and being entrusted to Shinkuro. She is initially very impetuous and haughty, speaking in a sophisticated yet arguably archaic prose and believing the world around her to be her personal oyster, like treating a bath house clerk like a servant and not giving thanks, expecting to be given treats and such regularly. Shinkuro begins to teach Murasaki about societal folkways and mores that she is not used to due to her sheltered upbringing in a prestigious family and we see the contrasting lifestyles and norms collide. From there, the series starts to take off. Being predominantly character driven, the story focuses on our 2 characters growing their bond, growing as individuals and growing as members of society with all these different scenarios and characters coming into play to help them blossom with things like Shinkuro trying to negotiate with shady figures that usually end up getting rough, Murasaki trying to occupy her time at the apartment while Shinkuro is at school, the 2 going out shopping or on play dates, and many more. We later learn about Shinkuro\'s tragic past and the reasons for Murasaki\'s kidnapping. It\'s all executed so well due to the exceptional writing that doesn\'t let things become formulaic, allows for balanced tones and conflicts, creates smart, subtle humour and not crude trite often seen (episode 6 is a riot, don\'t skip it), doesn\'t become steeped in melodrama and moves the story at a slower, but more enriching pace to its benefit coupled with some interesting cinematography and things like juxtapositions to add value to certain scenes. The action is interspersed over a few of the earlier episodes before becoming the focus in the last third of the series, but I\'ll refrain from delving into spoiler territory too much. The fights themselves are visceral in every sense of the word; you can almost feel every little contortion of flesh and bone with each blow, the movements are very fluid and expertly choreographed while making the environment feel like it actually has obstacles to it that get in the way. The characters aren\'t flying around all over and blasting beams at each other, and typically the place they are fighting in isn\'t conveniently spacious, so a character might get cut off by a chair, get caved in, etc, it is believable and well executed. Overall the story centralizes character growth and living as aforementioned, so early episodes involve some mundane stuff and a lot of conversation, but the mature dialogue, nuanced emotions, solid interplay, refined prose, natural tension and precise timing all culminate to make for a really engaging and really human drama. Whether it be Shinkuro chatting at school with friends, doing negotiations with people, him and Murasaki doing chores, Murasaki doing stuff by herself or anything else, it is all captured with meticulous detail for realism and not a single event feels superfluous or unnecessary. The final arc also happens to be a tour de force, really bringing the themes home, with Shinkuro questioning his strength in an refreshing and hard-hitting way unlike the typical shonen executions of it, along with the morals behind breaking out of an impersonal worker-client in order to make a change which leads up to a battle not of good and evil, but of freedom of expression for man as an individual v.s. punctual tradition for fortifying a status quo, making for a well constructed grey area as ideals clash as well as the morals behind family and the love shown to members of a family unit (trying to be vague to avoid spoilers) and all topped off with an ending that has reasonable goals and compromises for all sides that may be initially bittersweet, but touching in the end, and overall, I found nary a flaw in the whole thing. To conclude the story portion, I\'d like to draw up comparisons to 2 anime: Bunny Drop and Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal (moreso the former). I really love Bunny Drop, but I find that Kure-nai balances events better in terms of the child raising, not to say that Bunny Drop is bad by any means at doing its child raising well (quite the contrary) I just find Kure-nai is less linear and is able to show the events of both Shinkuro and Murasaki in an episode where they are apart whereas Bunny Drop will focus on either Daikichi at work or Rin playing in particular episodes besides the scenes where they are together, so I like how Kure-nai is able to handle multiple focal points like that and we aren\'t kind of left out on certain subplots or events for one side or the other, so it is more cohesive and rounded. As for RuroKen, it is mostly a stylistic thing, but I\'d just like to note that Kure-nai\'s final arc also has a rich, picturesque snow blanketed locale with a very heavy and tense atmosphere due to the content, and things proceed with just as much elegant pacing and tone as Trust and Betrayal, so do be sure to keep going with the series if you are having doubts and/or love Trust and Betrayal to see such a powerful and splendid final act. 10/10Characters: Again, being a character driven story, it is all about the characters, and the core duo and most of the supporting cast are multi-layered and believable human characters that you will grow on; although there are some hindrances, they are largely subjective. Shinkuro is a timid, humble and self-sufficient teenage boy just trying to get by in life with having to juggle so many things in his rough life; he is sincere and earnest, but can still be adamant and strict with Murasaki. He lacks some personal confidence, but is nonetheless devoted and compassionate. Murasaki starts out as a spoiled and whiny little girl with a brazen attitude, but over the course of the series, she settles down and blossoms into a very considerate, responsible and mature little 7 year old. Benika tends to be a rather reserved, sometimes stern person but also has a sharp tongue and is very optimistic and caring. Yayoi happens to be a tad thinner in personality than most of the cast, being mostly one note, brazen and subservient to Benika, although she does undergo something of an epiphany learning about strength through Shinkuro to help loosen up a bit. Ginko also is a little lackluster compared to some others, but has some subtle little soft spots beneath her blunt veneer and also happens to have a bit of a backstory with Shinkuro. Yuno is very kind upfront, but equally as assertive and strong with her convictions, being a sweetie with a rough side you don\'t wanna mess with. Tamaki is the eccentric, promiscuous patron living in the same apartment as Shinkuro, she is somewhat like Yuno only more carefree and playful whereas Yuno is more of a quiet yet passionate person, however, while Tamaki tends to wear her pride and flirtatiousness on her shoulder, she still feels some resentment towards herself for being too loose and not willing to settle down or be able to maintain a long relationship. Yamie is...an enigma really, so you could consider that a flaw in that little is exposed of her, but that is also part of her charm as the cunning witch that she is. Renjo Kuhoin is Murasaki\'s father, he appears to be a tightwad who simply amounts to the principles of the Kuhoin namesake rather than being a real person, when in actuality he cares deeply for his family and feels there is a bit of injustice in his family\'s system, but he is too fearful of the burden of being one to go against tradition and listen to his feelings. His son (whose name I\'m forgetting) is something of a foil to Renjo, he\'s extroverted and merciless and puts his pride as a Kuhoin above anything else and is very blatant about it. There\'s also Renjo\'s wife Kazuko who is one of the most arrogant and vile individuals in the series with that being the only real feature to her character, however if you want to take into account Western beliefs on characterization for villains or those of a similar ilk, having a real backstory for her and demistifying why she is so cruel would ruin a bit of her presence, similar to how people panned Kevin Smith for making a comic about the Joker\'s backstory. This is also seen in Lin-Cheng Shin, Renjo\'s son\'s bodyguard who is absolutely a psychotic nutcase who only desires for a fight, serving as a byproduct and raw exemplification of the son\'s spite and cruelty, sans the social and political connections to hold her back, making her a devastating individual. Lastly Souju Kuhoin is Renjo\'s sister who is the anti-thesis to Kazuko as a sweet-natured person and cared far more for Murasaki than Kazuko did, but she isn\'t shown too much. All in all the characters all serve a purpose and have well rounded personalities for the most part explored sufficiently while sticking to their more prominent traits to make them stand out, with a lot of subtleties to illuminate on them more which you catch onto after watching. 9-10/10Art: The artwork for Kure-nai is exceptional. The characters don\'t have super moe, over the top features and their faces all look well drawn and seriously designed to complement the nature of the series. Settings have a diverse palette with rich colours including lots of sensual reds (heck, Kure-nai translates to \'crimson\') and other exquisite tones that give it such an alluring feel. There\'s stellar use of shadows and lighting to accentuate the fantastic palette and make superb gradience. Backgrounds possess a lot of life evoked by the complements of aforementioned factors to make the mundane settings feel alive and lifelike, and then there\'s the Kuhoin manor\'s outside with a heavy atmosphere, great texture and an invigorating air to it all with the almost ethereal snow fields caressing the trees in winter and all the leaves and different things in the frame, and the Kuhoin manor itself which touts the most of those vibrant reds with a nicely stylized old Edo-esque aesthetic and all of these vivid designs to make things really pop. Kure-nai has a lot of eye candy, moreso innately with stuff like the Kuhoin manor, but nonetheless is great to look at. 10/10Animation: The animation for the series is a bit inconsistent, but has a lot of high points, evident by the fight scenes which spare no expense and don\'t use any shortcuts or stylish standalone frames, everything happens real time, non stop and right on camera. Meanwhile it can sometimes render things with kind of a \'soup-y\' quality to them, kind of melting off and not being totally clear. Episode 6 seems to have an abundance of it, but it is more for effect in that case and something of a more comedic episode. Still, at times it can look a tad awkward, like this one scene in the final episode involving Shinkuro, it\'s pretty obvious when you see it, and it comes off as a bit inadvertently comedic for an instant. Overall it still has great highs with special complements to the fight scenes for how stunning they look. 9/10Music: I\'m no expert on music, but the soundtrack for Kure-nai just sounds lovely, simply put. It further complements the stuff on screen with mesmerizing piano songs that are very romantic and captivating, like going to a ritzy, sophisticated bar or high class outing or cozying by some regal fireplace quality. Refined and relaxing, these songs total justice to the series and are great for savouring and unwinding yourself with. 10/10Enjoyment: Kure-nai is not for those with short attention spans or those who need something large scaled to happen every couple of minutes, but for myself and others who enjoy anime of a more heart warming and tender nature that\'s audacity builds gradually, Kure-nai does wonders. The dialogue had life and realism to it, the atmosphere was both enchanting and immense, the pacing was natural, the writing and plot was sharp and investing, the production values were excellent, the fight scenes were breathtaking, the composure was refined, the characters were memorable and the themes were poignant. I have no complaints, Kure-nai was a belly full for my soul. 10/10In conclusion, Kure-nai is a seductress, or a tamed lion even; it has all the looks, the composure and the atmosphere to make it a captivating creature and it has bite with its bark. Although it may not always speak loudly, when it does, it is ferocious, and when it is quiet, it is beautiful and touching. The manga can\'t hold a candle to this adaptation; it is juvenile in comparison, although I still must give thanks to the manga creators for laying the groundwork for this liberal, but far superior adaptation. Despite the anime adapting about 1/5th of the manga, it tells it with a much more resolute passion, and quantity should not take precedence over quality, nor does quantity equate to quality. The 2008 Kure-nai anime is quality. Do yourself a favour and watch it, even if you are big on crazy supernatural shonen fests, if you like a good story, give it a shot and you might get more diversity to your tastes while having the great fights to hold onto. I can\'t recommend it enough, it is an underrated anime gem and one of the greatest shonen anime of all time, and perhaps even one of the greatest anime period. heard about Kure-nai back in \'08 and read up on the premise, my tastes were too underdeveloped at the time and I dismissed it as some dull slice of life (in a laymen sense) story that wouldn\'t satisfy my adolescent male cravings for boisterous shonen action.

Episode 6 seems to have an abundance of it, but it is more for effect in that case and something of a more comedic episode. Still, at times it can look a tad awkward, like this one scene in the final episode involving Shinkuro, it\'s pretty obvious when you see it, and it comes off as a bit inadvertently comedic for an instant. Overall it still has great highs with special complements to the fight scenes for how stunning they look. 9/10Music: I\'m no expert on music, but the soundtrack for Kure-nai just sounds lovely, simply put. It further complements the stuff on screen with mesmerizing piano songs that are very romantic and captivating, like going to a ritzy, sophisticated bar or high class outing or cozying by some regal fireplace quality. Refined and relaxing, these songs total justice to the series and are great for savouring and unwinding yourself with. 10/10Enjoyment: Kure-nai is not for those with short attention spans or those who need something large scaled to happen every couple of minutes, but for myself and others who enjoy anime of a more heart warming and tender nature that\'s audacity builds gradually, Kure-nai does wonders. The dialogue had life and realism to it, the atmosphere was both enchanting and immense, the pacing was natural, the writing and plot was sharp and investing, the production values were excellent, the fight scenes were breathtaking, the composure was refined, the characters were memorable and the themes were poignant. I have no complaints, Kure-nai was a belly full for my soul. 10/10In conclusion, Kure-nai is a seductress, or a tamed lion even; it has all the looks, the composure and the atmosphere to make it a captivating creature and it has bite with its bark. Although it may not always speak loudly, when it does, it is ferocious, and when it is quiet, it is beautiful and touching. The manga can\'t hold a candle to this adaptation; it is juvenile in comparison, although I still must give thanks to the manga creators for laying the groundwork for this liberal, but far superior adaptation. Despite the anime adapting about 1/5th of the manga, it tells it with a much more resolute passion, and quantity should not take precedence over quality, nor does quantity equate to quality. The 2008 Kure-nai anime is quality. Do yourself a favour and watch it, even if you are big on crazy supernatural shonen fests, if you like a good story, give it a shot and you might get more diversity to your tastes while having the great fights to hold onto. I can\'t recommend it enough, it is an underrated anime gem and one of the greatest shonen anime of all time, and perhaps even one of the greatest anime period.', ""This anime is rather difering from the mainstrem types of stories (I.e Boy meets girl--Girl falls in love with boy--A conflict ocurrs--Conflict is solved--They live toghether happily).Story: While the concept of a guy guarding a young girl is nothing new, the way in wich the story is presented and developed is rather original.

One of the major complaints I have is what decisions the characters make. In the second half on the show, The main character's hiding place becomes compromised and he STILL decides to go back there even after knowing that it is a huge risk. Not only does it result in his friend being kidnapped, but him and his friend both become depressed as a result of this. My other major complain is that a fucking 7 year old girl kisses a high school boy on the lips. This is just absolutely repulsive and I have never cringed or been more disgusted at a screen in my entire life. If you enjoyed this scene, I think it is safe to say you are a peodphile.Now on to my minor complaints. The animation. The animation just isn't good. It's not terrible, but it isn't winning any awards. The characters look very weird during long dialogue scenes, like they are almost unnatural. The fight scenes are so bland, almost to the point it feels like you're watching some sort of fan animation on youtube that someone made on microsoft paint. Another minor complaint I have is about the person who kidnapped the main character's friend. This was the largest ass pull since Lana Rhodes pulled her fist out of Riley Reid. He was never mentioned throughout the entire first 9 episodes of the series, and didn't even appear on screen, but there he was. The main character is some sort of yakuza eliminating badass with a bone blade, but the show throws in this villain that can just shit on everyone and everything the main character can try to do. This was the worst attempt at introducing a new villain I have ever seen. The last complaint I have about the show is that int he first episode, the MC is mentioned to have won a 15 inch TV. That thing is definetely atleast 25 inches, that wasn't even close to 15 inches by far.In conclusion, this show was an absolute waste of time and I regret having watched it because I am now less of a man than I was before pressing play on episode 1 a few hours ago.

The guy reviewing the shows was downright embarrassing to listen to, I think it was probably the weird accent, but I guess he must've been pretty good if he got me to watch the show. So with pretty low expectations, I decided to give the show a try.Story: 8/10So to begin, the story was pretty original from what...I've usually seen and you may even learn something about the history of some of the darker parts of Japanese culture. You have the protagonist, Shinkurou Kurenai, a high schooler, who takes on odd-jobs for his employer, Benika Juuzawa. One day Benika brings a young girl named Murasaki Kuhouin to Shinkurou, asking him to take care of her while she is in hiding from her family. Although Shinkurou seems pretty serious about his work and agrees to the job, he doesn't fully understand how hard it is taking care of another person until he comes home from class to find Murasaki missing after her first day away from home. Without spoiling too much, the rest of the story is about the heartwarming relationship Shinkurou and his neighbors have with Murasaki. At the final stretch of the series (which to me was the most satisfying part) the show changes from a lighthearted slice of life, to a melodrama revolving around the dark past of the Kuhouin family.Art: 8/10I really appreciate how the anime uses a different style from the source manga to differentiate itself. Although I haven't read the manga myself, from what I've seen, the changes were well called for. I personally enjoyed the dark color pallet used throughout the show and I thought the character designs were great and very fitting for each of the character's personalities. I also really appreciate how Murasaki actually looked like a kid instead of a typical loli-type character (looking at you manga Murasaki).Sound: 10/10The performances were incredibly believable, especially Aoi Yuuki's performance as Murasaki. Yuuki seems to capture that immature brattiness of kids really well without making them seem too unlikable. Miyuki Sawashiro is also very talented in most of her roles and Shinkurou is no exception. The supporting cast also does very well with what little screen time they are given.The soundtrack is one of my all-time favorites in anime ever. I guarantee you that even if you don't notice it while watching, the dramatic scenes are greatly enhanced with the use of those amazing piano pieces by Ken Muramatsu. From the upbeat slice-of-life tracks to the tempo downed drama tracks, the OST has it all. To this day (at least at the time of the review) I still listen to the OST because it's that good.Character: 9/10There was not a single character I disliked, which I think is pretty amazing considering there was only 12 episodes to flesh out each one. Even if the antagonists aren't really the type you're supposed to sympathize with in this show, their motives play a crucial part to the story. Shinkurou's neighbors, Tamaki and Yamie, were the most surprising characters of the story. I don't want to spoil too much, but I think because I didn't really expect much from them, I ended up enjoying their presence and relationship with the kids a lot. A special shout-out to Benkia's assistant, Yayoi, who does a lot more than what she's asked to do.Enjoyment: 10/10I love this show with all my heart and even though it's not really smart or special in any way, I was seriously happy watching it. Although it was not long ago when I watch it, I feel a sense of nostalgia just remembering that I had. If I could erase my memories and watch it again with the same low expectations, I would. Sorry to anyone who reads this review though, your expectations might be a little higher because of me.Overall: 9/10On my official list I gave the show a 10/10, simply from the enjoyment and comparison to other shows I've watched, but if I had to rate the show in a vacuum, I'd give it a 9. It would be hard for me to recommend this show to other people simply because I can't guarantee that people will experience the same nostalgic feeling I had when watching it.

(You'd think a dangerous job like that would have decent pay, but whatever)The series mostly follows daily life, as Shinkurou learns how to deal with Murasaki, goes to school, and takes a few other jobs. While Murasaki learns about life, and how to have fun, with help from Shinkurou, and the other inhabitants of the apartments where they live.All the characters are interesting in their way, and each fits into...their part of the story well. The humour in the series is all character driven, just watching the way people (particularly young and impressionable Murasaki) act/interact, such as during the 'family' dinners the apartment dwellers have. Whether being dramatic or humerous, I never really felt the characters acted in a way that didn't make some sort of sense.Near the end, the series switches to mostly action, and it's well done, though it might not be as interesting after the character-based parts. Still, it's hard to imagine the series getting to the end any other way.The ending is open, possibly TOO open, and many will probably have a sense of annoyance at the fact. However, in all other aspects, the ending is well done, and avoids being entirely predictable.The art is generally nice, but there are times when the animation quality drops, and things get ugly, usually people's faces. Though, when combat kicks in, everything moves fluidly, and looks great.Overall, this is a good, humerous, character-driven series, with some nice action thrown in for good measure.

Now at first the only thing that came to mind was, there is something deeper afoot.  Sure enough, Kure-nai is rather shy with it's revelations and that just begs for the viewer to continue on until everything is over.  In this regard it is well executed.  As always, some of the scenes may not...make sense until it is later explained but that is to be expected of this offering.They went for a realistic approach in Kure-nai, which works well at points but sometimes results are either a victim of the uncanny valley or just plain disturbing.  Especially the a fight scene involving our protagonist and his principle's brother.  Speaking of fight scenes, though they may be brief at points, they are a visual treat thanks to the fluid animation.  What I especially liked as well was the background art.  The hues and lighting really set mood and are very well done.Sound on the other hand, could have been better handled.  The background music is satisfactory already but what I really had a gripe with were the sound effects. Physical contact sounds like they were sprung out of a can of stock sounds or out of a video game (which I must admit I feel as if I've heard them from somewhere else before but I digress).The plots is character driven and thus characterisation was given some priority as well.  Our protagonists lives charmingly mature in to real people as they live, struggle and come to grips with each other.  What is really admirable is their courage.  For our protagonist hero it is how he deals with the mistakes of youth and protagonist heroine how she stands up for her freedom.  Our supporting characters are not forgotten as well.  Each have a deeper side to them as it is slowly revealed by others or inferred from what they say and how they say it.Overall, I enjoyed Kure-nai.  The well written characters and the plot that surrounds it.  And to a lesser extent I enjoy the somewhat more realistically grounded fights.  Personal favourite scene would be the episode involving the musical, which I would describe as classy.  I'm heartily recommending this as something may not be unique to some but well executed.

Sometimes it’s easy as hell because there’s so many things I can easily point to and say, “This. This is the reason I like this show.” Other times the things that make a show good are a lot less evident and normally lead to me having to say something like, “It’s just good because.” Kure-nai is definitely one of those anime that belong in the latter category, and as hard as it may be I’ll try to justify my point.The Short Version:(+)The characters...are well rounded.(+)The art is splendid (Except the OP, I don’t even know what that was).(-)There’s not exactly much of a story.(-)The sound isn’t anything special.The Story (6/10): The set up for the story is simple, the MC is a peacekeeper of sorts and has been hired by someone to do some peacekeeping, namely acting as a bodyguard to an important child, (I made the leap in logic that she’s an heiress to one of those extremely rich and old-timey corporations or something like that) and that’s kind of it. The MC needs to protect this child and as the audience, we follow through said body-guarding and follow the characters in meeting people along the way. That, and we meet the MC’s friends for school. Up until the latter half of the show when it starts to pick up, thus becoming a bit more interesting for the action-heads among us, there are also a lot of supernatural undertones throughout the show and those undertones are the reasons why he knows one of his friends at school. Well, that and a certain *cough* that he possesses. The ending, while I understood why characters did what they did, didn’t really sit well with me. But then again I would’ve really only changed one thing. Apart from that though, it was peachy.The Characters (8/10): One of the things I can always appreciate in anime is a tight cast of characters, because that gives me time to, you know...give a fuck. If you throw 50 different characters that you’ve been telling me to follow for an entire show, I’m not going to give much of a toss if some of them die. But if the main cast consists of about 8 people and you throw them into a dire situation, then I’ll probably be biting my fingers down to the bone. With that little thing out of the way, onto the mains.Shinkurou Kurenai: The MC and not the standard archetype of protagonist.Murasaki Kuhouin: The plot device more or less and a lot stronger than I initially though.Ginko Murakami: An information broker and the less obvious love interest.Yuuno Houzuki: The more obvious love interest and the closest person to Shin.The characters are really well done considering I went into this anime expecting the bog standard archetypes for each person, ie. The Tsundere, the Childhood friend, the wimpy protagonist, and I got some of those but they put enough of a spin on them that they felt new. All that and the characters acted like people would act in some given situations.The Art & Sound (7/10) & (7/10): DON”T BE FOOLED BY THE OP! The art in this show is halfway decent, it’s fluid and kinda unique. This is one of the problems I mention at the start, I know its good I just don’t know how to put it apart from, “It’s not janky and it’s good to look at.”(For the most part) That and the characters are a lot more properly proportioned than other shows I’ve seen.The sound is alright, the voice acting across the board is well done as the voices of each person felt like they belonged to that person. The sound design and the OST however aren’t exactly much to speak of, however there is an entire half of one episode where the cast sang a beautiful choir number. That part *tick of approval*.What do you think of this anime?It’s alright to kill some time; not going to buy it though.Would you recommend this anime?Yeah if you’re looking for a show to watch after work to fill that gap between getting home from work, dinner, and going to bed, then sure, watch this show.Goodbye my brethren, see you in the next. are well rounded.(+)The art is splendid (Except the OP, I don’t even know what that was).(-)There’s not exactly much of a story.(-)The sound isn’t anything special.The Story (6/10): The set up for the story is simple, the MC is a peacekeeper of sorts and has been hired by someone to do some peacekeeping, namely acting as a bodyguard to an important child, (I made the leap in logic that she’s an heiress to one of those extremely rich and old-timey corporations or something like that) and that’s kind of it.

The Tsundere, the Childhood friend, the wimpy protagonist, and I got some of those but they put enough of a spin on them that they felt new. All that and the characters acted like people would act in some given situations.The Art & Sound (7/10) & (7/10): DON”T BE FOOLED BY THE OP! The art in this show is halfway decent, it’s fluid and kinda unique. This is one of the problems I mention at the start, I know its good I just don’t know how to put it apart from, “It’s not janky and it’s good to look at.”(For the most part) That and the characters are a lot more properly proportioned than other shows I’ve seen.The sound is alright, the voice acting across the board is well done as the voices of each person felt like they belonged to that person. The sound design and the OST however aren’t exactly much to speak of, however there is an entire half of one episode where the cast sang a beautiful choir number. That part *tick of approval*.What do you think of this anime?It’s alright to kill some time; not going to buy it though.Would you recommend this anime?Yeah if you’re looking for a show to watch after work to fill that gap between getting home from work, dinner, and going to bed, then sure, watch this show.Goodbye my brethren, see you in the next.', 'Story is between okay and good in the first half, but become literal crap in the later portion of the show. The battle system is broken. You could not tell who is stronger than who. Someone can suddenly become weaker or stronger for the convenience of the plot. Also, it can really cause some frustration with the ""I don\'t want to use my full power""-stereotype.The art is really unique for a light novel adaption and is pleasant to look at. It is similar to many late-90s anime with its toned down color scheme.There is not much to say about the music. It gives the...show an unique vibe, but can be underwhelming during emotionally intense scene.The heroine deserved a better a story to be in. She is lovable and realistic up until the last 2 episodes where she became an uninteresting typical tragedy princess trapped in a castle talking things not fitting of her age. The protagonist is good-looking but with annoying personality. Other characters are just generic.I enjoyed the show up until episode 7 with little complaint. After that, the show progress into its ""climatic"" final arc where characters\' intention make no senses.The protagonist:""I promise I will help you no matter what"" -> ""Someone is taking her away, but I don\'t want use my full power"" -> ""Nah, it is just a job given by my boss. I learnt valuable lesson from it. I will not make the same mistake again"" -> ""She need my help, let\'s go help her""Benika:The most annoying character in the show.""I trust him even though he fucked up every time and there is a 98.9125% chance that he will still fucked up""Yayoi:""I don\'t want to use my full power even though the lives of my boss, a boy and myself is at stake "" -> ""Nah, let\'s me use my full power"" show an unique vibe, but can be underwhelming during emotionally intense scene.The heroine deserved a better a story to be in.

It gets you thinking about what it would be like to live like Murasaki as well as being able to relate to what was going in terms to what society (family, tradition Etc) views as right compared to what is actually right. Its a very heartwarming story that gets you thinking. If you want something which really makes your heart tingle then this anime is for you. The fact that the two main characters are so similar yet so different makes it all the more enjoyable. This anime is highly under rated and deserves to be higher on both the...popular and top rated anime list. It has everything someone would want if they don't know what to watch.

The story itself is a bit different than any anime you would watch today. At the beginning of this I wasn't to sure but as I got 2 episodes in I realized that this was easily one of the best anime I have ever watched in my life. One of my problems though (though it wasn't a big one) was that the story didn't give you a lot about the main characters past, but that was about it for me personally speaking. I...think that everyone should give this a try I believe that most people would enjoy this. think that everyone should give this a try I believe that most people would enjoy this."", ""Meh i don't really have a straight opinion of this anime. The entire show aside from the ending was for me a solid 10. The comedy and deep story mix really well and provide a binge worthy combo for the viewer. However i can tell you this now the ending for me was over the top unsatisfying.I liked all the characters and they all worked well for the type on anime it was. There was also a good mix of action involved.I guess if you can put up with a half baked ending then give it a go, i just really wish the...ending was as good as the main show. ending was as good as the main show."", ""As many have already said, kurenai wasn't a show I was expecting to fall in love with. It looked like fairly standard anime fare from the mid-2000s, but it turned out to be much more than that.STORY: The plot of kurenai is good, but that's pretty much all you can say about it. It's dark, but also a little outlandish and goofy ( meek highschool boy has large blade in his right arm, and works for the Yakuza.) And it is very vague in the beginning. But it serves as a fine setting to hang the characters, which are the main draw of this...series.CHARACTER: The characters in kurenai are excellent. They are all 3 dimensional and complex, and seeing them interact makes this show a joy to watch. Murasaki is addorably stubborn, shinkurou is a quiet badass, yamie and tamaki are a riot, and it's all pulled together with outstanding voice acting.( Though if you've watched HXH all you'll hear is kurapika from the MC) another very admirable thing is the lack of outright fanservice. No one ever does anything out of character to pander to the viewer.ART:  The art is another area where kurenai shines. You can tell that this wasn't the highest budget production, but everyone making it wanted it to be perfect. Whether it be the beautiful character designs, gorgeous colors, lush backgrounds, or occasional burst of great sakuga. This is a good looking show, and it has aged and will continue to age very well.SOUND: not much to discuss here, the OST is alright, but not very memorable, and the sound design is fine.ENJOYMENT: This show could have been the most generic, obnoxious thing ever put to animation, but such great care was taken with the direction and execution that it ended up being fantastic. The dialogue in this show is extremely natural and fun, the comedic timing is surprisingly on point, and you'll be itching to watch the next episode.OVERALL: The only thing keeping me from giving this show a 9 is the ending, though while not terrible, nor gut wrenchingly sad, left me wanting, and slightly disappointed. I almost think I would've been happier if the story didn't really have a conclusion and just sort of ended after the slice of life stuff, but oh well.

Kure-nai does this.Kure-nai follows the brooding 16 year old orphan and martial arts expert Shinkuro Kure-nai, by day a 2nd year high school student and by night a dispute mediator. Being a dispute mediator means working for an organisation where if you have a problem and no one else can help maybe you can hire Kure-nai.Shinkuro mainly deals with low level disputes and low level criminals. After begging his boss Benika for a bigger job he his given the task of protecting Murasaki Kuhoin, the 7 year old daughter...of a minor aristocratic family who was destined to be kept as a prisoner in a guilded cage and give birth to her brothers children to keep the Kuhoin bloodline pure.Despite some some initial problems Shinkuro shows Murasaki the outside world with the help of his neighbours the student Tamaki and the swindler Yamie developing an attachment in the process.It is not a flawless anime. The main problem is that at 12 episodes it is too short. The relationship between Shinkuro and Murasaki develops too quickly. There is huge scope for this to develop overtime with Murasaki's initial bratish behaviour lasting a number of episodes instead of one. Far too quickly Murasaki adjusts to living from luxury to a small dirty apartment and sleeping on a smelly futon. The anime probably needed 24 episodes.The story itself quite good without being brilliant and not falling into the trap of total implausibility like a lot of animes do.Where it comes in to its own is the characters despite their being a harum feel to it. I can't really fault any of them. The middle episodes are really enjoyable as the anime stops being action based and more slice of life as Murasaki spends her time hanging out with Shinkuro, Tamaki, and Yamie visiting schools, university, supermarket and festivals even taking part in a musical as she learns about love and the outside world in general.There are romantic interests for Shinkuro with his sparring partner Yuuno and Ginko who collects the information for his cases (both are girls by the way), however, this is not really explored again because the series is too short.Shinkuro's boss Banika is mysterious, decisive and cares deeply for her employees but won't take crap from nobody. His colleague Yayoi thinks protecting Murasaki should be left to a more experienced person but all her complaints fall to Banika fal on deaf ears. Yayoi is quite a lonely person and is found musing on her loneliness whilst watching Shinkuro protect Murasaki. She is also shown to have a very good singing voice.The ending is very good. Its not a everybody lives happily ever after but a everybody feels more able to face the challengers life has in store for them. For Murasaki its challenging and not yielding to her families traditions and for Shinkuro realising he is not a lone in the world and being stronger for it.This really an anime you should at the very least check out. of a minor aristocratic family who was destined to be kept as a prisoner in a guilded cage and give birth to her brothers children to keep the Kuhoin bloodline pure.Despite some some initial problems Shinkuro shows Murasaki the outside world with the help of his neighbours the student Tamaki and the swindler Yamie developing an attachment in the process.It is not a flawless anime.

They incorporate the ""Harem/Romance"" side into the series, but only a very little, just enough for you to know its there in the background.Art style has this ""Gritty"" edge to it, I for one am a fan of this suited the sort of dark undercurrent this show had.Sound and Music is really good, Voices for each character were spot on. Even didn\'t mind the OP/ED Which for most i skip.My bias for this series would say its a 10, but more realistically i\'ve marked it down to 9, Its an incredible series, it won\'t be a series everyone will like but if you are a fan of Usagi Drop (Shows like that) you will love Kure Nai, Its like Usagi just Darker & Martial Arts thrown in for good measure.All i can end this with is this, there is a reason this is my only ""Favorite Series"" on my Profile, It\'s that good in my opinion. art and an experienced professional mediator with a long track record of resolving disputes, His new mission is to ""Protect"" young Murasaki Kuhoin and the story follows this mission + his bonding with Murasaki and other people involved in Kurenai\'s life.The progression is fantastic, Great to see the key characters grow as the series continues.

That being said, I feel like I was tricked into watching this.Pros: The show tackles some pretty heavy material including how to tackle problems in the family, finding yourself, child captivity, overcoming your past, and many others-The music in the series-The art (for it\'s time)-A lot of strong female character rolesCons: It\'s really hit and miss with characters (poor development and such)-The inability to tackle...the said heavy material-Nothing but female characters (the genres for the show are comedy, drama, martial arts, but the genres for the manga are much more telling with the inclusion of romance, harem, and supernatural.  I mean those are clearly visible in the show, but maybe just the opacity is set to something like 99%)-Lot\'s of dialogue that doesn\'t do anything-Throws you into the story right away and doesn\'t offer any explanations about what is anything (kind of a, ""Here\'s a new important character...Yeah."")I couldn\'t find any (and opted for, ""Heavy material"") themes because I couldn\'t find the characters.  I couldn\'t find them because I didn\'t know who, what, are why certain characters were even there.  When anything happened it was just kind of a, ""Okay,\' sort of response.

The show never played up to its strengths, I mean I was at least hoping for the relationship between Shinkurou and Murasaki to resemble that of  the MC\'s and their youngsters in Barakamon, or Darker Than Black II, but it just didn\'t feel as momentous.

However, the actual show is really impressive, particularly the art and animation.The show keeps you in the dark for these first few episodes, but the characters definitely make it worth watching. Shinkuro is refreshingly mature for his age and Murasaki is outrageously cute, not to mention 20 years wiser than the average 7 year old, but I personally like that, it continues the japanese 'tradition' of idealizing youth.The dialogue and characters are one of the best apects of the show, if you're a fan of dialogue heavy shows, you won't be diapointed.

The characters are vivid,...the setting is good. There are things that are enjoyable. In Shinkurou's character we can see how twisted his dual life is as a student ad who does odd jobs (couldn't find any other way to put it), Murasaki's character is just lovable although you may find it creepy that a 7 year old can act this mature but although having a tragic background you don't actually find it too yearning to be pitied, although you may feel a bit of pity but you just get drawn towards her, not to mention she's just too cute. Even the side characters Yamie, Tamaki, Benika and Yayoi although they lack depth, but they seem vibrant and likeable and although they may seem to lack depth and background they are just feel right in the story and they play a major part in the story.I can go on statin all the good points and I know no one has enough patience to read a long review.To sum it all up just watch it. the setting is good.

The reason/motivation a person has to wake up each day and do what they do. The little things/moments in a day that made it worth living. Most of all, it makes you consider what life would be like without them.Try imagining this – from the moment you were born, your whole life is planned out. You will have no rights. You will be kept inside for your whole life. You are not allowed to speak to others. Only material possessions will be allowed – those devoid...of emotional value and life. Now compare that to your current life. Feeling a bit more fortunate?This is the bleak reality for Murasaki Kuhoin, a 7 year old girl in the mighty Kuhoin family. Following strict traditions from centuries ago, females in the Kuhoin family and employ are forced to live in the ‘Inner Sanctuary’ for life. Her life completely manipulated for her by her cold, cruel father – she is barely a shell of a person. Until Benika, a former female security agent of the Kuhoin family, takes Murasaki from her confines and places her in the care of her apprentice – 16 year old Shinkurou Kurenai. (hence the series name) Learning his way as a ‘dispute mediator’ under Benika’s direction, Shinkurou is a person with little motivation or direction. He has more than his hands full being the protector of Murasaki. But gradually, Shinkurou and Murasaki end up bonding and filling the voids in each others’ lives.I need to point out something now before one gets too deep in – Kurenai is not an action series, so don’t go looking for action. There is a coherent plot in this story, but this is not the crux of it. This is a series that is about EVERY moment that the characters live through and what they take from it. Yes, this is an unusual emphasis, but this is where Kurenai’s strength as a series comes from. One’s patience/desire for action may hinder them from being able to appreciate this style. So be warned about this style – it won’t be for everyone. This will depend on your values and what you expect to gain from Kurenai. My advice – have no expectations. At all. Let the story do its work.Brains Base, a younger studio with titles like Kamichu and Baccano under its belt, have proven to consistently provide quality production values. This is their best effort yet. The animation is simply spellbinding. The caricature-like nature of the opening sequence is a laugh and very well done. It acts as a good foil to remind the viewer that while this is a somewhat serious series with some darker moments, you need to lighten up as well. The in-episode animation is gorgeous. Characters, backgrounds, moving objects and the like all get equal attention. The colours and line details are spot-on, making for very pleasing, fluid viewing. The faces are some of the best I’ve ever seen. To say that the quality is top-notch would be an understatement. The music in-episode is a very sedate, ambient affair that suits the series.Musically, this series does a decent job but I wouldn’t call it stellar. Both the opening and ending songs are light, bouncy songs with messages of value, everyday life and memories. In-episode music is mainly for mood purposes. The voice acting is of a very good standard. Of particular note is the ease in which the voice actors are able to properly emobdy the emotions and psyche of the character at that particular moment. One can feel Shinkurou’s confusion or his sudden passion, Murasaki’s snappy mood or her affection, the eternal bitterness of the Kuhoin head, Benika’s constant struggle and her frustration at seeing Shinkurou not reach his potential.The story is not very complex. Murasaki has been taken from the Kuhoins. The Kuhoins want her back at all costs. Benika and Shinkurou have something they have to do for Murasaki before they will let that happen. But once again, the story is not the emphasis of this series. It is on the characters. Still, the story felt like one that had enough purpose and plot within it to justify this series. The seemingly simple events like taking a bath, walking around school, playing out a musical are made to be special and meaningful because they really are. An experience that is had under freedom and that is a positive one should be valued and not taken for granted. That is one of the core messages of Kurenai. Loaded with many classic one-liners (including the funniest payout of lolicons ever [yes, Kurenai can even parody itself!]) and many gripping scenes, there is plenty to enjoy and be moved by.Kurenai’s characters are what the series live and die on. It excels with them. Shinkurou makes for a very unlikely hero. He’s somewhat strong but not very. Initially he is unable to converse well with people and lacks confidence in himself. (Considering he watched his parents die in a terrorist attack, that can be forgiven somewhat.) His female classmates intimidate him and almost act as pseudo-parents, not to mention graudally falling for him. But this is what is so interesting about the guy – he has flaws and he knows it, but he wants to be stronger. He just doesn’t quite know how. But through Murasaki’s difficult and demanding nature, Shinkurou is forced to draw upon himself to be a responsible minder for Murasaki and make her understand that the outside world is a very different place. He isn’t the most ideal/qualified minder for Murasaki – or so he thinks. His ability to see Murasaki as what she really is – a manipulated girl who wants to live live but doesn’t know how, as well as having selfish behaviour programmed into her by her family – provides Shinkurou with something he didn’t have before – motivation/raison d’etre. Everything up to this point has offered Shinkurou little reason to feel good about his life. But once Murasaki enters it, Shinkurou knows that someone has to save that little girl, which he takes upon himself. Not to mention being more grateful for the basic freedoms and choices he once took for granted. To say ‘Kid, your life isn’t over. There’s a whole world out there with so many things to experience and see. And I won’t let anyone deny you those experiences.’By the time Shinkurou reaches the end of this story, he no longer doubts himself. He interacts properly with others, he wakes up with a purpose. Most importantly, regardless of the outcome of this part of his life, he is ready to live the rest of it with passion, to cherish every moment and to enjoy the times with his friends. He is now a person that demands respect and can hold his own with anyone. His metamorphosis through the series is a real delight, for few males in anime display the true strength to be a man with dignity when needed and to be tough when needed. A perfect antidote to the mass of weak/emo male leads that plague anime today.Murasaki – what an amazing little girl. I rarely like kids but Murasaki stole my heart. Her ways with others are a mixture of insane hilarity and heart-warming moments that make for very entertaining, moving viewing. When she first enters the frame, she is a shell of a person who simply expects others to do what is necessary to maintain her empty existence. It becomes a very intense journey for Murasaki and Shinkurou to change her into someone who is respectful of others, grateful for what she has and to place true value on things. To be taken from comfortable, confined surroundings to a simple yet free environment is a major shock for her. But her inquisitive nature and the sudden jolt of feeling alive compel Murasaki to explore this strange new world that her family has continually condemned. Gradually, the girl learns how to smile, to laugh, along with a plethora of experiences and emotions she never would have experienced in her sheltered confines.As much as Shinkurou is a catalyst for Murasaki to grow and experience life, Murasaki is as much the exact same catalyst for Shinkurou. Murasaki wants to explore this world she has suddenly been exposed to but is too little and sheltered to know how. She is essentially saying ‘I want to live but I don’t know how. If you care about me, please show me how.’ Although Murasaki’s initial defiance and brat-like behaviour may mask it, she is always asking that from Shinkurou. So once Murasaki gains some form of self-empowerment and feels alive for the first time in her life, she is able to repay Shinkurou by helping him grow into what a man is supposed to be. This is the true magic of their bond. Two people who find the strength from the other to be there for each other, to grow and to develop a purpose in life. So when Murasaki reaches the end of this story, she is no longer weak, without a purpose or submissive. She is able to find strength within herself to do what only she can. Once Murasaki has played out her part, you can’t help but admire her and be amazed by how much she was able to achieve. Her ending is hardly idealistic, but it is the most appropriate. Murasaki and Shinkurou reach a point where the two are now able to rely on themselves but are forever grateful for what each of them was able to show the other, allowing them to move on and remember the other fondly. It is a bond that is quite mature and inspiring.The other parts of the cast are very solid. Benika is a very formidable woman with a scarred past of her own that fuels her to take Shinkurou under her wing and to take Murasaki into the real world, regardless of what it may cost her. Once Benika’s character is properly fleshed out, it becomes very apparent why she took Shinkurou as her pupil and her motivations to do such a daring thing as take Murasaki from the Inner Sanctuary. She has class, muscle, attitude and passion. A very capable woman worthy of respect. Yayoi, her semi-androygnous female subordinate, is a person who takes life and all aspects of it seriously, never allowing herself to enjoy it or to be happy. Initially begrudging having to watch over Shinkurou and help when needed, Yayoi begins to value the freedoms she has taken for granted once she appreciates the gravity of Murasaki’s life and is able to develop the ability to enjoy moments that make her fulfilled. Shinkurou and Yayoi develop a gradual respect for each other as they realise that thy may be able to learn from what the other has to offer, which proves to be very telling in the final part of the series.Shinkurou’s flatmates and friends make for amusing times. The grieving widow, Yamie, gains a strange satisfaction from seeing Shinkurou initially struggle then is compelled to climb out of her sorrow through her interactions with Murasaki. Tamaki, a very promiscuous female university student who neglects her studies and is overly harsh on men she gets involved with, gradually recognises her own faults from helping mind Murasaki and realises it’s not too late to turn her life around. Ginko, a clever glasses-girl, firmly keeps Shinkurou in line at school and acts as his informant, but even she would admit she actually enjoys the role. Yuno, the female classmate who actively wants to be Shinkurou’s girlfriend, provides some good laughs when coupled with Murasaki and also acts as a good way for Shinkurou to be able to communicate with females better. Renji, the head of the Kuhoins, trapped in family tradition and forever angry at himself for turning his one true love into a broken woman who lost the will to love, makes for a person that initially seems like a villian, or at the very least the ideal person to vent feelings on. But even his own demons he tries to deny will eventually be confronted through Murasaki as he is forced to consider what his own life as become as well as those he has helped destroy. His trials heavily shape the outcome but end up being more worthy of intrigue rather than hate. He is easy to criticise but that would diminish and deny the point of his role. Make sure you reserve proper judgement of Renji until the tale is done. You may be surprised as to what he ends up doing.A bit of impact may be lost on rewatch, but Kurenai is still such an enthralling series with stellar production values and a character cast that may have the most depth of any ever. Enjoyment of Kurenai is dependent on the ability to appreciate a character-driven series that values all moments equally and the interactions between people. Its unique approach and good mix of humour and reality had me captivated from start to finish.Kurenai is a very unique, refreshing series. To value moments, people and the experiences freedom brings is something no other series has accomplished to the degree this series has. With strong characters and equally strong bonds, this series will entertain, enthrall and evoke everything that is good and bad about reality. But really, isn’t the fact that we get to experience these things what is so magical about life itself? of emotional value and life. Now compare that to your current life. Feeling a bit more fortunate?This is the bleak reality for Murasaki Kuhoin, a 7 year old girl in the mighty Kuhoin family. Following strict traditions from centuries ago, females in the Kuhoin family and employ are forced to live in the ‘Inner Sanctuary’ for life. Her life completely manipulated for her by her cold, cruel father – she is barely a shell of a person. Until Benika, a former female security agent of the Kuhoin family, takes Murasaki from her confines and places her in the care of her apprentice – 16 year old Shinkurou Kurenai. (hence the series name) Learning his way as a ‘dispute mediator’ under Benika’s direction, Shinkurou is a person with little motivation or direction. He has more than his hands full being the protector of Murasaki. But gradually, Shinkurou and Murasaki end up bonding and filling the voids in each others’ lives.I need to point out something now before one gets too deep in – Kurenai is not an action series, so don’t go looking for action. There is a coherent plot in this story, but this is not the crux of it. This is a series that is about EVERY moment that the characters live through and what they take from it. Yes, this is an unusual emphasis, but this is where Kurenai’s strength as a series comes from. One’s patience/desire for action may hinder them from being able to appreciate this style. So be warned about this style – it won’t be for everyone. This will depend on your values and what you expect to gain from Kurenai. My advice – have no expectations. At all. Let the story do its work.Brains Base, a younger studio with titles like Kamichu and Baccano under its belt, have proven to consistently provide quality production values. This is their best effort yet. The animation is simply spellbinding. The caricature-like nature of the opening sequence is a laugh and very well done. It acts as a good foil to remind the viewer that while this is a somewhat serious series with some darker moments, you need to lighten up as well. The in-episode animation is gorgeous. Characters, backgrounds, moving objects and the like all get equal attention. The colours and line details are spot-on, making for very pleasing, fluid viewing. The faces are some of the best I’ve ever seen. To say that the quality is top-notch would be an understatement. The music in-episode is a very sedate, ambient affair that suits the series.Musically, this series does a decent job but I wouldn’t call it stellar. Both the opening and ending songs are light, bouncy songs with messages of value, everyday life and memories. In-episode music is mainly for mood purposes. The voice acting is of a very good standard. Of particular note is the ease in which the voice actors are able to properly emobdy the emotions and psyche of the character at that particular moment. One can feel Shinkurou’s confusion or his sudden passion, Murasaki’s snappy mood or her affection, the eternal bitterness of the Kuhoin head, Benika’s constant struggle and her frustration at seeing Shinkurou not reach his potential.The story is not very complex.

But really, isn’t the fact that we get to experience these things what is so magical about life itself?', ""This anime essentially has two core storylines. The first is the one involving Shinkarou exposing Murasaki to the outside world, her experiencing many things for the first time, and slowly growing up along side it. This also involves the many side characters in the series, though they weren't developed that much. On the other hand, there was some very strong character development in Murasaki as can be expected, but there is also some noticeable development in Shinkarou as well. Watching Murasaki was the best part of the anime as she was presented in a very interesting way, where she looked through the world with a...lot of curiosity and innocence, but had some level of wisdom and was caring and kind at heart, all of which came through very well. Strangely enough however, despite that, the relationship between the Murasaki and Shinkarou felt kind off for the entire show, especially the ending, which is related to the other story line. The other story line is related to Murasaki's family and their drama with how they want to capture her while she wants to be free, as well as the background on that related to their strange customers and Murasaki's mother. This plot line felt a lot weaker than simply watching Murasaki encounter the world. A core part of this plot line was the action, but overall the action felt quite weak, not having any depth to it, nor being flashy. Rather, I would say that it was mostly pretty dull. On top of that, while the overall plot line was somewhat interesting, it seemed to get far too melodramatic, especially towards the end. This is because while it was suggested that there may be more to the story, the anime still ends at a place that feels like a complete ending to the story, and that ending feels incredibly unsatisfying in that it separates the two, and not just not resolving key issues, but rather even acknowledging how key issues weren't resolved. Hence, I felt the story line related to the background arc was quite weak.The art and animation were pretty good and fit well but they were kind of dreary. The OP/ED had good songs. The visuals on first for the most part I got used to and liked, but the ED visuals felt weak all the way through. There was also a random different ED song for no real reason at 8 as far as I can tell.An anime that is quite good in half of what its about, but that is rather weak in the other half. lot of curiosity and innocence, but had some level of wisdom and was caring and kind at heart, all of which came through very well.

It has characters with substance, an interesting story, and the action scenes were always intriguing. I also enjoy when the watcher has no idea what is going on, and little by little we are allowed to understand what happens, sort of a mystery.It's a refreshing anime, with a different story than a lot of action animes. The only downfall Kure-nai has is an unsatisfying ending for some, it has a lot of questions at the end. Although sometimes it's fun to assume what happens in the future for them. "", ""Lets get to this;Kure-nail is a series that i hesitated to watch tbh, it was something that didn't quite appeal to me after reading the synopsis but i dove in anyway.  And let me say that I don't regret it.I think the premise was fantastic, the writing and subtlety of the story was very realistic even though some of the elements are clearly not.  And that's not a bad thing.  I was hooked pretty quick, i ran through this show savoring the potential, it becomes obvious that its one of those shows that lead you in a certain, straight forward direction and...climaxes.I thought it had all the right elements as well, blended well above average.  There's mystery, fantasy, slice of life, drama, good and interesting characters and their relationships, intrigue and the art was above average as well.  In fact they really tried to push the boundries imo in art direction.So with the positives out of the way, and minor spoilers ahead, let me say that you should definitely give it a go.  I, however, was disappointed for reasons of taste.When you build a series up to a single climax, pacing the story and pushing it towards an inevitable and yet refreshingly unknown conclusion, certain expectations will arise.  These expectations are dictated by personal preference.For me, it was a little bitter sweet.  What i wanted and what i got miserably clashed at the end.  Even throughout the show in its execution.  It was, to put it mildly, weak.The climax delivered in some ways, but failed, imo, horribly in others.  Namely how the stage was set for a violent confrontation, which occured, but ended in a very sub par, shounen-esque way.  I wanted the MC to open a can of whoop ass that would reverberate throughout the halls of the MAL community, kicking ass in a tornado of epicness.  Instead it fizzled most unexpectedly.  It almost seemed like the entirety of the earlier episodes were just wasted.  That's how it made me feel.So what's the problem?  I clearly enjoyed the ride, but was slighted at the over hyped destination.  The MC was really setup to be an ass kicking machine the moral prerogative to deliver sweet just desserts.  Instead we got an anti climactic moral which in hindsight seemed foreign to the initial trajectory.  In more spoilery terms, the reward was insufficient and laced with obscene naivety.Nothing you can say can reconcile what happens at the ill fitting end.

In some other anime's there are lots of characters that seems like they don't have their own life, just becouse they are not the main characters. i hate it, so i loved this anime for having that.

However, along the way I was extremely pissed.I am very much aware that there are lots of custom like this one since ancient times and unfortunately until now. I know very well that we should respect others’ opinions and beliefs and what they do with their lives but I really can’t understand such customs. Sometimes I genuinely can’t comprehend what’s on rich people’s mind or any other people...for that matter. This was beyond abnormal but absolutely insane. While poor people struggle to have money, rich people struggle to keep their lives so damn complicated. This is the problem with rich and powerful people they always thinks that they are so special from others and have the privilege to do pretty much everything they want and that usually within their own brethren. This is one of the reasons why I am very much thankful that I am not that rich. Setting aside the story, I know a lot of people who have the same problems and they are all rich. The truth is, rather than be mad at them I pity them most of the time. I rather work my ass off with jobs to have money than be in this insane situation. At the end of the day, the only person who was most affected was the child. Murasaki, at a very young age was so mature already because of the adults around her. She should be a child playing and doing things that children should be doing. Because of the insane minds of the adults, the child suffered so much already even though she’s very young. By the way, she’s the only character who was genuinely effective. I like how cute she can be when she’s so naïve with the outside world and this was not because she’s rich but because she was literally kept from the outside world.Anyways, regardless of that issue, there were still too much cliché in the story and main plot. A typical story about modern day damsel in distress and knight shining armor. I knew that this was a slightly romantic type of story but I felt that it was more of brother/sister love. I guess that was because of the girl’s age. Perhaps, if she was 10 years older and even with the same age difference it would’ve been more of a romance between boy and girl.It would’ve been a great anime with such potential but unfortunately rather than be entertain I was extremely pissed and disappointed with the whole thing. I believe the manga form is slightly better than the anime form. for that matter. This was beyond abnormal but absolutely insane.

Mazinkaiser,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1064/Mazinkaiser,"[""Although it would strike anyone as another childish animeIt has been actually one of my big childhood favoritesand although it doesn't pack any seriousness behind its plot or drama (if there's any) it does have its own lustrous styleMazinkaiser takes the viewer to the ultimate Mazinger Z form of robots, being an advanced form more even than the Great Mazinger, it provides amazing fight scenes and marvelous drawing, that will keep you excited and on edge throughout the whole seriesI certainly loved it, and loved how they re-introduced the beloved characters (villains or heroes) of the Mazinger Z universeIf you're a fan of Mecha anime...in general or Mazinger Z in particular you cannot miss this show, you can never go wrong when it is a Mazinkaiser show :) in general or Mazinger Z in particular you cannot miss this show, you can never go wrong when it is a Mazinkaiser show :)"", ""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSMazinkaiser exists in a liminal state between adaptation and new property: Mazinkaiser itself and a fair number of the mechanical beasts are brand-new, but veteran Mazinger fans will recognize some of the setups and structure of the series.Similar to its super robot contemporaries Shin Getter Vs Neo Getter and Getter Robo Armageddon, Mazinkaiser incorporates motifs and concepts from all iterations of the source material: if one hasn't read Mazinger Z and Great Mazinger before watching, it is more than likely that the show will feel barren. Even then, there are those that may be turned off from its almost dogmatic faithfulness...to the manga, and write it off as stagnation rather than homage. One such example can be found in the third episode, which is essentially a straight adaptation of the Gamia Q storyline from Mazinger Z. It's a faithful retelling of the story that will either bore or impress, and I fell into the latter group. I found the callbacks and homages to be more endearing than annoying, but it is a polarizing element all the same.In terms of presentation, Mazinkaiser is more than competent: the thick linework transfers Go Nagai's style seamlessly, and the animation is generally smooth. The show carries a lot of visual comedy, and all of it is well-executed. Boss Borot steals the show here, and any scene he's in is a real crowd pleaser. It's all good fun.The general sound of Mazinkaiser is outstanding. JAM Project hits the opening out of the park, the battles are conducted with some great effects, and every punch/slam/kick is incredibly impactful. Even the most mundane battles are raised to an exciting level with the sound design. As a final note, the seiyuus do an excellent job, Koji's and Boss' especially. They bring the characters to life and improve the series considerably.All in all, Mazinkaiser is an excellent translation of Mazinger Z to the modern age, while contributing to the mythos in a substantial way. It's a great watch, and I have no qualms in recommending it if you enjoy the franchise as a whole. to the manga, and write it off as stagnation rather than homage.

I'd heard a lot of good things about this seven episode OVA so I was excited to see it. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as I was led to believe. Mazinkaiser is also the name of the main giant robot in this show. It was originally created for the Super Robot Wars video games and apparently the fan reaction was so good that they decided to make an OVA series based on it. It's set in the Mazinger Z universe with the same characters as Mazinger Z. The characters are...pretty archetypal; there's the hero that solves everything with bravery and manly yelling, there's the silly comic relief character, there's the girl, there's the scientist guys that do maintenance on the robots, there's the evil nemesis that wants to destroy our heroes. Pretty basic, but it gets the job done. Anyway, Kabuto Kouji, the main good guy, finds Mazinkaiser, the ultimate unbeatable giant robot, and Dr. Hell decides that he must destroy Mazinkaiser because....he's the antagonist and he feels like it. The problem with the show is that there doesn't seem to be any overarching plot. Each episode stands alone. The last episode was actually really cool but it isn't worth watching six average episodes to get there. The art is based on Go Nagai's original designs so it has an old-school style, which I like. The animation changes style from episode to episode. The first one is done with cels, some are done with real thick lines, and some are just done with computers. The sound is nice. All the sound effects are fitting, you can hear the robots stomp as they walk around and the laser blasts are good. And it has an awesome opening done by JAM Project. I'm more disappointed than anything else. Mazinkaiser had everything going for it, but it still turned out mediocre. pretty archetypal; there's the hero that solves everything with bravery and manly yelling, there's the silly comic relief character, there's the girl, there's the scientist guys that do maintenance on the robots, there's the evil nemesis that wants to destroy our heroes.

While not a high profile crime occurs a mystery does happen and Conan sets out to solve it along with help from Heiji. The story was strong and fun. It was nice to see the gang work on a case that did not involve a corpse or anything along those lines. Struck me as more of a funny story that was meant to cause a few laughs.The art and music are typical of Detective Conan. Nothing super flashy happened but all in all both were solid.Due to this having so many characters in it was...hard to see any development. More of the characters just have fun and being in an environment that is not overly stressful.I liked this story overall. I thought the twists were fun and just enjoyed seeing a more normal day in the life of Conan. hard to see any development.
