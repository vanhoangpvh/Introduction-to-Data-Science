Nurarihyon no Mago OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15959/Nurarihyon_no_Mago_OVA,"[""The past isn't always easy to deal with. In fact, I doubt anyone in this world has ever had a perfect past, where there's no pain. Whether it's physical ore emotional, the past is something we sometimes look back and reexamine certain events; to see how it was played out and what to make of it.Nurarihyon no Mago OVA are two special episodes produced by the animation studio, Studio DEEN to give viewers a look at a blast from the past. In general, it explores some history of a main character and what he's been going through. It's not easy considering there's a secret and...one that may change his outlook on others forever. Hence, begins a special presentation at our very special Rihan Nura, the second supreme commander and son of Nurarihyon and Youhime.The OVA contains both sadness and comedy, mixed together in a little package of two episodes. For the humorous side, there is the onsen which spells out the fan-service part. In a typical manner, there's the skin-ship and accidental glazes. However, it shifts to a more serious mood later on with doses of the past. As stated from the synopsis, there is a secret and one particular woman has the knowledge of it. When we look back into the past, there's that certain feeling of realizing the revelation and how to take it in. For Rihan Nura, there's a feeling of both shock and anger at the revelation. It's not surprising considering what he has already gone through. In fact, his reaction easily allows viewers to visualize what he has been holding in his mind all this time. It's a mixed package of all type of emotions for him.For Nura clan though, there's even more than meets the eye (literally as one of character from the first episode gets a freezing surprise to it). The past of Nurarihyon is indeed something fans may wonder about and luckily enough, the concept is touched up in these two episodes.Other factors in the OVA still uses themes from the original series. Many of the supporting characters makes their cameos (some more noticeable than others) while there's also the presence of the yokai. They are presented in the same way as supernatural beings. More importantly though, the OVA explores more of a particular character, a snowy yuki-ona whom is given a special task to accomplish. It's humorous to watch especially with what she is instructed to do but at the same time, it's Setsura who wants the best for her.There's still action in these episode especially in the later half although not as well presented as I had anticipated. More so though, there's questions that I originally had but never seemed to got answers to. Among other factors, the artwork remains consistent enough with the original series. Nothing's really changed and that sense of mixture of historical/fantasy themes are still within the episodes. The soundtrack/OST of this is not very noticeable with the follow up of rock like music near the endings. However, there's still a sense of nostologia. It's been years now since the original series have made it on screen and season 3 is still a question in some fan's minds. Well, paint me curious but I'm hoping for a bright future to this series for a wrap up, just like for the clan of Nura. one that may change his outlook on others forever.

And I love knowing what happened in the past too. And my, that little tsurara is so cute. And hey, who would have thought Natto was the first lol hahahaHaving the three of the Nura generation in 1 frame is just too good to watch. And hey, how could I forget Rihan's love for Otome. My! I want a man like him!!!!But I'm really curious who's Tsurara's father though. Also, the grandpa is one sleek one, it would be great to see more of him and the Princess Yo's life together <3 ""]"
One Punch Man Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31772/One_Punch_Man_Specials,"[""This is just a honest review from a regular anime watcher so if your looking a detailed one its not the right place. To begin with if you're looking for action, like in the main story, it's not the right place to search. I agree That these special series are worth watching and are funny, but its definitely lacks the entertainment which the main story was packed with.Would I recommend to watch it ? Definitely.Will you have fun while watching it ? It depends on your expectations, but I'll say that it's worth spending your time.So all in all 7/10. "", ""(EDITED VERSION;)OPM specials don't fall short on comedy compared to the main series. I dare to say the specials have even better comedy and humour than OPM itself.In the specials we follow the people around Saitama. Genos, Sonic, Bang (later on the whole S class). As 6/6 episodes have aired, we have gotten some quality comedy with especially Genos. I loved episode 3's parody on Ginga Densetsu Weed (the huntsman and Akakabuto, the one-eyed king of the mountains).As the specials main focus is more on comedy we only get to see the people around Saitama in all kinds of conflicts less than fighting monsters....The animation quality is great and super as in the main series also.I love how the people around Saitama always over-analyze things, especially Genos and Sonic. They are the best comedians of the show and bring so much to the series. Especially in last episode the whole (well, almost) S class was given screen time. Oh boy was that a treat!As OPM had great, absolutely awesome music, the specials don't fall too short with it's catchy ending song. The OPM march song is super since it has the specials lyrics sung by, for example in ep 3, Sonic. We also get glimpses of other side characters who have yet to be on screen in the specials (Tornado & Mumen Rider[lol Mumen Rider only played part in the ending song but what evs]).I thoroughly enjoy these specials. These are a great follow-up to the main series. These specials might yet to be the best ones I've seen so far.Story: 8Art: 8Sound: 9Characters: 10Enjoyment: 10Overall: 9 The animation quality is great and super as in the main series also.I love how the people around Saitama always over-analyze things, especially Genos and Sonic.

I don't know if it's just a product of the sometimes awkwardly translated subs these are coming out with, but I found the humour overall in these to be a bit drab.OPM specials feel like an episodic slice-of-life comedy.  Let me clarify by saying that's about as far from my genre of choice as it gets, but I also feel it's far from the appeal of what OPM's mainline series was too.While the art stays true to the original series, there's rarely a chance for Madhouse to really shiny when...there's little to no action in the specials at all, and when there is it's nothing nearly as bombastic as the mainline series. It's above average at best, unmemorable at worst. It does give you some interesting insight into the lives of all the main characters, and that's the main reason I find it worth watching.If you're a fan of OPM because of its unique blend of comedy, action, interesting characters, and occasional tug at your heart strings, then the specials simply don't have every ingredient. It's cake without the icing, but at 12 minutes an episode it at least doesn't overstay its welcome. there's little to no action in the specials at all, and when there is it's nothing nearly as bombastic as the mainline series.

Soundtrack of this specials are so funny and relaxing, animation and very good fluidity as ever...by Madhouse by Madhouse"", ""The One Punch Man Specials are exactly what one expects, but doesn't always get from a series' extras.  Each is an amusing side story not interesting or relevant enough for the main series.  That might sound like an indictment, but the dozen One Punch Man episodes were of very high quality and heavily storyline-driven.The specials aren't up to that level, but are they still exciting and funny?  Damn straight they are!Each episode focuses on a different character with the exception of the final one, which follows a gathering of the Hero Association and Kid Emperor's attempts to solve...a murder mystery.  There aren't any big fights between two powerful combatants in these specials, but there is still plenty of fast-paced action.  Impressively, the humor is as good as anything in the main series.As an additional bonus, the ending theme is usually sung by the character the episode is focused on.  Thus, the first episode's ending is a song by Saitama, the second by Genos, and the third by Sonic.  Sadly, the lone exception is episode four, which focuses on Bang, but is a repeat of the first episode's theme. I guess the elderly voice actor didn't feel like singing against the aspiring pop stars and idols that make up One Punch Man's younger voice cast!Some of the other elements of the main series are present here.  The last episode's murder mystery is an excellent parody of Detective Conan.  And there is even a poignancy to the story of Fubuki in episode 5, constantly overshadowed by her far more powerful older sister Tatsumaki.Fans of One Punch Man will absolutely enjoy this bonus, which is ultimately the point. a murder mystery.

How you ask?, lets find out!(Shorter review for shorter series)Story: 6/fairThe snippets of the universe that we see in these vignettes are slightly better with plot in each than of the original. Between observing more in-depth studies of side characters, as well as accepting more comedy as a whole, the story of these short stories of the One Punch world come together to form something great. Including side tales of Sonic, Tornado, and even more of the top S-class, these nice...stories culminate into a neat, tight package for any fan.Art: 7/goodA little smaller on the innovative side of the spectrum, The Specials don\'t include much of the manga influence- mostly caused by fewer action scenes- and stays with the refined cg. This does not hinder on the quality of the show at all, as we still enjoy the nice shots of these characters and the smooth feel of the animation.Sound: 7/goodOpting out of including the opener was an alright adjustment for these stories, and I got used to it fairly quickly. However this also means the show was lacking it\'s usual death metal/slayer music feel for more quiet somber melodramatic tones. The closer did improve though, and I enjoyed the ""One Punch Marching Song"" very highly.Character: 8/very goodSome how with less time, these narrations gave me more about each side character than the original show had. I learned more about my favorites like Sonic and Genos slightly. I even grew warmer to Saitama with his little spar against Sliver Fang a.k.a Bang. We got more laughs out of them as well, and I enjoyed there charm even more. The only thing lacking was more time to elaborate on these changes!Enjoyment: 9/greatThese specials not only made me appreciate them over the original, but completed my love of the principal presentation. Without these leaflets, I may not have grown to love the anime\'s quirkiness as much as I do now.

Although it sure as hell isn't enough to satisfy the 4 years that we've waited for the 2nd season of an amazingly over hyped but worth it series. This is very surprising considering how much the manga got praised how well the guy did with this and mob psycho.

I'd say they're a must watch for fans of the show and do a lot to enhance the experience.You won't get a lot of big set pieces or huge choreographed fight scenes here, but that's not to say there's zero action. For what there is...the animation is still pretty good considering these are just shorts tacked on as a DVD bonus. They could have totally phoned it in with these but I swear it looks better in some places than a lot of season 2. (We'll get to that in my review of that season, oh boy.)Each episode focuses on one of the characters or the group of characters introduced in whatever episode it was supposed to air between. I think roughly once every other episode of the main show. They're all cool little mini stories about those characters and do a lot to make you like some side characters you might not have cared about otherwise.

Firstly, the story is so ridiculously melodramatic, convenient and just plain old unbelievable.In fact, so much of it is redundant. Ooh, to spice things up a bit, rather than just having all the passive gay guys get victimised, let them get victimised by relatives of and friends of and co-workers of their lovers! Everyone loves infidelity!Just it makes no sense, since we all know they won't cheat since they're SUCH GOOD GUYS....So then, what was the point of even including that in the plot?!The art is still dirt poor as always. Ugliest gay guys I ever saw, I thought gay dudes were supposed to be fabulous? These weren't. And the sound is still lame. The theme songs are awful.Characters, ha! Only a bunch of immature, horny bastards who cannot understand the concept of love but understand the concept of butt secks very well. They don't grow, change, develop. In fact, they spend so much time wallowing in angst and self-pity and jealously that it's a wonder that they're not all thirteen years old.Then again, only thirteen year olds would watch this.

He just came off as indifferent and  whatever-ish to me Like he was already taking the relationship for granted like they already fell into some routine or something.Too bad there isn't a third season. I think it would be just as much of a success as the first two."", 'Junjou Romantica. My first introduction to Yaoi.I was linked this by a friend, and at first turned my nose up at it, thinking it would be all dirt and guy on guy love. But, as I got further into the episodes, I found myself hooked; yearning for more seasons of this outstanding anime.The compelling and heart wrenching story-lines are intricately woven throughout the comedy, which had me rolling on the floor laughing.This stunner of an Anime really is worth the watch, and will have you laughing one minute; crying the next. ', '******this is a spoiler free******-Edited on 27/6/2021 (some grammar mistakes)-IS THIS EVEN PG 13?-Too many Usagi X MisakiStory: 7/10It\'s split into 3 different couples. But they are somehow being linked to each other (relationship). Well in season 1 they juz started like: "" Hey! There\'s NO WAY I\'m gonna love a guy"" but in season 2 they eventually accept each other. In season 2 the plot is being carried on. Like the couples having arguments then get back again. Well this is normal in ""romance"" anime duh XD. All i can say is that if you enjoy this genre of anime you will...probably like this too haha.Art: 6/10V SHAPED FACE . Did they all go for plastic surgery? LOL. The legs are way TOO slim even for a guy haha then the body is big. And the hairstyle is kind of weird. The eyes are too big for guys in Misaki\'s case. They are kinda funny if you think properly hahaha. But since this is an old anime i complain too much hahaSound:7/10The opening song is not bad it is not really like the rock type but rather calming it fits this anime.I REALLY wondered WHY 90% of the shounen ai or yaoi anime have very good songs? Seriously like WHY? And they are sung by guys as well hahaCharacter:6/10Each couple there\'s like an S and M (top and bottom). What pisses me off is that Misaki always says that he ""don\'t love"" Usagi but then he always give in . Just like when Misaki is angry then Usagi kissed him then he accepted it instead of rejecting it. Duh same goes for other couples . I like terrorist the most as its just cute and sweet.Enjoyment:8/10This anime have WAY TOO MANY awkward moments . I am really hiding my face or turning down the volume. But i do enjoy it (some). 1 thing I really like in this anime is that there\'s many LOVE TRIANGLE and I really love it ^^In fact in most shounen ai and yaoi anime or manga there\'s love triangle . It is special as its NOT harem i simply enjoy them :)Overall:7/10Overall it\'s a sweet ""shounen ai"" anime though there\'s no such coincidence in this world.

This series is too adorable. I like Misaki and Akihiko the most and don't really care much for the side cast. Season 2 does better in showing the best duo MxA. It has very sweet, goofy, and sad moments, a great mix of all three and is worth the watch.Akihiko's family is very childish but they offer growth and acknowledgement of Misaki's true feelings. I wish they would show Misaki seeking out affection more, but I understand why his character doesn't (and Akihiko is always offering anyways, so...).But yeah, really cute anime. "", 'I have never had a huge desire to watch or read yaoi or BL before.  But while looking for an anime to watch I came across Junjou and thought the artwork was good and the story sounded good.  Yeah I didn\'t get a yaoi vibe at all, not sure why but anyway.I was a little lost since I watched season 2 before 1 but it was cute and funny so I kept watching.  The story and characters really pulled me in and by the end of the second episode I was searching for where I could watch season one.  I had...such absolute fun watching this and there were so many times I found myself tearing up or feeling so utterly embarrassed for the characters.I am so happy that this was my welcome to the wonderful world of yaoi and BL because I could not think of one better, well exception being Sekaiichi Hatsukoi.  I would suggest this for anyone who wants to broaden their anime genre horizons.  You will not be disappointed.  The only problem might be you will find yourself searching out more and more yaoi and BL anime and manga like me.Junjou is on  my ""need a pick me up"" list of anime and manga now such absolute fun watching this and there were so many times I found myself tearing up or feeling so utterly embarrassed for the characters.I am so happy that this was my welcome to the wonderful world of yaoi and BL because I could not think of one better, well exception being Sekaiichi Hatsukoi.

Either that, or you're like me-- you like to watch every anime you start to completion, and you just wanted to see what you're in for. Regardless of what brought you here, I'm going to give it to you straight-- if you're here after liking the first season or liking shows akin to the first season of this anime, then you're definitely in the right place. This anime is for you. I can't say that this season is the same level as season one, but it...caters to all of the same tastes.Let's start off by talking plot. Last time around, I mentioned in my review that this anime had very little plot. Well, seems that the anime gods heard me (or I asked for the same thing that everyone else wanted, seeing as I'm writing this years after the show aired, haha!) and added more than just makeouts and smutty scenes to this season. However, to people who like the other couples more than they like Akihiko and Misaki, I have to apologize-- our main couple completely hogs the spotlight this time around. The others are barely even in it other than for an episode or two, and even then, they just domestic troubles opposed to the smutty goodness I suppose most of the viewers want. Not being particularly what one would classify as a fujioshi, I was actually surprised that they managed to make their semblance of plot into a sexual undertone anyways. It's kinda cheap-- they use predictable elements and just make complicated love triangles and sexual assault-y situations for fan service, really. But this isn't a completely negative review!! Stick around. :)As for the art, I can say that it has improved. It's by no means good art, but it's much better than the first season. A lot of things still seem lazy about it, and all the human forms look really unnatural and creepy, but at least they don't look like somebody drew them with their eyes closed anymore. It's slightly more refined, basically.I still have a problem with the background music being too cheery while rape is essentially happening, but other than that, I think they did a pretty good job with it. Again, the OP was pretty good, but I found the closing pretty boring. The voice actors were forgettable, but nobody was especially grating, so it's not a big deal.The characters got a lot better. I appreciate that they recognized what was happening was rape. Was I bothered Misaki fell in love with his rapist? Yes. Do I still think Akihiko is hot? Unfortunately, yes, even as much as I hate myself for it. There was significant development in the characters of the other two couples, but Misaki and Akihiko remained kinda consistently flat. The introduction of Aki's family did help the situation, but it seemed forced to me either way.I know this entire time it sounds like I'm insulting the show, but in the end, I really enjoyed it too. And I hate myself for enjoying it. It has events and romances that are unhealthy, abusive, and unrealistic, but as much as I go off harping about all the bad things about this show, it's become a guilty pleasure. So make your own decision-- can you live with yourself after liking something against pretty much all of your values and beliefs about consent? Can you like with something that fetishizes and makes pretty much soft porn out of a an entire sexuality? After answering these questions, I think you can take a go at this. :)I would recommend this if you: liked the first season, like Misaki and Akihiko, like love triangles/boy magnet ukesI would NOT recommend this if you: didn't like the first season, like the other couples better than our main, don't like love trianglesHave a great day everyone! caters to all of the same tastes.Let's start off by talking plot.

To draw good anime you have to be a good psychologist, both in terms of narrative and characteral plastic design.Even if this expresionism come as a trait characteristic of this genre, i can whitout a doubt say that in this anime is an outstanding characteristic. "", ""*I'm not a big fan of manga so I know I've watched a good anime after I plan to read it's manga where the anime left off just to get more of the story.I watched Jonjou Romantica and Jonjou Romantica Season 2 a bit differently. According to the couples, I watched the Romantica episodes first, then the Terrorist, following by the Egoist episodes. For me, it made the stories easier to follow and that much more enjoyable. I loved being able to recognize a conection between the 3 couples such as Miaski purchasing flowers from the Egoist couple's Nowaki. The first time I started watching...Jonjou Romantica(season 1) I loved the Romantica couple but when they started pulling these other couples out of know where I became disinterested and the idea of skiping around didn't occor to me. I eventually gave the series another try and I'm very glad I did.I was pretty skeptical for this being my first time watching a Yaoi but I think I enjoyed it as much as I would or maybe more any other anime. I easily really got attatched to each couple which is probally why I liked it so much. Regardless of how unsightly a plot can be if there are good characters it cancels it out. Although it wasn't nessisarily the case here. There was a probally in mostly every episode which usually tugged at my heart and be kindly resolved at the end which I'm greatful for, if I care about the character I need a happy ending.If you aren't ecspecially tollerent with this show like I was, you'll probally dislike how each couple basicly has the similar sort of same problems/plot but for me, I was okay with it. What I wasn't okay with is how annoying some of the tsundere were, always denying how they felt and pushing the one they love away with their always angry faces, geez. In the case, the character development must've been was REALLY good so it made up for it. Even the tsundere were still characters I loved characters.The art; Eh, my only complaint about it is that most of the characters looked too much alike which might turn someone off from this anime because of getting confused. But each character was drawn very good looking, I must say. I liked the way they potrayed the comedy scenes as well.I even took me a long time to get through one episode because of how many scenes I kept replaying.

For some reason, even though I know all the characters would never cheat on each other (because they are...so cheesily in love with each other), everytime some problem is presented my jaws clench, my heart stops, and I find myself watching and not blinking until it is resolved, no matter how many episodes it takes. I watched this season in one sitting and I hadn't even realized how long i'd been watching. Everything the story lacks is made up by the characters.

(some light spoilers in the character section).Art - While the art is pretty simple, and sometimes their proportions are off, I think the characters are really cute, and the females are adorable too.Sound - uhh, well the Japanese dubbing is good. I love Usami/Usagi's voice. And the opening themes are pretty good.Characters - I found all of them really enjoyable, especially Usagi and Misaki, though they both have their flaws. Nearly every main character and side character is enjoyable...to watch, though. If you haven't seen any seasons of this show, skip the rest of this part.............. Anyone who's watched at least one season knows how Usagi is quite forceful about his affection to Misaki. I see how this is sketchy, but remember this attitude is really popular in this genre for some reason, maybe stemming from the idea that women have fantasies about take-charge men? (and the genre is generally written for females) idk..........but we know it's not okay in real life. If it bothers you too much, you probably didn't finish season 1. We also know Misaki does like him and said himself that he'd try harder to stop him if he didn't actually want it. This is also gets annoying on HIS part, though, how often he acts like he doesn't like him. But they're still both adorable, especially Usagi's romantic side. Nowaki and Hiroki always seem to have their frustrating problems, but they're still enjoyable, too.Enjoyment - This series is hilarious and super freaking cute (and sometimes steamy) if you like romance and anime boys being together. I personally find the drama enjoyable too because I like some angst in my shows, and I don't expect it to be super realistic, since it's fiction. Anyways, all in all I found this series really fun to watch so far. The story may not be genius or super realistic, but it's still good, cute, and funny. 8/10.

It also shows how he got his outfit and a couple of other interesting things.Art and Animation (8/10) Very Good...The Art and Animation for this stand alone is very good it looks just as good as the other episodes. The isn't anything high budget related taking place in this episode and barely any fights are even seen so barely anything high maintenance on the animation side of things where shown in the episode but like I said it looks identical to the other 12 episodes when nothing super crazy is happening so that fine by me.Sound (8/10) Very GoodSame thing with this section everything sound very good, Opening and Ending are present no really differences between this and the 12 episodes everything is very good here too.Characters (8/10) Very GoodThis episode revolves around Saitama mostly and secondly his friend who creates the icon One Punch Man outfit for him. His character is very good as we see his struggles of keeping his store afloat good character development for the old geezer as he *SPOILER* ends up giving in to his age and the times for retirement.Enjoyment (7/10) GoodObviously the highest enjoyments when it comes to the series One Punch Man are the over the top and hype moments the series brings to the table, after that enjoyment lays on to the comedy aspect and then the actual story. So since this is based on Saitama before he went bald all the hype hype moments are really present for the episode. As for comedy there are a few funny moments in the episode but nothing that made me laugh my ass off like the other episodes. And so we are down to story and learning about what Saitama had to go through to get to where he his as far as his outfit and where he's living is interesting and enjoying enough to an extent for one episode.Overall (7/10) GoodMore Specifically (7.50/10)This was a good episode you can definitely consider this a flashback episodes which now these days aren't really liked around here but it was good for what it was. Nothing too crazy and amazing but more on the funny/informational side of things when it came to One Punch man this is a good watch if you want to just know more about Saitama.

The story takes place in Z-City, where a group of thugs calling themselves Niya Niya Loans are forcing local businesses to close their doors when they can no longer afford ""insurance"" that Niya is offering them. Saitama becomes involved whenever his tailor, located in the now nearly abandoned shopping district in Z-City, informs him of the situation.This is a standalone arc that offers some brief insight into Saitama and his humble beginnings. There isn\'t nearly as much action in this OVA compared to the actual series,...but the comedic moments are still present and the overall atmosphere of the One-Punch Man universe is well intact.

The second best thing about this OVA. There's also a great punchline that reminds you of the series' highlights. Other than that, this OVA is closer to the worst episodes of One Punch ManWe don't have people running around, screaming and flexing their muscles. Praising a show for a lack of things doesn't get you anywhere though. That's like praising a show for not having plot holes, or for not being racist.The story is pointless. We learn how Saitama gets his suit, and there's no satirical bite to how ridiculous heroes customes are. Saitama being appalled at a...samurai custome is just one joke. The story is actually about going to beat up a bad guy who's an asshole because he's an asshole.If that sounds like every other One Punch Man episode, that's because it is. The difference between this OVA and the series is that Saitama has no characters to interact with. The series' strength was that it gave the characters other traits than being powerful. Saitama is entertaining also because of his casual view of things, how he doesn't pretend to be anything else than a hobbyist.Without Genos to play off from, he doesn't do much but beat up people. Our antagonist is as boring as they get. You think a series that wants to be wild and crazy would have interesting visual ideas. The antagonist is a dude with a fish-head and a BDSM outfit. This is less exciting than you think.The world of fiction is full of quirky villains who end up more popular than the heroes. One Punch Man always failed in that department, and this OVA relies on the eventual conflict. Aside from seeing Saitama with hair and one punchline, this OVA has no reason to exist. samurai custome is just one joke.

Our antagonist is as boring as they get. You think a series that wants to be wild and crazy would have interesting visual ideas. The antagonist is a dude with a fish-head and a BDSM outfit. This is less exciting than you think.The world of fiction is full of quirky villains who end up more popular than the heroes. One Punch Man always failed in that department, and this OVA relies on the eventual conflict. Aside from seeing Saitama with hair and one punchline, this OVA has no reason to exist."", ""*This review was removed since I forgot to add the spoilers introduction, I will now re post it, but view it at your own discretion since it contains key info for this OVA*One Punch Man is an anime that took it's popularity rising like a storm, and many fans claim it's literally saving anime. Here we have an OVA which has all the essence of the main series.This OVA contains Saitama telling a story to Genos about the origins of his superhero suit and how important it is to him.At the start we can see Saitama, who still has hair in a jogging outfit defeating...an evildoer on the streets, but slightly ripping his pants during the act, thus requiring the help of a sewer to fix them! This is where all the OVA unfolds, the sewer is in a pinch due to requesting money from Niya Niya Loans, and they will take his shop, but Saitama decides to intervene or who else would fix his ripped clothes?Saitama is given the directions of Niya Niya Loans hideout, which is actually his own condominium, he then knocks on different doors and floors to seek out the boss of Niya Niya Loans, but only to find more and more evildoers, that's why the rent of the place was so cheap. He then finally locates him, and the boss transforms into a type of sado-maso fish who gets promptly defeated after ripping slightly Saitama's clothes.Saitama get's kicked out of the condominium for ruining the landlord income, but he gets the superhero suit we see him use in the main series.All in all, this OVA was decent, it has literally everything the main series has, except for the one punch KO, I got to point out that I somewhat disliked the fact that the OP and ED from the main series was added into the OVA, for the simple reason that I believe it doesn't fit there, if you enjoyed the current on-going main series, you will enjoy this as well. an evildoer on the streets, but slightly ripping his pants during the act, thus requiring the help of a sewer to fix them!

Framed around his money troubles and ending with him receiving the iconic yellow jumpsuit, Saitama confronts several silly villains throughout. However, there is a scarcity of action, and the OVA relies primarily on its humor. This is a contrast to the regular series, which provides a more balanced mix of fights and comedy. Here, if one...doesn\'t laugh, he won\'t like the OVA, as there is precious else.Personally, I did laugh and there was enough enjoyment to call this a solid, worthwhile work.

There was no cool new discoveries about this world OPM is in, no real threat to much. It was just really meh.Even the the usually on point humor of One Punch just didn't strike as much of a cord as usual.The OVA was fine and still OPM, but I can't...really see why it is rated so high outside of OPM hype really see why it is rated so high outside of OPM hype"", ""Overall I give it a 6/10Road To Hero covers one important aspect of the main character Saitama's backstory that I'm sure many fans were interested in learning about.

Let's take a look.(Shorter review for shorter series)Story:  6/fairLanding in the realm of a snippet that could have been used in the specials, this segment of Saitama's backstory does give us the relish we craved that the original series skimped on, and for that...I thank it. But for it to be included as a whole separate package makes no sense. Of course the story is more important when it pertains to the overall course of events in the show, but through observing the length and quality of the spectacle, it still harkened the poignant decision of if this vignette would have existed better within the specials own confined space. Why was this one snippet of backstory so important? And why didn't they make it longer and include more exposition? These major inquires were not fully answered and it left me wanting more from Saitama's past.Art: 8/very goodRoad to hero does include more manga influence than The Specials, but it doesn't exactly win you over. With a fraction of time spent to that degree of artistry, the viewer becomes conflicted and yearns for more, but is cut down based on time constraints. The animation also lacks on bigger action sequences, but this is justified based on the setting. It still includes that great smooth feel that the show is known for, without skimping out on the sfx department.Sound: 8/very goodI rated the sound portion of Road to Hero the same as the original, mostly because they are mixed with the same music and have the same original opener and closer. For more on my opinion, check out my review of One Punch Man.Character: 7/goodRoad to Hero lands somewhere in the middle of the of afore mentioned series predating it based solely on character. In Road to Hero we begin to see a more light-hearted yet mature side to Saitama before he gains his comeuppance when he grows stronger. We do see a funnier side of him here as well, without muddling around to much with other matters. Even the shop keeper's part is played very well and seriously. The only reason this category does not rank higher is only because of how short the presentation is. If this OVA's running time was increased to a slightly longer degree- maybe a little over 45 minutes- then this section of the show would have ranked much higher.Enjoyment: 7/goodRoad to Hero lands majorly in the medium space between the 2 previous entries.

If you like me, loved the first season and have had high hopes for the sequel, you are in for a disappointment. You can totally ignore it and be fine. But if you like softcore yuri stuff and get excitement from watching cute girls then you can watch it."", ""If you're here reading this then I will assume you had at least a passing affection for the first season of New Game and will try focusing on what is different from the first season. I will be giving my overall opinion too so if you want to skip straight to the second season of the show for some reason I will try presenting the anime as best as I can.Right from the title the second season of New Game!! let's you know it means bussiness because it now has two exclamation points! Everything is going to be more intense! Drama, action, game development, furious...blushing! You're in for a ride now!Or perhaps it's just going to be more of the same with a few extra bits and bobs to change up the pace and make for an even better season than the previous one.New Game's second outing is extremely similar to its first, so if you liked last year's season you are probably going to enjoy this one too. That being said there are several changes, some for the better, some for the weirder which make this season just a little bit better.Right off the bat the anime shows us that it's grown up by throwing some mild fanservice our way. The first few episodes of the new series are full of either hardcore lesbian bait or shots of characters in cute and/or revealing outfits. It seems like a lot of experimenting went into these first episodes figuring out what identity this season is going to have, particularly since the main new changes have yet to be implemented. It had to differentiate itself somehow for the time being so the writers opted to go for some fanservice which at times flows well enough into what is happening while at other times is just shoved straight in your face (I'm looking at you Cowoba!). I don't particularly mind these scenes, but I will concede the fact that they are not very fitting of a „Cute Girls Doing Cute Things” show like this.Some of the more minor changes in that are perhaps worth bringing up before moving onto the main course include shifting character dynamics. The returning cast is shaken up a bit by changes in management at Eagle Jump and must adapt to their new jobs. This makes it so that while the main casts personalities start off largely the same they do show some change as the season progresses, making it feel less like a rehash. The first season had some character progression too, mostly for Aoba, but this time the anime tries to give each character, or pair of characters, a chance in the spotlight to either further develop them or give them more screen time than they had in the first season. In fact, the latter half of this season is quite fond of giving almost entire episodes to characters besides Aoba, Hifumi and Yagami who ate up most of the screentime last season.In terms of the plot we also get to see a game being made from scratch all designed and programmed by the characters we came to know and love. Because of this the anime does manage to establish a better connection to the overarching goal of the season and gives you more incentive to care. You want Aoba and the gang to succeed in making a good game because you've seen how hard they worked on even just coming up with ideas for it. However, as with the vast majority of Slice-of-Life shows focusing on an all female cast the plot is secondary here. The added depth is welcome, but it's nothing major and it doesn't need to be.Arguably the biggest change to this season is the understandable and somewhat necessary addition of two new characters. I say understandable because the show needed to drastically shake itself up somehow to keep itself fresh and adding to the main cast is a good way to do that. Combine this with the previously mentioned changes and more focus on previously sidelined characters and this second season of New Game decently fresh.The two newbies we get are Momiji the stone-faced and competitive artist and Narumi the prim and proper programmer. They largely fit into the already existing cast well and with both being students looking for a future hire after studies they bring a competitive air into the show and actually manage to create a little bit of discord between themselves and some of the other characters. I feel like this is where people may have a bit of an issue, up until now things have mostly been rose coloured with only the occasional tense moment which never really came from friction between characters. And here we get introduced two new characters whose first order of business is getting way too serious about their job. I can see how that might ruin the overall relaxing atmosphere of the show, but I personally didn't mind it at all.Speaking of breaks in the rose coloured world of the show: season two manages to create some genuinely touching moments of character development, specifically between Yagami and Aoba though much of the crew get at least small moments like this. These scenes aren't anything ground-breaking, but they do their job well and one scene around the middle of the anime and one at the very end actually manged to get me emotional with an intensity I never thought the show was capable of.Now mind you scenes like that are very few and far between and the anime will never compete with the likes of, say, Clannad, but again it was a nice change of pace and they were well executed.The returning cast of the show also goes through some changes, some more than others. For example, Hifumi is put in charge of the team making her have to get over her fear of talking to people, Ahagon gets trainees which shows us a caring side of here we didn't really get to see before and Hajime gets a job designing mini-games where we get to see her being her usual self – I suppose she didn't really change. In fact, with the focus being shifted away from just the character team to the overall production team some characters are left in the dust which is kind of weird considering that they do get an adequate amount of screen time. The writers just don't seem to know what to do with them, Yun and Hajime are a good example of this. They both get segments of episodes dedicated entirely to them as they did previously, but curiously they stay largely unchanged for the show while everyone around seems to be moving on. Even weirder is how disconnected they feel from the rest of the cast in hindsight. They don't really interact in any meaningful way or change much of anything. They have their same old gags and side-stories that they had before.I suppose with a cast as large as this something's got to give. Though overall I feel like the show did a good job sprucing things up, adding new elements and changing the old that new season didn't feel like a total repeat of the first which considering the overarching plot it absolutely could have.The anime makes no effort distinguishing itself in the art or sound departament though. The art is style the same ultra-colourful, ultra-bright style that could blind you if you stared at it too long. It's generally pleasant to watch however, and doesn't have that many, if any, inconsistencies or faults. It does it's job at being a cute and fluffy Slice-of-Life show really nicely.Now would be a good time to also mention the dub which is relatively well acted, with the exception of maybe the game director Hazuki, though I can't help but feel some roles were horribly miscast. English dubs aren't the best when it comes to moe, mostly due to the lower pitch of western women so when you hear a character who had a relatively high pitched voice in Japanese have a lower voice or other characters who sound like they have entirely different personalities it can be a bit jarring. A couple of the faces and personalities just don't mesh with the voice coming out of their mouths (But maybe you want to listen to the dub just to hear Aocchi mispronounced as Ouchie which was just hilarious).All in all New Game's second season is what a sequel to this kind of show should be. It keeps much the same formula, but changes enough so that it doesn't feel like you're watching the first season again. It's a good effort, and one which could be met with a bit of resistance to the sheer amount of change happening, what with the first season being rather stale. I definitely enjoyed my time with New Game!! and would obviously recommend watching it if you liked the first season even a little bit. Maybe all the changes will make you like this season even more. And I did joke about how only weirdos would watch the second season first, and while that is still true, I also feel like this is self-contained enough that if you wanted to just watch this then you could though I would not recommend it. blushing!

What I want to say is that they don’t forget to have fun while doing a job with a huge responsibility for them and the others around them.Who wants to see a stiff old geezer working for  a company that makes games? That would ruin all the atmosphere for this anime and the final product(game) would be plain. You need to have a innovative mind and some crazy personality to come up with entertaining ideas for the game which in the end it’s all purpose is to have fun.

Season 2 uses all the details from season 1 and manages to grow Nenechi as a programmer and Hifumi who finally manages to solve her social interaction problems.Although it has a serious atmosphere Season 2 doesn’t forget to provide enjoyment and with the introduction of two new characters the light-hearted  comedy is guaranteed. You know the saying “The more the merrier” , those two characters have a huge influence on the development of our old ones and with their  vivid and adorable personalities they paint the anime with the color of “excitement”.Despite all the comedy and enjoyment New Game also shows how much detailed work, patience, investments  and staff is needed for a game to be released . The cute and silly stuff is used to make it  easier for the audience who isn’t familiar with the environment regarding a game company to understand it’s basic concepts starting from the programming team , character design team and finally to the debug team . Everyone has a important role and what matters is to work as a team and enjoy afterwards the fruits of their labor and not forget the most important factor in making a game :To have FUN!New Game is an anime that encourages the viewers to pursue their dreams , to work hard and not choose the easy path , the determination , time , patience and loved poured in doing something you love doing  and finally the feeling that you get from the fruits of your own labor.

NG!! starts strong, but halfway through, when the two new characters are introduced, it tanks hard. Everything becomes more serious, more dramatic, and less fun to watch.It\'s the same trap 90% of comedies fall into: they start with hilarious jokes and great vibes, but then halfway through the small seeps turn into gushing floods of needless melodrama that overwhelmingly destroy the lightheartedness. I thought the first series was incredible because it\'s so rare to maintain cheery atmosphere without being sunk by crap; NG!! fails in this regard.The two...new main characters are total bitches. I knew from the start that they would have their ""reasons"" for being bitchy, and they did come at the very end, but for 4-5 episodes the two of them dragged every scene down with their negative attitudes. It completely spoiled what made NG! a fantastic experience. Not to mention, the final episode is a complete drama-dump of feels, and while I did believe it was genuine (and it was written fine), it just completely ruined the entire second series.The tone shift from series one to series two was a huge mistake. new main characters are total bitches.

There is another character that was technically introduced in the finale of the first season, Christina Wako Yamato voiced by Kaori Nazuka, one of the Producers for Eagle Jump, but she gets less screentime compared to Momiji and Tsubame in this season and she's briefly looked at, mainly because she's sisters with Shizuku Hazuki. At first LA thought Momiji was going to be the annoying rival to Aoba and was gonna thoroughly teach Aoba a lesson in being a character designer, instead LA was surprised that Tsubame was the one who did this and to Nene at that, though LA understood WHY she was acting up like that to Nene (as she got an internship with Eagle Jump through her contacts aka Aoba to become a debugger where Tsubame worked diligently and as hard as possible without her family's help) but nonetheless her attitude was by the most part unacceptable, thankfully she got her comeuppance with Nene helping her which resolved the matter, both of Tsubame's failings and patching things up with Nene.Now the restructure of the character design team definitely helped many of the main cast in this season, mainly Hifumi, Aoba and Kou as a result of this. Hifumi for LA was a character LA ignored in the first season due to her shy demeanor and odd but interesting way of communication she had, here in the second season however with Hifumi now the de-facto leader of the character designer team, she was interacting with her peers more and communicating in general thus she got better and increased her screentime as a result of this and hey she even got a few good quirks that aided in some of her more funnier comedic skits in the anime. Aoba became lead character designer for the new game which was named PECO in which caused some strife with Kou because of this and saw that not only that Aoba was growing as a character designer but also showed that Kou wasn't the perfect character designer we hoped she was and this lead to both of them having actually some good drama because of this and again helped these two grow further form their limits as characters. We do get into more insight to Yun and Hajime in one episode but LA thinks that was enough as their placing wasn't changed due to the restructure. Now Nene is quite interesting and as you would have guessed from what LA aforementioned about Nene helping Tsubame, Nene getting an internship working at Eagle Jump was good character growth for Nene as not only did she actually got to help Aoba with a game she created through character designs but she grew as a character through having her own hardships as a debugger and programmer and her own work drama in the form of Tsubame and her work in general and heck it has a flow on effect to Umiko as she's essentially become Kou but for the programmer team and opening up to her interns and members of her group. Seriously this second season did not let up on it's character development and growth of it's already quirky cast of characters. LA is gonna leave the best character til last as she becomes important in the finale.The animation done once again by Doga Kobo was expected moe from them, with the typical art style of character designs from the first season and the same 3D CGI work used on the in-game character designs. It's the same vibrant atmosphere and the typical comedic moments and inflections it has in it's animation. If it's ain't broke, don't fix it is what the animation is for the second season's animation really.The voice acting was decent and even the new voice actors of Momiji and Tsubame voiced by Arisa Suzuki and Hitomi Ohwada were great additions to the anime voice cast. But LA having watched the dub of the first season of New Game!, LA thinks it's wise to add in what LA thought of the dub of New Game! here as the majority of the core cast would be reprising their roles in this second season. LA will say this here and now but this dub by Funimation doesn't have the problem of doing moe horribly, this mainly comes in the form of Megan Shipman as Aoba, Jill Harris as Hifumi and most definitely Kristen McGuire as Rin who was on par with her Japanese counterpart Ai Kayano. Some problems arose for LA when it came to certain voices however, in this case, Tia Ballard as Hajime as they gave her a too masculine and too thick accent to go with Hajime, LA gets the masculine part as Hajime is like that but did Tia had to make her accenting thick? Leah Clark as Yun was given NO regal accenting when that was exactly her character archetype instead given her a typical normal voice but the character voice that irked LA the most was Michelle Rojas as Kou and LA says this because LA utterly loves Kou Yagami as a character in this anime that LA needs to talk about her dub voice. Michelle Rojas' take on Kou was that although at times she did her interpretation of Kou well especially in the more comedic parts, Michelle had tendencies to come off as TOO abrasive as Kou, where in Yoko Hikasa's case, she had the balance of nowhere near as being abrasive yet snarky when she needed to and Michelle Rojas just didn't get that balance right. LA still loves this Funimation dub without a doubt even if Michelle Rojas and Tia Ballard irked LA. Ohh and if you thought LA would be annoyed by Bryn Apprill's voice acting for Nene, well no, as her inflections and mimicking Madoka Asahina's vocals  and character mannerisms were almost exact thus more commendable as a matter of fact.So the finale and about Kou, well it was a tearjerking finale LA but it was definitely a well done finale nonetheless and again gave Kou growth as a character as well as Aoba by the end of it and was a nice farewell to New Game!! in more than one way. This finale essentially gave opportunities for the whole cast to evolve from Kou's decision not only through character interactions but through their work in Eagle Jump for them to strive for more and this finale did a great job at relaying such as message to the cast albeit in a tear jerking way god damn it!.New Game!!'s second season maybe the same thing as the first season, but made this second season worth while watching through it's character growth, integrating new characters with new conflicts for them, giving genuine drama with it's main cast as well as it's new characters. New Game!! did not disappoint and with a strong...tearjerking finale to boot. form of Momiji Mochizuki voiced by Arisa Suzuki a character designer who has a friendly rivalry with Aoba and has almost the same aspirations as Aoba and looking up to Kou and Tsubame Narumi voiced by Hitomi Ohwada, Momoji's best friend and a programmer. There is another character that was technically introduced in the finale of the first season, Christina Wako Yamato voiced by Kaori Nazuka, one of the Producers for Eagle Jump, but she gets less screentime compared to Momiji and Tsubame in this season and she's briefly looked at, mainly because she's sisters with Shizuku Hazuki. At first LA thought Momiji was going to be the annoying rival to Aoba and was gonna thoroughly teach Aoba a lesson in being a character designer, instead LA was surprised that Tsubame was the one who did this and to Nene at that, though LA understood WHY she was acting up like that to Nene (as she got an internship with Eagle Jump through her contacts aka Aoba to become a debugger where Tsubame worked diligently and as hard as possible without her family's help) but nonetheless her attitude was by the most part unacceptable, thankfully she got her comeuppance with Nene helping her which resolved the matter, both of Tsubame's failings and patching things up with Nene.Now the restructure of the character design team definitely helped many of the main cast in this season, mainly Hifumi, Aoba and Kou as a result of this. Hifumi for LA was a character LA ignored in the first season due to her shy demeanor and odd but interesting way of communication she had, here in the second season however with Hifumi now the de-facto leader of the character designer team, she was interacting with her peers more and communicating in general thus she got better and increased her screentime as a result of this and hey she even got a few good quirks that aided in some of her more funnier comedic skits in the anime. Aoba became lead character designer for the new game which was named PECO in which caused some strife with Kou because of this and saw that not only that Aoba was growing as a character designer but also showed that Kou wasn't the perfect character designer we hoped she was and this lead to both of them having actually some good drama because of this and again helped these two grow further form their limits as characters. We do get into more insight to Yun and Hajime in one episode but LA thinks that was enough as their placing wasn't changed due to the restructure. Now Nene is quite interesting and as you would have guessed from what LA aforementioned about Nene helping Tsubame, Nene getting an internship working at Eagle Jump was good character growth for Nene as not only did she actually got to help Aoba with a game she created through character designs but she grew as a character through having her own hardships as a debugger and programmer and her own work drama in the form of Tsubame and her work in general and heck it has a flow on effect to Umiko as she's essentially become Kou but for the programmer team and opening up to her interns and members of her group. Seriously this second season did not let up on it's character development and growth of it's already quirky cast of characters. LA is gonna leave the best character til last as she becomes important in the finale.The animation done once again by Doga Kobo was expected moe from them, with the typical art style of character designs from the first season and the same 3D CGI work used on the in-game character designs. It's the same vibrant atmosphere and the typical comedic moments and inflections it has in it's animation. If it's ain't broke, don't fix it is what the animation is for the second season's animation really.The voice acting was decent and even the new voice actors of Momiji and Tsubame voiced by Arisa Suzuki and Hitomi Ohwada were great additions to the anime voice cast. But LA having watched the dub of the first season of New Game!, LA thinks it's wise to add in what LA thought of the dub of New Game! here as the majority of the core cast would be reprising their roles in this second season. LA will say this here and now but this dub by Funimation doesn't have the problem of doing moe horribly, this mainly comes in the form of Megan Shipman as Aoba, Jill Harris as Hifumi and most definitely Kristen McGuire as Rin who was on par with her Japanese counterpart Ai Kayano. Some problems arose for LA when it came to certain voices however, in this case, Tia Ballard as Hajime as they gave her a too masculine and too thick accent to go with Hajime, LA gets the masculine part as Hajime is like that but did Tia had to make her accenting thick? Leah Clark as Yun was given NO regal accenting when that was exactly her character archetype instead given her a typical normal voice but the character voice that irked LA the most was Michelle Rojas as Kou and LA says this because LA utterly loves Kou Yagami as a character in this anime that LA needs to talk about her dub voice. Michelle Rojas' take on Kou was that although at times she did her interpretation of Kou well especially in the more comedic parts, Michelle had tendencies to come off as TOO abrasive as Kou, where in Yoko Hikasa's case, she had the balance of nowhere near as being abrasive yet snarky when she needed to and Michelle Rojas just didn't get that balance right. LA still loves this Funimation dub without a doubt even if Michelle Rojas and Tia Ballard irked LA. Ohh and if you thought LA would be annoyed by Bryn Apprill's voice acting for Nene, well no, as her inflections and mimicking Madoka Asahina's vocals  and character mannerisms were almost exact thus more commendable as a matter of fact.So the finale and about Kou, well it was a tearjerking finale LA but it was definitely a well done finale nonetheless and again gave Kou growth as a character as well as Aoba by the end of it and was a nice farewell to New Game!! in more than one way.

lot,I could see a tremendous change when comparing season 1 and 2 and it\'s more meaningful,life-encouraging and realistic.-The intense game-making environmentAt first,I thought this would be a pretty poor idea for putting a serious environment into a tittle that should be relaxing,yet I was totally wrong about that.After I have looked for more episodes,I feel this show is more realistic,since New Game season 2 has given us a feeling of working in a game company.You would be in charge of character designing in a limited time,feeling...lack of ideas and hopeless,all the stress and pressure that you would be received from a job environment.The word ""realism"" plays an important role in New Game season 2.-Teamwork and EncouragementDon\'t forget at your back,you\'ll have a group of teammates,who are willing to help your working process and give you new ideas.When you are hopeless,there\'ll be people encourage you.Even when Aoba and Yagami are in rivalry,friendship walk first and they\'ll help each other.Ideas couldn\'t be think off,if there is only one person,it\'ll be better if there\'re more people to help.The word ""Friendship"" also plays a large role in New game season 2.These are parts that season 1 doesn\'t show off,yet season 2 improves a lot and take the game development to the heat.Speaking of the story messages,it fulfils all my expectations that a game-making anime should have and it definitely spot on.-Character inner feelingsCharacters inner feelings are also a main reason why you should watch season 2.Other than the detailed story,he new season has deepened the description of characters.When Aoba is trying to give out ideas when her model is being turned into 3D,she feel herself is useless as she is totally inexperienced in it,while others are joining into the discussion.But even Aoba knows she is inexperienced,she is willing to learn and doesn\'t give up or relying on others.As you can see,the elements of story also connect to the characters perfectly.Thats why season 2 is more eye-catching than season 1.For those who wants to know more about game-making environment and a life-encouraging story,this new season should fit you the most,yet what season 2 is lacking of is the hilarious moment,if season 2 is trying to add more funny moments to the story,this will be flawless and impeccable.Last but not least,the animation in this show is pretty promising,it keeps the ""kawaii"" environment and the diversity of animation backgrounds from season 1,which would probably satisfy most of the fans.However,the usage of soundtracks is still not very notable,because in most of the time,voice acting covers the background soundtrack,causing less enjoyable and a more silent environment.Fortunately,op and ed are pretty relaxing,sound effects in op and ed are pretty cool and fits the anime properly,so it isn\'t too bad in general.Summary:+More tends to characters and seriousness+Story become more consistent+Continues

of gaming grill nerds dedicating its entire runtime to making games combined with various antics in the office cause quirkiness is a staple for this kind of show to keep things interesting.  To no one’s surprise, we got a sequel.  So…how’s the sequel, I guess is the question.  (Missed opportunity not calling it ‘New Game+’.)Story:Now finished with their current project, we return back to Eagle Jump one year later from Aoba starting as a character designer for the company as we continue viewing the lives of the women who work at the...company.  Now with an expected new game rearing its head on the horizon, the team buckles down again for another round of game development.As expected, the story for New Game!! (now with two exclamation marks) is something of a rehashed storyline cause in a moe show dedicated to game development, you don’t really have much variation to go off of from the base plot.  So really what you saw in season one is gonna be done again in season two, but done in a slightly different manner, with that ‘slightly different manner’ being a new duo of characters, a new game (how fitting), and a myriad of littered sidestories to make the overall product something more than just ‘a show in the moe genre’.The small sidestories added development to give the show a little bit more to work with in terms of how to use its runtime, as several sections of the show is devoted to showing how characters have grown, small bouts/tension moments to give the show a bit of a serious atmosphere, and resulting change to make the relationships between these girls more meaningful.  The problem here however is how little the show attempts to facilitate and keep those things in the foreground.  Sure the moments they’re presented in are important, but the lack of time investment to make it something more than what’s on the tin is rather disappointing cause there was actually a good amount of tonal shifts to be more serious in order to instigate change among its cast members, yet they didn’t really pack the kind of punch that made the subsequent changes anything largely substantial.  It’s cute and all, but if you’re going for serious, really shooting for that angle helps.In the end, New Game!! is a harmless sequel to a show whose potential was limited from the get go.  Its attempts to be serious are vastly overshadowed by its naturally fluffy nature, and was an aspect that would’ve added a lot to the show had it not been so focused at showing the cute girls doing cute girl things.  I will agree the ending was impactful enough to make up for some of what the show lacked, but not enough I feel to really make up for what else the show had.Overview:+ Attempts to be interesting+ Surprisingly good end–  Largely the same showCharacters:The cast is…largely the same as season one.  In terms of shift, the two more prominent character designers, Aoba and Ko, receive a decent amount of the show’s attention by providing an overarching narrative for how the new game they’re developing is going.  This in turn gives average growth of character to Aoba as she becomes more comfortable in both the work environment, and in the creative space.  As far as Ko goes, the show treats her with a weird imbalance, as for a majority of the show she’s something of a character on the side, before becoming the main focus RIGHT at the very end.  It was handled well enough to be a good plot point, but didn’t have enough impact I feel to really be enormously substantial.By contrast, the rest of the ‘main cast’ of girls get specialized time focused to them, imbalanced with the rest of the story by more or less by only giving attention to them once before shoving them to the side so they can do more cute girl things.  Hifumi, Yun, and Hajime all get this treatment, and I find it disappointing cause there was potential to do something significant with them.In terms of new cast members, the show provides a heaping handful of development to its new additions Momo and Narumi, as well as giving Nene time in the spotlight as a more explored character.  While the show did devote attention to its older cast members, practically all of the latter screentime is focused on these three in some way or another.  As such, a majority of the show’s attempted serious/tonal shift moments happen here, and it’s here where the problems with season two become clear.  The show really tries to build up all three of these characters to have higher stakes to prove themselves and make them more significant.  Yet in spite of that, they just don’t seem that severe.  Their stories, problems, and flaws are practically written out and/or are resolved within the episode, cutting away any and all of the tension pre-established in the scene.  Ultimately, the arguments or problems seem kind of petty, and not really that fun to watch due to its naturally predictable nature.Overview:+ Development for its cast–  Most of the development is rather quick and/or not impactfulArt:Produced by Doga Koba, the art for New Game!! retains the company’s standard bright and shiny visual style with a light color palette in order to emulate the show’s naturally carefree and happy nature.  As such, the visuals look cute, have very few dark colors added to it, and is overall standard fare for the company’s track record since nothing about the show’s artwork really has any outstanding or super clearly pretty moments added to it.Sound:Similarly, the soundtrack is a remarkable average that has few memorable qualities about itself that make it truly unique or have a special quality about it.  The show’s OP “STEP by STEP UP↑↑↑↑“, and its two EDs “JUMPin’ JUMP UP!!!!” and “Yumeiro Compass” are all sung by the seiyuus of the four main girls: Aoba, Hajime, Hifumi, and Yun, with each song sounding strikingly similar to each other with the show’s OP and first ED sounding almost like the same song.Admittedly, the second ED has a more mellow tone to it with less energy to its other counterparts, but overall, the soundtrack is surprisingly samey, and overall just doesn’t have anything about itself to be a memorable piece.  They’re fine and do what they’re intended to do, but that doesn’t stop the songs from being quite generic.Overview:+ Ok songs–  Entire soundtrack is quite sameyPersonal Enjoyment:Honestly, New Game!! is a show I didn’t really care for much.  Moe fluff is moe fluff, and after watching so many, I feel quite jaded by the repetitiveness and overuse of certain tropes in the medium.  New Game!! was sadly no different.  Sure it gets props for at least attempting to be serious and having a setting that not many other shows can say they’e done, but that doesn’t save it from the fact that a majority of what it has in its screentime is devoted to your typical cute anime girl stuff, and most serious tonal shifts are swept under the broom due to their easily solved nature.What did I like about this anime?As much as I’ve complained about it, I’m happy the show tried to do something different for itself, even though most of it didn’t work out in the end.  Sure the glimmer of hope that there would be development usually vanished in thin air a couple minutes after the plot was kickstarted, but it at least had development, and again, had a really nice and impactful ending relatively speaking.What didn’t I like about this anime?Momo.  She just feels like a lazy character because her motivations during her introduction just didn’t seem interesting at all.  The whole ‘claiming rivalry’ thing is just stupid to me.  Also not enough stuff about Hifumi and Sojiro.  Not putting in more scenes about a girl and her pet hedgehog is a crying shame.Would I recommend this show?As a piece of moe fluff…I guess it’s alright.  It’s got at least something going for it, so if you liked the first season or want to watch a half decent moe show, New Game’s a decent starting place. company.

It's about Aoba and her coworkers working on a bear fantasy video game. A lot of new characters that werent on season 1 are introduced in this second season. These new characters were great and I was a fan. There were a lot of fun moments throughout that made me laugh but this anime also had a lot of sad moments and drama. This anime did a great job being a roller coaster ride of emotions. If you liked the first season of new game I 100% recommend this 2nd season, you will enjoy it. "", ""*Please note I watched both the first and second seasons in succession so there may be crossover in this review*Upon first glance, my assumption was for this to be a moe centered anime, profiting from cute girls, thus I didn't watch the first season when it came out. Seeing that it got a second season, I presumed there must be more to it and decided to give it a watch. My assumption was wrong. This anime really hit home with me, a brilliant artstyle which personally I don't think I've seen elsewhere, lovable characters with a strong sense of character development and an engaging, exciting...and at times emotional storyline.Story- 9The story centres around a 18/19 year old character designer named Aoba Suzukaze at a games company, working under her idol Kou Yagami. The story was engaging and interesting, yet easy to follow, going on an idea that as far as I am aware is untapped in the creation of video games, New Game!! managed to balance a serious story, with hints of slapstick comedy and romance.Art- 10I am personally a big fan of the artstyle used in New Game!! the main highlight being the eyes, which admittedly are what made me initially assume the anime would focus on being moe, because lets be honest, they're frickin cute. But that isn't the sole feature, the visuals were fantastic throughout the series, the realistic game promos and artwork within the games, everything was exceptional.Sound- 8I thought that the music for this anime was great, nothing stand out, but catchy tunes and well thought out BGMs, helping to set the mood of different scenes.Character- 9The main feature in terms of characters was the addition of 2 new characters, whom initially I didn't like, upon first impressions the new characters seem callous and as though they may disrupt the existing calm environment, however as with the other characters of the show, these 2 characters develop with time and become very much lovable. We get to see the ups and downs of each character, demonstrating emotional instabilities and understanding and showing how different situations effect different characters helping to humanise them, and help the viewer relate. A personal favourite part of this for me, is showing how severe Hifumi's social anxiety is at the beginning of the first season, and being able to see visibile progress across each episode as she begins to open up as a character. And they did manage to get the moe in, all of the characters are cute girls, the hints of fan service that are pretty much essential in this generation of anime, such as Kou's panties, Hifumi's cosplay and any bath or shower scenes, were made in ways to keep from making them the centre of attention, making them whimsical to the story and not having any lewdness to keep the innocent slice of life feel to the show.Enjoyment- 10This has been one of my best watches in a long time, I thoroughly enjoyed watching the series and may go back and watch it dubbed too, the overall experience tugged at my heartstrings and although the ending satisfied me, I can't help but want another season.Overall- 9In summary, the New Game! series is great, I would definitely recommend it.*This is my first ever review so constructive feedback would be appreciated rather than flame* and at times emotional storyline.Story- 9The story centres around a 18/19 year old character designer named Aoba Suzukaze at a games company, working under her idol Kou Yagami.

And they did manage to get the moe in, all of the characters are cute girls, the hints of fan service that are pretty much essential in this generation of anime, such as Kou's panties, Hifumi's cosplay and any bath or shower scenes, were made in ways to keep from making them the centre of attention, making them whimsical to the story and not having any lewdness to keep the innocent slice of life feel to the show.Enjoyment- 10This has been one of my best watches in a long time, I thoroughly enjoyed watching the series and may go back and watch it dubbed too, the overall experience tugged at my heartstrings and although the ending satisfied me, I can't help but want another season.Overall- 9In summary, the New Game! series is great, I would definitely recommend it.*This is my first ever review so constructive feedback would be appreciated rather than flame*"", ""Hmmm, where do we start?It's basically the same vibe as the first season, but this time with new characters, and more yuri senses tingling lol...Imo, the new characters were quite a turn-off, completely irrelevant to the whole series. I think the season would have been 100% fine without the addition of new characters. Fortunately, towards the end they resolve the itching that the new characters produce, but I still wasn't very fond of them.On a side note... what kind of dark character is Aoba!? Like... chopping up sentient beings to use them as skins, and then cannibalism? Dang, she's something different, that's for...sure... sure..."", 'New Game!! is the 2nd season of the New Game! series. When I first watched New game! last year, I was really motivated. The anime was really good and it helped me a lot when I used to be a game developer. The second season of this series is even better; it has a lot of improvement over the first season.While the first season focuses on comedy and some problems that game designers have while developing a game, the second season shows more of these things and focuses more on the problems that game developers and programmers have while working on a project. One more...big improvement that the second season has is, the developing in the drama part of the anime. The second season shows a clear improvement over the first season.The second season of the anime hit me right in the heart. It might not be the same situation for all people. However, for me, as I used to be a game developer, the anime hit me really hard.

Same great cast, back again.This is just a continuation of the first season, they are all back for their next project. In terms of development, characters haven't necessarily matured, but some have found new positions in the company and so need to take on new roles and responsibilities. But this is generally the same as the first as I have said.The art is just as Moe' and colourful, if not even brighter than before.If you haven't seen the first season of this...series would definitely say to watch it. No real difference but would add a bit more depth and history to the characters and how they interact with one another. Otherwise you could actually just start with this season and pick up or at least understand what is going on.Overall would say 8/10 *(As of episode 5) It is just a nice chill, wind down anime. Easy to watch and digest. usually the same 2 halves each episode. 1 minor task or story and then another part of the day. before you know it, Ed is rolling through. series would definitely say to watch it.

This anime in particular delves deep into friendships, hardships, relationships, and ""ships"", but with also a slight spice of the fanservice that fans quite asked for after the first season\'s hype.In this new season the characters were portrayed in a much balanced manner than with the first season which almost totally deals with Suzukaze Aoba, the main heroine, and her difficulties and developments at work. Now we get to see more of the other characters\' sides which mainly...includes two new characters and Yagami Ko\'s character development.For those with a slight hatred or sadness or boredom for their jobs, New Game!! puts you in a likable bind in which you will find bliss. One of the best parts about this anime is that you will get to see that there is so much more to your jobs than those being something you do everyday repeatedly just because you need them to make a living. If that is the case, I\'d call subjective relativism, but personally, I believe that New Game!! is more than just that―happiness and contentedness with one\'s job served on a platter―no, it is not that. Realistically speaking, the company the characters are working in and their workplace environment seems almost impossible, BUT that is not the focus of the series. Ultimately, I think that New Game!! is REALLY for those people (the target audience) who are lonely at work; those people who are suffering mentally; those people who are just at work for the sake of money. There are many more possibilities.In a sense, New Game!! might be a new take on ""curing"" depression from work. It might not be enough, but for the sake of those suffering, I suggest you people watch this series. Watch the entirety of it, know the characters, know their feelings, and know their resolve and confidence, it really helps A LOT.I recommend this jewel in the rough not to just those lost, but also to everyone looking for a good time. The happiness and passion in this series is just oozing, and that may lead to an ultimate inspiration (just like how I was touched by this series that actually lead me to write a review).My verdict: 9 out of 10PS: Not enough Hifumi in this sequel!

Best thing about is is pacing. It's perfect. Both seasons. No silly situation was stretched trough the entire episode like in stupid sitcoms. You laugh at them, not feeling cringy.Characters. Sure, it's just cute girls doing cute things, but god, they are ALIVE, I lived lives of everyone of them. They grow, they change, they live a live. It's the thing you expect from this genre, and...yet it surprised me so much. Also, besides living, they love. It's the love without kisses and words. Purest love possible. It's so good.Season 2 was extremely good, and it's even better when tied together with season one (standalone, it's ~8, but together they make strong 10). I love how it's started just like season one, just to bamboozle viewers (and cut this joke after few minutes, because stretching it would be stupid, but, as I said, pacing is perfect). At first I was little skeptical about two new characters in season two, but they integrated just fine, and they also were somewhat interesting in the end, but for me, both of them are just step stones for Nene and Aoba.I recommend anime this to everyone, who want extremely kind, pure (but with bit of fan service in form of panties), and not so silly story to rush trough because it's so good. yet it surprised me so much.

Throughout New Game!! I found the majority of the cast from the first season far more interesting and fun to watch than those two in particular. The second season also felt more story-driven. By this I am not referring to a more serious tone, but rather a direction outside of office itself.On a...disappointing note this season didn't produce as many high points and memorable moments as the first season did, but it is still enjoyable overall. On a positive note this change in direction allowed the friendships of some characters to further develop.I have no clue whether a 3rd season is in the cards, but if it is I eagerly anticipate its release. disappointing note this season didn't produce as many high points and memorable moments as the first season did, but it is still enjoyable overall.

Especially when the topic is related to boring reality -- working.First off, I just want to state that New Game II took a slightly different direction, one filled more with co-worker interaction and goodness of fit rather than individual struggles and the need to finish your projects before those dreadful deadlines.Nevertheless, the key elements that made New Game what it is can still be seen throughout the episodes. That occasional comedic moment. That serious moment of stress. The cute moe characters. The innocence of the Original Four. And of course, can't forget...about the memorable pervy boss, our fav shippings and the lazy cat meowing around.This shows that there was a progression in the timeline where Aoba lives in. An advancement. Different times for different plotline and the course of this anime did an excellent job.※ STRENGTH ※- Strong character development. Everyone has or should have a goal.

Whether it may be needing to improving yourself to be the best you can be or finding yourself a role model you can follow. I felt that I took away something from this anime and can apply it towards my life. And animes who do this are a big plus.※ WEAKNESS ※- Less screen time for your favorite characters.

This is a brief review just to go over some points as I carry on.This comedy and slice of life anime, is different from many other that fall into the same or similar category in a very good way.When I finished season 1 of New Game last year, I realized how it was no ordinary like the other comedic, slice of life anime series; it felt so special to me that I went to make my current account for myanimelist only to give it a score of 10. I was wishing New Game would get recognized by many anime...fans, and was hoping for a second season to be released soon after.Well... season two came, and I'm so glad many people recognized this anime to be very good and gave it high scores and good reviews.So what makes this anime special to be appreciated?New Game series has its outstanding elements such as the character design, being so charming and the colorful art, which together help to create a truly amazing atmosphere that fits so well with this kind of anime.The animation is fluid and the voice acting was fitting with the characters. This anime is peaceful and bright that watching it at any given time or in whatever mood, it would make you relax and enjoy at ease.New Game season 2 mainly talks about cute girls working on a new game just like the first season; however, there were somethings made me a little irritated; like when Aoba was distressed to the point she was crying because Ko was a little frustrated in the heat of the moment..?! OK that's cute. But WHAT?!! The reactions in these dramatic moments/situations were too much, making them so unrealistic and you couldn't relate to.The workplace also lost its solid atmosphere compared to the prequel, and I wish the characters' expressions weren't too obvious so that we are left out to dig in and discover their deep feelings for ourselves a bit.In the end, I enjoyed watching season 2. But in my opinion season 1 was far better than this one. I give this a 9/10 because it's special to me, otherwise it's an 8/10 compared to its amazing prequel.I would recommend the series for anyone who is looking for something new or anyone who wants a break from action, gore, or tense anime, as this one is not something serious or thrilling but peaceful and humorous with very cute characters <3 Seriously though~~ Hifumi-Senpai alone is worth watching the entire series :D <3 <3 fans, and was hoping for a second season to be released soon after.Well... season two came, and I'm so glad many people recognized this anime to be very good and gave it high scores and good reviews.So what makes this anime special to be appreciated?New Game series has its outstanding elements such as the character design, being so charming and the colorful art, which together help to create a truly amazing atmosphere that fits so well with this kind of anime.The animation is fluid and the voice acting was fitting with the characters.

The simplicity of the first season is absent, but it\'s not a bad thing.  Season 2 builds off of the first season.  Where the first season introduced us all to our lovable female cast, the second builds off of the established relationships and and strengthens them throughout the series.  This is done through the diverse set of interactions of characters.  For example, Kou Is seen briefly chatting with Nene, Hifumi desperately attempting to comfort the newcoming Momeeji by bringing up relevant topics, Hazuki admiring Hifumi,...and a bunch of other small interactions that help shed light on the characters and what they think of the rest of their co-workers.  While the first season focused on sub-plots for each episode, this season focuses on the small, but key interactions throughout it\'s cast which includes newcomers Narumi and Momeeji.  What New Game season 2 does best is show just how crucial the chemistry of the company\'s employees is.  It really does a great job of helping the viewer see the characters as more than just ""cute anime girls"" and exposes the character\'s  unique personalities.  No two characters are the same, and they show that through the use of it\'s different scenarios and situations that characters end up in based on who they are with.  To summarize it all, New Game season 2 does the best it can to establish characters as more than a stereotype, people who are just like us, with vastly different personalities, hobbies and interests. and a bunch of other small interactions that help shed light on the characters and what they think of the rest of their co-workers.

The second season follows her career as she is given a more important role at the company.While this anime doesn't do anything especially outrageous, I don't think that is necessary for a slice of life anime.What you get is a fairly tame, cutesy anime that is very low key. If you just need something light and upbeat to watch, this anime accomplishes that very well. It's got the upbeat nature of K-On! mixed with the hustle...and bustle of the life of a salaryman (or woman in this case).Where this anime does differ from your average slice of life is the setting and age of the characters. Animes in this genre have a tendency to focus on the mundane day-to-day of school girls so it's a nice change of scenery.The story itself tends to be unbelievable (I don't think game companies operate in the way they are depicted in this anime) but I don't think that's important. Artistic liberties were taken for the sake of making the show more interesting to watch.There are a few ecchi moments here and there if you're into that sort of thing but they are so sparse that it isn't really something worth mentioning even.The characters are pretty well written and even though there's a good amount of them, this anime does a decent job of giving them enough screen time and development to make them interesting.Art and music weren't particularly mind blowing but nothing shoddy either.Given that this is the second season of the show I thought they would have maybe used this opportunity to maybe put a bit of focus on the plot or try and have some more interesting character development, but that isn't the case. Not that it's necessarily a bad thing, but I think it would have given this anime a bit more life. There were times that I was kind of bored watching this season.While this season of New Game doesn't really go crazy in any department, it's still a nice breath of fresh air for the slice of life genre. If you want something light and cutesy for easy viewing you can't go wrong here. I give it a solid 7. and bustle of the life of a salaryman (or woman in this case).Where this anime does differ from your average slice of life is the setting and age of the characters.

This is the positive impact of slice of life genre anime which focuses on hobbies or professions, which usually anime with this genre would feel boring but by adding the spice of comedy and competition it feels fun, and there are several ecchi scenes which are not excessive, making the...comedy element more  Good.

This isn't bad for the most part as season one was great and keeping the show somewhere near that level makes sense. The little gripe I had was that overall the show wasn't as entertaining as season one had been. However the way the finale was executed made for a great conclusion to the story and balances out the missing entertainment value for me. I want to quickly point out that this season felt like it had more yuri-bait but that didn't really bother me in...this instance.The story is very similar to season one but this time a new game is being worked on and Aoba assumes more responsibility in the production of the game. It's still very much a Slice of Life anime but it does manage to have some very emotional and dramatic moments every now and again between the comedy, even more so than season one.The art is in that gorgeous moe style you would have come to expect by now. The characters are as lovable as ever and there were additions to the cast later on in the series that I think will do great in the future but they don't really have that much importance this season.New Game!! was an enjoyable ride for yet another season and hopefully we can experience that feeling again soon. this instance.The story is very similar to season one but this time a new game is being worked on and Aoba assumes more responsibility in the production of the game.

They're all something game development can give back to you. Now with two exclamation marks in the title, New Game!! continues to be a delight once again, bringing in even more endearments and tight-knit bonds to your screen.Ding, ding, ding! The second level refreshes a new year and marks the start of a new game for the team over at Eagle Jump. More fun, more entertainment, and this time, the game developing process takes on a more central role so there's...more growth for the characters. Between the productive and merrier days, the story is able to find the right balance and explore them as both friends and co-workers alike. When they pour their hearts to improve themselves, face their own struggles, or express their gratitude to one another, all these aspects are not just some singular details. They combine together into this lovable synergy. More than only attachment, it opens up a path to actually feel and be supportive for them. Their cooperation streams ideas that keep coming one after the other. Their minor drama is a result of each of them having such strong relationships. As a result, I've come to care about seeing their game turn from a mere idea to a final product. Because there is no shortage of chemistry when it comes to these characters, every single interaction, whether that'd be the insignificant hijinks or the emotional connection, is an enjoyable experience that does my heart good. In the end, I can say that I'm proud of what they've achieved together as an enchanting team.Artistically speaking, that exact enchantment also takes form as a scheme of sweet hues. Doga Kobo has reached my heart once again with their art style that appeals to the emotions. Being lustrous and pleasant in color, the lovely brightness gives off an endearing aura throughout the whole show. It's like they've used a soft brush to gently add some visual subtleties around everything. On the motion side, the animation still radiates emotive energy but as this sequel comes in with more maturity, it doesn't just achieve cuteness. Their feelings are very demonstrative, having expressions and gestures that convey their own character and personal conflict. To augment this, the voice actresses did a great job to bring out rawer emotions out of them while still striking with the same, adorable pitch. It's a nice balancing effect between a work and fun scenario. The calmer soundtracks ease up the atmosphere, making it easier to focus on the characters while in contrast, the opening and ending songs take in energy and convert them into some of the catchiest tunes. These songs are even sung by the voice actresses themselves! That in itself adds even more adorable points. And lastly, I loved seeing how their cutesy game is progressing with the small tidbits of previews every now and then.Since its boot up, New Game!! never ceases to lose its purpose in showing the more lighthearted sides of game development. It's fun, it's rewarding, and most importantly, it inspires motivation. This second level is a great illustrative sequel and all these endearments that it gave, they're definitely something that can bask one's soul in a lot of joy. more growth for the characters. Between the productive and merrier days, the story is able to find the right balance and explore them as both friends and co-workers alike. When they pour their hearts to improve themselves, face their own struggles, or express their gratitude to one another, all these aspects are not just some singular details. They combine together into this lovable synergy. More than only attachment, it opens up a path to actually feel and be supportive for them. Their cooperation streams ideas that keep coming one after the other. Their minor drama is a result of each of them having such strong relationships. As a result, I've come to care about seeing their game turn from a mere idea to a final product. Because there is no shortage of chemistry when it comes to these characters, every single interaction, whether that'd be the insignificant hijinks or the emotional connection, is an enjoyable experience that does my heart good. In the end, I can say that I'm proud of what they've achieved together as an enchanting team.Artistically speaking, that exact enchantment also takes form as a scheme of sweet hues. Doga Kobo has reached my heart once again with their art style that appeals to the emotions. Being lustrous and pleasant in color, the lovely brightness gives off an endearing aura throughout the whole show. It's like they've used a soft brush to gently add some visual subtleties around everything. On the motion side, the animation still radiates emotive energy but as this sequel comes in with more maturity, it doesn't just achieve cuteness. Their feelings are very demonstrative, having expressions and gestures that convey their own character and personal conflict.

Series 2, on the other hand, not only involves Aoba in the conflicts (so the impact hits closer to home), these are serious ones people might face in real-life working situations. Granted, in real life conflicts aren\'t often solved as quickly or cleanly as in this show, but the suggestion to ""Hey, let\'s talk it over. Let\'s at least try to solve the problem....It\'s probably better than stewing over it for months"" is one that I really wish more people would take up. I get the impression that either the manga artist or scenario writer isn\'t a big fan of drawn-out conflict, because just about every conflict is resolved amicably in the show. Well, OK, every conflict that isn\'t a competitive rivalry.Series 2 is also where we see the characters move forward and grow in their careers. Hifumi decides to get over her near-pathological shyness now that she\'s been promoted, Umiko takes Nene under her wing, etc. I really like how the ending animation/song in the first half reinforced this, ending the refrain with ""Susume susume (Let\'s go, let\'s go)"" and the entire cast marching.We also get to see the game creation process at Eagle Jump from concept to release. What\'s cool about this is that in between her tasks as animator, Hajime ventures out as a fledgling designer herself, so we get to see the playtest cycle in action.Series 2 is sort of 2 arcs in one. The first arc is Aoba\'s first steps as lead character designer, and the second is the introduction of 2 entirely new faces, Momiji and Tsubame. The pace picks up in the second half to accommodate the climactic moment not long before game release, but credit to the production staff, writers, etc: it did not feel rushed. Or maybe it did, and it matched the Death March (TM) pace at the end of the release schedule.I don\'t know if they expanded the soundtrack over series 1, there wasn\'t any music that really stood out to me as new. I think I like the new OP over series 1 (I know it looks out of character, but OMG Hifumi is adorable in her mini solo!).In conclusion, I would love to have a poster of Aoba\'s illustration piece.

While I absolutely loved the first series, being my first SoL rated >8, I cannot praise New Game!! as much as I wish I could. First part was great due to the characters, interactions between them and their struggles and development. And at first, New Game!! continued on this premise, with it's first couple episodes being equally enjoyable as it's predecessor. Unfortunately, something broke around the middle of the series, with introduction...of new characters. The first series told a story of Aoba, her relations with Yagami and her new collegues, there have been a fair amount of Yagami x Rin, with Ahagon, Hazuki and Nenechi adding to the comedy ascpects of the show. But Aoba's struggles and game development was in the centre of things all the time. This time around, the show left this premise at some point and never really returned. The game progression feels completly unimportant, later in the series there are barely any scenes involving any chemistry between Aoba, Yagami and the rest of the character design team. Instead, more emphasis is put on Nenechi and the programming team, which does not really make any sense whatsoever. Additionally, new characters are completly undeveloped, there are barely any interactions between them and Aoba's team, honestly there is barely any Aoba and Yagami at all leter on in the show. You just get the feeling that the story goes nowhere. Having more then 10 characters in a show that lasts 12 episodes and trying to focus a little bit on everyone is doomed to failure and that is what happend later on.That said, I still enjoyed the show, despite it being inferior to it's predecesor. The art was good, the characters did not suddenly become worse and I am generally in mood for SoL series to begin with. It is just that it did some unnecessary things that did not work out. of new characters.

It is just that it did some unnecessary things that did not work out."", 'New Game is back in action for a second season, and this time, it focuses on the development of PECO, with art by our favorite purple haired employee, Aoba!Story: Much like the first season, New Game!! focuses on an episodic formula. Although most episodes have events that are separate, some do impact the overall end of the season. Episodes usually vary between the workplace, and episodes that encompass days off, such as the episode where the cast goes to watch a show. Episodes that are at the workplace show the majority of New Game\'s storybuilding and character development. Story-wise, the content itself is not deep,...and serves mostly to progress the characters. However, as you would most likely be watching for the characters, this shouldn\'t be much of a problem. What story it does have, the show handles fairly well, although a few certain points may feel a bit lacking and in need of a little more. For instance, we don\'t really get to see much of character thoughts when it comes to certain instances.Art: The art in this show is easy on the eyes and uses soft, but bright colors. This really helps compliment the mood of the show, since it\'s a laid-back show with slight yuri undertones. This artstyle is effective in its selling point as it matches character designs, which I may add, are all unique and contrast well. The moe-factor within this show is amplified with the character design and art. However, shading is a little awkward with the faces, as there really isn\'t any when the characters are at work. However, that isn\'t too much of a problem, because the faces they do make are extremely varied and show lots of emotion. This can be seen as you compare the Hifumi death stare to whenever Ko goes chibi.Sound: The background music in this show is true to the premise. This show uses music that you can tell are video game inspired, reminiscent of older gen consoles. Voice acting is great, as usual, and the opening is also great. In terms of anything else, the show gets it right.Character: This is what New Game puts its emphasis on, and it can be seen. Characters aren\'t just a shallow addition, even if they\'re supporting. Most of the cast shows a growth or change throughout the show, and backstories are given for most of them too. Even Hajime gets some sort of backstory, even though she doesn\'t change during this season. You see a real development when it comes to position changes with the show. As Aoba adjusts to her role as art director, she becomes more open towards people in the company and also starts to stand up and lead. Ko shifts from the easy-going person she was used to being to becoming someone who wants to continuously keep getting better, with Aoba being her rival. The biggest change has to be with Hifumi, and her speaking ability growing each episode in this season. Although some aspects are flawed, the character portion within this show is enough to make it a strong selling point.Enjoyment: There were some times that I was wondering ""where will this episode go"", and was a bit worried that the episode wasn\'t going to go anywhere. This, I would say, was resolved fairly quickly as the episode\'s premise would usually take a scene that doesn\'t feel like it\'s progressing the plot, and change it so that it\'s actually developing characters. Most of the time, the show was great at what it did. Would recommend 10/10Overall: New Game!! took the formula from the first season, and improved it in certain areas, while keeping it the same in others.

If you enjoyed the first season, there is no excuse not to watch this season.', 'I love the first season, now I love the second season.This is unique and so far the first anime about gaming career I have watched.It\'s a harmony about girls in a company working hard to develop ""NEW GAME"", one season with a new game basically, on perspectives of arts and coding. How everyone in the same group or different group works hard and takes care of each other.I feel happy for them when everyone gets what she deserves from her work.It is perfect if you are looking for something simple but will make you happy all day long. ', 'I said it before and will say it again, I would have probably skipped this second season if I knew that this sequel were more focused on fan service than plot itself, more than half of this season is just cute girls doing cute stuff. Of course, there isn\'t a problem with this at all on a SoL anime, but I expected more as a Sequel rather than having an anime that FINALLY starts moving after 7 episodes, the first 6 where 75% of cute girls doing cute stuff and 25% of actual plot. Let\'s not forget that they also included new characters halfway in...the season. If you don\'t get yet what I mean, is that most of this show went for filler and that can be a bit boring at times.TL;DR: If you like SoL Anime and cute girls doing cute stuff then this might be a good sequel for you, but if you expect more plot and development, then you might do well on skipping it.Honestly, some episodes could have been easily bundled as OVA\'s on a BD release or something like that since they are not that necessary, but considering than the actual plot of this show wasn\'t that big, I guess it was needed in order to expand it to 12 episodes.Lets get to the details!, New Game!! starts off giving new roles to the staff as they interview their employees of what do they think of Eagle Jump and what are their goals now, while they decide what ideas are good for a new game. After settling up their roles and deciding the lead, we are set up for an incredibly slow and boring plot progression filled with ""cute girls doing cute stuff"" for quite a while until the plot finally starts moving somewhere. Here we will have some clash between staff members, some rivalry feelings, the need of improvement their skills, etc. And then, when the new characters are introduced, the plot finally is heading somewhere after 7 episodes. You see, I couldn\'t even properly explain what this second season has to offer, because on half if this season there isn\'t much to say about rather than just cute girls on their natural environment, the slow pace for the story doesn\'t help that much unless that you want to see cute girls doing cute stuff rather than expecting a plot. 6/10The animation department of this anime is probably the best thing this show has to offer, watching girls dealing with bugs or being creative with their job is quite a nice watch if you are into gaming stuff, they make good use of the definition of game physics when it comes to animation. I\'m not gonna bother that much with the character designs since they don\'t have major changes... maybe the inclusion of new characters, but that\'s pretty much all. 7/10I wasn\'t originally a fan to any OP/ED of both seasons, but is not like they are bad, they are just not of my taste, its okay overall. I do feel that the soundtrack on this second season didn\'t have that much of an impact, well, I guess that on few scenes the soundtrack was good but not enough to be completely meaningful. 7/10Characters, like the plot itself is also one of the lowest things this anime has to offer, there isn\'t much development aside from few characters that had some development. The inclusion of new characters isn\'t that meaningful, but it helps to add more drama, comedy and fan service to an anime that were overusing the same cute formula over and over again. 6/10Now, even if I said that the show was a bit boring and has a slow pace, it manages to give me some laughs and making me smile at times, it might lack on plot and many other things, but if you don\'t actually watch this for the plot, you will probably have a good time watching this for moe induction. 7/10Now don\'t believe that scores of 6 or 7 for this anime is hating on it, I actually believe that rating this more than 8 is actually overrating a show that doesn\'t really improve that much and just offer more of the same. I do think that they just didn\'t want to risk that much and decided to KISS (Keep it simply stupid) but that\'s okay if the goal of this anime is to please the fans by giving them more fanservice and farming the money out of them. a 7/10 the season.

Kou is the last main character (i plan on reviewing more than just these 2 by the way) she is the she is pretty much the senior to the character design team she well she can be cherry eye and what not but also forget a lot of stuff as well but she is a good character in all honesty. Hifumi is a supporting character and well she is really shy when it comes talking to people the point of running away she does kinda develop in this season with talking to people but i don't think to a large scale also she is a cheerful one a nice and good character. Hajime is another supporting character she is apart of the animation team and she is a pretty big person of a fan when it comes to action figures and well she is a total nerd again another nice and cheerful person. Yun is another supporting character and works in the Character design team she well no idea how you can describe her she kinda has a little bit of a attitude but in more of a nice way but again another nice character (sorry for not describing her the best). Umiko is another supporting character and is the programming chief  when it comes to work honestly even outside of it she can be pretty strict when it comes to both but mostly work she will even scold the employees as well but in nice kind of way. Nene is another supporting character and the friend to Aoba she ends up coming back to eagle jump (wont say why find that out for yall selves) but she is almost like Aoba she is bright full and cheerful. Rin is another supporting character and she is art director for the company like many others has the nice and cheerful personality.Enjoyment: Things that i liked: the comedy was really good in this anime (towards the end not really that much) but again the comedy was damn good also that the characters do kinda develop here and there also that this added some more serious moments in this was a really good touch for the anime and that it was really a enjoyable watch. Things that i didn't like: sometimes the comedy can be there and when it is its really damn good but when it isn't its kinda meh honestly probably my really only complaint that id give this anime.Overall: im giving this a 8 id say i thought this season was better than the first season for sure the comedy was better here and also that some of the characters develop here also that it again was just a really enjoyable anime and also that this anime went with some more serious moments in this and it worked really well easily a second season worth watching for sure. here is really good even on par with the first season and loved the art from the 1st season so the art is really good maybe not the greatest but again still good)Sound: So the Op was actually really good here really liked as for both ED (never honestly understand why anime's sometimes change songs on ending even halfway though the anime for that matter but whatever) both of the were actually really good not that bad at all also i watched the dub of the anime and the dub was actually really well done.Character: Aoba is the only 2 of mains of the anime and well she is a honestly a pretty go lucky person in the anime all ways being cheerful but also can have her moments of feeling down and sad a really good character.

While I enjoyed the new challenges that came with being in the game industry and moving up in the company, it felt less slice-of-life-y and wasn't as funny. Additionally, there was more fanservice, which is generally okay but it was a noticeable jump in the amount.I didn't really connect to the new characters or feel like they were as integrated since we had the full first season to bond with our beloved cast, and some favorites were kind of...pushed to the side and got less screen time.Once again, good but not amazing. The first season is a must watch, this one you can pass if you don't really care about overarching plot. pushed to the side and got less screen time.Once again, good but not amazing.

They often refer to the characters as 'he' but as far as I'm concerned their is not one male in the anime unless you count the kids during the magical girl scenes. And not to mention the translation for what was supposed to be something like 'oh, shoot' was 'cabbage' .......why?? Sometimes I can't stop wondering why does this make sense to people but not to me. I can't even get past the...first episode of this season because of the translations are so poorly done. first episode of this season because of the translations are so poorly done."", ""The second season for New Game!! is pretty much the first season again with a couple of new characters and a little bit more drama. Aoba has a rival now, Momizi, who is also aiming to become the best character designer in the company. Nene is now hired as a part-time programmer. The pairings here change a little bit. Nene is around Ahagon a lot now, since they work on the same booth.Hifumi is promoted and has to try to overcome her shyness even more. Yun and Hajime get an episode focused on their past but that's pretty much it. The focus here really is...around the newcomers, Momizi and her friend, the programmer Tsubame and how they relate to Nene and Aoba. As you might expect, despite some intial friction, they quickly become friends because it's impossible for that not to happen.There's even less talk about gaming this time. One's enjoyment here really depends on how much you like the new girls.

New Issues!The second season of New Game! is much better than the first season.With the characters established, they can now grow and become fleshed out.

Yun shows her kinder side and lets herself breathe more. Hifumi is started to grow into someone people can rely on and talk to. Hajime was perfect since episode 1 so. Still perfect here. No Bias.

Psycho-Pass Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21339/Psycho-Pass_Movie,"['While Psycho-Pass: The Movie is a continuation of the story from Psycho-Pass Seasons 1 and 2, it changes a lot of the things from the show: the setting is different, and while Kogami is brought back again, many of the characters are new. These changes may be fine for some fans, but disappointing for many others. What results is still a great standalone movie, but may alienate many fans because it doesn\'t entirely ""feel"" like Psycho-Pass.Art: 10/10Undoubtedly the high point of the movie. The painstakingly-animated cityscapes and landscapes simply made my jaw drop. And the fight scenes - oh my god, the fight scenes. I...don\'t think I\'ve ever seen fight scenes as well animated and choreographed in an anime as in this movie. The animation budget was probably very high for this film, and it shows - the animation is better than it was in the show. It may not be ""Spirited Away"" or ""Ghost in the Shell"" awesome, but certainly up there as one of the most well animated movies ever.One thing to note about the art though: there\'s a bit more violence in this movie than in the show. When people are shot with guns or Dominators, the blood splatters and body explosions are animated in detail and often focused on, and internal organs and body bits can be seen. If guts and gore turn you off, you may want to avoid the movie.Sound: 8/10The music and sounds do their job very well. The soundtrack mostly consists of the traditional orchestra and chorus you\'ve come to expect, and adds tension to the story when needed. The OP and ED are both energetic rock songs, and get you pumped before and after the film. However, there\'s nothing outstanding about them. The music isn\'t something I\'d listen to over and over again on my iPod, but it definitely contributed to the enjoyment of the film. The sound effects are also very well done. The voice actors do a great job as usual.One complaint I have about the sound though, is the excessive use of ENGRISH. Some people won\'t mind the terrible pronunciations, but because entire dialogues in the film are in Engrish, it will be at best a bit distracting, and at worst make some parts hard to get through.Story: 6/10The story is one of the weaker points about the movie, especially since we\'ve all come to expect a strong story from the show. You know those anime films that seem epic at the start, but by the end nothing really changed about the overall plot or characters and you could go right on to the next season without watching the movie and not have missed a single thing? This is one of those movies.Unlike the previous 2 seasons of the show, this movie does not take place in Japan, but in another Asian country where the military regime is trying to implement a Sibyl-like system in an effort to keep the populace under control. Guerilla rebel forces resist the corrupt government, but thanks to Sibyl\'s system marking all opposition as criminals, the government is able to firmly control its people with brutal oppression. So where do our heroes fit into all of this? Well, it turns out Kogami is discovered to be aiding the rebels, and Akane is sent to investigate both his actions and the country\'s use of the Sibyl system.In essence, the movie is an exploration of what happens when Sibyl falls into the wrong hands. Questions about the political and social implications, such as persecution and segregation, are raised by the movie. The problem though, is that the movie is never given enough time to actually probe into these questions, instead choosing to focus more on the actions scenes than on answering all the thoughtful, philosophical questions it raises.Furthermore, the movie seems to have switched the genre of the series. Whereas the show was clearly a Sci-Fi Thriller with some action sprinkled in, the movie feels more like an Action Spy flick with some Sci-Fi elements mixed in, a change which may turn some fans off. One final problem with the story was the somewhat unsatisfactory ending. I won\'t spoil it, but I will say that I was a little disappointed with it.Character: 8/10While fan-favorite character Kogami is back and better than ever, new characters that the audience are never given time to get to know or get invested in are also introduced. There is some character development: it\'s a joy getting to see the new Akane interact with a somewhat changed Kogami. Ginoza\'s reunion with Kogami is also interesting.Unfortunately, the side characters don\'t get that much screen time, so apologies to fans of any team member other than Akane and Kogami. Anyone hoping for Ginoza or one of the other team members to play a major role will be sorely disappointed. As I said, the film\'s main focus were definitely Kogami and Akane, at the expense of all the other characters. The film\'s villains do their job, but none of them is nearly as memorable as Makishima from Season 1 (who makes a short cameo appearance, BTW). So if you\'re only in it for Kogami and Akane, then you\'re in luck. Otherwise, the rest of the characters do their job - nothing more, nothing less.Enjoyment: 9/10Despite all the flaws in the story and characters that I pointed out, the film was by no means bad. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and wholeheartedly recommend it to both fans and to anyone who is interested in Sci Fi or action. Throughout the movie my attention was held, and the 2 hour running time flew by. The movie didn\'t feel like a drag at all, which is a testament to its entertainment value. It\'s not as deep as the show, but sit back, relax, and you\'ll enjoy it.Overall: 8/10TL;DR summary:Pros:- Absolutely breathtaking animation and fight scenes- Everyone\'s favorite badass Kogami is back and kicking ass- Good musicCons:- A story that\'s not given much time to develop- Setting change may unsettle some fans- Mediocre villains- New and side characters barely get any screen time- Disappointing ending that didn\'t seem to impact the bigger general plotlineDon\'t let the cons I listed stop you from watching the film, however - with absolutely gorgeous animation, a beautiful soundtrack, and the best fight scenes in anime I\'ve seen in recent years, I still wholeheartedly recommend this movie. Just don\'t go in expecting it to be the ""good old Psycho-Pass adventure"" with all the characters you love and you\'ll have a good time with it. don\'t think I\'ve ever seen fight scenes as well animated and choreographed in an anime as in this movie.

Still, it was a fun and enjoyable show with some funny moments (Brains, Hyper-Oats, Spooky-Boogie etc).  Psycho-Pass 2 on the other hand felt like an unnecessary cash-in that didn\'t bring anything new...in terms of plot (and in fact recycled many of the plot points that kept the first one so interesting in the first place). Back then, I chalked it up to them not having the original writers onboard, perhaps the newer writers played it safe and didn\'t want to innovate and that since the movie brought back the old writers, surely they\'d learn their lessons and bring something new to the table right? Or so I thought.Boy howdy how wrong I was. If you\'ve already watched the second half of Psycho Pass 1, you\'ve pretty much already seen this one. It\'s pretty much the same premise, with the same plot twists and revelations only in Cambodia as opposed to Japan. And impressively, it manages to have even worse writing than the first anime.Akane, once again, proves to the viewer that she\'s still a naive nutcase who thinks the system can change for the better (it doesn\'t) and is strangely easy to trust otherwise an obviously evil Colonel. When Mika of all people calls you out on your nativity, you seriously should consider retiring from the position of Main Protagonist.  Kougami on the other hand is still the same old Kougami you\'ve remembered from the first season, only cranked up in terms of OPness. This guy could take down an entire military with a sniper rifle without breaking a sweat. Because of that, most action scenes lose their sense of tension when your character is piratically invincible thanks to plot armor.The other characters from previous seasons hardly make an appearance (understandable) apart from a terribly shoe-in cameo near the end (not understandable). As for the villains, we have Araragi Ko- I mean Colonel Wong who looks like he took a break from his usual harem anime shenanigans to try his luck at the Psycho-Pass-verse. At least that\'s what I remembered him doing. The other villains suffer from the strange syndrome of ""looking cool but ultimately useless"". I mean, you have a chick who can make wires grow out of her arms, how incompetent can you be to undersell this cool character?  Of course nothing ends well for them, they also suffer from Bond Villain Stupidity so much you won\'t be the least bit surprised when Akane\'s friends show up at the precise moment to save them. Makishima wasn\'t the best villain in anime ever (face it, reciting quotes from random works of literature a good villain you don\'t make), but he was at least interesting and he had goals. Sybil System is less interesting now the viewer is aware of their true nature, and Araragi has no motive at all.Really, that\'s pretty much the major things wrong with the film. I could go on about the other minor flaws plaguing the film (Engrish, Minor Inconsistencies, Plot Conveniences), but watching the film really wore me down, and nitpicking on minor issues would require me spoiling the whole film scene by scene.Animation is good at least.2/10Spooky-Boogie couldn\'t save this. in terms of plot (and in fact recycled many of the plot points that kept the first one so interesting in the first place).

The story allows the viewer to get a glimpse of the characters\' improvements and strengths that speak volumes of their years of experience.However, the storyline played an unfamiliar tune.Psycho-Pass season 1 and 2 focused on individuals that brought forward an opposition against the system. By exploring a world where we are introduced to the different types of people accepted or denied by the society, we are treated with a myriad of perspectives and social psychological warfare. It was...a show that focused mental strength and intelligence.The movie, on the other hand, heavily focused at bringing out the ""Brains"" counterpart: raw muscle strength; the fighting force of an army, the individual and the people. Because of this, the storyline of the movie was simplistic and a ""lazy"" attempt at uplifting what the show was supposed to explore. It was a simple goal, a simple manipulation and eventually, a simple solution handed on a silver platter at solving the crisis. There were no individuals or groups that were forward-looking and thought-provoking like Makishima or Kamui; in this sense, no solid antagonist to bring out the potential of a thriller.One could argue that this was because the two antagonist from the series were accustomed to the system and knew how to play by the rules to cunningly twist around with it, while the movie was set in a world who was very new to Sibyl System, therefore their aims fall short to the visions presented in the series.Overall, as a fan of the series and its characters, I really enjoyed watching the movie testing out new waters (literally) and its expansion to the possible potential progress it can bring forth. Personally, as a tribute to the series, I would have preferred a direction which focused more on the essence/discussion/consequences of Caged Reality vs Freedom rather than have implications of a one-sided argument (in this case: Caged Reality). 8/10 a show that focused mental strength and intelligence.The movie, on the other hand, heavily focused at bringing out the ""Brains"" counterpart: raw muscle strength; the fighting force of an army, the individual and the people.

It's an interesting franchise that doesn't have any kind of moe and doesn't involve high school teenagers with supernatural powers. It's a really good thriller-mystery show with some really deep characters and good philosophical themes. I really enjoyed the first season and I loved the second one (though I was probably the only one). Yet I didn't like this movie as much as the predecessors. At first let's start with the story. The thing that i liked about this film was the fact that it expanded the already interesting world of Psycho pass. The biggest part of the movie doesn't take place...in the futuristic Japan like the two previous anime series but in another country were things didn't develop as good as with Japan. That way we have a really interesting place to get the story started. The plot itself was good enough even though in some moments I was starting to loose interest. Generally speaking the movie is kinda big in length (almost two hours) as a lot of things open up and need to be closed with the ending.Also the philosophical aspect of the two first seasons is almost gone as this movie targets mostly in the action and a little bit in the political thriller genre. The animation is really good but for Production IG the best animation studio in Japan for me there were some flaws. Basically the animation was kind off awkward in some hand to hand combats. But overall it was really amazing. Now for the  sound. Let the rant begins. I am not one of those people who have complex about locations. If an anime is taking place in England for example, I don't mind if the characters are speaking Japanese. But when an anime is trying to add English dialogues in it's script is always welcome with the requirement of course that the English are at least GOOD. I'm not asking to speak fluent English (hell I can't even write fluent English XD) but  in this movie were  a major part of the dialogue was in English this thing was unbearable as most of the voice actors couldn't speak English at all. And ok I could excuse the fact that Kogami's couldn't speak good English because he is a main character in the franchise and they couldn't change his voice actor. But for the characters  that appeared for the first time like Nicolas or the mercenary team they could at least take some voice actors that could speak better English than the abortion that I was hearing from them.Maybe I would forgive it if the film was made by another studio but  Production IG has a history of shows with really good English dialogues like ''Higashi no Eden'' and ''Blood the last vampire'' so this was unforgivable for me. Just make them speak Japanese for God's sake!!! Apart from that the voice actors were generally really good and the same goes for the OSTs too. The film starts with song of people's now favorite band Ling Toshite Shigure which was good but not their best in my opinion and ends with the awesome song by Egoist ''namae no nai kaibutsu''. But for the horrible ''engrish'' I put a 6 in the sound section. Hell some sideshows were speaking way better English than the main characters!!!And lastly we reach the character section. I'm not a fun of Kogami (yes he appears it was obvious from the trailer so it's not a spoiler). I find him too perfect for the fucked up word that Psycho pass is displaying. But it was nice to see the other characters  like Akane, Gino and a special someone near the end who makes a brief but memorable appearance that I believe all of us we were expecting. The other movie-exclusive characters were good enough but I was disappointed with the mercenary team who were all really interesting characters but apart from their leader none of them is being discovered at all.Overall ''Psycho Pass the Movie'' was an enjoyable entry in this franchise. I don't believe it will be the last especially after seeing the last scene after the credits. It's good if you want to see 2 hours of action with a little bit of political thriller on it but don't expect to see any philosophies like the two previous seasons. I would recommend this movie to the fans of the franchise but don't go with high expectations. But I guess I shouldn't be the one to talk.

This movie is intellectually stimulating like no other, with references to smart writers like Marcel Proust. This is the first time I\'ve heard someone mention Proust in an anime.This time the villain does not carry around 1984 like Makishima Shougo, which I\'ve heard is a very good book.

The guy doesn’t seem to understand that just because you take out the lame and the unfunny doesn’t change the fact that your dialogue and idea-throwing can still qualify as dull setup, you dullard. Not that the directors...helped things - especially not in regards to Fate/Zero - but between shows that most people consider to be revolutionary but me to be gimmicky along with a movie that was about as engaging and thought-provoking as being lectured on thermodynamics whilst riding a very slow-moving horse, I’m really failing to understand why he has so much appeal. I mean I like a good amount of David S. Goyer movies, but it’s going to be a long f*cking time before I forget the existence of Jumper, y’know?But Psycho-Pass was the one anime of Urobuchi’s I actually liked. It was as hit and miss in its execution as the writer and studio, but the story was generally strong and the concepts, whilst not exactly original, were always interesting even when they weren’t introduced in the most clever of ways. I even liked that maligned sequel, although that was mostly because it kept making me laugh in how stupidly forced it was, along with having a bad guy who might as well have been Kirito from Sword Art Online by way of Jim Phelps from the first Mission Impossible movie. Couple that with the fact that we rarely get good anime movies and I was looking forward to seeing what kind of sequel Psycho-Pass would be with Urobuchi back on the writing staff, how it’d fit in canon, and whether there would be a bunch of people exploding as is usual for this franchise.Well for those who hated the sequel season, prepare to be disappointed that the movie not only acknowledges its existence, but that that bitch you guys all hate so much is just as obnoxious as ever. Which one am I talking about, you may ask? Eh, it doesn’t matter anyways, as aside from Akane and Kougami, the characters from the previous iterations are barely in the thing. In fact, Psycho-Pass: The Movie - and yes, that’s its actual official name without any boring attempt at a subtitle whatsoever - is about as much of a franchise sequel as Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood was to Assassin’s Creed II (and the entire Assassin’s Creed series in general). It doesn’t really shake up the franchise’s core so much as add more to it, which I knew beforehand because every single discussion I read whilst trying to discover when the DVD release date for this was kept bringing that point up.Me: Hm, fine. What exactly does it add, Mr. Urobuchi?Gen Urobuchi: Why, the same exact stuff as the first season, except in a foreign country.Me: ...so I can pretty much skip this movie if they ever made more of this in the future?Gen Urobuchi: Well yes. But it has Akane meeting Kougami again, so anyone concerned about the fact that he didn’t get any closure will be pleased to know that he’s now become a wanted terrorist.Me: But you clarified that he was wanted at the end of your first season and it was pretty obvious he wouldn’t be running a charity organization after that.Gen Urobuchi: It has people exploding. Will that make you happy?Me: ...you’re still a fucking hack, y’know.Gen Urobuchi: Pepsi is better than Coke.Me: Oh screw you, dude!Investment in the series is kind of necessary to enjoy this thing, as they don’t do too much to reacquaint you with the returning cast and the new characters they introduce are pretty much there so that a plot can actually exist. They’re not as lame as the new people introduced in the Tiger and Bunny sequel film, but the only way the governor of the South East Asian Union could have made his intentions more obvious is if he had a caption hovering over his head saying “I am the bad guy, yo”. And the only other antagonist who stands out in this thing does so because he’s black - and looks like Jax from Mortal Kombat for some reason. I remember a woman being introduced, but I think she got killed off real quickly, and the fact that I can’t recall for sure says all you need to know about her.You know one other thing I’ve continued to notice about Gen Urobuchi over time is how much he really wants to be Christopher Nolan. I made the comparison before that Expelled from Paradise’s style reminding me of Interstellar’s if it wasn’t executed nearly as well, and Psycho-Pass: The Movie’s (and arguably Psycho-Pass’s in general) style kept bringing Inception to my mind. They have different stories obviously, but they both try to accomplish combining thought-provoking ideas with big budget action and the former doesn’t even come close to achieving the level of intelligence it wants to because it’s mostly just saying stuff we’ve seen before. And it kind of stands out in the movie’s case, since we have seen it before in all sense of the phrase. The idea of applying a different form of the Sybil System to a different country has potential, but when you get down to it, it’s mostly the same thing all over again except with an active terrorist force opposing it this go-around.So how about that action then? It’s still pretty damn good even though you knew as soon as this movie was announced that Kougami would be doing all the dirty work and Akane would just be elbowing a thug or two. Actually, she does put down a terrorist in the opening act when he refuses to cooperate, so her hands aren’t just mildly untainted this go-around. I did like how a good chunk of the movie takes away the Dominators, forcing our characters to rely on good old-fashioned guns and bombs, and making it so that when the characters do use them it’s all the more impactful. And the setting change from a city to a jungle has that sort of Rambo feel to it, if you made the main character the cop chasing Stallone and moe. It’s not all perfect though. There’s this one action scene in the middle that has a fucking horrible frame rate and felt like I was watching (reading?) well-choreographed flip books whilst on a speeding train.One thing Urobuchi seems to have improved on over his last few works is the pacing. I actually feel like I’m watching a real movie with this thing rather than something that’s 80% setup, 10% action climax, and 10% dragged-out ending. The movie seamlessly switches back and forth between dialogue and explosions the same way your mom switches from sweet to stern (not that I’d know for sure), and aside from conversation with her friend before jumping into a hellhole, Akane never catches a break and the discussions are on-point with the surroundings, so the momentum never really stops. It never felt like I was waiting for a story that never came unless you think random cryptic dialogue in an unspecific timeline counts as a story, and I know I’m going to sound mean and maybe sexist for saying this, but watching Akane get screwed again and again puts a smile on my face. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because I like seeing that sort of torture when it happens to characters who have determination without coming across as creepy and stalkerish. You know, like a certain person in that other anime conceived by Urobuchi. Fuck you guys. Inaho was better, if only because I found him kinda hilarious in the few episodes I watched of that show.Okay, I’m going to have to state at the end of the day that Psycho-Pass is still fun to watch in an “it’s the same good, but why fix what ain’t broke” sort of sense, but the series reached its prime long before the first season ended, and as much as I like Akane, I think I’m more comfortable with leaving her future to the imagination whilst staying away from the crappy fanfics. Best to move on from this thing now before it ends up like the inevitable Madoka sequel when Homura reunites with Madoka in order to fight in an Earthrealm tournament against Shang Tsung and his out-of-place Joker transformations. helped things - especially not in regards to Fate/Zero - but between shows that most people consider to be revolutionary but me to be gimmicky along with a movie that was about as engaging and thought-provoking as being lectured on thermodynamics whilst riding a very slow-moving horse, I’m really failing to understand why he has so much appeal.

This is a return to form for the psycho-pass franchise. It has great visuals, sound and a solid plot. If you enjoyed the first season this is for you. If you hated season 2 then you can forget about it. After watching the movie, in my mind, season two no longer exists.Overall I loved this movie and can't wait to add it top my collection beside season 1 (season 2 doesn't exist). "", 'Just to clarify: I am a huge fan of Psycho Pass. That is, the original series, written by Gen Urobuchi. Season 2 was a bit of a letdown but overall still enjoyable. But this? No. No excuses. This was just plain bad. Minor spoilers. Tl;dr at the bottom:Story:This was just a huge cluster of cheesy sci-fi-esque ""plot twists"" which you find out at the end of the film mean absolutely nothing. The so called ""plot twists"" themselves were about as predictable as a sunrise. The film starts out promising with an interesting hook of a terrorist plot in Tokyo which you soon find out involves...another country in an experimental phase of integrating the Sybl system. But...that\'s it. Beyond the first 20 minutes is nothing but boring, bland and tasteless ""plot"" designed to try and make the entire situation seem a lot more complicated than it actually is, in a vain attempt to try and give the film the same depth that the original series had.Art:It\'s pretty. Nothing else really to say: the futuristic technology still looks as pretty as it did back in the original series.Sound:Again, nothing much to say, besides the fact that a few of the adrenaline pumping OSTs reappear in places. Aside from that, the OP was brand new, however done by the same artist who did the first two OPs, and the ED was a reused one, however one of my personal favourites.Character:Ugh. They messed up two of my favourite characters. The first half of this film tries to establish how strong our main heroine is, and to show just how much she\'s grown to when she first became an inspector. But around halfway through, she essentially becomes completely useless, serving no purpose but to convey the plot to the audience (which the audience already knows by this point, might I add). Kogami makes a reappearance and plays quite a key role in this movie. And by key role, I mean he was on the screen for a while. As for what he contributed to the film...pretty much nothing aside from a bit of fanservice and action.Animation:Oh my lord what happened?! I\'ve made PowerPoint presentations with better animation than this! As a whole, the general animation was about average quality, however during particular scenes (such as a fight scene around 3/4 of the way through, or even a general talking scene around halfway through) the animation becomes extremely rough. Heck, there isn\'t even any animation. It\'s a slideshow with sound. Did they run out of money while making this?Tl;dr+gorgeous soundtrack+pretty art style with cool, sci-fi backgrounds and technology present everywhere.-sloppily written plot-virtually no character development past the opening 20 minutes-incredibly low animation qualityIf you\'re a fan of Psycho Pass, I\'d definitely say steer clear: it will only make you start to dislike what was such an amazing series. another country in an experimental phase of integrating the Sybl system.

So it comes as no surprise that I not only watched this movie, but also enjoyed it quite a bit. However, I also strongly believe that Psycho-Pass\' strength lies in not its beautiful art nor its amazing soundtracks (both of which are fantastic), but rather on its philosophical explorations and thoughtful plot/character development. As a result, even though I did greatly enjoy this movie, as a fan and honest critic I have to give it a less-than-stellar rating. Now in more depth:-...Art: As mentioned in other reviews, the art is nothing short of fantastic. From the initial guerrilla scenes to the final showdown (to avoid spoilers), little can be said to detract from the artwork and animation.- Sound: The music and OST for the movie are both excellent, and the ending is a thrill for old Psycho-Pass fans. Again, nothing much to criticize here, but nothing much to gush over either.- Character: This was one of the low points of the movie, particularly in comparison to standard set by the other Psycho-Pass seasons. Unlike in the other two seasons, Akane doesn\'t really develop at all in the movie, and the denouement where she inevitably has a ""showdown"" with the Sybil System (no Psycho-Pass story would be complete without one) is disappointing, if only because it shows how shallow the whole theme behind the movie was. (More on this in the Story section.) The only upside in the character department is that Ginoza finally gets some closure, which was great to watch, but otherwise nothing is resolved. Makishima is provided a 10-second appearance just for the fangirl screams, and our protagonists (by whom I mean Akane and Kogami) end the movie at about the same point they started it. As a side note: why the !#$% does Shimotsuki still exist? I haven\'t been this pissed off at an anime character since the infamous Nina of Code Geass.- Story: Ah, the story. I\'ll discuss both the plot and the whole premise of the movie here, since in Psycho-Pass they\'re often one and the same. In short, it was a pretty awful execution of a potentially interesting idea. The Sybil System, with some improvements and elbow-twisting from Akane, has been functioning more or less well in almighty Nippon, so inevitably we have the question of what happened to the rest of the world. This movie starts to answer that: well, the rest of the world was kind of destroyed. At least, the world as we know it today. Lawlessness and war are the fixtures of the day, and humans have reverted to living in a sort of tribal society.So what is the benevolent Sybil System to do but to export itself to save the rest of the world? (Hint: white man\'s burden, Washington Consensus) We see the System exported to southeast Asia, and the consequences that follow; how they go about dealing with the ""aboriginals"" and imposing law on such a society. Some of the ideas, as with others in Psycho-Pass, are quite interesting (i.e. the collars), and the premise itself is quite interesting. But unfortunately, this is about as much praise I can give, for the rest of the movie\'s execution is sub-par.What could have been a fascinating exploration of how the Sybil System deals with the challenges of assimilating a ""rabid"" population and of the process of building a society from essentially scratch is instead turned into a typical military coup d\'etat in which (*spoilers ahead*) the ultimate bad guy turns out to be (surprise!) a criminally asymptomatic puppet of the Sybil System. Hey, it\'s not like we\'ve seen that as the climax of pretty much every season right? And Akane (surprise!) uses talk-no-jutsu with increasingly strained logic to get the Sybil System to back down. A job well done!All in all, this movie is, of course, something of a must-watch for Psycho-Pass fans; I mean, if you were raving as hard as I was about the TV seasons, then you probably didn\'t even read this review before watching it. But simply as a piece of the art form that is anime, and more so as a successor of the Psycho-Pass franchise, this movie was something of a disappointment.

Usually they come off as fanservice and do not further the main series in any way. And when said movie has tied into the main series, it is often very rushed and poorly structured(I’m looking at you Gundam 00). Sadly, the Psycho Pass movie is no exception. .First off, this is a stand alone side story. It says that it’s a sequel to Psycho Pass 2, but that is pretty much a lie. The is basically zero connection the second season and most of the movie takes place outside of Japan. None of the characters...other than Akane and Kogami makes a meaningful appearance in the movie. I guess the movie wants to stay away from the nonsense in the god awful Psycho Pass 2. The bad thing though, is that this basically makes the movie filler. Now, I wouldn’t actually mind this that much if the movie was good. But alas, it was not.First and foremost, the thing rushed as all hell. The movie has approximately enough content to cover an entire season, but all of it is crammed into less than two hours. Everything goes by so fast that it becomes hard to care about anything that's happened. Characters come and go at a blink of an eye, ideas are dropped at a tip of a hat, and there is no theme that last long enough to matter. However, I don’t necessarily think the movie would be any better with a longer run time since the plot is contrive as the US tax system.The plot for the Psycho Pass Movie is completely illogical and downright stupid. The entire point this movie trying to push the point that the Sybil system is actually a good system. This seems really obtuse and stupid, especially considering this is consider this movie technically take place after season two, where Sybil kills people for no reason. In this movie, Sybil killed thousands of innocent people, allows an army of megalomaniacs to oppress millions, replaces politicians with robots, and still expects the viewer to believe it is all done for the good of humanity. What a fucking joke. And they even throw in the dictatorial government in Cambodia to simply make Sybil look good in comparison. Gen, a slight smaller piece shit is still a piece of shit. And for the love of god, Akane somehow still believe that she can change the system from the inside. Really Akane? That is like trying to passing a bill through Congress, it will never happen.None of the characters ever matter in this movie. All the villains suffer from “James Bond Syndrome”  where they let the main characters live for no reason, explain their plan to them, and then finally proceed to kill them. As for the villains, they are just there for the sake of being cool. None of the villains ever come off interesting of meaningful. The army dudes are are just a bunch of one dimensional psychopaths and all the mercenaries that appear later in the film are just there to either look cool or to throw out pseudo intellectual quotes as if this was GITS Innocence.Even the main characters don’t do much. Akane and Kougami are just passive observers who are just dragged along a series of events that they have no control over. And the part that pisses me off the most is that no one learn anything at the end. All the characters remain the same as if nothing ever happened. Akane is still a stoic observer, Kougami is still a bishonen rebel, and Sybil is still a bunch of hypocritical jerks. Everything remain at the status quo as if nothing ever happened.If you want an action movie, I think this would satisfy you. It is very well polished and technically proficient and there is an abundant amount of big, blockbuster action scenes. However, if you want anything more that a dumb, action bust them up, you won’t find it here. All this movie really amounts to is an over the top gore fest that have no idea what it's doing. other than Akane and Kogami makes a meaningful appearance in the movie. I guess the movie wants to stay away from the nonsense in the god awful Psycho Pass 2. The bad thing though, is that this basically makes the movie filler. Now, I wouldn’t actually mind this that much if the movie was good. But alas, it was not.First and foremost, the thing rushed as all hell. The movie has approximately enough content to cover an entire season, but all of it is crammed into less than two hours. Everything goes by so fast that it becomes hard to care about anything that's happened. Characters come and go at a blink of an eye, ideas are dropped at a tip of a hat, and there is no theme that last long enough to matter.

Kougami will show you how to defeat his enemy with epic battle scene.For the character, it will be focused at Inspector Tsunemori and Kougami. you can see the great improvement of Inspector Tsunemore because She will serve some great action and use his skill to solve the problem. for Kougami, he will appeared as the leader and use his talent to winning the war. The enemy is different like two season before, If Makishima look like Kougami or Kirito with his great Technology and Planning skill, For the enemy here is great with his assassin skill and Kougami will face him. You should know what happen for next scene.In my opinion, i really enjoy this Movie. it serves so many epic action scene and it has so many complexity for the problem. and the main part is how to solve this big problem with enemy at everywhere.Overall Score: 8.5/10Even the show is epic, i still miss enemy like Makishima Shogo i hope there some new epic crew like Kagari or Masaoka. of the machine and the ruin. you can feel great sensation of war because the background art so epic.  you can see more and more action animation here if you miss it at psycho pass 2.

To start off, no this isn't nearly as good as season 1, but it is still much better than season 2 (though really that's like saying a High school track star is better at the 400 meter dash than the top special Olympics competitor, so not exactly a fair comparison). The story line was quite intriguing to say the least and had a nice, but not entirely unexpected plot twist that any fan of the series should see coming a mile away. The...animation was top notch, but what else would you expect; and the music managed to set a nice tone for the action. Some characters came back, even if they were mirages, and made this movie hearken back to the first season of the show, which after the intense average-ness of season 2 is quite nice. Overall a solid film that slipped up in some places, but hell, it was a herculean task to stand up to season 1, and this movie made an effort so props to it. Overall 7/10.tl;dr: Tsunemori is bad at her job, Sybil is a dick, and I want to lick whipped cream off of Kougami's body. animation was top notch, but what else would you expect; and the music managed to set a nice tone for the action.

With the creators of S1 working on this movie, I had high expectations. Reality can be harsh sometimes.The buzz surrounding the movie was the return of Kougami Shinya. As Psycho-Pass fans say, Psycho-Pass isn't Psycho-Pass without Kougami. As much as I fan-girled over seeing him back in action, he just didn't have the finesse of season 1. My assumption is that Makishima added that extra bit of 'umph' to his character. Kougami had a goal and clear motives in S1 but in the movie he seemed like a lost puppy. Although his...combat skills say otherwise. Our other protagonist going by the name of Akane however, once again proved her competent skills as she uncovered the events occurring beind-the-scenes in SEA.This brings me to the plot. It was dull. We are introduced to a random nation in South East Asia undergoing a civil war. This was a brilliant way to demonstrate the Sybil System's superiority over other judicial systems. Chaos and war is portrayed as common in many countries, with Japan being the only country living in peace and prosperity. However there was nothing more the story and it had no substance.Shootouts, explosions and witty dialogue mixed in between the action scenes are not what made Psycho-Pass S1 the best work in the franchise. A large portion of the movie was dedicated towards showing off the ongoing havoc which disrupted the flow of the progression. It's obvious to see from the visuals and effects the high production values and the effort put into making the fight scenes look gorgeous. Due to this, less attention was paid to what I consider the more important aspects of the plot. How has SEA come to this catastrophe? How is the area designated to the Sybil System's management coping? We get brief statements about these plot points but showing the viewers instead of telling is much more effective. The story also concludes poorly. We weren't shown the after-effects of Akane exposing Sybil's intentions.The remaining cast of characters were a mix of good and bad. Shimotsuki seemed more competent at her job than she did in S2 but the mercenaries had no personalities to speak of. Ginoza was given little screen time but this was used effectively. The 2 on 1 with him Kougami tag-teaming demonstrated his combat prowess, something we never got to see before. We also witnessed him having a soft spot for his former colleague by not arresting him. Nice touch to his character.I doubt the heights of S1 will ever be reached again, as this movie proves Gen and his fellow colleagues seemed to be struggling to add something new to the series. I was pleased with seeing what Kougami was up to and the extra bit of world building in this sci-fi world.Oh and yes, the engrish was bad. combat skills say otherwise.

The movie flowed well, had a good plot & furthermore, and actually more importantly, is a good segway to lead into a season 3 of Psycho pass, which, if done like this movie, can probably rival the first season.Story:I will skip any synopsis as MAL already did that.PSycho pass the movie does a pretty decent job of keeping a good flow. The plot is original as it can be & the action scenes, which are frequent, are brilliantly done and amazing. Regardless of...what you think of the plot, you will never be bored with this movie as each frame is an integral one and there is no wasted dialogue nor scenes.However, the story suffers in two major ways: The first is that despite it being original(as you would expect) it\'s not terribly unique or fascinating. It\'s pretty much easy to follow and you can almost sense what the ending will be like. It\'s certainly not entirely predictable but\'s not challenging in any way, which leads me to the second part: It\'s not a movie meant to challenge your mind in anyway. Psycho pass the first season was very psychological and even in the second season, there existed these questions of right and wrong, law & order, justice, etc, albeit less interesting than the first season and less intriguing. The movie does nothing of the sort, at least, nothing that hasn\'t already been made clear. Which again, leads to the first negative aspect of the story. It\'s not unique. No unique story, no unique elements. Try and think of this movie as something similar to a fast & furious movie or a seth rogan movie. Entertaining, but not entirely bright or especially good.Art: 10/10 would bangThe art in the movie is incredible. INCREDIBLE. incredible(one more time for shits & giggles). The budget must have been more than whatever Donald trump spends to keep his fake hair on his head each month because there is not a dull frame. In fact, sometimes, the background is even better animated than the characters! Obviously, each character is animated perfectly but most surprisingly, so is every frame as i mentioned. The art in the back, from the cityscapes to the ruins are incredibly well done, near as perfect that you could want. The action scenes are amazingly well done as well & probably the most impressive about the art. Things you will notice for sure is the background, the way the character\'s hair sways in the wind, and the fight scenes.Sound:I gave it an 8. Could be a 7 honestly. I\'ll tell you why. English. English, english, english. Never thought I\'d hate hearing my own language so much. Terrible pronunciation throughout, and entirely unneeded. It\'s not like the country in question is America or Australia. It\'s fucking south east asia. Obviously English is more common than Thai or Vietnamese and maybe even easier to learn but it\'s unneeded and bad & there\'s heavy dialogue in english, even from people such as Kogami & Akane. For that, it gets a 7.However: I give it an 8 because any movie that does that, is really trying. That is something new and I appreciate that. To me, it reminds me of watching a film with subtitles, aka, a foriegn film, which despite me having to read and listen to Danish or something, The movie is so good. Or if a movie hires actors who can speak another language or have them learn it. But most big budget films don\'t & instead, I\'m reminded of movies such as the boy in the striped pajamas where no one speaks german & instead has English accents which is confusing as fuck. So kudos to them for at least incorporating some culture.As for subs, Voice actors do a great job as usual & the music is as expected, especially that one, and you know it when you hear it, when the fight is about to happen or shit just got real in the story. Background music, which includes aforementioned ""shit hits the fan sound/song"", is good and ranges from memorable to ok but it never does the show injustice once. Great job all around.Character:I gave it a 7. I\'ve heard people say that this movie tried hard to have more villains like Makashima. There is literally no one like him. In fact the only person like Makashima is Makashima, who makes a cameo(I\'ll get to that in a bit). The villains introduced serve one purpose: To die. You can tell it from the beginning. It\'s a movie. Not a season. There are not memorable and pretty dull and are there only to antagonize the story and give it a conflict. There is no point mentioning names, and again, each is pretty standard and boring. Though, that being said, the mercenaries are cool, as like fighters and stuff but the leader is given unnecessary dialogue to make him seem smart. When he\'s clearly expendable as fuck.Here, let me explain about reoccurring characters. For one, the supporting characters play no role, except for Ginoza, who for some reason does not wear glasses anymore and has a different hairstyle, so at first I didn\'t even know it was him. He got a lot better looking. Anyway, some of them, like that red Haired guy from season two(sho) & the sadistic black haired guy(Togane) don\'t even have dialogue at all. Maybe Togane has 1 line & even Kunizuka(the kind of lesbian enforcer from season 1 & 2), has like 3 lines. In fact, the most important person, as far as dialogue, and actually, at all as a supporting character, is karanomori. Saiga says a few things that aren\'t really important, other than to fill screen time for Akane to mull over his words. And finally, that stupid bitch partner of Akane\'s is back too, being a bitch and pretty much disagreeing with everything Akane says and does even though she doesn\'t know shit that stupid whore piece of...Sorry. Anyway, as for main characters.Akane is actually more likable. Wow. First season I hated her stupid black & white ideals and her happy go luckly bullshit. Season two she dulled down but she was still too happy and her ideals still kind of black & white. Now, though her ideals haven\'t changed, she seems to directly oppose the sibyl system now, especially  by the ending and pretty much dictates what the sibyl system should and can do. She also seems more closed off personally and serious, which I like more, and her character has developed well from s1. She has even taken up fighting. So kudos to the staff at Psycho pass for making her more likable.Kogami: Yes he is back. Finally. And as you can imagine, he\'s still a bad ass motherfucker who doesn\'t take any names. He hasn\'t changed much but it\'s cool to see him play a role outside of his enforcer one back in s1 & therefore is integral to the story. His sense of justice is still strong and unwavering and the new thoughts & feelings we learn from him are great because 1, they help his character develop and 2. he becomes more likable. Which is pretty hard.I\'m going to address the cameo of Makashima. He is so unneeded. I dislike psycho pass 2 & this movie using him so many times as references. All because he was so great and every other villain sucks & every problem has to come back to him. They talk about him way too much. Just leave him alone. The cameo actually pisses me off because, one, he\'s a fucking hallucination of Kougami\'s, who for no reason is hallucinating him so it\'s not even believable for him to be there & two, because Psycho pass will do anything to talk about him & this time they just had the balls to draw him & animate him. The dialogue he has between Kougami isn\'t even important & considering it\'s a figment of his mind, doesn\'t even matter because it\'s already shit Kogami knows. It\'s not new information. Psycho pass will never be able to recreate a character like Makashima because Makashima is arguably one the greatest villains of all time.Enjoyment: 9/10None of the problems or concerns mention took any precedence over enjoying this movie. Though it takes 45 minutes for Kougami to even speak, it is a great movie worth two hours of your day. It sets up as a perfect transition to season 3, though is most certainly a stand alone movie, and in no way leaves a cliff hanger.For those that found that too long, i will give a quick recap of pros & cons.Pros:-Great animation, as perfect as can be, including characters & backgrouns & fight scenes.- Fight scenes. That is all.-Solid, easy to follow plot.-entertaining.-Character development from Akane & Kogami.Cons:-Not a very unique or challenging plot.-Supporting characters pretty much useless and left with no dialogue.-Villains forgettable and bland.As you can see, pros outweigh cons, go & watch it.As shia Labueff would say, JUST DO IT what you think of the plot, you will never be bored with this movie as each frame is an integral one and there is no wasted dialogue nor scenes.However, the story suffers in two major ways: The first is that despite it being original(as you would expect) it\'s not terribly unique or fascinating.

But now that I watched it, I have a different opinion. The story was very good but not great. I loved the recurring themes of free will and human nature. That humans are not meant to be ruled in a way that interferes with their free will and that each person should fulfill their desires. The corruption of government was very good too and can be compared to real life. The artwork was quite good and it was a lot better than the artwork from season two. Probably because it was...animated by the same production studio from season one. Akane's character was very good. In comparison from season one and the movie, you can tell she has grown and changed in a way but her sense of justice is still the same and she still has her humanity. Kougami's character was very good too, and he did have some traits that Shogo Makishima had. But the biggest difference in both of them was that Shogo would use his power in a way that was evil and Kougami wouldn't and that's what l liked about his character development. I really did enjoy the movie but the ending did not feel like an ending. I do think that they kept it that way so that one day they may make a season 3 or a movie sequel.

I\'m very happy to say that the movie has met my expectations and is a fantastic addition to the franchise.Picking up after six months of the conclusion of the Psycho-Pass 2, a group of foreigners invade Japan with the intentions of committing an terrorist attack against the Sybil System. From that point on, Akane is sent off to a war-ravaged country, where the Sybil system is trialed, in order to find Kougami,...who has some sort of connection to them. As this is a movie with a limited running time, the amount of action has been greatly increased to compensate the few new ideas that the movie brings to the table. This is where the second season has its greatest connection to the movie as the assault dominator and the bipedal mini-gun trotting killer robots are used to light up the screen with tons of bullets. Fights that go beyond the scale of the two seasons frequently occur with grandiose explosions and it makes up for whatever philosophical depth the movie may have lost in transition to the big screen.StoryBuilding off of the themes from the two previous seasons, the movie expands its horizons by exporting the Sybil System into a country that is already embroiled in a civil war and violence is very much a way of life. The first season focused on judging the individual while the second season was about some nonsensical thing about collective identity and the Sybil system having to judge itself which then leads on into current situation within the movie.Gen Urobuchi, as the primary writer, does a good job in keeping its focus on the new ways that the Sybil system is adapting itself to an outside world and its various implications. I really did like the message that movie gave off in the end as it is up to actual people, not systems, to decides whether to have freedom or security. Although the conclusion was a bit abrupt and had little impact on the primary cast as the all the important characters basically return back to the status quo, I felt that the cat was out of the box and was an appropriate setup for some major conflicts in future continuation of the Psycho-Pass series. Having a Sybil System that casts its net across the globe is something that is truly frightening to comprehend.CharactersWhen it comes to characters, Psycho-Pass: The Movie has its sights on who made the series great by focusing squarely on Akane, Kougami and the Sybil System. Akane, having come so far from being a greenhorn inspector with native ideas about justice, continues to be the star of the series. Sporting a bulletproof vest and even carrying a 9mm pistol, she is takes a page from Kougami playbook in building herself up to be deadly without resorting to the technical marvel of the dominator. Far away from hyper-advanced Tokyo metropolis, it was immensely satisfying to see Akane be outside of her element and dealing with the brutal reality that most of the world faces.Kougami remains the badass that he always is so it is like meeting up with an old friend that you haven\'t seen in a while and having both him and Akane together again is living up to a large part of what Psycho-Pass is. Ignoring Kamui of the second season, Makishima Shougo is back once again even though his physical body has a bullet hole in the middle of his head. A figment of Kougami\'s psyche, he is relentless in arguing his point that he and Kougami are of the same nature and that both of them will arrive at the same point.Sadly, the real antagonists are little more than two-bit thugs armed with some serious firepower and are even weaker than Kamui in the previous season. They do have some fancy toys in their procession like giant-walking spider tanks, jetpacks and armored bio-suits but I don\'t think the movie could have crammed developmental time for the villains especially when there is so much awesomeness going with the main cast and gunfire tearing up the landscape . As a result, the supporting characters don\'t receive a lot of screen time and they don\'t show for the majority of the movie. Interestingly enough, Mika Shimotsuki is far more tolerable as a character even though there are more than enough hints of growing tension between the her and Akane. Knowing the full truth behind the Sybil System, she is far more ruthless and ideological harden than her former self, who was fumbled around in the dark while annoying the audience. For future installments, I can see this rivalry exploding when the stakes become even higher in a world that craves the promises of the Sybil System.AnimationProduction I.G. is in charged with once again with animating the entire movie and they do not disappoint. Unlike the work of Tatsunoko Productions, which clearly was not a first-rate studio and had some serious production issues throughout the second season, everything is skillfully animated and looks gorgeous. My only gripe with the visuals is the rather bland textures on some of the 3DCGI models like the Honda CRV in Akane\'s opening scene.Music/SoundLing Tosite Sigure gives a wonderful opening titled ""Who What Who What"" that feels like a natural continuation of the second season opening and there is a spiffier version of the Psycho-Pass main theme.There was one thing that really irks me during the movie and that was amount of Engrish being thrown around. The occasional mangled English phrase or sentence spoken by native Japanese voice actors is something that can usually be overlooked but hearing entire blocks of philosophical statements being spoken like that is more than cringe-worthy. Overall, the audio aspects are what you expect of a high budget anime movie but the Engrish is a black mark against an polished entertainment product.ConclusionPsycho-Pass is one of my favorite series in all of anime with its distinct lack of moe, cyberpunk sci-fi setting, thought-provoking mature subject matter and some really great characters, both protagonists and antagonists. The movie only affirms my love for the series with its lovely visual, bold new setting and some unsettling plans that Sybil System has as it go beyond its native Japanese borders. If you are a fan of Psycho-Pass, then there is absolutely no excuse in not watching this movie and I wouldn\'t hesitate in recommending this show for those who are old or new fans of anime.8.5/10 who has some sort of connection to them.

Once again it follows Akane as she takes her incorruptible hue and immovable morality outside of Japan to hunt S1 favorite Kougami in SEAUn (South East Asian Union).After Akane stops a well organized terrorist group in Japan, she learns of Kougami\'s connection to them and goes off by herself (with the blessing of the Sibyl System) to SEAUn to investigate. The continent itself acts a representation of two things, one, what life is like in countries outside of Japan...(without the SS) and also how its used and affects the lives of those where the system is recently implemented (to an extent.)An issue is that the SEAUn is all we have of the world outside of Japan. It\'s a place where violence is common and the area is not only under constant risk of terrorist attack, but has just had a civil war. We hear that ""Every place is like this outside of Japan."" The problem is that we have no way to really verify this claim.Of course we get to view both sides of the coin here, how the city is viewing things with the newly implemented Sibyl System making things peaceful, and the Rebels who understand the dangers of the system, probably thanks to Kougami (although it\'s not explicitly stated except for a single line of dialogue). But it\'s all really what we knew or expected overall. No real major revelations.The movie does have some minor world things tossed in like how people who are latent criminals where collars in order to enter the city, but are often shunned by others, and how the city generally accepts the lack of freedom because of Sybil because the lack of freedom without it was greater, but those are really fleeting afterthoughts.The story really wants to go everywhere and touch a lot of points that fans have been asking since the end of season 1. The problem is that it does not have enough time to fully explore any of it or the story put restrictions where we don\'t get accurate depictions. It\'s pieced together well, but only at the seams and seems pretty shallow overall. I suppose it did a good job for the time frame. If it feels like I dislikes the story, I didn\'t I actually thought it was decent, but they should have focused more tightly on a couple of things instead of simply trying to answer every question.Akane has always been the constant of the show and she has true main character status here. But as much as I like her as a character because the story gets in the way of her and in some cases just screw her over. It almost seems like they go out of their way to establish how badass she\'s become only to completely erase it later on, and then reestablish how she\'s able to almost easily force her views onto the Sybil System at the end. There are parts made to make Akane contemplate her decisions with the Sybil and her actions, but he moral and personal beliefs are so strong that the time the movie dedicates to this is nowhere near enough to have an effect. What worse is that if this was a full season instead a movie I fully believe that Akane would have subverted these ""story"" elements that hamper her character in the movie.Much more interesting is Kougami. It\'s not even as his character really develops a lot throughout the movie, it\'s more where his character is now since we last saw him. He\'s in essence the leader of the resistance against the Sibyl System and has taken on several traits of S1s antagonist, Shougo Makishima. But his hows and whys are fundamentally different. Which raises an interesting point, if his ends justify the means and the audience agrees with him (as I expect a lot of us do), are we being unfair to the Sybil System because in almost every case life for those under it are better?The villains are pretty lame and kind of obvious what they are doing. Not much else to say about them except that the Sybil System is involved somehow. There is an interesting part where the villains basically offer Kougami to step over the line and become a Makishima, and not without obvious benefits.That leaves the other characters and not a lot of them really do anything of significant note. I suppose I should mention Ginoza, who has since forgiven Kougami and now even seems to respect his actions despite not agreeing with them. The other is Mika Shimotsuki who pretty much represents a faithful dog to the system. If Kougami represents Destruction (The system must be destroye), and Akane represents Change (The system is needed but so are humans), she represents Order (The system is perfect) to a point where she has an extreme view of the ends justify the means and it shows a couple of times within the film.I do need to address her interaction with Akane. It\'s no secret to those within the anime that their approaches and viewpoints deviate significantly and it often results in arguments (more like Mika yelling at Akane) as it\'s not in Akane\'s character to really argue her points in the heat of a moment. But when she does it here it just seems like it was tossed in only to make sure we know this girl has an opposing viewpoint. The problem is that her credibility ended at a very low point in S2 and we don\'t see any of her development since then so her word hold little meaning against Akane who has single handily changed more than anyone else in the series. I understand they want her to have a foil, but Mika is not compelling.The art and animation in the film are generally very high quality. The action sequences are very well animated and some of them even have this weight to them where you almost feel the characters movements and the impacts. It also has some Akane fanservice tossed in. But at times it does feel more like an action show rather than the more drama based stint that the series really is, although I suppose that is to be expected with a movie.Overall the Psycho Pass movie is like a surface view of the benefits and downfalls of the Sybil System and the viewpoints of some of the key players within the anime. It\'s not really any mind blowing twists or sudden character revelations but a solid frame work that was built from the previous two seasons that hold this movie together. Even so, it does raise enough questions and adds enough elements into the mix to hold its own.6/10 (without the SS) and also how its used and affects the lives of those where the system is recently implemented (to an extent.)An issue is that the SEAUn is all we have of the world outside of Japan.

Urobutcher being the man he is decided to take things up a notch and created a situation in which the system was tasked with settling conflicts due to lingering effects of political and civil war.Even though the concept behind this film is interesting and enjoyable, the outcome of certain events were pretty much predictable, however be that is it may, the film did manage to execute it's established plot points pretty well primarily due to its main cast and the conflictCharactersIn short, this film mainly focused on Akane, Kogami and both sides of the playing field in this new country with everyone else getting minor roles and limited amounts of screen time. The biggest con that I had with the film leaned towards the antagonists who sadly ended up being the standard group of villains that are trying to gain large amounts of power and quite frankly, they ended up.being very forgettable. But I will give credit to the fact that the antagonists (Mainly the mercenaries) were very menacing and added a lot of much appreciated suspense and intensity to the filmOther characters such as the Sybil System and Division 1 were all showcased exactly how they were in previous seasons but with minor roles however I will say that the breakthrough performer in this group was Gino - The man was a complete boss in this film. Still their work together is always a joy to see and the film captured the essence of an everyday active mission in the lives of Division 1.....Credit also goes to Shion whom also played a more active role in the film along side Gino  (Mika is still pretty annoying but what's worse is that now she has a lot of sass)As I stated earlier, Akane and Kogami were the main focus of this film and both of their sub plots and joint dynamic were handled very well. Akane's development from the previous seasons remained in tact and the film perfectly showcase the drive, determination and detective skills that Akane has gained as well as her ever so strong denial of the harsh methods made by Sybil. Kogami was exactly the same but even though the character went through some interesting changes, what made Kogami such an interesting character was his tactical skills, personality and combat prowess and that was more than showcased in this filmA certain individual from S1 that ended up solidifying their place as one of the best antagonists in anime history ended made a cameo in this film and said person's influence and actions lingered into the film and affected certain events and charactersArt/SoundIt's more than obvious to see that Production IG really went all out with this film and managed to get a very high budget because the art and animation were completely fluid, there were no drops in frame rates and the backgrounds and lighting + camera work were all 10/10. Thankfully the original character designs stayed the same but more detailed and the new characters looked decent as wellThe sound was equally as epic however there was one thing that didn't pan out too well, and that was all of dat Engrish.....Never in my life of watching anime have I seen so much pure English dialogue that for the most part sounded really bad. However, I feel like Hana Kana did a good job at it, Ko's was decent enough too....The Japanese voice acting was pretty decent though.The OST consisted of new tracks that completely grasped the essence of Psycho Pass as well as already established and new mixes of tracks from the first season. The film also has a great OP song showcased in the PV that was made by the group that did the OP's for the first and second season and lastly, the icing on the cake came in the form of the ED song being Namae no Nai Kaibutsu  (ED 1 of Season 2) by the ever so talented EGOISTEnjoyment/OverallEven though the story wasn't anything groundbreaking what truly made this film shine was the amazing action scenes and the character interactions with one another and how they made the plot move and more engaging. If I were to take out my own personal enjoyment,  I would rate this film somewhere between an 8-8.5/10 however, this film had me on the edge of seat from beginning to end and I really enjoyed seeing some of the things that I love about this series in general so as such, I'm gonna give this film an......9/10 from the first season as well as to throw in its own kick to itThe story takes place in a foreign country outside of Japan and I can't speak for anyone else here but personally, one of the questions that I had during and after watching the first season was exactly how would the Sybil System fare in another country and this film direct addressed this.

It’s a searing political commentary on the nature of free will and sociological predestination, exploring countless fascinating (and severely fucked) dystopian concepts while backed by a fantastic, character-driven narrative and one of anime’s most iconic bad guys. It’s possibly Gen Urobuchi’s best work, with stronger characters than Madoka Magica and far less, well, Fate-ness than Fate/Zero, though they’re all of such similar caliber in my mind that I wouldn’t feel comfortable ranking them against each other. But the...failure of Psycho-Pass 2 to re-capture its brilliance couldn’t help but raise the question of how much of a franchise there really was to this franchise.See, part of what makes Gen Urobuchi’s work so great is how complete and self-contained his stories feel. You come to the end of any of this shows and all emotional loose ends will be tied up, all characters will have reached the natural endpoint of their arcs, and the story’s themes will have been analyzed and dissected to completion. Some writers excel at creating expansive, varied universes you just want to spend endless time in, but Urobuchi’s signature touch is getting in, saying everything he wants to say, and then cutting the cord not a second later. He’s a remarkably efficient writer in that regard, crafting wonderful self-contained mobius strips of darkness that leave you with countless thoughts to endlessly mull over. But because of that, his work just doesn’t naturally lend itself to sequelization. Despite the ambiguity of his endings, his work doesn’t leave behind any dangling threads to pull on if you want to tease out new ideas from the same universe, which means you have to throw entirely now playing pieces into the mix that just might not gel with the tightly crafted clockwork contraption they’re being shoved into. Sure, Psycho-Pass 2 not having Urobuchi on the writing team (as a result of him working on this movie, no less) was a big reason it was of such lower quality, but even when Urobuchi does work on the sequels to his own projects, like with Rebellion, you can’t help but feel like the focus isn’t as strong the second time around. As much as I love the dude’s work, the more of it I see, the more convinced I’ve become that it’s just not really possible to sequelize him without losing the magic that made it work in the first place.Thank god, then, that the direct movie sequel to the first season of Psycho-Pass has arrived to put those doubts to rest.It’s some time after Kogame killed Makishima and went rogue, and Akane is in the process of getting used to working as a superior officer under the Sybil System. But things get dangerous when a successful sting operation reveals connections back to an unstable South Asian nation called SEAM. Outside Japan, the world is a chaotic battlefield of warring nations and insurgencies, and the seeming stability of the Sybil System is beginning to attract many to want to adopt it as well. SEAM is holding a trial run on an artificial island created to house clear and clouded Psycho-Passes alike, turning those deemed dangerous into closely monitored slaves. But because the Sybil System is literally the worst and stomps on the unlucky under the guise of being “fair and balanced”, the citizens of Seam are suffering, and a guerrilla army is attempting to overthrow the chairman to stop the adoption of Sybil. And it just so happens that among that rebel army is non other than Kogami himself. At her request, Akane is sent in alone to try and bring him in, and once there, she becomes embroiled in the political scheming and chaos as she attempts both to track down Kogami and unravel the roots of the unrest plaguing the country… and what Sybil might have to do with it.The best way I can describe this film is that it’s an epilogue to the first season, and somehow just as good a stopping point for the story of Akane and Kogame as the end of the first season. We do catch glimpses of the new characters from season 2, but they’re firmly in the background, which is for the best, because in case we forgot, none of the new characters were interesting. The focus here is on Kogame and Akane, as they come to terms with the people they’re both turning into and whether or not the paths they’ve come to follow are the right ones. And whenever the camera’s on them, it’s like we never even left. The friendship and conflict between these two characters was the true heart of Psycho-Pass, and this movie is a chance to give that bond proper closure, allowing them both a chance to determine how they want to keep fighting against the pain the Sybil System brings. And man, I can’t believe how fucking much I missed them. Their chemistry, the way they bounce off each other, the respect they hold toward each other, the newfound sadness as they try to make sense of the companionship they can never fully restore… god, it’s really fucking good. And without spoiling anything, by the time the movie’s over, it really does feel like a proper farewell to the old status quo. It’s possibly the most outwardly hopeful ending in Urobuchi’s entire oeuvre, a promise that for as hard as the world seems, thing are, and will continue, to get better.That said, I’d be lying if I tried to pretend the Psycho-Pass movie fully escapes the Urobuchi sequel curse. Once again, now that the story has to expand beyond the tightly constructed parameters it set for itself, it has to start tacking on new additions that threaten to bloat the proceedings down. The politics of the new setting are all very well-realized, and it makes for a nice sort of “bottle episode” feel, but there are definitely a few too many new characters to comfortably fit. There’s a squad of cybernetic mercenaries, in particular, that feels like they’re only here to expand the runtime and give Kogami someone new to fight hand-to-hand. But the gadgets and gizmos they fight with aren’t interesting enough to make them stand out, and the one woman on the team wears the stupidest fucking fanservice outfit with her oversized tits just about spilling out of her shirt, so it just ends up feeling more stupid than anything else. It’s the one part of the film that feels like the second season in a bad way, a sloppy, juveline aping of the first season’s maturity, mistaking shock value for genuine darkness and tension.But you know what? For all those complaints, the fact of the matter is, this movie accomplishes what the second season couldn’t even come close to: it felt like Psycho-Pass. It felt like a proper story set in the world of the Sybil System, with the same pitch-black-yet-doggedly-hopeful dystopian edge and an actual worthwhile addition to the franchise’s overall picture. It’s got great character work between its central players and provides proper closure to the first season’s ambiguity. It’s full of nasty, fascinating technological advances that raise dark questions about the possibilities of future societies. And while I’m still not the biggest fan of the franchise’s aesthetic- Production IG’s early-2010s washed-out bloom look is never not gonna make me have PTSD flashbacks to Guilty Crown- it still takes advantage of its movie budget to pull off some spectacular, evocative setpieces that hit hard and spray dizzying litres of blood across the pavement. It’s also got proof that CG elements can actually blend almost seamlessly with 2D shows, as long as they’re drawn in the same style and actually animated at full frames per second instead of like stuttering dial-up connections. Seriously, I was really damn impressed by how well the big 3D machines and robots integrated with the hand-drawn backgrounds and characters. Never let it be said that this franchise lacks for artistry.In the end, what I most come away from this movie with is a sense of hope. Not just for the surprising optimism of its conclusion and what it means for the people living in the world, but for the franchise a whole. Urobuchi’s work is hard to sequel, but the Psycho-Pass Movie proves it can be done. It’s still possible to draw legitimately worthwhile follow-ups from his closely woven narratives, to find stories still worth telling even after the curtain falls. Whether or not the Sinners of the System films and third season can make good on that potential remains to be seen, but at the very least, I know this franchise still has life. And that's an achievement worth celebrating. failure of Psycho-Pass 2 to re-capture its brilliance couldn’t help but raise the question of how much of a franchise there really was to this franchise.See, part of what makes Gen Urobuchi’s work so great is how complete and self-contained his stories feel. You come to the end of any of this shows and all emotional loose ends will be tied up, all characters will have reached the natural endpoint of their arcs, and the story’s themes will have been analyzed and dissected to completion. Some writers excel at creating expansive, varied universes you just want to spend endless time in, but Urobuchi’s signature touch is getting in, saying everything he wants to say, and then cutting the cord not a second later. He’s a remarkably efficient writer in that regard, crafting wonderful self-contained mobius strips of darkness that leave you with countless thoughts to endlessly mull over. But because of that, his work just doesn’t naturally lend itself to sequelization. Despite the ambiguity of his endings, his work doesn’t leave behind any dangling threads to pull on if you want to tease out new ideas from the same universe, which means you have to throw entirely now playing pieces into the mix that just might not gel with the tightly crafted clockwork contraption they’re being shoved into. Sure, Psycho-Pass 2 not having Urobuchi on the writing team (as a result of him working on this movie, no less) was a big reason it was of such lower quality, but even when Urobuchi does work on the sequels to his own projects, like with Rebellion, you can’t help but feel like the focus isn’t as strong the second time around. As much as I love the dude’s work, the more of it I see, the more convinced I’ve become that it’s just not really possible to sequelize him without losing the magic that made it work in the first place.Thank god, then, that the direct movie sequel to the first season of Psycho-Pass has arrived to put those doubts to rest.It’s some time after Kogame killed Makishima and went rogue, and Akane is in the process of getting used to working as a superior officer under the Sybil System. But things get dangerous when a successful sting operation reveals connections back to an unstable South Asian nation called SEAM. Outside Japan, the world is a chaotic battlefield of warring nations and insurgencies, and the seeming stability of the Sybil System is beginning to attract many to want to adopt it as well. SEAM is holding a trial run on an artificial island created to house clear and clouded Psycho-Passes alike, turning those deemed dangerous into closely monitored slaves.

If I said that season 2 was disappointing because it was just like watching a rerun, this one is disappointing because it\'s nothing like the original Psycho-Pass. It\'s more like your standard American action movie, they just need to add Bruce Willis to the voice cast for perfection.The movie explains that Japan is the only functioning country in the world, due to the Sybil system, and the rest of the world is just one big warzone with no functioning governments. Japan is leading an effort to stabilize the region by having Sybil remotely manage foreign countries as well, starting with the...South East Asian Union, which was in the middle of a bloody civil war. After a terrorist attack in Japan, which appears to have originated in the SEAU, and with a possible sighting of the escaped enforcer Shinya Kougami in the area, inspector Akane Tsunemori heads to the SEAU to asset how Sybil manages the area, who is behind the terrorist attack in Japan and hopefully catch Kougami while at it.Whether it sounds interesting or not, from the point where Tsunemori arrives in the SEAU there\'s hardly anything in the movie similar to Psycho-Pass, apart form the occasional mention - it\'s basically just a war between a ruling junta and guerilla fighters, just explosions and guns. We\'ve all seen dozens if not hundreds of movies exactly like that.Anyway, if you\'re just looking for the casual ""let\'s watch people kill each other"" movie, go ahead, or you might as well just watch ""Die Hard"" again. If you\'re looking for anything unique, you won\'t find it here.Art - Same as the TV anime so it gets the same score. Sound is excellent, especially if you have a 5.1 system.

Sound is excellent, especially if you have a 5.1 system.', ""Psycho-Pass, one of my favourite anime besides Pokemon, Gurren Lagaan, Steins;Gate and Cowboy Bebop. Nothing else ever drew me in closer and made me binge-watch the hell out of it. Heck! While I was watching Trigun, I put it On-hold for a day or two, and I started watching it, WITH NO BREAKS IN BETWEEN! But when I heard there was a movie, I had to look it up. And let me tell you, it was mid Trigun ALL OVER again (except this time, with Serial Experiments Lain [The show was good, but in a battle of engagement, it was pretty one-sided]). So let's clear...our Psycho-Pass and file in our cases, this is Psycho-Pass-The Movie.Story - 10/10The show explores a pretty interesting concept, what the world would be like if we implemented the Sibyl System to Third-World countries.  Some might say it would work, others might argue otherwise. And that’s what makes the story so engaging. Our main protagonist is also dragged into the conflict of the country of SEAUn, trying to piece the jigsaw pieces and to see the big picture, just like the first episode of the main series. As always, Gen Urobuchi nails this part of the story. Making the world more relatable, engaging, breath-taking and fleshed out, all while going through all kinds of themes, such as, ‘when it’s over, what do you do?’ Or ‘Is the Sibyl System REALLY the best choice?’ Or ‘Is Psycho-Pass 2 part of this movie?’ To the latter, I say, No (PRAISE THE LORD!). To the others I say, watch the movie and see for yourself. Yes, the dialogue can get a little heavy at times, but knowing Gen Urobuchi, he can make ANY exposition engaging. When we hear exposition, we think ‘droning’, ’boring’ or ‘is it lunch time yet?’ When we hear exposition in movies, we think ‘Oh God!’, ‘How much LONGER!!!!’ and ‘Kill me NOW!’ But in this case, none of these points EVER popped up. We think ‘engaging’, ‘wonder’, ‘thought-provoking’, ‘educating’, and ‘Yup, its Gen Urobuchi.’.Art – 10/10What did you expect? Of course, the art is great. It has Great shot composition, atmospheric settings and, of course, gorgeous visuals. And we can NOT talk about Psycho-Pass’s visuals without talking about the gore, and talk about gore I shall. You know it’s Psycho-Pass when gore is kept to a bare minimum, but show it SO well. For those of you who were unlucky enough to watch Psycho-Pass 2, you must have noticed that the Dominator was used too many times, as opposed to the first season, where the paralyze mode is used the most, and the Lethal Eliminator is preserved for the perpetrators. This is akin to the rules from, where else, OUR world. Police are highly advised AGAINST using guns on an unarmed civilian, but rather as a means to intimidate criminals and force them into a corner. The gun holds a LOT of responsibility, just like our Dominators. How will they be used? Who will be at the receiving end? Is this gonna look like a sexual innuendo? Why use it? There’s a lot to consider it. It’s not just a weapon of awesomeness; it’s a glow stick of HEAVY responsibility, with enough firepower to WRECK SHIT UP!!Sound – 9/10It’s the same as always. That’s what I like about this movie; it stays true to what Psycho Pass is about.However, in the case of the sub, it gets kinda shaky. Approximately, one-third of the movie is plastered in ‘engrish’. It really gets in your nerves from time to time. I know they’re foreigners, but couldn’t you ask a foreigner to do that? It’s not that hard. If there’s one engrish I can handle, it’s from Kana Hanazawa. Her English was pretty fluent, even though it falls into engrish territory. All in all, this might be the weakest point, but I can’t tell, not until I hear the dubbed version (which might take a while).Characters – 10/10Just like how we cannot talk about Psycho-Pass without the Dominator, we can’t talk about Gen Urobuchi’s work without talking about the characters. The story takes places after the events of Psycho-Pass (NOT the second season, as I do NOT consider it canon), and the character’s growth is quite evident. Akane Tsunemori is back, and she’s not as naïve as she was before. She now has a lot of responsibility on her hands, considering she’s going on a business trip to SEAUn to determine the worth of the Sibyl System. She was one of my favourite characters of the series, and it’s good to see her character grow. Some of you may be thinking, “HEY! Where’s Shinya Kougami? Well, he’s here too, but for spoiler reasons, I cannot disclose what he is doing at the moment, but it does show what would happen when someone from a highly sophisticated justice system quit and try to look for some peace and quiet. He’s a man looking for some piece and quite, only to find wherever he went was a battlefield. I mean, COME ON! He went through a LOT, and the guy couldn’t just catch a break. And here’s where the movie throws a curve ball of jaw-dropping proportions. The characters from the second season, is back, though minor, and their characters are more stable. Yeah, even I couldn’t believe it. If you saw the second season, your perception of them might be little critical. But when I saw it, it kind of makes sense. And let’s not forget about the side characters, they played a HUGE role in the series. From the twists, the climax, AND the action scenes, they never lose their spotlight. And let’s not forget about Sem. He fought with a machine gun, WHILE WEARING A LUNGI! For those of you who don’t know, a lungi is a long piece of cloth. It’s like a poor man’s towel; less absorby, it's more like a substitute for pants. It is to Bangladesh, what the towel is to space (So long, and thanks for all the fish).Enjoyment – 10/10Guys, I put Serial Experiments Lain on hold, just to watch this gem. OF COURSE I ENJOYED IT! However, this time I won’t factor in my enjoyment, but rather the enjoyment of the fans. I am a fan, but this isn’t about me. It’s about YOU. The movie came weeks after the second season, so people might have been turned off and avoided it. For those who didn’t, were REALLY lucky bastards. For those who didn’t watch the second season, they’ll definitely enjoy it. But for those who did, will find it to be a breath of fresh air. It’s like wearing a pair of fresh new underwear on the morning of New Year’s Eve after taking a bath. It feels GREAT!!! But will newcomers enjoy it? If they want to, they’re better off watching anime first, and avoid the second season for the sake of not ruining their vibe.Overall – 10/10 (Of course! WHY NOT 10/10?)Ask me if I recommend it or not one more time, I swear I’m going to douse your face into a bucket of freezing water, and then punching you in the face while yelling’ “NO SHIT SHERLOCK! OF COURSE I RECOMMEND IT!!” Many people thought that Psycho-Pass 2 would give the series some closure, when in reality; this movie did a better job of doing that. Being a Psycho-Pass fan, this movie really put me in déjà vu territory again. Just like how I put a series on hold just to watch Akane get pushed into the action right away, I put another series on hold just to watch Akane go back to where she was in the first episode, but this time, she’s better and stronger. Strong enough to take the job and make it out even stronger than before. You can tell that the staff pulled absolutely no punches on this one, and it definitely shows.But this is not the end of the sci-fi marathon. Oh no. Next we’re diving into an anime that just seems to get better and better, as time goes by. our Psycho-Pass and file in our cases, this is Psycho-Pass-The Movie.Story - 10/10The show explores a pretty interesting concept, what the world would be like if we implemented the Sibyl System to Third-World countries.

Psycho Pass S1 Was Really Good For Me With Makishima And Kougami It Was Just Awesome As 2 Minds Which Are Alike Yet Different At The Same Time. It Is By Far My Most Favourite Season And Then There Was S2 Which Completly Sucked For Me As The People Even Forgot What Happened In S1. Altogther S2 Was Ok For Me But Was Not As Good As S1. Ok Now Back To The Review.----------------------------------------------------------------------------Story: 9/10Finally Kougami shows up and is even more badass than ever. The story brings a whole new level to it as this...is not set in Japan but in overseas. We now know how strong/brutal Sybil System Is. As the synopsis says it has exported itself to a differnt country and well you know what will happen next without me even telling you, Yes? We are shown a new light to the story itself with the country having it\'s own problems and when Akane learns the truth about the country, what will she do? Watch the movie to find out yourself. Kougami also explains himself of why he is in that country and doing stuff. There was really some plot twist in the end so enjoy it. I want a S3 please. I again alomost forgot that S2 was like it never happened. It was like the movie is the true sequel to S1 for me though.Sound: 9/10Another of my favourite part is here. Hail the epic soundtrack of Psycho Pass. Now again the OP + ED was done by EGOIST And Ling Tosite Sigure which again ended up pretty awesome. The OST again was pretty good and some of my favourite OST from S1 were also there. Oh wait there is more the voice was just epic. The overseas characters talked in English. Yes English. And not just for few mins, every chance the movie got it put up the English voice version of characters so it was completly new way of doing things as most anime just add the Japanese audio when the characters are in different countries. I agree that the English was kinda akward but it makes everything feel unique and make you feel like that we really are in a differnt country. There are times when all the characters speak in Japanese but it is explained that Akane or whoever used the translator so well it\'s good.Characters: 8/10We are introduced to new characters, new temporary villian and again new temporary characters. Kougami has now changed a lot. Goddamn how i missed him a lot in S2. He\'s the same yet not the same just as how I mentioned the Makishima lin above. I hope if there will be a S3 he will be in there as Psycho Pass is boring without him sadly. Also with the English voiceover it feels that the characters are unique and have more to it. English VA did a damn good job in voicing people right even though the voice kinda feels weird. I can\'t say more on other characters as they will become ""SPOILERS"" and I write Spoiler-free stuff only.Animation: 8/10There were some light drop in the movie but overall it was pretty good too. Exploding stuff animation was good and so was the gun animation wait there was more there is a really good animation scene watch the movie as I couldn\'t take the Screenshot of it. The contrast of SEAun was really good to look at as it was different than the ones in S1 and S2. There were no failure or animation drop in the movie (There was light drop in a part though.) Well it\'s a movie afterall. Well there\'s nothing here. Now let\'s jump to the next topic.Enjoyment: 8/10TBH there wasn\'t much scenes that you could enjoy as this was a complete serious movie. I don\'t remember seeing any enjoyable scene but well there were the fight scenes between Kougami and *SPOILER* You can in other words say that the serious tory was enjoyable atleast. Watch out for the new type of dominators and stuff cause they are pretty awesome and one day I would like to ride em (Well that will happen when I am real old I guess)----------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall: Why is this not S2? Ok overall it\'s good. I want more, give me more Kougami and a S3 please (TBH I don\'t believe there will be a S3 as Kougami\'s journey has been ended in this movie. Even if there will be a S3 Akane again would be the Main Character) 11/10 would see again after a few months to remember how good Kougami is and will be.Overall Score: 8.4----------------------------------------------------------------------------Personal Note: These are entirely my opinions and you don\'t have to agree or disagree with me. is not set in Japan but in overseas. We now know how strong/brutal Sybil System Is. As the synopsis says it has exported itself to a differnt country and well you know what will happen next without me even telling you, Yes? We are shown a new light to the story itself with the country having it\'s own problems and when Akane learns the truth about the country, what will she do? Watch the movie to find out yourself. Kougami also explains himself of why he is in that country and doing stuff. There was really some plot twist in the end so enjoy it. I want a S3 please. I again alomost forgot that S2 was like it never happened. It was like the movie is the true sequel to S1 for me though.Sound: 9/10Another of my favourite part is here. Hail the epic soundtrack of Psycho Pass. Now again the OP + ED was done by EGOIST And Ling Tosite Sigure which again ended up pretty awesome. The OST again was pretty good and some of my favourite OST from S1 were also there. Oh wait there is more the voice was just epic. The overseas characters talked in English. Yes English. And not just for few mins, every chance the movie got it put up the English voice version of characters so it was completly new way of doing things as most anime just add the Japanese audio when the characters are in different countries. I agree that the English was kinda akward but it makes everything feel unique and make you feel like that we really are in a differnt country. There are times when all the characters speak in Japanese but it is explained that Akane or whoever used the translator so well it\'s good.Characters: 8/10We are introduced to new characters, new temporary villian and again new temporary characters. Kougami has now changed a lot. Goddamn how i missed him a lot in S2. He\'s the same yet not the same just as how I mentioned the Makishima lin above. I hope if there will be a S3 he will be in there as Psycho Pass is boring without him sadly. Also with the English voiceover it feels that the characters are unique and have more to it. English VA did a damn good job in voicing people right even though the voice kinda feels weird. I can\'t say more on other characters as they will become ""SPOILERS"" and I write Spoiler-free stuff only.Animation: 8/10There were some light drop in the movie but overall it was pretty good too.

Thanks for the enlightenment, man. The choice bits this time include name dropping a Proust book that a terrorist is reading—because there\'s no better encouragement to bust your gut with a bomb than to read turgid old French lit about irrelevancies—of which this entire film consists of; the other stuff Urobuchi was reading at the time was post-colonial literature—definitely not my thing, but it\'s pretty apt for...a movie that is about colonialism, and not in the usual way of militancy or the slightly subtler debt-trap diplomacy—Sibyl is exporting its wonderful tech, starting with Southeast Asia.To quickly summarize the story, Kougami is training guerrillas to fight an SE Asian dictator and smash his Sibyl smart city, and lovesick Akane follows after Kougami to be his groupie—I mean, to arrest him. The rest of the cast plays second fiddle and have only bit parts (Ginoza is treated better here than in S2 at least).Sibyl replicating itself abroad actually would make for an interesting story. The problem is the structure of the film. An action film is not an adequate way to explore these ideas. There\'s no sense of world building like the original series had. It\'s just exoticism. A new locale to do the same thing, but instead of a low-crime, peaceful country like Japan, we\'re looking at a basket case country with a military dictatorship and the chaos of a civil war nearing its end.I had mixed feelings about this premise because Sibyl makes zero sense in Japan. They have such a low crime rate. Career selection is about the only use Sibyl has, and that could easily be supplementary or done away with. It\'s so easy to dislike Sibyl and be against it in the Japanese context.Shamballa Float is a bit of a different story. It is a miniature country (I guess created for this purpose) to not only test the Sibyl system abroad, but to get the foot in the door in SE Asia. It seems like a relatively nice place, but outside, there are dead bodies hanging from beams and armed guerrilla fighters everywhere... yeah, so, if you wanted something like Sibyl to promote law and order, this would be the place to utilize it. Of course, once a government implements a policy, they will always keep it if they are able and it is beneficial to do so. Good old-fashioned militancy is probably the way to tackle the problem—Sibyl will ultimately end up being a burden.At the very least, all of this talk about ""democracy"" doesn\'t make much sense in these conditions. The country obviously needs a military junta to bring order to what is a shambolic (pun intended) state. Akane was getting visibly upset when Colonel Wong was hunting down rebels who were spraying rifles and who had ISIS-styled Toyota trucks with machine gun mounts roaming around the cities! Like, are we really supposed to care? Before the modern age, most countries that are now peaceful KILLED OFF most of their criminals. It certainly happened in Europe. Arguably, you could call these ""freedom fighters,"" but there\'s not really enough depth to this story to indicate they\'re any better other than they have a no-Sibyl platform—I couldn\'t care less that Kougami is training them.A bit of a spoiler, but it\'s VERY predictable, anyway, and I think it\'s very important to note that Sibyl planned EVERYTHING out that happens. There are no real surprises and the whole situation was managed. Akane was probably just sent because Sibyl hates her, she sucks, and should die (I think Urobuchi does a lot of good and necessary things with Akane in S1, but she is generally kind of irritating). All of this was just a ruse to build up Sibyl in SE Asia, then massacre most of the military because of their (actually) high criminal coefficient scores. This is a lame revelation because the whole plot is just a bunch of cogs and wheels in a clock. Depending on the way you look at it, Sibyl probably caused a lot more unneeded deaths as well. Sibyl justifies it with an appeal to ""human rights,"" not unlike NATO with Kosovo or whatever other hyped-up charge in other scenarios. There\'s a nice parallel.What I\'ve been pondering is whether or not the writer takes the promotion of democracy here seriously—or if it\'s meant to be cynical. The reason I say that is Akane manages—AGAIN—to twist Sybil\'s brain stems into holding elections instead of maintaining their puppet dictator by the end. Their guy wins, so then you have to question whether Sybil rigged the elections or the dictator won because he\'s popular. Western media has a tendency to call leaders dictators (even when they\'re not) and claim elections are rigged when there isn\'t any evidence. The way I interpreted the ending was that Sybil pretends to throw idiot Akane a bone, puts forward a good faith gesture to appear ""democratic"" and give the illusion of choice to the people, and all the while, Sybil makes sure to control everything and win. Democracy is not about choice—it\'s about using the media to manipulate a dumbed-down public.The presumption that a dictatorship or military junta would necessarily have a higher criminal coefficient also seems dubious. Do soldiers in general have hue issues? It\'s a stressful profession that needs regular psychological maintenance, but most soldiers are law abiding citizens. I know these shows like to depict the ""bad guy"" military people blowing babies up in microwaves, but in most cases they are likely killing rival militants. A dictator and his bureaucracy would not necessarily have a higher criminal coefficient. Obviously, it was going to be the case that the dictator and his henchmen in this WOULD, but I just don\'t think Kougami\'s biases are correct.Of course, I\'m making it sound like the film is purely politics or the script is even half as interesting as S1, but it\'s mostly just one big action set piece. Certain fight scenes are kind of cool, but the animation is unremarkable other than these moments—even many of the fights have a surprisingly low amount of frames for a movie. The mercenaries are mildly entertaining, but they ultimately get dispatched too easily, and fall into James Bond villain mode and talk themselves into their own graves. They make a lot of wong choices with Wong as well—he is completely flat and has no motivation or reason for anything other than he\'s doing his job, I guess? The visuals are complimented often, but I think most of the surroundings look like a playstation 1 adventure game—loads of garbage CGI everywhere.  The characters are all one-note, and they rely on past chemistry between Akane and Kougami to sell the whole thing, but it\'s just not there. Makishima even makes a pointless appearance as an illusion. There\'s very little substance, and there\'s much better style elsewhere. Just look at the cover and judge it by its cover. The movie is as bad as the cover. As much of a train wreck as S2 was, at least that did SOME interesting things. a movie that is about colonialism, and not in the usual way of militancy or the slightly subtler debt-trap diplomacy—Sibyl is exporting its wonderful tech, starting with Southeast Asia.To quickly summarize the story, Kougami is training guerrillas to fight an SE Asian dictator and smash his Sibyl smart city, and lovesick Akane follows after Kougami to be his groupie—I mean, to arrest him.

Once a great doesn\'t mean it can get a legacy.After a whole week of pondering whether to see Psycho-Pass movie, I finally gave in the urge and actually enjoyed the first half of it. While it may have been driven by my bias since I like the prospect of the original protagonist returning in the spotlight, soon, in the latter half, it was crushed by an anticlimactic conclusion.Given Psycho-Pass already embracing their fallen grace, from the great season one to the poorly-written sequel, I was foolish to think that the movie would serve as a holy gargle to wash out the bad taste...of the season 2. And yeah, like aforementioned I did enjoyed the first half and literally got bored on the latter parts.So I\'ll start the points to my review in my usual format.The story wasn\'t bad nor it was any good either. Though a ""mediocre"" term is simply an insult as well. Frankly, the story had given the movie a good drive.Enters Shamballa, a newly-made cage for those who had just adapted the Sybil System. With its inferior function compared to the original, misfits and the rule of the systeml itself wasn\'t stabilized in the said country.Then comes Kougami, in his recurring main role. This is why I\'m always telling my friends that without Kougami, Psycho-Pass can never be such a bad-ass title. He now staged a guerilla faction opposing the Sybil as always. With his drive for his self-defined justice, he opted to act on his proven instincts to help the minority live another day.Finally, Akane. The notion of having Kougami and Akane in one movie was mouthwatering, but unfortunately, their reunion was bland and as far as I\'m concerned, really unconvincing. With hopes of arresting her admired model, Akane sets off to Shamballa to start of her investigation but it seems like the ever-calculated Sybil System had already seen through her intentions from the very start and purposely let go of her so that she won\'t pose a dent to their plans.Thus, the fateful reunion emerges and Kougami showed her the real situation of the country and so on and so on...Now we point on the focal minus of the movie and that is the villains.By now, we all know that Sybil System is a mass of Zero crime-coeffiecient brains, so the movie took a slightly different approach to their previous portrait of bad guys. Coming on this movie is a bunch of foreign mercenaries, which were totally honed as veterans on the warfields only to turn like idiots in the last part of the film. Aside from the big gorilla boss, who posed lethal threat to Kougami\'s hand-to-hand combat, the bunch who were pretty much intensified from their initial appearance were reduced to mincemeat without even resisting in the end and it was such a major turn-off.Another was this Colonel who initially appeared like an obedient dog turned out he is the mastermind of all. He was a waste of character development as he never acted like a real villain. The textbooked aspect of his has never left an impression and like any of the other villains, he was simply shot in the end, splattered his insides and that\'s it.The only villain worth mentioning is the ever-charismatic Makishima Shougo who appeared as Kougami\'s delusion. In the midst of their discourse, Makishima has indeed labelled Kougami as a bloodhound, only driven by his own view of justice. That itself served as a salvation for the majority of the bad dialogues and it was enough for me to tolerate the rest of the show.In the end, it was Akane\'s ""Talk-no-jutsu"" that finished the squabble. It was good at the least I think, one of the few worth mentioning. After all, Akane was written as the type to adhere the law and maintain it as fair as it can be.Ending this review, while the movie has indeed showed glimpses of greatness, it was all because Kougami was included in the cast. Imagine the movie without him and it will certainly, turn into one of the most forgettable films ever made.Still, with Kougami\'s tenacity towards finding his peace or perhaps, his resting place remains unsolved, there\'s still so much to expect from his character. With him still lurking outside the cage, I think it\'s safe to expect a third season years from now. Whether we see Akane finally arresting him, or he becomes the biggest villain the System has ever face yet faced, I\'m still hoping that Psycho-Pass can redeem themselves into one of the greats. of the season 2.

Not even close.I know that movies can never be quite as deep as shows due to the time constraints, but the Psycho-Pass movie was a big step down from the original series and I'm still trying to determine whether it damaged the series as a whole in my eyes.**spoiler zone**Let's start with the most important aspect -- story. There were two things that I really enjoyed here. One was the initial few minutes of the story, with foreign terrorists attacking Sybil-controlled Japan which I thought was just really cool. The second main thing was...the idea of Sybil attempting to expand outside of Japan, and the setting of the movie outside of Japan. I thought it added a new angle to the whole Sybil thing that wasn't explored in the original, which was a nice touch.As for the bad, well, I'd say most of the issues were in the latter half of the movie. Possibly the worst part was the ending, where Akane discusses morality with the Sibyl body-double version of Chairman Hang. It was a repeat of the ending of season 1, but less novel and somehow infinitely less interesting: Akane convinces the soulless Sibyl system (yes, again) to alter its way of thinking through a few generic arguments you'd hear in an Ethics 101 class. This whole theme of Akane being such a pure and righteous waifu that Sibyl itself has to change itself to meet her standards is/was kind of interesting in the first run, but left a bad taste in my mouth in the movie not just because of the deja vu but because of the nature of the argument itself:Sibyl: We had to start taking over this country because people are in a civil war, so we kinda installed a puppet government through this fake dictator body thing.Akane: People want to decide stuff for themselves!Sibyl: Oh, we never heard that one before even though we're made up of thousands of human brains... let's change the plan.While the original series struck a more careful balance to evaluate the pros/cons of Sibyl, this movie focused much more heavily on the cons making it less realistic and more... generic I suppose. The philosophy just wasn't there this time.The movie also dropped the ball when it came to characters. It wasn't so much the members of the original Unit 1 that were the problem, as they pretty much stayed the same. It was the lack of decent villains, most noticeably the lack of Makishima Shougo (except for the hallucination scene) that really made me realize how important he was to the original Psycho Pass. And if Sibyl itself can be considered a character (I personally think so), I think the aforementioned issue I had with the ending subtracted a lot of brownie points from this score as well.Having criticized the movie enough, I want to give a round a applause to Yoshikazu Iwanami for an excellent job at the soundtrack. And to the animators at Production IG, some scenes looked amazing and you drew Akane really well (And I'm not just saying that because of the two -- yes, two! -- prolonged scenes of her in the bathroom) but there were definitely some choppy moments that were noticeable. And yes, I know it's not their fault, it's obvious that the team was rushed near the end of this movie.Enjoyment? 6. Despite being an action movie, I always felt that Psycho Pass shined the most with its philosophy and ability to explore interesting dilemmas that aren't available in other shows. As a result, I feel like we got style over substance.I felt bad about giving the movie a 5 after giving the original show a 9, but it had to be done. Psycho pass season 1 was THAT much better, even accounting for its significantly longer runtime. Maybe they should have kept the setting in Japan, as the scope of this movie was probably too big for its length and it resulted in a sloppy story and ending. the idea of Sybil attempting to expand outside of Japan, and the setting of the movie outside of Japan.

Gone is the gratuitous shock value gore and comically silly antagonist motivations; now replaced by, well... still a lot of gore and violence, but violence that feels earned and serves a purpose in depicting the deeply troubled situation of the world outside of the Sibyl System's grasp. This is most likely owed to returning writer Gen Urobuchi, who was previously absent from season 2.Personally, I've never been a huge fan of Urobuchi's work, and while I appreciate his efforts to bring more depth and...maturity to the medium, he also has a tendency to get a little too stuck up his own ass, with characters standing around waxing philosophical a bit too bluntly and telling too much rather than showing, to the point that the narrative starts to drag. Psycho-Pass is no exception to the rule with Mr. Urobuchi. However, Psycho-Pass by far has proven to be the anime that best meshes with his writing style, as the political dealings at the core of its plot make sense that they would invoke a lot of philosophical questions and discussion.Thankfully, the movie mostly ignores all of the events of season 2 and can be watched having only seen season 1, which I highly recommend as the route to go if you still have yet to enter the franchise for whatever reason. Like the original Psycho-Pass, the movie continues to deliver on the mystery, thriller, and political philosophy that made the first season so captivating, while upping the ante with more action setpieces and a grander scale. It also marks the long-awaited return of Kogami, Akane Tsunemori's former partner in pre-crime, which for the most part is handled very well, and stays true to his character.My criticisms with this film mostly come down to problems that have long plagued the anime industry as well as Gen Urobuchi's writing. But first: the overuse of 3D CGI. It seems unavoidable that every studio nowadays feels compelled to shoehorn it in simply because they can, even though it overwhelmingly makes the animation look worse, feel cheap, or be merely passable at best. Thankfully, this movie at least falls into the category of the latter, managing to blend the CGI in just well enough to keep me from cringing, but it still suffers from the typical unnecessary reduction in framerate during certain scenes which creates a Robot Chicken-style plastic toy effect that makes it hard to take seriously. And in an anime that is this serious business, you should really try to avoid that at all costs. Most of the CGI in the background environments however is used to great effect, adding lots of depth to the scenery, but the use of it on the mechs and other close-up moving objects is just unneeded, and would have been better-served if hand-animated.I am not opposed to adding a nice jolt of action to the anime as well, but some of the action choreography started to cut a few too many corners with the animation, getting uncomfortably choppy and losing its cool factor. With a larger chunk of the narrative focusing on the action, it needs to consistently look good, and there's no excuse for skimping on the animation with the bigger budget provided for a movie adaptation. Luckily though, the animation works more often than it doesn't, and overall the movie does look marginally better than the TV series.Finally, there is the issue of Gen Urobuchi. As I said, he has a tendency to get drab and let the story drag at times, and some of the middling segments of the film start to suffer from this. A series of plot twists in the third act happen a little too fast and everything gets wrapped up a bit too quickly. With these twists being particularly some of the more fascinating segments of the movie, I would have liked to see these points expanded upon and explored more while trimming some of the fat in the middle. And above all, despite everything that happens by the end, there isn't any fundamental shifts or character development for the main protagonists. Everybody is mostly in the same place as where they were when they started. Even in spite of this though, Psycho-Pass has always had strong and interesting characters, which helps lessen the disappointment in this area.As far as the sound department is considered, this is where the movie excels in nearly all respects. The sounds of gunfire, the epic music, and superb voice acting all come together to make this world feel like a lived-in one. I heard that the Japanese voice cast attempts to speak a lot of Engrish with this taking place in a European setting, which after a while starts to turn off-putting, but I watched this in English dub where none of these problems were apparent. A  litmus test I often like to use when it comes to exceptional voice acting is if you can take someone who has never seen the show before and place them in an adjacent room where all they can hear is the sound, and they end up mistaking it for a live action drama instead of a cartoon, you know that the voice actors have put in a good effort. And indeed with Psycho-Pass, I believe the English voice cast passes that test with flying colors.All in all, the Psycho-Pass movie is a worthy addition to the franchise; one that is definitely worth seeing if you were a fan of the original series and hoping that it could still be salvaged after the second season shat its story into a paper bag and lit it on fire. I'm looking forward to this hopefully not being the last of Urobuchi's best work. maturity to the medium, he also has a tendency to get a little too stuck up his own ass, with characters standing around waxing philosophical a bit too bluntly and telling too much rather than showing, to the point that the narrative starts to drag.

The first season was okay, but after that it just keeps going downhill. Not only are the conflicts resolved without any real development, but the writing is unbearable. The show is made to be literally unwatchable due to how depressing it is the entire time. I'm not saying every show should play out like an episode of the teletubbies. Just don't go and make literally every minute of your show people exploding into horrifying goo piles. Is a little moderation too much to ask for?I think what pisses me...off even more are the people who praise it for being super deep. It's not really that deep. Maybe you would be able to tell that if you could watch the show with some mental release from the heavy, soul crushing atmosphere. off even more are the people who praise it for being super deep.

I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong-I am LOVE Psycho Pass, especially the concept of it. But my high expectations were gone after watching it. By the end you can tell this will become a franchise anime itself. If you watched the anime series, you know about the problematic Sybil System. You'd think that this movie will finally mean the end of the Sybil System, BUT YOUR WRONG. The Sybil system has spread to a different country, and uprisings occur.

In case you didn't read my season 2 review, I basically said it was a good effort on a misguided idea. This is a bad effort on a lazy idea. It's got a ridiculous budget so it gets higher scores on everything, but overall it's basically the same. It drops all the Psycho-Pass values of analyzing complex philosophical ideas and goes for a pure Die Hard and Rambo style action vibe. It's a pretty action movie. I don't have a whole lot more to say about it. This movie...was not for me. was not for me."", ""If you watched the series, you'll enjoy this little continuation.I liked the Psycho Pass series enough.  I'd give it an 8/10 at least.  But as some reviewers have said, the Engrish is so painful and horrible in this movie that I actually chose to listen to the English dub.  It was horrendous.  The English dub dialog and actors aren't as good, but I had no choice.  The rest of the sound effects and music were good.The art was top-notch, but some of the CG parts were clunky.  They seemed like they were running at a different frame...rate or something.  Overall, pretty good CG and traditional animation integration.The story doesn't add a lot to the series, but tells you what Kougami has been up to.

Normally, it wouldn't be that big of a deal to get involved in foreign affairs, but there's a catch to this terrorist group: one of its leaders is an old friend.Set 3 years after the conclusion of the first season, we finally get answers to two very important questions:1-What is the world like outside of Japan?2-What happened to our favorite Enforcer at the end of the first season?This movie is a wonderful additional story that any fan of the series will enjoy.

In fact, I think it would be more accurate to say that if you liked the first season but didn\'t like the second, the movie will likely end up being a return to form for you, as it brings back most of what made the original season great. And this is coming from someone who DID enjoy the second season, to the point that I\'ve given it a rating almost as high as the one I gave the first. To put it simply,...""Psycho-Pass: The Movie"" does nearly everything a movie entry in a franchise should, keeping everything that makes the series great while also bringing in some fresh twists.Set two years after the events of the second season, ""Psycho-Pass: The Movie"" opens with the MWPSB fighting off against a group of foreign terrorists who have invaded Japan. After defeating the terrorists, they discover that their old colleague, Shinya Kogami, is hiding out in as a fugitive in a superstate called the South East Asia Union. Soon after, Akane is sent to the Union to investigate the terrorists and bring Kogami back to Japan.Now, while Akane is definitely my favourite character in ""Psycho-Pass"", even I can\'t deny that the absence of Kogami in the second season is one of the major reasons it wasn\'t as good as the first, even if it did improve on other things. So, to see him returning is very welcome, especially since his dynamic with Akane is just as compelling as it always was. The way he\'s portrayed in the film also reminded me a lot of another Urobuchi favourite, Kiritsugu Emiya, being a wandering Japanese mercenary who travels fighting injustice without any laws restraining him. Hell, they even look similar. He also gets plenty of new action scenes, and they do not disappoint.Another welcome change is the setting. Due to Akane going to another state, this is the first entry in the franchise to be even partially set outside Japan. This helps expand the world in interesting ways, though definitely not cheery ones. You\'d think that after everything we saw in the first two seasons, other countries would absolutely be better off than Japan. You\'d be dead wrong, as if anything the South East Asian Union is an even bigger dystopia. For starters, it\'s war-torn, and it hardly takes a genius to figure out what the horrors of war would do to a person\'s psycho-pass. In fact, latent criminals are so common that they\'ve been integrated into society instead of being kept in confinement. While this seems like they have more rights than Enforcers, they\'re equipped with special collars that will poison them to death should their crime coefficients get into the danger zone. They\'re also kept separate from normal people, being unable to ride the same transport as them, which is disturbingly similar to how black people were treated in the late 20th century. The film also does a fine job at tying into the first two seasons, with Akane being forced to face the consequences of some of her actions as well as dealing with the current problem.All of this being said, the movie is not without its problems. For starters, moving away from Japan means the film focuses almost exclusively on Akane and Kogami, especially since the running time is only an hour and forty minutes. This leads to much of the supporting cast only being extras, with most of them only getting a couple of lines if they\'re lucky. The only exceptions are Shion, who helps out Akane in the middle of the story, and Ginoza, who gets some great moments near the end to show just how far he\'s come since the first season. Additionally, if you were expecting the movie to be some kind of grand finale you\'ll be disappointed, as there are still quite a few things unresolved by the end. Thankfully, that\'s what we have the ""Sinners of the System"" movie trilogy and the third season for, both of which were released this year and I have yet to watch. Regardless of its flaws, however, this is a fantastic addition to the franchise that every ""Psycho-Pass"" fan should watch, especially if you\'re a Kogami fan.

I'm sure we all know what a complex show Psycho-pass can get, from the emotion to the hype it all ties up very nicely, It's so perfect in fact that some of us might think a sequel would most definitely nor deliver the promise of the original season, most of the people are turned down very disappointed after seeing the second season, while this movie is a sequel to itself, it would...be worth mentioning that you can still get away watching it without having to see the second season, literally.But the question, remains, does it deliver?

it's the exact same animation and art concept of the show, only a hundred times better, the animations, in particular, feel a lot more smooth and appealing, I mean, just notice the facial expressions, and even vocals and face muscles movements, that's some crazy insane stuff.The anatomy couldn't' have been done better, and the CG scenes aren't as bad as I remember them in the show, truly a work of art.The brutal scenarios do look gruesome and even more disturbing, and the fight scenes are just, ugh, spot on.- Sound (8/10):Nothing to complain about here, It's not even a month ago that I finished watching both seasons, and having heard the original soundtrack once again, filled be with constant nostalgia, but the real star of the party was the voice acting, ugh, they cast deserves a trophy on this one.- Character (8/10):A lot of familiar faces were brought on in this one, but there were also new people to take into consideration, Kougami, for instance, is just as cool as you remember him to be, easy going, and the typical guy that's steps ahead of his targets, and let's give some credits to our antagonist, the mercenary guy, who really gave Koygami and Akane a run on their money, big time, that was quite the challenge to take down.What really cuts off the cake, was seeing how Kougami reacts to Akane's growth and development, really reminds you of how far she's gotten.- Enjoyment (8.5/10):Man, it's been a while since I last saw a good movie sequel, total worth seeing for other times to come.finishing this will only put you in the mood for a third season, which I hope would live up to the legacy of the first season, Kamui was cool, but we need some Makishima's awesomeness.- Overall (8.4/10):I would definitely recommend this pick, even more so than I would for the second season, no hate tho, bot ha great, but this movie, is just quality production, sets off a high ceiling for other shows to  come, if you're ready to have some great action, here's a good movie to keep your company, have fun! be worth mentioning that you can still get away watching it without having to see the second season, literally.But the question, remains, does it deliver?

Psycho Pass has always found a niche that I feel most animes can't do justice. It brings crime and awareness on levels I've only seen out of maybe Zankyou no Terror, and that's about it.Onto the review, story took a turn for the better imo in the middle, and without any spoilers, made for an interesting finish to the plot. But that has always been a high to Psycho-Pass, and this movie did a great job of it in less than ~5 episodes. Art was great, some...really awesome fight scenes towards the end, and graphics are always spectacular. Character was the same, and the throwbacks and coverage of some characters who we were left hanging with after Psycho-Pass 2 (namely Kougami) got an emotional side to them.So great graphics, good story, and the same strong characters all made for a great anime movie. Yes, it is a tribute movie to the original series, but that's why it is great. Highly recommend if you like behavioral theory, crime investigations, mystery, or great stories in general. really awesome fight scenes towards the end, and graphics are always spectacular.

Seems like they could have done it if not for the time constraint but it definitely adds to the story's charm and keeps the viewer hooked without thinking about it too much.The movie was very straight forward and delivered the story no problem 9/10.Its interesting how the mercs did not bother to fight back too much at the end, and their leader just did not put too much effort.

It reunites characters we know and love, it showcases an amazing art style, and it remains captivating the whole time.One of the things I should mention right away about this movie is that it feels different than the Psycho-Pass series itself. Perhaps it's because it's a movie and not an entire season, but the tone of the movie feels slightly rushed and overly urgent.That isn't a bad thing, mind you. It just feels different than the Psycho-Pass you know from the anime. As far as characters and character development goes, this movie took wonderful...strides into discovering who these people are. Without giving anything away, the conversations between the characters in this movie progress relationships that hadn't had much development in the past, which is a plus.Overall, the Psycho-Pass movie does feel slightly removed from the series, but it also offers a new way to experience the world these characters live in. strides into discovering who these people are.

That said, the franchise hasn't completely strayed from his original vision, just that he stepped away from his creation after Ubukata royallly goofed up on Season 2.It's in a weird area of the franchise. Close to Season 1 and 3, much better than 2, but not as good as the following Sinners of the System movies or First Inspector.Sibyl's presence outside Japan is almost completely forgotten in following seasons, so the movie can be interpreted as canon or non-canon as you prefer.In that sense, it's more like a love letter to the fans.Given that the movie takes...place outside of Sybil's Japan, it doesn't have the philosophy that season 1 was so well known for, instead, the movie sets itself up more as a political action thriller.But if you're watching this, it's more for a nostalgia kick, so let's get to that.Akane and Kogami are reunited! They share quite a bit of screentime together, but it honestly doesn't add up to anything meaningful here. So their reunion is nothing more than a tease to the fans.We get to see some follow-up to the first season, as Kogami deals with the fallout of killing Makishima, manifesting in the form of a hallucination. Makishima died a physical death, but his essence is very much still in the series, continuing to affect Sibyl and occupying Kogami's mindspace, because he still has much to talk about with his philosophical equal.Ginoza is in a much better headspace as an Enforcer - having come to terms with what happened in the prior season. He reconciles with Kogami, which might be the only meaningful development in the movie.Animation and visuals are top tier as always, since it's under Production I.G.Fight scenes are still unrivaled, since considerable time is spent in dojos observing martial artists.Yugo Kanno still composes the music, so the new compositions here are also nothing short of being classical masterpieces. place outside of Sybil's Japan, it doesn't have the philosophy that season 1 was so well known for, instead, the movie sets itself up more as a political action thriller.But if you're watching this, it's more for a nostalgia kick, so let's get to that.Akane and Kogami are reunited!

But with this film the cracks in philosophy and values are starting to feel more glaring and obvious. While enjoyable especially with a reoccurring favorite character, the narrative isn\'t exactly bad, but the logic and reason in the series is becoming more nonsense and it refuses to acknowledge these issues in the story. Foremost got to say this is a recommend watching as its definitely entertaining.Now with all that said, I\'ll put my cards on table just so everything said will make more sense: The...politics of the story are quite disturbed. If that\'s the point though why do all the violators have to be murderous psychos? Even more why is there no avatar for these questions that actually makes any sense. Akane is not an avatar for the audience because she believes hypocritically in system of ""justice"" yet isn\'t willing to question the system over practical reasons even if it violates ""justice"". (not that she even knows what that means given ""just"" arbitration for her is deciding who has the right to live outside a mental institution but still in a prison)  While interesting to see a quasi-technocratic society deciding who is and isn\'t of value and how it fails, the unfortunate fact of the story, and the one for which I am most deeply perturbed by, is the lack of acknowledging what this system is really doing to people. Beyond sterilizing them and indoctrinating them, deciding who lives well, who lives in a mental institution, and who dies, its also manipulating and controlling everyone and willfully putting lives at risk all for the sake of its own ego, claiming it has none. It has been continually demonstrated however that this premise itself is false and nobody questions its. Akane does not question the ""system"" at all despite the fact that its determinedly callous with human life so long as it achieves its selfish goals.The logical reasoning in the show is starting to break down, not that the dystopian setting had much to begin with as no dystopia is logical, its the logical conclusion of a fool\'s ideology after all which usually the writer was well aware of in writing the story. But the lack of an actual representative of liberty in the show when its also shown that its not a classical tragic dystopia like Orwell or Huxley is quite frustrating. Having antagonists or villains that act like they represent this doesn\'t help when they don\'t actually represent those positions at all. Even if the ""the show must go on"" paradigm prevents any resolution from ever being reached, it starting to feel as though the franchise is losing its grip on the intelligence it once had, that its only value is saying ""this is bad"" and not demonstrating that there even can be alternatives, it might as well being saying this is the best we can do then and that\'s not a good message.Not to mention the communist principals of the story don\'t seem to be on their way to resolving and neither to demonstrate an unrepentant evil.The story itself is otherwise well done, the characters fit pretty well, they\'re certainly entertaining and feel mostly realistic and grounded, though I have to question a few characters:Why Kougami is still cool with Sybil given it is directly responsible for getting so many of his friends killed. Kougami would only make sense at this point if he was actually skeptical and despised Sybil, even in not understanding how the system works there is no reason he should be cool with it taking over the country he\'s exiled to, especially when said system is going to try to kill him once its implemented in that country.Why is Akane also still fine with Sybil? It has directly put people in harms way, gotten people killed and maimed, elevated the position of a psychopath, all in only so as to build a world for it to perform world domination that it claims it does not lust after for which immediately after saying such contradicts itself and says that\'s what its trying to achieve. Its bad enough that Akane believes in the fallacy that is the social contract theory, but then in complete contradiction to her actual belief she doesn\'t question the Sybil System at all for directly claiming to seek world domination. Remember that the only reason she is unwilling to stop the Sybil System in Japan is because it would kill too many people in the short term in her opinion, an issue that happens regardless of Sybil in the Southeast Asian Union. There is no reason for her to argue that a vote for Sybil should even be held. Not to mention that from her perspective an election for Sybil makes no sense specifically because the voters can\'t even be informed so if you think the social contract is correct as she does she just advised its own violation anyway. The only logical position her character should be in is outright opposition to Sybil by the end, its already shown it can\'t be trusted and its neither reasonable nor logical and only exists to dominate the world and yet she, or more clearly, the writer, is unwilling to acknowledge the violation this presents. It really feels like the only reason this happened is specifically because they need to make more money, not because its a natural progression of the premise, it sounds like lazy writing.As for the rest of the story, nobody else really acts out of place, outside of the lack of the questioning presented regarding Sybil\'s actions. Sybil\'s actual behavior for domination and preservation makes sense and even somewhat entertaining to note. Its quite reasonable to expect that this is how a multi-brain quasi-supercomputer would act in this circumstance, though the writer really needs to show somehow that Sybil has superior alternatives, as a result of this failure in writing so far its harming the story.As for art, sound, music, and animation, its quite high quality and very watchable and enjoyable, if you don\'t care about the reason behind the world or the politics feeding into the story you can definitely find a lot to enjoy here though this does not feel like the type of story you should be vegging out to and a more consistent position would say this story is too deep to get as much enjoyment out of by not paying attention to its themes. Even if so far the themes of the franchise I find as questionable, least in execution if it intends to describe this world as drab as the art implies. politics of the story are quite disturbed.

But that's just my inner fanboy talking.Anyways, about this movie. It seems too short. I enjoyed it for what it is and is a much more welcoming return than Season 2. However, they should've made this movie into an actual season instead because it winds up wrapping everything up by the end that it wastes potentially great characters and story arcs.It is almost difficult...to say anything without spoilers, but the show has taken a more action path in contrast to its detective mystery that it held in the first season. In fact, one could say that this is Psycho Pass on steroids.The story is great, but the main reason overall for it is to show the Sybil Systems grasp outside Japan and to let the viewers know what Kougami has been up to this entire time. Besides the expansion of Japan's government to foreign territory and Kougami being a badass, this show doesn't really do much add to the series. However, I could forgive this under the guise that this overall is just a movie meant to appease the fans for the long awaited Season 3.Watch it.

That was truly touching.', 'Sequels are a very efficient way to promote a series that the audience seems to have in a special part of their hearts. However, when one must undertake the role of creating a sequel, he has to reconsider what made the series popular, capitalize on that and try to bring more depth into the universe. Unfortunately, the vast majority seem to fall into the trap of Michaelbayanism. That is to take your first movie and create a sequel that lacks the shine of the original or is thematically weak and terrible in almost all categories except production most of the times. Nonetheless, there are some...cases where the sequels are better than the originals ever wish to be. Such a case is Captain America: Winter Soldier which was superior to its typical, generic prequel. Another case is Terminator 2 which grabbed the charm of the original and multiplied the badassery and cool factor by 5 while having a pretty solid story to hold it from being like schlock action films such as the ones that followed it.But to my disappointment, Psycho-Pass the Movie is closer to the former than the latter one.The story and characters are just average. The setting is your typical futuristic dystopia but in another country in which a villain for selfish purposes tries to bypass the system and get recognition. Sounds familiar? Akane is the main protagonist again and thankfully she is closer to how she was during season 1 but more mature and far from the way she was portrayed in Season 2 which was a huge mess. But, still, Mika is the condescending ignorant fool that she was in Season 2 and she makes me want to shoot her face with a machine gun remorselessly. Thankfully, she only has 2 minutes of screen time, praise the Lord, Production IG did right. But to my dismay, the plot plays so typically and by the numbers that you feel this movie is overall not something to ponder a lot about. It does not also help that all the interesting theme exploration from season 1 is not quite there. Thus, the content of the movie can be nothing more than mediocre and that affected also the characters. And do not get me started with Kogami Shinya who does absolutely nothing in the movie than say quotes and boring talk and fights. If he was not in the movie nothing would have changed.Production-wise, it is Production IG. Almost all the works they have done have great audiovisuals to accompany them (some exception on my list are the abunai sisters and eden of the east). EGOIST is one of my favorite groups in anime music and their music is eargasm to the core and they have Guilty Crown to prove how good their songs are, which were too good for the show itself.Overall, this movie is like cheap ice-cream you will find in the fridges at your local supermarket. You know they are decent but they cannot beat the deliciousness and smoothness of fresh italian gelato. In terms of standing, it is less good than the original but far better than the mess the second season was which makes it a decent but otherwise forgettable watch.Overall: 6.66/10 (I wish this score was not true).Alternative Recommendations:Ghost in the Shell (1995) for its great thematic information and its well-choreographed fight scenes.Ghost in the Shell SAC which shows how re-adaptations or re-imaginations of original material should be done. cases where the sequels are better than the originals ever wish to be.

Junjou Romantica OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13767/Junjou_Romantica_OVA,"[""This was a very nice treat, since the second season ended quite some time ago. The OVA is just three short stories of the three couples and they're all very cute and fluffy.If you loved those cute moments in the anime and manga, you'll love this. If you're a fan of the more dramatic moments, this might not be for you, but still worth watching. "", ""*spoiler free*I am not what you would call a yaoi fan. I have only seen about four or five yaois total, most of them in the past few months as I have become too depressed and tired in my real life to tolerate darker subject material in my shows. After exhausting my better shoujo options (which get quite stale after a while) someone suggested I try the turbulent world of yaoi.Three seasons of Junjou Romantica, two eras of Ai no Kusabi, Fake OVA, Kaze to Ki no Uta Sanctus: Sei Naru Kana OVA, Koisuru Boukun, and the entire Ai no Kusabi light novel series...later, here I am, watching the OVAs for Junjou Romantica. Despite my relative lack of yaoi experience other than the list detailed above, I think I can safely say that I would know what a good example of yaoi looks like-- and this is it. It has the easily definable seme and uke, strange power dynamics and age differences, a little bit of misplaced homophobia from gay people towards gay people or themselves in a very unrealistic manner, and the fact that literally every single male character is gay.That being said, I strangely enjoyed this franchise. However, that did not carry over to these OVAs. I honestly found myself bored throughout them. I would've preferred it to be all about one couple, in honesty. By switching through them, they really made a mess of things because of how little time there was to actually develop anything.A lot of other things were lacking for me as well. The art seemed sloppy and somewhat dead at times, and the voice actors weren't all that great this time around either (other than Misaki's... that was fine). The characters didn't really have any motivation other than to be hot gay guys getting it on, pretty much.I didn't really enjoy this, and despite watching it literally a few minutes ago, I can barely remember what the plot was.I would recommend this if you: adore 'classic' yaoi, love heternormative gay stuff, like seme and uke dynamics, liked the first three seasons of this show (or even just one season is enough, tbh)I would NOT recommend this if you: like character development, like real plot, like actual gay relationships instead of two people with dicks where one person acts like a total forceful alpha male while the other is a feminine submissiveHave a great day everyone! later, here I am, watching the OVAs for Junjou Romantica. Despite my relative lack of yaoi experience other than the list detailed above, I think I can safely say that I would know what a good example of yaoi looks like-- and this is it. It has the easily definable seme and uke, strange power dynamics and age differences, a little bit of misplaced homophobia from gay people towards gay people or themselves in a very unrealistic manner, and the fact that literally every single male character is gay.That being said, I strangely enjoyed this franchise. However, that did not carry over to these OVAs. I honestly found myself bored throughout them. I would've preferred it to be all about one couple, in honesty.

Little Busters! EX,https://myanimelist.net/anime/20517/Little_Busters_EX,"[""Already seen the two season of Little Busters!. This is also my first review for a series (OVA).Story: At the moment only Saya's route has been shown but seem she was missing something from her childhood that was ripped from her. But overall the story based off a visual novel was very well played by J.C.Staff and Visual Art's Key brand.  Score: 10/10Sound: The music of this season is little meh but as usual Rita sings the opening theme. Saya's song has a strong emotional feeling toward who is listening but that my opinion since everyone has different taste in music for animination. Score:...10/10Characters: Only Saya Tokido's route was in the first four episode. She is very cute and attractive with her hair tied in two pigtails. Even the head of Key brand mention that Saya was his favorite character of the Little Busters! series. She vaguely remind me of other two pigtails from Key's other visual novel and a very popular Vocaloid.  Score:10/10Enjoyment: The OVA is only halfway and  is only ending the Saya Tokido's arc but the OVA seem very enjoyable since it started with a new character that was only in Little Busters! Ecstasy then two of the supporting characters from the anime. Now waiting for Sasasami and Kanata's arc of Little Busters! EX. Score: 10/10Overall: J.C.Staff and Key has out done themselves for releasing a very nice OVA plus increasing the heroines of Little Busters from six to nine. My only concerned is after 4 episode i only seen one naked scene and alot of bloody scenes of Saya being killed (T T). She is too pretty to die so many times but she must move forward. I love this series but it took me like 2 years to have a interest in it but now this my favorite series. Score: 10/10 10/10Characters: Only Saya Tokido's route was in the first four episode.

Score: 10/10"", ""~Spoiler Free~An anime adaptation of the new route additions in key's visual novel - Little Busters!: Ecstasy, Little Busters!: EX is a good summary of the arcs in the visual novel, however it cannot be compared to the masterpiece of which the VN is. That being said, covering three entire arcs over only 8 episodes of such an amazing visual novel cannot realistically be of the same standard as the visual novel. However, the eight episodes are indeed still of very high quality.The expectations I had for this anime, were naturally very high given that I had just watched Little Busters!: Refrain, now one...of my favourite animes that I have watched so far. However, I was not disappointed, and was instead met with an anime definitely worth the wait of one month per episode for. Little busters EX, although not nearly as sad as Refrain; still builds onto the series wonderfully and does it justice.The characters in this anime are in a word, incredible. Keeping in line with the original series, each and every character has a tragic background that is completely contrary to the facade they portray in public at first. However as the main character (Riki) progresses, their facade is removed and their past is revealed. Choice of music in Little busters EX, like the original, is amazing, and Jun Maeda should be commended for this. If you liked air, angel beats or clannad, it is likely that you will enjoy little busters EX too. The art style is the same across the series, and is quite good.The only con of this anime, would be that the second and third arcs could be a bit longer, as two episodes each can not adequately cover their stories in as much detail as I would like. That being said, they are still made very well. Saya's story however, is told across the first four episodes. This is probably because she is entirely new to the series, while the other two main heroines of little busters EX appeared in the original series, though only briefly.If you have not yet seen this brilliant anime, then you should really stop reading this review and go watch it. However, if you haven't already, watch the original series first (Little busters and Refrain). Also, if you have the time, definitely give the visual novel a try as it explores all the characters in greater detail than the animes.

Although LB! EX certainly had its moments, its ultimate downfall was due to its script writing. Simply put, the plot was not strong enough to keep the show flowing in a straightforward, unidirectional manner.Before I jump to my criticisms, I want to say briefly that I certainly enjoyed LB! EX. In fact, I watched it twice just to make sure I\'m not imagining any of the cons that I listed, but unfortunately, they are there, and there are some...pretty glaring issues that I can\'t ignore.The main issue I had with LB! EX was the same issue I had with the first and second seasons of LB (and pretty much any VN from Key that is adapted). By trying to incorporate a bunch of supernatural elements into the plot line, we are ultimately left with, frankly, a mess that doesn\'t follow any coherent flow. A good example of this in Saya\'s arc. Yet despite having the most screen time of the three heroines, Saya\'s arc was by far the weakest arc simply because there are a lot of unanswered questions that forced us to accept things at face value. For instance, how and why exactly does Saya come into existence? Who exactly are the Darkness executives, and why are they such an integral part of this world? And why was Saya able to make it out at the very end of her arc? Frankly, any creator that leaves so many open questions cannot argue that they have a strong, well-written script, no matter how feels-y or charming it can get.Fortunately, LB! EX is not all bad. The other two heroines, Kanata and Sasami, finally get some much needed screen time. Although the two of them showed up every now and then throughout the first season, they are the stars of their respective arcs and we get to learn substantially more about their past. For Kanata, it\'s a continuation of the first season - that is, what we learned about Kanata\'s past in the first season gets even more depth. In the first season, we learned about why Kanata has such a tough exterior for her personality, and LB! EX builds on this by describing the sacrifices that Kanata made for her sister.As for Sasami, we go straight to her past and learn about her bond with a stray cat that she took in at an early age. Unfortunate circumstances separate the two, but it is in Sasami\'s arc where the two reunite and resolve their differences.The one thing I really liked about Kanata\'s and Sasami\'s arc is their consistency (in terms of their plot) to their parent story. As I\'ve already indicated, Kanata\'s arc was a more in-depth description of her past and carries over some of what we learned about her in the first season. As for Sasami, her arc borrows the concept of the ""a new, secondary supernatural world that is controlled by one particular character"" from LB! Refrain. Although I still can\'t follow how such a world gets established (Refrain didn\'t explain this that well), the more important thing is that it\'s not a new concept that comes straight out of the blue.As for themes, a lot of what is used is recycled from the previous two seasons. If you\'re looking for something new, something deeper, something more meaningful than the previous seasons you will definitely not find it here. Love and the testing of one\'s friendship are all concepts that we\'ve seen not only in this show but in a lot of other anime out there. Although these two concepts are not executed worse than the other two LB seasons, it doesn\'t really bring anything new to the table either.As for characters, well, frankly put - there\'s nothing really special here. Saya is your stock-of-the-mill tsundere who falls for Riki apparently because of the amount of time that they spent together during their childhood (this love development certainly could have been fleshed out more, but I\'ll just set that aside for now). Sasami and Kanata are a bit more realistic, but even so, I\'m sure you could name other shows out there where you\'ve seen cold/mysterious personalities.As for character development, it\'s certainly present in LB! EX - to a degree. It certainly could have been fleshed out more, but you do have to remember that there are only eight episodes to LB! EX portioned into three separate arcs, so nothing truly spectacular can happen within that given frame. Still, Saya begins to open up to Riki towards the end of her arc (as with most tsunderes, lol); Kanata finally realizes the true meaning of sisterhood and friendship and how important the two are to her; and Sasami confronts her past, resolves it, moves on, and carries on with her life. At the end of Sasami\'s arc, you can see that she is clearly no longer held back by her past as she is more willing to take part in activities that she would have obviously avoided during the first season of LB.Obligatory statement regarding the art: it is well-illuminated, consistent, and well done. J.C.Staff is godly when it comes to art designs and certainly sets the standard high in the anime industry.And sound: I wouldn\'t say there\'s anything too exceptional regarding the voice acting. It\'s consistent, like the artwork. I will say this, however: LB! EX probably has some of the most interesting and meaningful OP and ED that I\'ve seen thus far. The lyrics that they use in each song apply directly to what is happening in the anime. Yes, okay the OP remixes the first season\'s OP, but it\'s an electric guitar. Come on. Who doesn\'t like electric guitars?In conclusion, will you enjoy LB! EX? Certainly. I doubt you\'d drop the show. If you\'re reading this, you\'re probably thinking about watching the series, which means you probably made it through the other two seasons just fine. But do I think it is the best thing ever? Nope.Actually I take that back, maybe the electric guitar solo is the best thing ever.tl;drPros:+ Some of the plot is consistent with previous seasons+ More screen time to side characters that was direly needed+ Some development+ Good art+ Electric guitars, just becauseCons:- Development could have been fleshed out more, but it passes- Some of the plot doesn\'t really make any sense and leaves unanswered questions- Stock-of-the-mill anime archetypes that aren\'t really original in the slightestOverall: 4.

Although consistent, the plot is simply too weak to stand on its own.', 'Ecstasy is an 8-episode sequel/expansion to Little Busters, taking place before, during and after the events of the original story. For various plot-related reasons however, you should not watch this before you\'ve finished the first series as well as its second season Little Busters Refrain, as Ecstasy\'s plot goes under the assumption that the viewer is fully aware of the events taking place during Refrain. If you watch them in any other order you will end up getting spoiled.Ecstasy adds three new arcs to the Little Busters story, two of which are focused on the already well familiar Sasasegawa Sasami and Futaki Kanata respectively, but...one revolves around an entirely new character named Tokido Saya. Therefore you can easily split up the series into three separate parts and talk briefly about them independently which is what I\'m going to do here.Saya\'s route: eps 1-4Half of the anime consists of Saya\'s route which is the first one off the bat. Saya is a very energetic and self-torturing mayadere character, which is an extraordinarily rare trope to ever stumble upon, but she\'s extremely entertaining and funny to see in action. The first thing you\'ll notice about this arc is how vastly different it is compared to all the other arcs of Little Busters. In fact it\'s much more similar to Angel Beats by having cute girls, guns and action. The story is about a giant underground labyrinth located beneath the school where mysterious shadows lurk, and a rumored treasure supposedly existing somewhere inside it which Riki and Saya together are trying to find. The only problem with this is that in the original visual novel, Saya\'s route is actually a dungeon crawling RPG containing a map system, traps, puzzles, shooting games and more, and none of this really translates into an anime format very well which makes the atmosphere feel a bit awkward at times.Overall this route is still very enjoyable and a breath of fresh air compared to what the main series has to offer, but it suffers a bit from adaptation issues and some slight rushing. That being said it\'s still a very good arc.Final score: 8/10Sasami\'s route: eps 5-6The ever so loveable Sasami finally gets her own arc here, but sadly it ends up being extremely disappointing for the simple reason that the adaptation is rushed beyond belief. Her route revolves around her being transformed into a cat for some unknown supernatural reason which she and Riki has to figure out and deal with together. This is actually a very emotional story in the visual novel, but here it sadly misses its mark completely because there is no time for the viewer to get emotionally attached to Sasami as a character or the story itself because the arc is already over after a mere two episodes. So unfortunately this arc is kind of butchered.Final score: 6/10Kanata\'s route: eps 7-8Last but not least we have Kanata\'s arc... actually that\'s wrong, this is definitely the ""least"" of the three stories as it\'s actually incredibly bland and boring. Again this is only two episodes long, but in this case that is not the issue; rather her arc is really bad in the visual novel as well. It\'s basically just a rehash of Haruka\'s route but from her sister\'s perspective instead, as Kanata\'s route is also revolving around her family problems. The problem here however is that there\'s almost nothing happening in this story from start to finish, and it just feels like the whole thing was slapped on there because they could, not because they wanted to.Final score: 4/10Overall, if you liked the original Little Busters as well as its second season Little Busters Refrain, then I still encourage you to pick this up. It\'s only 8 episodes long after all, it\'s not like it can hurt very much. Just don\'t put your expectations on it too high, consider this more as a bonus than anything else.Better still of course would just be to play the visual novel as it is a lot better in the end, but at the time of writing this Ecstasy hasn\'t been fully translated quite yet so you\'ll have to wait a while longer for that, if you can\'t read Japanese that is. one revolves around an entirely new character named Tokido Saya.

I tried to put this routes in the chronological order along with the first season of LB and Refrain and it\'s completely impossible.[Story]: (6/10)Little Busters: EX is an anime adaptation of a visual novel called ""Little Busters: Ecstasy"". Were they on Ecstasy when they made the VN? What\'s with the name? Anyways, it added 3 ""new"" heroines. Notice the quotation marks? Yea, 2 of the 3 heroines are not even new. 1 new character that was added is Saya (we\'ll get more into her in the...characters category) and the 2 ""new"" characters are Sasami and Kanata which we have already seen in the first season of LB.There are 3 new heroines, meaning that the show has 3 arcs.The 1st arc which is Saya\'s arc, lasted for about 4 episodes. No surprise, Riki comes in and helps Saya get the treasure inside the underground labyrinth. There are more things that happened between Rikki and Saya but I don\'t want to spoil the scenes. The ending of the arc.....well......all I want to say is they tried to make everything dramatic but failed to do so.The 2nd arc which is Sasame\'s arc, lasted for about 2 episodes. Sasame asks Rikki for help after she finds out that she has been turning into a cat for unknown reasons. Again, I don\'t want to spoil this arc. The ending of this arc ended on a happy note, reuniting Sasame and her cat.The 3rd arc which is Kanate\'s arc, lasted for about 2 episodes. If you saw her past in LB then you shouldn\'t be surprised that this arc will again focus on her past and her family. I mean, it\'s all the same but the EX goes more in-depth, showing that she has been on her sister\'s side all this time. The ending of this arc, again, ended on a happy note. Instead of Rikki helping Kanata alone, the whole Little Busters crew helped her.Now my thoughts on the arcs. The only arc that I liked is Saya\'s arc because of Saya, the romance, and the bad-ass gun action scenes. I didn\'t really like the remaining 2 arcs that much because of how boring it is. Hell, I find Sasame\'s arc ridiculous. You\'ll find out if you see the ending of Sasame\'s arc. Kanate\'s arc was so poorly thought out. It\'s like they run out of ideas or something. Kanate\'s arc is mostly the same as Haruka\'s arc except it just goes more in-depth and tried to be more dramatic.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Art/Animation]: (9/10)The Animation is exactly the same as Refrain\'s animation so I\'m not going to write my opinions on the animation again. It\'s on my Refrain review.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Sound]: (9/10)The background themes are mostly the same but there are new ones, used for the action scenes in Saya\'s arc. The OP theme song used in EX is exactly the same as LB\'s OP but there\'s a slight difference. The OP in EX is more of a rock version. I personally love the OP here than the OP in LB because of those electric guitar in the background. There are 4 ED\'s used in this show but I only liked the first one. I didn\'t really like the remaining 3 ED\'s.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Characters]: (8/10)The show only focuses on 3 characters but Saya got a lot more development and a more screentime. Saya is an attractive and a popular girl in school due to her attractive face and her figure. . However, at night, she can be found at the school, wandering around in order to obtain a ""treasure"" from those she calls the ""Darkness Executives"", and even has to fight them for it. Just like LB, something tragic happened in her past and I don\'t want to spoil it. It\'s kind of dramatic but not that sad, in my opinion. Sasame which we know in LB as a cat-hater is really not a cat-hater. She had his reasons. Kanata is the chairman of the public morals committee and head of the girls\' dormitory but you should already know that. The show just goes more in-depth with her character, her past and explains why she ""that"" personality.Out of the 3 heroines, I personally liked Saya more because she\'s more of a bad-ass compared to Sasame and Kanata---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Enjoyment]: (8/10)I personally enjoyed EX for the first 4 episodes because of Saya\'s arc but it just got boring during Sasame\'s arc and Kanata\'s arc. I did enjoy the ending of EX. We get to see the Little Busters crew work together to help Kanata.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[OVERALL]: (8/10)If you watched Little Busters and Little Busters: Refrain then you might want to check this out. It\'s not as dramatic or tear-jerking as Refrain but it\'s still quite an enjoyable side-story anime.Pros:+Great Animation+Great Soundtrack+Saya\'s arc is well done+Enjoyable action scenesCons:-The last 2 arcs are mediocre-Forced Dramatic moments-Character arcs are rushed-Mediocre ending characters category) and the 2 ""new"" characters are Sasami and Kanata which we have already seen in the first season of LB.There are 3 new heroines, meaning that the show has 3 arcs.The 1st arc which is Saya\'s arc, lasted for about 4 episodes. No surprise, Riki comes in and helps Saya get the treasure inside the underground labyrinth. There are more things that happened between Rikki and Saya but I don\'t want to spoil the scenes. The ending of the arc.....well......all I want to say is they tried to make everything dramatic but failed to do so.The 2nd arc which is Sasame\'s arc, lasted for about 2 episodes. Sasame asks Rikki for help after she finds out that she has been turning into a cat for unknown reasons. Again, I don\'t want to spoil this arc. The ending of this arc ended on a happy note, reuniting Sasame and her cat.The 3rd arc which is Kanate\'s arc, lasted for about 2 episodes. If you saw her past in LB then you shouldn\'t be surprised that this arc will again focus on her past and her family. I mean, it\'s all the same but the EX goes more in-depth, showing that she has been on her sister\'s side all this time. The ending of this arc, again, ended on a happy note. Instead of Rikki helping Kanata alone, the whole Little Busters crew helped her.Now my thoughts on the arcs. The only arc that I liked is Saya\'s arc because of Saya, the romance, and the bad-ass gun action scenes. I didn\'t really like the remaining 2 arcs that much because of how boring it is. Hell, I find Sasame\'s arc ridiculous. You\'ll find out if you see the ending of Sasame\'s arc. Kanate\'s arc was so poorly thought out. It\'s like they run out of ideas or something. Kanate\'s arc is mostly the same as Haruka\'s arc except it just goes more in-depth and tried to be more dramatic.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Art/Animation]: (9/10)The Animation is exactly the same as Refrain\'s animation so I\'m not going to write my opinions on the animation again. It\'s on my Refrain review.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Sound]: (9/10)The background themes are mostly the same but there are new ones, used for the action scenes in Saya\'s arc. The OP theme song used in EX is exactly the same as LB\'s OP but there\'s a slight difference. The OP in EX is more of a rock version. I personally love the OP here than the OP in LB because of those electric guitar in the background. There are 4 ED\'s used in this show but I only liked the first one. I didn\'t really like the remaining 3 ED\'s.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Characters]: (8/10)The show only focuses on 3 characters but Saya got a lot more development and a more screentime. Saya is an attractive and a popular girl in school due to her attractive face and her figure. . However, at night, she can be found at the school, wandering around in order to obtain a ""treasure"" from those she calls the ""Darkness Executives"", and even has to fight them for it. Just like LB, something tragic happened in her past and I don\'t want to spoil it. It\'s kind of dramatic but not that sad, in my opinion. Sasame which we know in LB as a cat-hater is really not a cat-hater. She had his reasons. Kanata is the chairman of the public morals committee and head of the girls\' dormitory but you should already know that. The show just goes more in-depth with her character, her past and explains why she ""that"" personality.Out of the 3 heroines, I personally liked Saya more because she\'s more of a bad-ass compared to Sasame and Kanata---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Enjoyment]: (8/10)I personally enjoyed EX for the first 4 episodes because of Saya\'s arc but it just got boring during Sasame\'s arc and Kanata\'s arc. I did enjoy the ending of EX. We get to see the Little Busters crew work together to help Kanata.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[OVERALL]: (8/10)If you watched Little Busters and Little Busters: Refrain then you might want to check this out. It\'s not as dramatic or tear-jerking as Refrain but it\'s still quite an enjoyable side-story anime.Pros:+Great Animation+Great Soundtrack+Saya\'s arc is well done+Enjoyable action scenesCons:-The last 2 arcs are mediocre-Forced Dramatic moments-Character arcs are rushed-Mediocre ending', ""Right off the bat, similarly to refrain i would immediately recommend this to those who have watched the original series - as you'll be enthralled by this additional show consisting of yet again, well thought out, powerful and untold stories: of 3 supporting characters.EX has a good blend of a spectrum of genres, from the start you'll be hit with a very cinematic, action packed main plot, and as you observe these other characters too, their untold relevance is seamlessly revealed.Fans of LB will be pleased to hear that yes, all of the base components well reflect that signature narration - a powerful hybrid between...emotion, twists and dark sides.As a special, you've probably already realized that this installment doesn't go on for too long, and so when the creators opened a building-full of great possibilities, they had to shut at least a few windows to fit everything in. The first told story line was definitely comprehensive, yet i can't help but feel that the remaining two were a tad rushed.It is still a win for the viewers though, a special series that will further enrich your knowledge on that faithful group of childhood friends. As i expected it was an enjoyable watch :)Not really much else to say.So See You ^^ emotion, twists and dark sides.As a special, you've probably already realized that this installment doesn't go on for too long, and so when the creators opened a building-full of great possibilities, they had to shut at least a few windows to fit everything in.

I watched and enjoyed both seasons of Little Busters so I decided to watch these. Great decision.The story routes are great. Saya's route with all of the shadows and action scenes really reminded me of Angel Beats, one of my favorite anime. Saya's route was very profound, while making me laugh at the same time. Sasami's route has proved to be pretty entertaining from what we've seen, as it is full of comedy and transformation hijinks.The only worry that I have is that Saya's route took up four episodes. That's exactly...half of the eight episodes that were created for this. I know that since Kanata's backstory was mostly revealed in the first season, I seriously worry that the pacing of Sasami's and Kanata's routes will be rushed because of this.The animation is done by J.C. Staff, the same people who animated the other Little Busters seasons. The art was just as good as it was before, which is nice considering that I enjoyed the character designs and overall look of the anime.Honestly, I really liked that they incorporated the music box song from the menu in the arcs. They played the song Rita sang for the first season as the opening again, which I really thought was awesome since it was my favorite opening from the series.These characters are great, easily one of the best parts of this anime. I was a little worried that the additional Little Busters members such as Komari, Mio, and Haruka were going to end up being pushed out of the matter to pave way for the new heroines. The characters are as fun as they were before, which is a definite plus.One character that I could definitely identify with was Tokido Saya, the first heroine. Even though I'm not a gun-slinging badass, she is shown to be a airhead at times and often acts like a tsundere, which is something that I tend to think that I am. I got super attached to her and bawled so much at the ending of her route. She honestly reminded me a lot of myself, which is a great thing since it shows that the creators worked hard at making characters relatable.Honestly, I am enjoying every minute of these OVAs. I would definitely recommend these to anyone, but would advise for you to watch the first two seasons to become acquainted with the characters. half of the eight episodes that were created for this.

Ex is the third season/OVA after little busters refrain, here the show tells us 3 different stories, two are about some supporting characters Futaki Kanata and Sasasegawa Sasami from the main series, and a totally brand new heroine Tokido Saya (More for the litttle buster haram XD).So yeah if you have seen first and second season of little busters! then this is somewhat quite recommended even though I think when the stories are so short that it is hard to get the feels which the series tries to give us.The feels in this OVA series is nothing compared to...the ending of Refrain.lthe rainbow faeces of the Unicorn - the good things- More in depth story about two supporting characters which we only did know a little bit about from the main series.- It did keep a somewhat same overall feel of little busters!

Why bother...This is a spoiler-free review from the perspective of a fan of the visual novel who read EX routes in the VN before watching (Thank god).The Ex routes in Little Busters are three additional routes unlocked after completing Refrain. In my opinion, they feature some of the best stories in Little Busters, but unfortunately, this anime adaptation of 2 of them is awful.Saya:Saya's route in the VN is one of my favourite works from Maeda, despite its quirks. However, this route is already, from the get-go, very difficult to adapt arc because of how it's structured into...the VN. But that still doesn't forgive the poor, low quality adaptation that we're offered.The anime adaptation for this route has major pacing issues because of its time constraints. While yes, it does follow the story, it rushes through it very fast, not giving time to develop Riki and Saya's feelings, resulting in their relationship feeling too comical and overall flat. While a lot of people agree Saya's ending in the VN is one of the highlights of reading it, the anime feels like a rushed mess that makes very little sense. Giving so little time to try to figure out what's going on for yourself in the plot, to become familiar and attached to the characters, and this results in a very weird story that feels not thoroughly thought out. It's not the worst adaptation in the world, but it's bad enough that I would rather you not watch it than only watch it over reading the VN.I do want to mention some positives, though it does reference some CGs use the same soundtrack, including the infamous ED. I also much prefer Yui Horie's voice for Riki.Sasami:Thankfully, ironically, albeit sandwiched between 2 awful adaptations, Saisami's arc is probably the best adapted route in the whole series (including S1 and Refrain). In the VN I found that this route went on a bit too long for what it was, but the anime gives the right amount of time for everything without leaving anything out. In fact, I even think it improved upon it by removing the weird sub-plot of Sasami suddenly loving Riki despite loving Kengo the entire rest of the series. The adaptation faithfully uses all the CGs and plays the story out faithfully, and it feels just as good as reading the VN. I can even recommend watching it over playing the route as it's significantly shorter, saving people time. Unlike every other arc/route in Little Busters, this is the only part I can confidently say that you wouldn't be missing out on anything (aside from the more charming art style, I suppose).Kanata:Unfortunately, the good ends there. Kanata's route in the VN is my personal favourite route (aside from Refrain, of course), and its treatment in the anime is quite frankly an abomination. Kanata's route is probably the deepest, darkest-toned story in the game and has way too much content to cover \xa0within the time the anime offers, which ends up coming across as insensitive and unwatchable to VN readers. The anime does cover all the key scenes, but it's like a highlight reel, leaving out all the substance that makes this route so good and makes those scenes so impactful. Leaving an awful aftertaste to end the series on, unlike the VN which was the complete opposite.To Finish:I do like the new opening and ending sequences (using songs from the VN). The things this adaptation does carry over are good and fairly faithful. Like I said in my previous reviews, the art style loses the charm of the VN and the animation isn't anything to celebrate. I do think production quality is a bit better than Refrain, less weird editing and using more of the source materials CGs to go off was a welcome change. But the stories aren't given enough time at all; it ends up feeling insulting to fans of the VN and makes Little Busters look a lot worse than it actually is. Overall, I recommend watching Sasami's arc, as it's fun to see it faithfully animated, but for Saya and Kanata's, I'd rather you not watch them at all than choose to watch it over the VNMy Anime vs VN Ratings:Saya route - anime: 3.5/10 VN: 9/10Sasami route - anime: 7.5/10 VN: 7.5/10Kanata route - anime: 2/10 VN: 8.5/10(If you would like to see my short review of the VN check out my backloggd or vndb) the VN.

Another fact is that, I believe Rin as rikki's supremecy, but saya comes from nowhere and takes the place.Are you kidding me, They give this much key point to rin and rikki relationship , and give another lovey dubby rote to rikki.The best thing I liked is Kanata's route , which is...coming from  First half of her story is before Refrain and second half is after Refrain. I just love the love the way they help kanata from the forced wedding, and the ending scene, Is just too perfect.Bonding is what Little busters Means! coming from  First half of her story is before Refrain and second half is after Refrain.

EX is a fan service and it was more of a added dvd as far as I understand and that is all great but in terms of story and not a hand me out. I think its a 6.3 maybe 6,4 at best. Let me explain in detail spoilers. bellow:spoilersI think Little Busters! EX takes the ending where they survive and shows the continuation in the last route if you belive they survived route (or alternetive universe theory then sure but in my real world of the little busters! refrain they are all dead I think) in the inital series...if you like that ending. But only in Kanas route dose it show what the group is up to and how much they have grown but just a tad bit the other routs  it dose not really as Sayas route is pre little busters and more of a additional character and the sasagawas route only shows a tad bit of what happend after but it's too little more in detail.Sayas route I think it's a cool fan service episode but rating is 8/10 why :I think its an interesting character and in general the story dose make you care for her and KEY again goes into alternetive universe ending where she gets her happy ending with RIKI and is his GF I guess more fan servise then RIN but I am ok. I also think it shows that riki had a childhood friend that died but he didn't know and totaly forgot about her guess when this happend to her rikis parants probably went into the car accident on the same day so was cool to see this aspect and an alternetive version the story was fine on its own.Sasagwas route is a fan servise for more screen time of riki but honestly from my point its a pointless 2 episodes (3 or max 4 / 10) Why:The show shows like 3 minuts of what characters are doing after refrain in the 5th episode and 1 minut in the 6th other minuts are preaty much a cats fantasy world about sasagawa and I saw no point as it didn't develop the character or made me understand her or riki or any other characters the few shots of the main characters was cool but that is it I didn't get the episode quite a lot and there was no point to her episode.if insted of sasagawas route there should have been 2 episode or 1 episode at the end of kanatas route about riki and rin and the whole crew and showing there relationship development a kiss maybe or something. then this EX would have goten a 9 rating or higher. But honestly this 2 episodes where a vaste. 1 more katana episode and 1 seperet episode would have did it.Kanatas route if this route is (7,8/10)I feel it needed a bit more ummfff 1 more episode to really understand and show what happend after a bit more then it would have been a 10/10 or 9/10 really good and if then last episode was riki rin and the others this would be a perfect show. But her route was the coolest but least explored or felt rushed. I do not know but I fell it was cool as you still saw the characters grow up and see what and where they are in the world. Thats my opion.In general its ok maybe I am a bit down because of sasagawas route but other than that it was ok. I wish it was more like I said if you like that ending.

Love Live! Superstar!! 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50203/Love_Live_Superstar_2nd_Season,"['Just when I think Love Live has reached its peak it kicks things into gear and surpasses everything I thought I knew about this franchise. It’s with great pleasure that I say Love Live Superstar!! S2 is easily the best the franchise has ever been and is a blast from beginning to end.When the Liella girls got announced a couple of years ago I was cautiously optimistic about how their anime would go. They had amazing designs, but not much was known about them since they were only formed in 2021. Fortunately, from the very first episode of season 1 I was hooked on the...girls’ music, personalities and overall vibe of this LL iteration. That only continued to increase as season 1 went on, and things have got even better this time around in season 2. The biggest overall improvements for me are the story,  the drama, the stakes and the performances. LL is at its core a light hearted idol series, but this season actually did a good job of creating tension with Keke’s family situation, introducing the new girls and Margarethe’s rivalry with Kanon.Speaking of the new girls, I LOVE all of the first years, with the exception of Natsumi. I think they were all such great additions and Shiki and Mei have already become two of my fave idol girls in general. Seeing liella finally come together as a full unit and reach their full potential was just amazing. Of particular note for me was Sumire. She’s one of my fave characters ever, and you could really see her take major strides in this season. Going from kind of a jokey comic relief character to a real leader and her episode with Keke is among the top 3 in LL history imo. A truly beautiful episode.Now of course, you can’t talk about an idol show without going over the music. I thought the music in this season was phenomenal. Several of the girls solo songs are on constant repeat in my playlist and it looks like Sunrise have nearly perfected CGI blending during performances too. It’s amazing how we’ve come from such blatant and obvious CGI during lives to not even being able to really detect it. Of particular note for me are Margarethe’s performance from episode 10, Liella’s first full 9 member performance and Shiki’s solo performance. All 3 were just stunning.Love Live Superstar!! Season 1 is a must watch for any fan of the idol genre. Not only is it the perfect follow up to season 1, but it’s one of the best idol seasons, period. The Love Live franchise continues to push the bar and sit atop the music anime mountain, I do not see that changing anytime soon.Love Live Superstar!! Season 2, gets 10 out of 10. girls’ music, personalities and overall vibe of this LL iteration. That only continued to increase as season 1 went on, and things have got even better this time around in season 2.

Of particular note for me are Margarethe’s performance from episode 10, Liella’s first full 9 member performance and Shiki’s solo performance. All 3 were just stunning.Love Live Superstar!! Season 1 is a must watch for any fan of the idol genre. Not only is it the perfect follow up to season 1, but it’s one of the best idol seasons, period. The Love Live franchise continues to push the bar and sit atop the music anime mountain, I do not see that changing anytime soon.Love Live Superstar!! Season 2, gets 10 out of 10.', 'I hope that watching the season through to the end will change my opinion. I watch it every week, wishing and hoping it will get better, but it doesn\'t.The only thing Superstar!! has over other LL! franchises is the animation quality/budget. Half of the cast\'s designs are inferior to all Love Live! predecessor\'s, the outfits are bland, the music is generic and the story is recicled -again-.Being honest, no Love Live! is ""revolutionary"". They are all kinda silly and cringey, but enjoyable, with adorable characters, nice music and  cute/well designed outfits most of the time. Liella! so far has been a huge...disappointment for me. Some episodes barely make me breathe out of my nose, the rest of the time I am just staring blankly at the screen or straight out cringing. I\'m not buying it.And this is also the first time I absolutely DO NOT CARE for the rivals, and also don\'t think that their music is even good?? A-Rise, Saint-Snow and Lanzhu all had an edge, a reason why you would believe they could be perceived as ""better"" inside the LL! universe, it fit the storyline. But in Superstar!! I was appalled... That random Puricure looking girl\'s stage was a bunch of ballet moves with a taste of nothing. It\'s not believable that she won unless everyone else performed horribly. It\'s just... I don\'t see it, I don\'t see the charm. There are some salvageable moments, but most of the time I am just angry at the wasted potential.I usually buy merchandise and go to concerts for Love Live! but I don\'t want to give Liella! a single cent.  As if the only possible conflict/point of the series can be SAVING THE SCHOOL! and WINNING LOVE LIVE!!... Again.If I wanted a copy of LL!SiP I would\'ve rewatched Sunshine!!.SCOREAnimation 10/10 Highly above average. Their only saving grace, wasted.Sound 5/10 Only 2-3 good songs so far. The rest are just bland idol songs.Characters 4/10VISUALLY: Half the cast looks ok, a couple look very nice, and a couple of them are plain ugly. I\'ve never thought this of other LL! franchises. Most of the outfits are also uninspiring or look bad, like the previous OP with the italian pizzeria tablecloth vibe.PERSONALITY/INTERACTIONS: They feel like they are acting/reading from a script half of the time. It\'s not natural, it\'s not believable, they don\'t feel like people.Story, pacing 3/10: Big nothing salad.I hope to edit this and bring it to a higher score once the anime is over...

I like the expressions of Kinako, which provides a very entertaining and relaxing atmosphere, but in contrast Wien (a new character in S2) proves as a more than worthy opponent for the top tier idol group Liella, providing exitement and sort of tension.

I recommend everyone who want some wholesome moments and are interested in Idols to watch this"", ""With this being the third anime installment in the Love Live! saga (not including Nijigasaki which is a separate entity), Superstar!! had a lot of pressure among the larger LL community to live up to expectations that would recreate a familiar formula while also providing something new to entice the fans.Unfortunately, it has failed at this goal, and nothing short of a miracle can salvage this anime series.While there's much that can be said about Superstar!! in regards to its plot, like retaining a common structure comparable to School Idol Project and Sunshine!!, it manages to do incomprehensibly worse than its predecessors at telling a...coherent narrative. What sold this show to me to get this low of a rating though has been the characters and their dynamic with one another, which is practically nonexistent if Shibuya Kanon is not involved.As opposed to both μ's and Aqours (as well as Nijigaku), Liella, the idol group in this anime, only comprises five members in contrast to the usual nine… only until it doesn’t, deciding to add an additional four members (Shiki and Mei are amazing, the same can't be said for Natsumi and Kinako) while leaving the original five, minus Shibuya Kanon, with little character growth besides comedic bickering (Keke and Sumire) or last minute dialogue (Ren and Chisato). Had Liella! followed its initial vision from the start of the series, there was the possibility of developing closer and perhaps more realistic character interactions than seen in the previous installments. With how the characters have interacted with each other so far in both this and the prior season though, this seems to be unlikely to happen even with an unprecedented third season.At the end of the day though, Love Live! at its core is a music anime, and wow does Superstar!! fail to deliver in this category. While in the insert songs present in the anime are mediocre at best to downright awful at worst (the b-sides of their singles are amazing though, and it’s infuriating these superior songs weren’t featured in the anime like they should’ve been), the true musical aspect of Superstar!! that it shares with his predecessors has been the original soundtrack. At least, that’s what I would’ve said had they built upon the soundtrack from the first season instead of recycling the same two themes whenever something even slightly emotional happens (call it the Ren funeral song when a somber piano and/or violin plays). In other words, this season managed to make me have utter disdain for the one element of a Love Live! anime that never failed to disappoint me. I gotta hand it to Superstar!! Season 2 for pulling off the unthinkable ^^Whether you're a  diehard fan of Love Live! or just stumbled upon this anime by mistake, I would strongly avoid giving Love Live! Superstar!! a watch so long as you're interested in a compelling story, relatable characters wanting to achieve their dreams, or great music. For those who are among the Love Live! community that have decided to give Superstar!! a skip, I applaud you for making the right call, as School Idol Project, Sunshine!!, or Nijigasaki are all infinitely better stories within the Love Live! franchise, and only deserve far more love than the trainwreck that has been Liella’s journey.What could’ve been a fresh and beautiful story about a group of friends going through their three years of high school together to win the biggest idol competition in Japan, what we got instead was nothing short but disappointing, especially as someone who had high hopes for this group when they first debuted.

Overall, a 2/10 for Love Live! Superstar!!"", ""“Welcome to our world!” The five girls’ first performance of this season was a warm welcome not just to the aspiring members of Liella, but also to the audience for returning to witness a new chapter. And I mean, who could resist? Superstar season one is perhaps one of if not the best idol show out currently out there. So, how did second season fare?Well, not great. Introducing new characters this late into the series naturally comes with some compromises, and this season of Superstar had the wrong priorities.Now, I don’t mean that Kinako, Mei, Shiki, or Natsumi are bad characters, they are decent. They...have strong, distinctive designs that reflect their personas; some of their character traits mesh very well with the original five, like Mei with Keke or Natsumi with Sumire. Mei and Shiki’s relationship is adorable. And although Some of their attributes on the extreme end, e.g. Shiki’s nonsense gadgets and Natsumi’s “desuno” mannerisms, could annoy some people, it ultimately comes down to personal preference and I digress.To introduce new members to an existing idol group is to risk alienating your audience, because people came for Kanon, for Keke, for Chisato, for Sumire, and for Ren, not for Kinako, or Mei, or Shiki, or Natsumi. So the question is, how do you get people to keep watching while you introduce characters that no one cares about? The solution Superstar gave to this question is to get their introduction over with as soon as possible, cramming it all into its first episodes. I don’t think that’s a good approach. The first episodes resemble the real life equivalent of a freshmen ice-breaker, not necessarily the most entertaining stuff.In later episodes, as the characters get to know each other, you can see their characters play off each other better. Conversations feel substantial, sometimes even fun, and not just vegetables talking to each other. In a sense you could argue that therefore the awkward start only makes it more realistic: the more time you spend with the same group of people, the more comfortable you are with them. However, disregarding the discussion of whether the realism of fiction is always preferable or not, it still doesn’t make it any fun to watch.One could also make the case that their addition was a cornerstone to season two’s structure, essential for the dramatic confrontation between Keke and Sumire. Keke’s potential departure is perhaps the easily the most intricate, important, and interesting plot thread in season one left unresolved, it’s very intricate and showcases the emotional intelligence of both of them. However, in this season, the whole situation ended on quite a bitter note. The confrontation and solution is too cheesy, and the most detrimental part about it is the climatic scene where Sumire spills the beans about Keke. But there are redeeming qualities: the voice acting coming out of the whole sequence is done insanely well, the drama feels authentic and there are nuances in everyone’s thoughts that the audience can understand and appreciate. And that’s about the high-note of this season in terms of story.Because if last season’s story required some suspension of disbelief, the story this season is sometimes borderline incoherent. I won’t delve into it deep here, because there plainly isn’t much to talk about, I’ll just give a few examples. Obligatory spoiler warning.Episode 1: somehow because Kinako stumbled upon the five practising, they suddenly want to HER specifically as THE new member(?)Episode 3: to celebrate(?) their loss at a local competition, they decided to hold a performance at their own school(?)Episode 7: Ren got addicted to games, so their solution is to play together to overcome her addiction(?)I guess the only other storyline that made any sense coincidentally also comes from a new character: Wien Margarete. She is the real rival of Liella, hinted at in episode two and only appears every now and then when she needs to. Even then, so little is known about her until an exposition dump in episode eleven, which backfilled her motivation and established a “she doesn’t have a soul of a school idol” narrative. Even then, it's like the writer knew that there would be a season three, so they just left this part of the story unfinished, so we'll see how that goes. On the topic of Margarete, we were told that her performances are jaw-dropping, insanely good, on a completely different level than even Liella or Sunny Passion. In reality, we can’t even see the performances when they have lost, and the only time we saw her beat, it was when Liella squarely diffed her both in terms of music and choreography.Which brings me to season two’s saving grace, its performances. At this point I am convinced that the Love Live franchise has the most talented people in the industry working on the 3D models, animation, and music. They continue to be stunning this season, and sometimes even one upping themselves. Chance day, Chance Way! has Chisato jumping up in 2D but landing in 3D in one continuous shot, which I swear is more impressive than it sounds; Sing! Shine! Smile! has hands down the most beautiful set, most expressive faces, and most natural movements in any Love Live; Mirai no Oto ga Kikoeru is subtle and comparatively muted as a finals song, but it reflects on the growth of everyone over the season and the decision to put Ren in the centre was refreshing. They definitely do cut corners when the characters are not performing though, to the point where it feels like the video game equivalent of cutting back to gameplay from a cutscene when the girls get off the stage.Superstar season two may be best described exactly as this, a series of dazzling music videos with this poor excuse of a story put in between them.

Let's wish season three isn't as much of a disappointment.At least the songs are still bangers."", ""Love Live as a franchise shows no sign of slowing down, and the 2nd season of Superstar happily continues that momentum. The thing with sequels, is that they’re generally not as good as the original, any piece of creativity that surpasses the original is about as rare as hen’s teeth. As someone who loves Love Live to the stage and back and considers Superstar to be the best out of the four current outputs, I had feelings of excitement, curiosity and disappointment.Thankfully, the last feeling evaporated after watching this and even before the last episode aired, I realized any fear I had was simply...misplaced.The 2nd season of Superstar continues the story of Liella! with the hopes of winning Love Live after their defeat from the previous season whilst hoping to recruit new members to the group. All the charm, positive energy, and endearing character development are all present but also refined as the girls now all feel like veteran idols whilst having a reputation to uphold. This definitely helps when it comes to introducing the new members.Which actually was the source of my aforementioned disappointment. When it was announced that season two would be adding new characters to the group, I was surprised. Watching (and then re-watching) the first season, I didn’t notice anything that indicated something like that would happen. I was disappointed because Love Live has had nine-girl idol groups before and Superstar instead focused on a smaller cast of five which was one of the biggest draws for me. Still, I did say I would keep an open mind and in hindsight, I’m glad I did. Previous series definitely struggled when it came to introducing nine idols all in one season since there would be a few characters who were significantly less developed or captivating compared to the others.The way Superstar solves this is by fleshing out the girls in season one and now, with the school idol club in full effect and a tangible goal in everyone’s mind, season two serves as the perfect opportunity to introduce new girls and their aspirations for idol hood, letting their characters bring new life to shake things up a bit. The four new members to make their debut in the spotlight are: Kinako, Mei, Shiki and Natsumi.I am unapologetically partial toward Shiki. She’s without a shadow of a doubt the most relatable character any Love Live has ever created to me. She’s a science geek, part-time mad scientist, loves reading and animals, is kind and gentle and to top it all off, she’s now an idol. Even though all of those are great, it’s her long-time friendship with Mei that truly establishes her. They have a friendship that could be a spin-off on its own and the anime does a unique job of making their friendship dynamic thanks to Shiki’s constant support of Mei into becoming an idol, flashbacks to when they were in middle school and Mei’s tenderness toward Shiki. It all ties in well when the two eventually join Liella!Speaking of Mei, she’s even more obsessed with school idols than Keke. She even applied to Yuigaoka with the hopes of joining her faves! She has something of a stubborn, tough girl exterior, but mention anything school idol related around her and she’ll get cutesy and starry-eyed. She also has a talent for playing the piano. Her character is at its best whenever she’s around Shiki, but she also has amusing moments with others, especially Kinako. It’s not a coincidence her hair is red and Shiki’s is blue. They fit the red oni, blue oni trope to a T. They are essentially the same while being different. They both are bad at expressing themselves, they’re shy, they have similar insecurities and are trying to encourage the other to keep going forward even though they never take their own advice.Kinako is, all the way to her design, the most “normal” of the bunch and is the first one to join. That’s not to say she’s boring, she’s an excellent addition to the cast as she initially provides an outside and hilarious perspective of Liella!. It can be easy to forget that every member has their own quirks and the ability to create chaos and funny shenanigans. She also provides a bunch of heartwarming moments in the anime. Her senpai/kouhai relationship with Kanon is a wonderful example of this. It used to be Kanon who thought she wasn’t good enough to be an idol, but now she’s in a place where she can provide support and encouragement for Kinako. Kinako isn’t the first character to think there’s nothing special about her to be an idol, and that insecurity is amplified when the 2nd years try to ease up on their training schedule since she’s so far behind and second guesses whether she’s really cut out for it. While the older girls’ have good intentions when it comes to handling Kinako, she takes it as a sign of pity which just adds to her insecurity. It makes it all the better when she does stand up for herself. She knows she’s behind, she knows she has to work harder, but she’s going to become a school idol with them no matter what so they don’t have to worry about her so much!Natsumi tends to stay in the background for a bit working various side gigs, but does get her proper introduction later. She initially comes off more of a clout chaser than anything else. She likes money, a lot, like she’s Mr. Krabs. She also didn’t have any interest in idols whatsoever so it can be easy to dismiss her as selfish. I would argue she does end up being likable once her deeper motivations are revealed, it’s just that I wish Sumire played a key factor in that. She and Sumire had and have similar motivations for joining Liella!, similar experiences with failure, even down to similar hair colour! You’d have to be as blind as Joey’s sister from Yu-Gi-Oh! to not notice the similarities. I’m not just saying that because Sumire is my favourite from the OG 5 and I want her to have more screen time (though, that’d be nice), there was a lot of potential on writing how they’re alike and in doing so, Sumire can become something of a mentor/big sister to a first year and pass on her experience and lessons to someone who needs them. Hey, I only gripe about this stuff because I’m a big fan of Love Live and these characters are so realized, but I believe there are better ways to make that even more so.Regarding realized characters, just because new characters are brought in, doesn’t mean the older girls don’t get any more development. Kanon becomes something of a mentor figure, Chiasto becomes more of a leader, Ren ends up picking up a new hobby, and Keke and Sumire’s relationship deepens. It shows how far they’ve all come while also having them take on new roles.My biggest complaint though has got to be the character, Margarete. I don’t hate or even dislike her, but I did have mixed feelings about her in the beginning, and in the end, my feelings haven’t changed. But I at least sympathize with her. She’s supposed to be this mysterious, skilled rival to Liella!, and especially to Kanon. She comes off as someone who’s stuck-up, mean and aloof, but you begrudgingly admit they’re talented. As expected from Love Live, there’s always something else to it. It’s just that I don’t find it all that compelling when it comes to how her problem can be solved. No spoilers though!Art and animation remain as impressive as ever. All the characters look as visually charming as before, the world/background still has a very warm feel to it, the performances are a treat to look at, and you can play a game of pausing the anime to see the distinct, unique and funny facial expressions the characters make (Natsumi and Mei do this a lot). Love Live in general never fails to impress in this department.The 2nd season’s music is wonderful, another facet Love Live excels at. I really enjoyed this OP because it conveys the theme of winning, something Liella! hasn’t had the experience of yet. It gives a very happy, uplifting vibe to this season. The music throughout is all about keeping with that style, giving it a determined feeling. The voice actors continue to do a stellar job with their respective characters and kudos must be given to the voice actors of the new members as they convincingly bring their character’s personality to life.Superstar continues to be a truly enjoyable series overall. Personally, I would see it equal in every aspect with the 1st season. While maintaining everything that made it great, the 2nd season leaves on a high note for the upcoming 3rd season.That's all I have to say. Thanks for reading.そんじゃ\u3000あばよ！! misplaced.The 2nd season of Superstar continues the story of Liella! with the hopes of winning Love Live after their defeat from the previous season whilst hoping to recruit new members to the group.

It all ties in well when the two eventually join Liella!Speaking of Mei, she’s even more obsessed with school idols than Keke. She even applied to Yuigaoka with the hopes of joining her faves! She has something of a stubborn, tough girl exterior, but mention anything school idol related around her and she’ll get cutesy and starry-eyed. She also has a talent for playing the piano. Her character is at its best whenever she’s around Shiki, but she also has amusing moments with others, especially Kinako. It’s not a coincidence her hair is red and Shiki’s is blue. They fit the red oni, blue oni trope to a T. They are essentially the same while being different. They both are bad at expressing themselves, they’re shy, they have similar insecurities and are trying to encourage the other to keep going forward even though they never take their own advice.Kinako is, all the way to her design, the most “normal” of the bunch and is the first one to join. That’s not to say she’s boring, she’s an excellent addition to the cast as she initially provides an outside and hilarious perspective of Liella!. It can be easy to forget that every member has their own quirks and the ability to create chaos and funny shenanigans. She also provides a bunch of heartwarming moments in the anime. Her senpai/kouhai relationship with Kanon is a wonderful example of this. It used to be Kanon who thought she wasn’t good enough to be an idol, but now she’s in a place where she can provide support and encouragement for Kinako. Kinako isn’t the first character to think there’s nothing special about her to be an idol, and that insecurity is amplified when the 2nd years try to ease up on their training schedule since she’s so far behind and second guesses whether she’s really cut out for it. While the older girls’ have good intentions when it comes to handling Kinako, she takes it as a sign of pity which just adds to her insecurity. It makes it all the better when she does stand up for herself. She knows she’s behind, she knows she has to work harder, but she’s going to become a school idol with them no matter what so they don’t have to worry about her so much!Natsumi tends to stay in the background for a bit working various side gigs, but does get her proper introduction later. She initially comes off more of a clout chaser than anything else. She likes money, a lot, like she’s Mr. Krabs. She also didn’t have any interest in idols whatsoever so it can be easy to dismiss her as selfish. I would argue she does end up being likable once her deeper motivations are revealed, it’s just that I wish Sumire played a key factor in that. She and Sumire had and have similar motivations for joining Liella!, similar experiences with failure, even down to similar hair colour! You’d have to be as blind as Joey’s sister from Yu-Gi-Oh! to not notice the similarities. I’m not just saying that because Sumire is my favourite from the OG 5 and I want her to have more screen time (though, that’d be nice), there was a lot of potential on writing how they’re alike and in doing so, Sumire can become something of a mentor/big sister to a first year and pass on her experience and lessons to someone who needs them. Hey, I only gripe about this stuff because I’m a big fan of Love Live and these characters are so realized, but I believe there are better ways to make that even more so.Regarding realized characters, just because new characters are brought in, doesn’t mean the older girls don’t get any more development. Kanon becomes something of a mentor figure, Chiasto becomes more of a leader, Ren ends up picking up a new hobby, and Keke and Sumire’s relationship deepens. It shows how far they’ve all come while also having them take on new roles.My biggest complaint though has got to be the character, Margarete. I don’t hate or even dislike her, but I did have mixed feelings about her in the beginning, and in the end, my feelings haven’t changed. But I at least sympathize with her. She’s supposed to be this mysterious, skilled rival to Liella!, and especially to Kanon. She comes off as someone who’s stuck-up, mean and aloof, but you begrudgingly admit they’re talented. As expected from Love Live, there’s always something else to it. It’s just that I don’t find it all that compelling when it comes to how her problem can be solved. No spoilers though!Art and animation remain as impressive as ever. All the characters look as visually charming as before, the world/background still has a very warm feel to it, the performances are a treat to look at, and you can play a game of pausing the anime to see the distinct, unique and funny facial expressions the characters make (Natsumi and Mei do this a lot). Love Live in general never fails to impress in this department.The 2nd season’s music is wonderful, another facet Love Live excels at. I really enjoyed this OP because it conveys the theme of winning, something Liella! hasn’t had the experience of yet. It gives a very happy, uplifting vibe to this season. The music throughout is all about keeping with that style, giving it a determined feeling. The voice actors continue to do a stellar job with their respective characters and kudos must be given to the voice actors of the new members as they convincingly bring their character’s personality to life.Superstar continues to be a truly enjoyable series overall. Personally, I would see it equal in every aspect with the 1st season. While maintaining everything that made it great, the 2nd season leaves on a high note for the upcoming 3rd season.That's all I have to say. Thanks for reading.そんじゃ\u3000あばよ！!"", ""I remember having completed the 1st season of Superstar and ultimately feeling optimistic in where it looked like the series evolved to. I'd probably say season 1 of Superstar was the best 1st season of all the series that have released prior to this one. After taking a reprieve I come back to see that the feelings about season 2 through portions of the internet fanbase are conflicting and one of the reasons why is evident just from looking at the promotional pieces & thumbnail on this site.Well, they added 4 new members who aren't really bad characters to me personally, but just their existence...felt like an automatic flaw because Liella consisting of 5 members was a very refreshing change of pace from the groups we've seen until this point all having 9 members, which leaves less room for characters to standout individually. We got to know the original 5 much better in season 1 by having fewer girls to overshadow one another & more time to develop them all. Now the original 5 are 2nd years and the new girls are all 1st years.Kinako's a pretty basic character with basic struggles and the least distinctive of all the girls in the group. Mei comes across as bold as her red hair. Shiki comes across mellow & composed as her blue hair and whimsical & slightly eccentric in nature. Natsumi came across adventurous & ambitions. The problem by default with the 1st years felt like they exist to increase Liella's member count to the usual 9. After they have their initial episodes there becomes a clear distinction that isolates the 2nd years & the 1st within the season's own plot. The 1st years start to feel like 1 whole character because traces of who they seemed to be initially become overshadowed by a shared desire of wanting and needing to catch-up to the 2nd years. Then the 2nd years at least don't become overshadowed: Chisato & Kanon continue acting as co-op leaders over different aspects of the group, Keke & Sumire have the most noticeable interactions with each other, and Ren is kinda subdued but more delightful this time around and has a discernible presence; all actually get solid continued development.The plot is where things become a mixed bag but I'll point out my grievances individually. First off they introduce a new figure that is expected to adopt the role of the rival character in the Pretty Cure villain, Wien. She comes across mysterious, determined, & rude at first which sounds like should be interesting, but she appears way too sporadically until the end of the season and throughout it you're never given any reason to want to get behind her being cold or think she deserves to succeed. Then taste in music is subjective, but I couldn't quite see how she achieves the success that she does in the competition. Her beating Liella in the initial face-off can at least be justified, but HOW does she go on to beat Liella's previous rivals Sunny Passion, the winners of the previous Love Live? And the worst part is they don't even show the performances for that moment... Sunny Pas really got the short end of the stick more than anyone. They could've made for good rival figures like A-Rise & Saint Snow, but they get pushed to the side for Pretty Cure girl. They're in their 3rd years so this might've been the last we see them they're gloomy about losing and they couldn't even get some kind of proper resolution so I hope we see them grown up in season 3 and hopefully reprise a stronger role.Secondly, the drama simply doesn't land in many areas or have satisfying outcomes. Like that point they made about Keke possibly being forced to return to Shanghai if they can't win Love Live! provides an episode of heavy tension between her & Sumire, but after Sumire announces it with everyone made aware it's never mentioned again. And worst of all the last big story issue revolves around that bait & switch with Kanon. What seemed like a big decision gets flopped instantly.But negatives aside this series is filled with fun slice of life moments and character interactions predominantly. Liella is determined to win Love Live still but they're not at that point of needing to prepare for graduation yet so this season is partly also about giving the 1st years their own version of a Love Live season 1 (training hard and preparing to take on the challenge of the Love Live! event for the first time) and acknowledging the 2nd years' progression as characters. It was nice seeing each of the girls develop in their own ways from the struggles they faced previously & were introduced to this time around. I always enjoy those simple moments of a Love Live and they don't fail to deliver on that front.As far as simple aspects such as animation & art go they feel just as good as they were before. Music is subjective to us all, but I thought it was good. My only real complaint there might be how the music doesn't feel like it goes along with the story being told. Like when Muse & Aqours had insert songs they tied into the tone of the moment it followed more appropriately with the lyrics and instrumentals.But to close, this Love Live maintains the usual style of presentation as all the series before it have. Some of what could make me cringe sometimes I've grown accustomed to at this point and the over dramatization which feels somewhat excessive at times can either sell a moment well when implemented justifiably or act as a reason to be disappointed if it doesn't land or come across well enough. I'm genuinely curious what Liella does for the 3rd season. They're already playing New Game Plus since they've already won a Love Live! so the desire to see it again isn't as strong as the first, but they could become the first group & school to win 2 of them so that would be a feat to witness if so. While I'd say this is NOT actually a 8/10, I'm personally ranking this highly because I still enjoyed it for what it was in spite of it's abundance of flaws.

We finally get a proper rival/""villain"" and a goal for the girls to work towards, as well as additional characters added to the crew. Now quite honestly, I have been skeptical of adding more girls in, considering how the main appeal of Superstar and Liella to me initially was that less girls meant more character development and focus for each of them, but so far, the new additions...have been pretty fun. I will say that a certain ""CEO""-chan\'s episode definitely felt a bit too rushed, but her character is an interesting new take, compared to the usual cast of misfits in these shows. Now again, it has only been half a season so far, but it is definitely a massive step up from all the mediocrity that has come before, and I really hope to see Love Live be actually good again. It\'s not a hard science with Love Live; it\'s like a sports anime that just needs a proper goal for the team to work towards, and not just flounder about, like in Nijigasaki season 2. have been pretty fun.

We will now continue to follow the story of our fellow Liella member on their 2nd years of high school. With the school popularity increasing because Liella live show last season, the school is saved from closing down. And now they have a new goal. Win Love Live tournament and recruiting new members for Liella.Even though we are not facing a graduation problem like every previous Love Live anime, it can still give us some emotional story. I'm not saying previous Love Live installment is bad its just a breath of fresh air to not see this...graduation problem on 2nd season of Love Live. Instead we get served with new and unique story only Liella could have. We have heavy problem that include tears dropping everywhere. And we also have the silly problem like gaming addiction, yes idol anime girls with gaming addiction. That is my favorite episode.Though we got new members now, the old members is not forgotten. We can still see their characters development, even more deep into their personality and personal struggle. At early episode is what i thought the best in context of characters. Because everyone act so realistic to the situation. One example is how the 1st years feel insecure around their upperclassmen. You should watch it yourself really. One thing that still didnt fit for me is their new rival. How she introduced and her act is just weird. I mean its unique, but still kinda weird.There isn't any significance change in art from season 1. They still got the colorful and vibrant animation style. Plus now there is a lot of new characters design with bright hair color. Actually this affect me on pre-anime hype. There's this one girl who's hair color is normal, she looks like background characters. But after we got introduced to her in the anime, she just as interesting as the other new member. The development of their friendships as they work towards their goal of becoming successful idols is heartwarming and inspiring.I give every seiyuu involved a thumb up for their great job. Not only they voicing the characters, but also sing and perform all the song they produce in real life. If they dance inside the anime, they use CGI and I can tell you that it is beautifully smooth. But to be honest, there are no songs that stuck in my head. They all sound so generic, except the ED song. Beside from that, nothing grasp my feeling.Despite all the flawless this anime have, I still enjoy it overall and give it a 9/10. This is the first anime that didn't get a perfect score in my 2 years of watching anime. Doesn't mean its bad, it is still a great anime but lack something small. Either that or my taste in anime advanced as I watch more and more anime every season, I hope its not the latter. Anime scoring beside, I'll definitely rewatch this anime if its get a dub.

No, it clearly isn't. Is it, however, worth watching? Yes, the show was able to maintain its consistency in terms of comedy and SoL-like factor.This season introduced new characters, including a rival named Wien Margaret, who appeared halfway through the season. The story for this season can basically be summed up in a few sentences: first-year students joins Liella!. Liella! fights for the honor of representing their region. Liella! defeats Wien Margarete, as expected. And Kanon Shibuya gets invited to study abroad at one of the most prestigious music schools, which is the final and most...unexpected event in this season (With a 360 turn).The plot in general was mediocre and lacked the spark that the previous season possessed. The show's finale did not help matters either. For the positives: The addition of new members added more personality to the group, making Liella! more lively and adding more drama to the show. Wien Margarete's singing surprised me, as it did most people, since she was clearly the best singer and had the best songs\xa0this season. And as for the negatives: The songs this season aren't as good as those from previous season\xa0or other Love Live series, but they're still worth a listen and adding to one's playlist. The introduction of the new members also had little impact; aside from Shiki Wakana and Mei Yoneme, who are at least decent, the other two's reasoning for joining and becoming idols didn't make much sense. And, let's be honest, Wien Margarete joining the fray as a rival was a bit of a puzzle, as it appears she was thrown in for the sake of being an antagonist and having a new and fresh face.In general, I believe that the comedy and SoL aspect truly distinguishes this Love Live series from the others, as it manages to keep us engaged, from being sad, happy, to a genuine heartwarming moment, as that this series is designed to be light-hearted and a switch your brain off series to manifest\xa0different types of emotion.

And wouldn\'t you know it, not long after the first season ended, the second season was announced. It even aired right after season 2 of Love Live Nijigasaki ended. I need to finish my review for that particular season. I admittedly liked Superstar, though a little less than Nijigasaki, but I definitely enjoyed what Superstar tried to do, even if parts of it didn\'t always make the landing. But when it was announced that several new characters would...join Liella, many LL fans were both excited and nervous, excited to see what these new characters would bring but worried that their inclusion might mess up the dynamic that the original members of Liella established. Plus, adding these new characters seemed to lean back into an established formula even though Superstar originally intended on just having five main characters. This was especially worrisome because most Love Live series often have the issue of trying to juggle too many characters at once, having some characters receive focus episodes while others wind up getting shunted to the background. Even as someone who\'s only seen this and Nijigasaki, I tried to temper my expectations and keep all this in mind as I watched the show.Needless to say...the previous LL fans and I wound up being right, to an extent. So season 2 takes place immediately after season 1. While Liella admittedly didn\'t make it into Love Live, a new semester has started and they\'re looking forward to what the new year will bring. They even manage to recruit some new members: Kinako Sakurakoji, a spacy country girl; Shiki Wakana, a quiet, soft-spoken science fanatic; her best friend Mei Yoneme, a passionate idol fan who tends to hide under a tough, menacing facade, and aspiring YouTube star Natsumi Onitsuka, a greedy, money-grubbing gremlin who really, really wants to make bank. Things start to get a little heated when a mysterious singer named Wien Margarete comes into the picture and seemingly wipes the floor with all the other idols, including Liella and Sunny Passion. It doesn\'t help that she seems to have some kind of grudge against Kanon for reasons nobody, not even Kanon, seems to know. But Liella isn\'t one for giving up, and with new members under their belt, they\'re determined to get farther in Love Live than they did before.I have a lot I want to say about Superstar season 2, and some of it...you\'re probably not going to be happy about. As far as the new characters go, I think Kinako, Shiki, and Mei are fine. Not necessarily as fleshed out or developed as the main five, but I found them to be okay characters. I do appreciate that Ren got fleshed out a bit more in the focus episode she got in this season, and I was pleasantly surprised by the direction they decided to take her in. Speaking of the main five, I do like that season 2 does put in some effort to develop them a bit more and have them try things here that they didn\'t do before. Remember in season 1, when people nominated Kanon to be the student council president? In season 2, Kanon decides to willingly join the student council as vice president as a way to take the burden off Ren, which is really significant because she takes on more responsibility, and is shown to be pretty good at it. That being said, I really didn\'t like Natsumi. I found her extremely annoying and her motivation to become an idol just felt really shallow and forced. But more than that, I also didn\'t like the new rival character, Wien Margarete. She just felt like nothing but a plot device whose only purpose was to boot Sunny Passion to the side and be a source of conflict that Superstar really didn\'t need. Poor Sunny Passion doesn\'t even get to do anything in this season! Her whole motivation just felt really stupid and melodramatic, and the show\'s attempts to make me care about this emo brat really didn\'t work for me because they didn\'t give her enough of a presence beyond her concert appearances to make me care about her. That being said, she does have the best songs in the show, so I\'ll give her that.Speaking of melodrama, I know Love Live has a bit of a reputation for not always being good at tackling big dramatic storylines. I haven\'t seen the first Love Live series, but I know that had a particular subplot involving Kotori near the end of the first part that really didn\'t go over well with the fans. And unfortunately, Love Live Superstar also has this problem with a subplot involving Keke. I won\'t spoil anything, but this subplot was briefly mentioned in season 1, and it gets followed up on in season 2, but the way the anime resolves it just felt really stupid and hollow. It doesn\'t help that the anime has the characters scream their feelings out in a really forced, artificial way and go into cry fests that just scream ""We\'re trying really hard to make you feel for these characters! Now feel sad, dammit!"" and it really didn\'t work. It\'s similar to a subplot that Ren had back in season 1, with it somehow getting resolved with a handwave near the very end, even though the series previously made a huge deal out of it before. But whereas that subplot suffered from just having a convenient solution just handed to the characters without feeling earned, the subplot here with Keke tried too hard to force drama that could have been resolved in a less...theatrical and melodramatic manner.And as much as I hate to say it, the songs got a bit of a downgrade this season. They\'re not bad or anything, and like I said before, I loved all of Wien\'s songs. But several of them just weren\'t as good as the ones in season 1. I admittedly really didn\'t like the song that played when Natsumi joined the group, but I did like the one Liella sang to welcome Kinako into the group. The songs range from good to uninspired. The actual soundtrack is fine, and the opening and ending songs are nice to listen to as well. But season 1\'s songs were just better by way of having more versatility and a willingness to explore new genres. I mean, why do you think people consider Nonfiction to be the best song in the entire Love Live Superstar canon? Because it kicks ass, has a fun beat, and is a pretty good take on rap and hip-hop, two genres I admit to hating with a passion.But I don\'t want you to think that I consider Love Live Superstar season two to be outright bad. Like I said before, the series does make the effort to flesh out both its old and new characters, even if it didn\'t do so for others, I liked several of the new Liella members, Wien\'s songs are all great even though I hate her as a character, and the animation work is about the same as the previous season, so it\'s still nice to look at on a technical level. Plus, and this is a rather petty, personal thing for me: Superstar has no boob grabbing. Thank God. And funnily enough, a lot of what I just described could very well be addressed later on because Superstar was just announced to have a third season in the works, making it the very first LL series to ever get a third season! I still enjoyed the season as a whole, flaws and all, and you can bet your ass I\'m watching the third season for sure! join Liella, many LL fans were both excited and nervous, excited to see what these new characters would bring but worried that their inclusion might mess up the dynamic that the original members of Liella established. Plus, adding these new characters seemed to lean back into an established formula even though Superstar originally intended on just having five main characters. This was especially worrisome because most Love Live series often have the issue of trying to juggle too many characters at once, having some characters receive focus episodes while others wind up getting shunted to the background. Even as someone who\'s only seen this and Nijigasaki, I tried to temper my expectations and keep all this in mind as I watched the show.Needless to say...the previous LL fans and I wound up being right, to an extent. So season 2 takes place immediately after season 1. While Liella admittedly didn\'t make it into Love Live, a new semester has started and they\'re looking forward to what the new year will bring. They even manage to recruit some new members: Kinako Sakurakoji, a spacy country girl; Shiki Wakana, a quiet, soft-spoken science fanatic; her best friend Mei Yoneme, a passionate idol fan who tends to hide under a tough, menacing facade, and aspiring YouTube star Natsumi Onitsuka, a greedy, money-grubbing gremlin who really, really wants to make bank. Things start to get a little heated when a mysterious singer named Wien Margarete comes into the picture and seemingly wipes the floor with all the other idols, including Liella and Sunny Passion. It doesn\'t help that she seems to have some kind of grudge against Kanon for reasons nobody, not even Kanon, seems to know. But Liella isn\'t one for giving up, and with new members under their belt, they\'re determined to get farther in Love Live than they did before.I have a lot I want to say about Superstar season 2, and some of it...you\'re probably not going to be happy about. As far as the new characters go, I think Kinako, Shiki, and Mei are fine. Not necessarily as fleshed out or developed as the main five, but I found them to be okay characters. I do appreciate that Ren got fleshed out a bit more in the focus episode she got in this season, and I was pleasantly surprised by the direction they decided to take her in. Speaking of the main five, I do like that season 2 does put in some effort to develop them a bit more and have them try things here that they didn\'t do before. Remember in season 1, when people nominated Kanon to be the student council president? In season 2, Kanon decides to willingly join the student council as vice president as a way to take the burden off Ren, which is really significant because she takes on more responsibility, and is shown to be pretty good at it. That being said, I really didn\'t like Natsumi. I found her extremely annoying and her motivation to become an idol just felt really shallow and forced. But more than that, I also didn\'t like the new rival character, Wien Margarete. She just felt like nothing but a plot device whose only purpose was to boot Sunny Passion to the side and be a source of conflict that Superstar really didn\'t need. Poor Sunny Passion doesn\'t even get to do anything in this season! Her whole motivation just felt really stupid and melodramatic, and the show\'s attempts to make me care about this emo brat really didn\'t work for me because they didn\'t give her enough of a presence beyond her concert appearances to make me care about her. That being said, she does have the best songs in the show, so I\'ll give her that.Speaking of melodrama, I know Love Live has a bit of a reputation for not always being good at tackling big dramatic storylines. I haven\'t seen the first Love Live series, but I know that had a particular subplot involving Kotori near the end of the first part that really didn\'t go over well with the fans. And unfortunately, Love Live Superstar also has this problem with a subplot involving Keke. I won\'t spoil anything, but this subplot was briefly mentioned in season 1, and it gets followed up on in season 2, but the way the anime resolves it just felt really stupid and hollow. It doesn\'t help that the anime has the characters scream their feelings out in a really forced, artificial way and go into cry fests that just scream ""We\'re trying really hard to make you feel for these characters! Now feel sad, dammit!"" and it really didn\'t work. It\'s similar to a subplot that Ren had back in season 1, with it somehow getting resolved with a handwave near the very end, even though the series previously made a huge deal out of it before. But whereas that subplot suffered from just having a convenient solution just handed to the characters without feeling earned, the subplot here with Keke tried too hard to force drama that could have been resolved in a less...theatrical and melodramatic manner.And as much as I hate to say it, the songs got a bit of a downgrade this season.

It was good enough for an idol anime.In terms of story, actually I didn't expect much considering this is an idol anime. But actually, some of the plots that are presented are quite impressive even though in fact they are still light on the overall story which was predictable from the start of this anime's release. The characters presented in this series have their own motivations which are quite unique and become something fresh in this anime. The main character is also quite impressive and really has the aura of a leader so she gets plus rating points because to...be honest I really like her.In terms of design, there isn't much that can be discussed because in reality it's normal. The character descriptions and costume designs provided are actually good but nothing more than that. From a visual standpoint, this anime likes to flex in moments where they are performing songs. And at that moment, to be honest, the visual quality displayed can be said to be quite good and eye-catching. In terms of the most important in anime idol, namely audio. This anime spoils us with the quality of the oshi that cannot be doubted and also the songs that are given are actually quite good objectively. However, in terms of subjectivity, it is natural that people have their own preferences.Finally, I just want to argue that only stupid people expect a lot from aspects other than audio in idol anime. Overall, this anime is fun enough to be enjoyed by idol lovers. For those of you who want to start an idol journey, Love Live will be a long but exciting journey. But if you are not ready to sacrifice time, money for other personal satisfactions.

But if you are not ready to sacrifice time, money for other personal satisfactions. Better to just watch ordinary anime."", 'I should lead off this review by noting that I am not typically a fan of idol music in anime, and neither season of Love Live Superstar has changed my mind about that. I mention this to add perspective, because I do enjoy this series despite my lack of interest in the music and I think it often gets pigeonholed as something only fans of J-pop would enjoy. Honestly, it bears more of a likeness to ""cute girls in a school club"" anime than being specifically about music and, in my opinion, remains highly accessible even to people that don\'t care for idols or their...music.That\'s all largely unchanged from season one, and that sense of continuity is the greatest strength of season two. There was a fair amount of consternation over the announcement that 4 new first-year girls would be added this season, and I was skeptical at first too, since I thought one of the strengths of the first season was the tight cast and how it gave you time to really get to know the characters. I\'m pleased to report that, for the most part, the 4 new girls are well-integrated. Kinako fits in so naturally that you almost forget she wasn\'t one of the original 5, and Shiki and Mei\'s introduction to the group, while bumpy at times, ends up being pretty heartwarming in the end. Out of the 4, only Natsumi, the money-grubbing Youtube streamer, felt like an afterthought, and 3/4 ain\'t bad.It also remains the case, like season one, that Superstar is at it\'s strongest when it\'s doing wacky comedy and often stumbles when it tries to do drama. The comedy is still there in season two, the episode where Ren goes down the Gaming rabbithole was a favorite of mine, but laugh out loud moments aren\'t as common as in season one. On the flip side, season two also avoids some of the bad drama lowlights from season one, like Ren\'s attempt to ban the school idol club. The drama is still mediocre with few exceptions, but does at least touch on a few interesting themes, especially with regards to the anxieties of the new girls trying to figure out how they fit into Liella. They aren\'t as talented or experienced as the original 5 yet, and don\'t want to hold their senpais back from winning Love Live, but they\'ll never be on the level of the original 5 if they split the group by class. How to balance the growth and integration of the first years with their ambitions is an ongoing theme throughout the season and they do get a few nice moments out of it, but it often tends to be a bit on the treacly side, like most of the drama in the series. There is also a sadly missed opportunity with a subplot about Kanon wanting to study abroad in Austria that, without getting into spoilers, is resolved in a highly unsatisfying way when it had potential to be an excellent storyline if it had been handled better.There is also one more addition to the cast that I haven\'t mentioned to this point, and she ends up being one of the most positive things about this season. That would be Margarete Wien, a solo singer that arrives out of nowhere to become Liella\'s toughest competition in the Love Live regional qualifiers. She oozes chuuni goth princess energy and her philosophies about music are pretty much antithetical to the bright and shiny teamwork that the franchise lives on, which gives the series a shot in the arm every time she shows up. In fact, one of the weaker points of the season is in how she arrives like a hurricane on Liella\'s doorstep early in the season and then... just disappears for 4 or 5 episodes. It\'s a bit of a momentum killer given how immediately magnetic she is. It\'s also frankly hilarious how much better her operatic songs and theatricality are compared with the candy-colored stages and generic J-pop of Liella. It can actually be difficult to suspend your disbelief at times and think that anyone would vote for Liella over her. While I have little interest in most of Liella\'s music and find their lyrics cloying, Margarete was an entirely different animal and having her sing music that was not J-pop in any practical sense actually made me sit up and pay attention, something I was glad for since she\'s quite a talented singer. Her presumptive addition to Liella in the already-announced 3rd season is the thing I am most excited for with the future of the series because she\'s going to bring something completely different to the table than any of the girls in the group now.Overall, this was a nice continuation of the series. If you liked season one, you\'ll enjoy season two as well. It makes a few changes but handles them well for the most part. It peaks with comedy and struggles with drama just like season one, but is more consistent. The highs aren\'t as high in season two, but the lows aren\'t as low either. The main cast additions mostly get the job done, the original characters don\'t get pushed to the margins in favor of shiny new objects as I and others feared they would, and the new rival-turned-ally character shows a lot of promise for the future. All in all, a successful sequel that injects just enough change to keep it feeling fresh without compromising its identity. music.That\'s all largely unchanged from season one, and that sense of continuity is the greatest strength of season two.

All in all, a successful sequel that injects just enough change to keep it feeling fresh without compromising its identity.', 'After watching the first season of Superstar, I had taken an almost 1 year break from idol shows, and so when I finally sat down to watch season 2 of Superstar, I feel like I went in with a much more different perspective than others who may have kept up a little more with the fandom.I feel like most of the negative feelings towards season 2 of Love Live! SuperStar is based around the new members who were added into Liella. Although I understand the precious feeling towards the original unprecedentedly small cast of Liella, I don\'t necessarily think the added characters ruined the show...or the group. I admit, that some of the introductions and induction into the club felt a bit forced at times, but in total I disagree with the sentiment that their designs were sub-par or that they didn\'t fit well with the synergy of Liella. On the surface, their characters and personalities do have good synergies and is relatively harmonious to the group, I think it is only when you compare the altered/updated group dynamic with the original 5-person group that you feel like something special was lost. But I just believe that this is a testament to how well the characters were written in season 1, and how it is really hard to maintain such a thing for season 2.I probably only have this opinion since I had long forgotten the unique and excited feelings I had for the original 5-person Liella, and was able to view this season with a cleansed pallet, so I understand if those who are more invested don\'t agree with my sentiment.But other than that here are a short list of pros and cons of this show:Pros:- Incredible animation, it seems that the quality of production has just been going up and up- Some good story writing, it has been a while since I\'ve felt that the writers of the story decided to give any thought in synthesizing details and events across episodes, as opposed to the traditional ""each episode is dedicated to a certain character"" type formula (Although it is still present, it feels much more thought out and harmonious)- (some) good character development- Banger songs (mostly), and killer OP!!- The voice acting for the OG members of Liella have definitely improved significantly! Especially the voice actresses for Sumire and Kanon blew me away at timesCons:- Some aspects of characters or story can feel forced or awkward at times- The classic idol show cringe! (can be a positive depending on who you are...)- Ok so what the f- is the ending? Please explain... like why?- The stuff I talked about aboveHonestly I really liked this new season, I think in what it lost in the uniqueness of the small cast, was made up with the sort of magic touch that was similar to the original love live school idol project, and it did it well and subtly as compared to the other love live series that tried to copy it.Though I may be kind of biased since Mei x Shiki made me squeal like a dolphin haha... or the group.

SuperGalaxy!!“Love Live! Superstar!!” is back and it’s just as funny, wholesome and moé as it’s first season.Now in their second year of high school the girls are having trouble expanding Liella! and getting first years to join due to how popular they are, but also because first years are all concerned they can’t keep up with the intense training schedule. This is a premise I don’t think I’ve seen an idol show attempt before, but it’s a brilliant way of showing off the girls growth and physical fitness from the first season plus it’s a sticking plot point woven through the second. It...also helps limit the amount of new characters that can be introduced at one time which helps make their introduction feel organic and impactful.Superstars biggest strength over the other Love Lives has always been it’s small, intimate cast. Were as the other love live casts like Nijigasaki High School Idol Club suffer from what I like to call ‘Too many characters syndrome’ Superstar’s first season main cast consisted of five who were given enough screen time to fully develop as characters, and we in the audience spent a lot of time getting to know them. Thanks to that the four new members of Liella! are given enough space and screen time for their own developments whilst the continuation of Kanon’s, Keke’s, Sumire's, Chisato’s and Ren’s new developments feel organic and natural rather than a quick update to make up for their lack of development in the first season.Kinako, Mei, Shiki and Natsumi are all very charming and fit into the group dynamic very comfortably. I never felt like they didn’t belong to group despite their quirks.The only character I didn’t particularly care for was Margarete the antagonist who stands between Liella! and first place at Love Live!. Her motives are… just not all that interesting and she comes off more of a weird stalker rather than an immovable talent.The animation is still absolutely gorgeous too. From backgrounds to cgi music numbers to… everything else. It’s just a real stunner to look at. That along with the impeccable voice acting makes this show a treat to watch.If you’ve watched the first season of “Love Live! Superstar!!” and enjoyed it then you’ll enjoy this one too. I personally don’t think the songs are as good as the first seasons, but that didn’t effect my enjoyment. It is definitely the best Love Live! variant in the franchise by far in my humble opinion.9/10 Amazing. also helps limit the amount of new characters that can be introduced at one time which helps make their introduction feel organic and impactful.Superstars biggest strength over the other Love Lives has always been it’s small, intimate cast.

At first, Liella didn't really catch my eye when they were introduced as a new project, but the enjoyable 1st season of the anime coupled with the casts' amazing live performances in their 1st live tour made me fall in love. The chemistry within the group (the seiyuus) is definitely special, and the second years have been a delightful addition to the group. I hope I'm able to win tickets to a performance in 3rd 🥺🥺🥺.Unfortunately, I don't feel the same passion as I do for the seiyuus as I do for the anime. To put it simply;...it was very disappointing. There are so many things to nitpick from the anime that bring it down, but I think the main cause for the disaster was a lack of any overarching narrative other than 'let's win Love Live' and a sporadic mess of ideas.The good things.- Production (Lives super pretty, no real negatives here)- Some of the songs are pretty nice- Prepares you for Liella 3rd Live Tour :DThe bad... 🥺Introduction of the 1st years.With the exception of Shiki and Mei's arc being solid, Kinako and Oninatsu's arcs were... unfortunate. Their addition into Liella feels not only forced, but uninteresting with a lack of genuine emotion. Also, once all of them are added into the group, you can't help but feel they are pushed to the side and basically become air in the presence of the other 5 members.Lack of meaning in songs.Love Live's production has only gone up since School Idol Project, and it's clear as day to see within this season's MVs. Despite this, however, I found there was no real sense of connection between most of the insert songs with what was actually occurring in the story. In season 1, almost all the songs feel specifically created for that moment in the story - something that was lacking in this season. In one episode, a Japanese-Rock type song is performed by the group. Is it good? Yeah. Does it make any sense in the story? Not really. The contents of the episode prior to the live was such a juxtaposition, and it made the song feel completely out of left field with it not having any correlation to the 'sentimental' nature the episode was trying to portray. Also most of the songs are kinda mid compared to 1st season lolThe new rivali don't even wanna explain this one man. not a fun/interesting character. I didn't really understand why she's being forced so much until the last episode. I have a pretty good idea what the LL staff are wanting to do with her now and the direction the story/group will go in, but wow the execution was just poor. Poor Sanipa as well... got done dirty,,,Just not that interesting :(Most of the episodes were just boring. the drama wasn't particularly well written, so it was hard to connect with the characters on an emotional level. although I don't think season 1 was perfect or a masterpiece, there is definitely a spark missing from this season that made the 1st season as enjoyable as it was for me. The emotions I felt during Mirai Yohou Hallelujah and Tiny Stars just didn't exist in this season.TLDRUnless you're a huge fan of Liella or the sequel makes this season worth enduring, I can't honestly recommend watching this season. It's an uninteresting mess of a story, and if you just want to watch the live performances, you can just go on youtube for that lol. I love Liella so it pained me the write this, but it's because I love the group so much that I feel like I needed to make people aware that this season was just bad, even as a huge Liella fan. If you're still interested in the group though, I'd highly recommend checking out their live performances/content outside of the anime. The group is 尊い and honestly as long as they keep doing what they're doing, 1 bad season of anime isn't gonna bother me. it was very disappointing.

Despite this, however, I found there was no real sense of connection between most of the insert songs with what was actually occurring in the story. In season 1, almost all the songs feel specifically created for that moment in the story - something that was lacking in this season. In one episode, a Japanese-Rock type song is performed by the group. Is it good? Yeah. Does it make any sense in the story? Not really. The contents of the episode prior to the live was such a juxtaposition, and it made the song feel completely out of left field with it not having any correlation to the 'sentimental' nature the episode was trying to portray. Also most of the songs are kinda mid compared to 1st season lolThe new rivali don't even wanna explain this one man. not a fun/interesting character. I didn't really understand why she's being forced so much until the last episode. I have a pretty good idea what the LL staff are wanting to do with her now and the direction the story/group will go in, but wow the execution was just poor. Poor Sanipa as well... got done dirty,,,Just not that interesting :(Most of the episodes were just boring. the drama wasn't particularly well written, so it was hard to connect with the characters on an emotional level. although I don't think season 1 was perfect or a masterpiece, there is definitely a spark missing from this season that made the 1st season as enjoyable as it was for me. The emotions I felt during Mirai Yohou Hallelujah and Tiny Stars just didn't exist in this season.TLDRUnless you're a huge fan of Liella or the sequel makes this season worth enduring, I can't honestly recommend watching this season. It's an uninteresting mess of a story, and if you just want to watch the live performances, you can just go on youtube for that lol. I love Liella so it pained me the write this, but it's because I love the group so much that I feel like I needed to make people aware that this season was just bad, even as a huge Liella fan. If you're still interested in the group though, I'd highly recommend checking out their live performances/content outside of the anime. The group is 尊い and honestly as long as they keep doing what they're doing, 1 bad season of anime isn't gonna bother me."", 'If you don\'t want to actually use your brain for any critical thinking, then you\'ll think this season was great! However, for many critical thinkers and myself, the show has left us torn. Unlike the laughably bad other Love Live show that aired this year, Love Live Superstar is at least enjoyable, probably in part to its talented director (Takahiko Kyougoku) who also directed School Idol Project. However, some excellent episodes, kickass music, and a few enjoyable new characters like Wein Margaret don\'t entirely make up for everything that bothers me.So what is it that fans don\'t like about this season?I think the biggest...failure with season 2 of Superstar for the fans is the ending. But for me the it\'s how the new characters were introduced, which is what is to blame for the lackluster ending. Adding new characters was already a major risk, and Superstar\'s risk did not pay off. Shiki and Mei probably had the best introduction, but it could have gone a lot better. Kinako\'s wasn\'t too terrible although she basically becomes a side character after episode 3. Natsumi\'s episode (technically two) where she joins are quite bad, but I actually really like Natsumi as a character (outside of the times where she faces no consequences for her bad behavior). Wein initially started out pretty good, and I still really like her, but the final episode with her is a disaster, mainly because the writing is so convoluted. She joins the same school as Liella for what reason exactly?Actually, that\'s not fair to Wein, a lot of the writing is convoluted. Season 1 had issues with it too like when the school director tells Kanon and Keke their group will have to disband if they don\'t get first place at a concert. They end up losing to Sunny Passion, but for some reason the director doesn\'t make them disband their group. With that being said though, you could at least brush off the plot points that never connect in season 1. It\'s a lot worse in this season. Take for example Natsumi trying to screw over Liella and using them to make money. What is Kanon\'s idea of how to deal with it? Ask the little troublemaker to join Liella after all the grief she\'s put them through because...? In another moment of bad writing, Ren gets addicted to playing video games in one of the episodes, and apparently the way to fix her addiction is for the other girls to play games with her because the power of friendship fixes gaming addiction?!? This one isn\'t quite as bad because Kanon offers to be Ren\'s vice president to help her out, but I don\'t quite see how that fixes her gaming addiction, they never actually resolve the issue, they just sort of forget about it. And let\'s not forget Liella celebrating in episode 3 after they go to the idol competition just for getting an honorable mention even though they lost. Also why is Wein so fixated with Kanon in the first place? I can understand her knowing about Love Live, but Liella didn\'t even make it to the finals in Love Live, and even if they did and were famous, why is she only fixated on Kanon specifically?!? Just another thing this show never explains.A lot of the characters don\'t really get much time on screen because much like Nijigasaki season 2, there\'s too many characters and not enough time to develop them. Kinako, Shiki, and Ren are definitely the worse. Ren actually GOT an episode but she\'s genuinely the most boring character outside of that, only being relevant by talking about her dead mom.There\'s a few other minor things like the music not tying in very well to the story, or the last episode not making you feel very passionate about Liella winning, or the stupid fake-out ending where Kanon\'s trip to Austria is canceled. But none of those particularly offend me, although I know a lot of people were upset about the last one. But honestly I didn\'t WANT Kanon to go to Vienna because she\'s such a good lead. So dumb anticlimactic ending or not, I can forgive the ending other than the episode being (mostly) wasted.The Good:There\'s actually a lot of good stuff to talk about this season! My favorite part of this season was episode 9, which funny enough was the episode that aired a few days after my original preliminary review. Keke and Sumire admit they care about each other, even though it\'s clearly embarrassing for both since Sumire is a show-off and Keke is a by the books kind of girl who doesn\'t like Sumire\'s prideful ways. But Keke knows Sumire cares about her deep down and would do anything for her, as would she. The passion Sumire has and desire to be with Keke was so touching and cute compared to most of the bland and uninteresting drama in earlier episodes. It\'s genuinely my second-favorite episode in the entire franchise, only behind You\'s episode in season 1 of Sunshine, which is similar but focuses more on loyalty and friendship than the obvious light yuri Superstar is sprinkling on with Sumire and Keke. The voice acting was some of the best I\'ve ever heard in anime, and it was awesome to see Kanon actually in the driver seat and passionate about something instead of standing around with a generic smiley face going along with everyone else. Episode 4 is also pretty good, and so are the first couple, even though they\'re soured a little by knowing that Kinako\'s basically not getting any character development when they\'re over. There\'s also a ton of funny moments with Natsumi that made me really love her as a character, like I said, she\'s one of my favorites even though her arc was stupid and gave her misdeeds a pass. Wein Margaret is a great rival, even though I think the other characters are a bit too forgiving of her, it\'s nice to see that Love Live actually has a rival who isn\'t ""nice"", which is a trope I\'m pretty tired of. Tying in with that, it was nice to see Sunny Passion lose. Frankly, they were really weak as a rival group and had sucky music, so it\'s nice to wrap up their story and focus more on the vastly superior Wein. I was worried that they\'d be a major part of the story in season 2 but I was thankfully wrong.The music is almost all top tier, it\'s on par with season 2 of School Idol Project. We have Welcome to Bokura no Sekai, Butterfly Wing, Vitamin Summer (my personal favorite), Chance Day, Chance Way!, Edelstein, Sing! Shine! Smile!; and the outro, Oikakeru Yume no Saki De. (The song they sang at the finals for Love Live was okay, but it was no Kira-Kira Sensation and honestly didn\'t deserve a win. Any of the other songs I listed that were sung by Liella would have been more deserving of a win.The comedy is also pretty good, and made me laugh quite a few times.Overall, there\'s about as much good as there is bad for me, and to top it off the show has a high entertainment factor. I didn\'t go in with high expectations after Niji season 2 and the announcement of new characters, so I wasn\'t too terribly disappointed. There\'s a decent number of problems I have with the series, and I don\'t think they should be glossed over. Do they harm my enjoyment of the show? Definitely, and it pulls this show down enough to where I can\'t be a diehard fan of it like with school idol project. But does it destroy my enjoyment of it? Absolutely not. As long as Kanon, Keke, Sumire, Wein, and Natsuuuu can continue to entertain and have somewhat decent stories working off each other, I\'ll be cautiously optimistic, but not excited, for season 3. failure with season 2 of Superstar for the fans is the ending.

Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei: Tsuioku-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48375/Mahouka_Koukou_no_Rettousei__Tsuioku-hen,"[""For starters, if you plan to watch this special, then you are quite acquainted with Mahouka and the various anime that have already come out in previous years. What this special did was shed a lot of light on the relationship between Tatsuya and Miyuki and how it evolved to its current state. A lot of background information was also provided, and some rather important characters made an appearance as well. To say more would be spoilers, so I'll refrain from going further.The art and sound were just great overall, and anyone who knows anything about Mahouka should have an idea of how things will...typically progress when Tatsuya is involved, so no surprises there either. All in all, while somewhat predictable, it was still quite enjoyable to see the progression and finally get to the heart of the character that is Tatsuya.Would definitely recommend for any Mahouka fans! typically progress when Tatsuya is involved, so no surprises there either. All in all, while somewhat predictable, it was still quite enjoyable to see the progression and finally get to the heart of the character that is Tatsuya.Would definitely recommend for any Mahouka fans!"", 'This special is par for the course when it comes to the Mahouka franchise - badHowever it fulfils an interesting role in that it is the missing link to understanding who Tatsuya is, how he came to be, and his relationship with Miyuki. I\'ll get more into that later (spoilers I guess), but now for my surface level problems.As usual the show has an over-narration problem. Miyuki narrates throughout the whole anime and it\'s used as a means of dropping meaningless exposition and lore dumps and telling us things that really should have been conveyed from the direction and animation instead. The entire Mahouka anime...franchise is what I\'d call a well animated visual novel with action scenes.Now from a construction standpoint I have two more gripes. First is the framing of the story. Having present day Miyuki and Tatsuya flying to the island and reminiscing about the past is a terrible way to frame an origin story because it provides a context that disconnects us from what is happening. It would have been better to begin in the past and immerse us in the story, and then timeskip at the end to present day to remind us of how these characters have grown and where they\'re going.The second gripe is the plot itself. It doesn\'t really exist. There is no act structure of any kind. Tatsuya is introduced. Various events happen that affect Miyuki in various ways, Tatsuya gets to flex, there\'s a big battle, and Miyuki\'s arc is brought up to the status quo that will kick start the rest of the series. It\'s a terrible, uninspired way to tell a story and as a result the special has no real momentum or driving energy to it. And no you can\'t call this a ""slice of life"" side story since there is already plenty of action and plot progression (albiet incredibly botched). It\'s just a very bad regular storyAs for the fact that this is supposedly an origin story, there are problems with this as a concept, and most of them are not necessarily adaptational issues but general issues with the story itself.First of all, if you have an origin story, what is the best way to deliver it? Typically speaking you would want to start from the beginning, establish who your characters were, and explain how your characters became who they are now. However the special begins after Tatsuya has already become an OP God. It only covers Tatsuya and Miyuki becoming acquainted and forming the incestuous sibling duo so many fans know and (supposedly) love. So why then do I call it an origin story if it\'s not really an origin story at all? That\'s because it drops all of Tatsuya\'s origins in an information dump in the last 10 minutes. This was a terrible idea for several reasons. First of all, we didn\'t get to see Tatsuya before he underwent surgery and became an emotionless OP god, so we don\'t really understand what Tatsuya lost in order to become who he is. We\'ve only ever known the god Tatsuya and not the person who he was before, so we aren\'t given any reason to care about his origin apart from the fact that it sounds cool.The implication of this is that it makes it less meaningful when Miyuki learns of his origins because we can only empathise with his suffering on a surface level.Another issue here is with the way his mother views Tatsuya. Because he can\'t do ""proper magic"" Tatsuya is considered lesser and therefore not worthy to be anything other than a bodyguard for Miyuki. However as we see in this special, and even more so in the rest of the show, he is practically speaking a better asset to the Yotsuba clan than Miyuki has been, and far, far more useful than pretty much every other character we\'ve met thus far in the anime. So while I can understand why on a political standpoint he doesn\'t have the qualifications to be the next leader, I fail to understand what meaningful reason his own mother would have to look down on him as a failure. While the reasoning may legitimately exist in the source material it\'s very poorly communicated considering this is the foundation for the entire story going forwards.overall, this is a poorly directed, poorly written, poorly characterised, but well animated mahouka special.

Ie: a generic Mahouka special', 'WATCH THIS SPECIAL BEFORE THE MOVIE AND SECOND SEASON!Story: 7.5  This light novel Volume (8) was one of my favorite in the series story-wise. This anime was not. This arc in the anime was good, but the first season was better. A big part of this was the shift from Madhouse to 8Bit which brought a new director, the same one who jumbled up the visitor arc. Without going into spoiler territory, the light novel was much more interesting because the storytelling was not linear. It jumped between right where the Visitor arc left off and a few years prior on the island, as...well as Maya’s childhood. It gave a whole backstory for the Yotsuba clan and why guardians exist which better explains the nature of Tatsuya and Miyuki’s relationship, As well as Maya and Miya, the chapter where Maya’s childhood and the Yotsuba’s history is expanded upon is called “Untouchable — The Nightmare of 2062.” It also had this very tense moment between Tatsuyas and Maya which was very exciting. The director did do a good job this time making the story flow well but I just can’t see anything good coming with the continuation of these content cuts. I actually enjoyed the anime original content at the end of the visitor arc but I would have much preferred the cut content. Why can’t we have both? I feel like we’re straying too far off course from the light novel. The next season was announced but I am assuming it is still with 8bit so I hope they somehow include “The Nightmare of 2062” in the next season and correct some of the changes in the visitor arc to get back on track.Art: 9.5  It is important to distinguish art from animation. The animation was pretty good, with no major flaws or anything, but nothing special. I didn’t notice any obvious bad CG or anything. What is special is the art. The character designs are some of the most beautiful I’ve seen and the style is elegantly refined. After watching “Mahouka koukou no Yuutousei” it is especially nice to see Miyuki return to her former glory, the art style in that anime was attempting to follow the manga but it looked terrible. In this special, all the main characters looked fantastic. Pretty much any random screenshot of Miyuki, especially when she is in the foreground, is screenshot-worthy. It was also a treat to see more of Ayako dressed up. This also might be one of if not the first times we are seeing Miya’s character design and it looks phenomenal.Sound: 9  The music is obviously composed by Iwasaki Taku and it is amazing as ever. His techy music has always been perfect for Mahouka. Magic battles would not be the same without him. The only real complaint is that most of the special has very little large-scale magic until the last quarter. His high-tech music doesn’t quite fit with the hand-to-hand combat quite as well. I noticed this most in the fight where Tatsuya is defending Miyuki near the water. Also, the voice acting is a bit strange. I think someone needs to remind Nakamura that Tatsuya is barely a middle schooler. He sounds at least 40. Hayami is doing a bit better sounding young but it is all a bit forced. Maybe it’s good that the music sometimes drowns out the speaking because the music is the best part.Character: 8  Everyone I talk to who has only watched the anime seems to think of Tatsuya as a bland MC/Self-insert which is not really true but understandable to a certain degree. I am hoping as the story goes along viewers will start to understand how likable and commendable he is. This special won’t change everyone’s mind right away but it is certainly a step in the right direction. Miyuki has always fawned over Tatsuya in the anime so it is honestly refreshing to see her before she realized the power of godsuya. The only critique I have is that she changed her mind way too fast. Like for her whole life, she didn’t like him but after like 30 minutes she starts to have a crush on him and won’t leave his side? I wish her character developed a bit more slowly.Enjoyment: 8 I found it really fun and a bit sad in the end. The fights are good and honestly seeing Ayako just once doubled my enjoyment. She is just such a fun character. I really wish they wouldn’t have cut “The Nightmare of 2062,” that and Tatsuya’s tea time with Maya were both cut which definitely drops my enjoyment.OVERALL: 8.5  The thing that really made me enjoy this anime was at 17:23 when Mitsugu glared at Tatsuya. Around light novel volume 16 you will learn why Mitsugu is scared of/holds animosity towards Tatsuya. This little detail of his eyes shows how much attention to detail was put into this. Foreshadowing like this makes the anime so much more enjoyable for those who read ahead and gives me hope that they are planning to adapt all the novels. Overall I think this special should have been released way before the movie and visitor arc but I’m glad it’s here now. well as Maya’s childhood.

I really wish they wouldn’t have cut “The Nightmare of 2062,” that and Tatsuya’s tea time with Maya were both cut which definitely drops my enjoyment.OVERALL: 8.5  The thing that really made me enjoy this anime was at 17:23 when Mitsugu glared at Tatsuya. Around light novel volume 16 you will learn why Mitsugu is scared of/holds animosity towards Tatsuya. This little detail of his eyes shows how much attention to detail was put into this. Foreshadowing like this makes the anime so much more enjoyable for those who read ahead and gives me hope that they are planning to adapt all the novels. Overall I think this special should have been released way before the movie and visitor arc but I’m glad it’s here now.', 'The special is great, but there are some parts in the manga that would have been epic if they added it on the anime but overall it is great, it really shows the backstory of Tatsuya and I would have love it even more if they show more demon light action (kinda epic when the enemy gets disintegrated into dust.) They announced another sequel and I cant wait for it. I have already read both the manga and the light novel and it never cease to amaze me. I really do hope that they continue this series, it is a masterpiece that not many people...know about outside japan. I would love to rewatch the whole series again. The animators, the staff, and everyone working behind the scene did an amazing job for this series. 100/10 it cured my depression. know about outside japan.

I appreciate most of what happens here is spoken about in various episodes of the existing anime beforehand but at least here it is all put together and also has a visual viewing rather than a story on its own.The art is the same as the show always is, I love this. It doesn't change apart from being more polished which again I love. Some shows change art between seasons from different companies and it kind of ruins the feeling unless it's epic. Take Attack on Titan,...the art style changes so much that you can always tell when a new studio took over.The sound is great and fills the room. Voices are the same as always and welcome.Characters, we know them, love them, hate them, whatever. If you are watching this just to learn who the characters are then this is not for you. Watch the rest and come back.I would say it could be higher than an 8 but it just isn't. Since I paid attention and read the manga related this is just a re-telling of a story we have been told throughout various episodes done visually. This is fine, but being that it's not totally new then it's an 8. the art style changes so much that you can always tell when a new studio took over.The sound is great and fills the room.

It, however, still suffers from all the pacing and plot issues from the main series – escalating in an insane manner and not doing anything to de-stupify the core premise of the show... Maybe even worse, as the explanation it gives for Tatsuya's treatment is beyond stupid and makes the whole magical aristocracy of Japan look like even bigger morons than before.The one thing this special does better than main seasons of the show is exposition – there are fewer...clunky info dumps and while the whole arc is arguably rushed, it at least doesn't include pointless downtime. In the end, it's just more content for fans of the main story – nothing less and nothing more. clunky info dumps and while the whole arc is arguably rushed, it at least doesn't include pointless downtime.

This was an incredibly important event for Mahouka’s story, the impacts of which have been felt throughout the series. It’s been mentioned explicitly throughout the series a number of times, as it was the beginning of the war between the GAU and Japan which played heavily into the events of the first season. Tetsuya played a critical part in...the conflict, resulting in him being feared as ‘Mahesvara’ by the GAU. His Regrowth and Decomposition abilities spawned rumors under the names of ‘Demon Right’ and ‘Divine Left’ respectively, terms that have popped up a number of times throughout the series. This special explicitly shows and thus makes very clear a lot of the things that have been referred to throughout the series. However, ultimately it doesn’t really add much new in terms of the world building or in terms of explanations of abilities.What it does contribute heavily to is Tetsuya and Miyuki’s characterization. It explains a lot of why someone like him is in the position he is in terms of his place in the Yotsuba clan as well as his connections to the military. It also explains why he has such a coldly logical personality and why he’s so obsessed with Miyuki. On the flipside it explains part of how Miyuki fits into the Yotsuba clan and how that’s resulted in her trying to be ‘perfect’. She also has an entire character arc where she becomes humbler and learns to accept her own feelings. And of course the special also explains why she reveres Tetsuya so much. There’s a bunch of other stuff to that it touches upon, such as broader background on the Yotsuba clan or specific members of it, but this special doesn’t go into as much depth as in the novel. Still, it seems that the anime adaptation isn’t skipping this content entirely, but rather seems to want to try to cover it differently as shown by the filler arc in the second season which already touched upon much of it. And the pacing of the special definitely benefited from the heavier focus on Tetsuya and Miyuki, so overall I feel this worked pretty well.The art and animation are solid enough. Though it has the length of a film, it isn’t a theatrical release, so it should be no surprise this has the same production values as the TV anime. The designs are as good as usual but there was nothing new particularly worth mentioning. The soundtrack was decent but didn’t really stand out at all, which is surprising considering the soundtrack in all the other Mahouka anime have stood out quite a bit. The ED song was over footage of the epilogue and was solid enough, though considering that characters were talking over all of it, it didn’t feel like an ED and more like an insert song. the conflict, resulting in him being feared as ‘Mahesvara’ by the GAU.

Not really, it was fine. The story was alright, art seemed slightly off in some scenes, and character development was laughable at times.The story begins with Miyuki reminiscing about the past, and this is where the problem with the story begins as well. It felt unnecessary for it to begin with anyone thinking of the past, or rather it wasn’t ended in a...satisfying way. The beginning and end of the movie did not feel all that connected to the past events the movie is mostly about. Yes, they are of the same characters, in the same world, but the ending in particular feels lackluster as it does not conclude the story before well. It felt like the character basically saw something that made her think of the past, then after reflecting on such events just shrugged and carried on.Reminiscing of the past is fine as a story element if it actually serves a purpose for the current state or nature of the character within the same continuation – as in if the reminiscing was within an episode in a series, it is perfectly fine for that to conclude into the character’s current behavior or development in another episode, but for this movie, even if it is not a standalone movie, there should be still be something taken from this past you reflect on you currently try to live out within the same movie. For example, Miyuki could be shown in the end living out a lesson she learnt in the past. If not, the reminiscing serves little to no purpose and it would have been better if the movie started and ended with only the past events.Another problem is Miyuki’s narration. Having a character state too much of their inner thoughts and through that reveal their personalities is just lazy. While there were indeed times when the narration made the scene funnier, there was simply too much.The animation of the movie felt slightly off during the fight sequences at the beginning (fight sequences at later parts of the movie was fine and looked good). It did not flow well, stances did not look natural and the poses some characters held during a few scenes even looked wonky.Character development felt abysmal at times. This movie was used to display how Miyuki got to the point of being all ‘Onii-sama’ in Rettousei, but the transition to get to that point felt rushed and forced. The final change in feelings did not feel natural. The gradual build-up at the start of the movie was fine and made sense, nor was it unreasonable and rushed. However, right after the climax (which did not really build up tension at all and feel like a climax), she had a sudden and complete change of heart that did not feel like what the events before would result in. They would certainly steer her in the way of her eventual feelings for Tatsuya, but not that completely immediately after.This movie actually suffers from poor character development for side characters, or rather, the lack of character development for the side characters. There wasn’t much of a closer look or a deep dive for the side characters, and while these side characters are important to the development of the main characters, they suffered from the lack of character. Some characters only got to express part of their inner feelings in a rushed, short speech at the end, of which the contents would be closely related to the main characters. Others get a single line that referenced what would be a complex character trait but well, only received one line describing such. This movie would have been a great opportunity to dive into these particular side characters as they are not closely followed in Rettousei.In the end, from a non-LN audience perspective, although I am unaware of what could have been of this movie if it followed the light novel, there were elements in the movie of which I was unsatisfied with. satisfying way.

The annoying as shit sister, with the personality of a loli-incest fuck-doll made in Japan, is less annoying, at-least until she begins her incestuous brother worship by the end of the movie.Art is the same as the show, nothing mind blowing happening here. Art was never the issue...with this series. The comedic background music track that plays over everything that the director thinks is ""cool"" in the series, is missing from the movie, which is a welcome surprise.Plot, however, remains a shitshow.The fact that even in the backstory, the origin story, Tatsuya is still an OP demigod, doesn\'t help. In good Isekai shows, the protagonist starts weak and gets stronger. But this fucking show refuses to make the protagonist weak, even in the origin story. The hack writer who came up with this dribble as an excuse to simp on a fictional loli, probably finds it hard to get off without the power fantasy being ON 24/7.I guess since this is the origin story, it didn\'t give the writer enough time to offload his pointlessly detailed explanations on run-of-the-mill magic spells that every other fucking fantasy hero just.. casts, without going into hour long explanations.

It explains the history of Tatsuya and Miyuki and their relationship. This doesn't seem to be a necessary part of the story but it adds some nice background information. You can watch this after the first season or after the second season, it doesn't really matter that much. You shouldn't watch it before the first season though because it's a flashback, not a sequel, so it expects knowledge of the characters.Overall the story isn't too good.

The two most important characters in this movie are Miyuki and Tatsuya and all other characters are of lesser significance.

Muumindani no Suisei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2313/Muumindani_no_Suisei,"['This used to be one of my favourite movies as a kid. It also made me scared of meat-eater-plants, octopuses and falling stars. Especially falling stars...I may be a little bit biased with this one, but I noticed that there was not a single review for Moomins! I tried not to put too high ratings, but it\'s so hard. I already feel like I\'m giving it lesser score that I actually think it deserves. Sometimes it\'s hard to be objective...So where should I begin? Yes, it\'s a ""children\'s movie"", Moomins are targeted for children (which is odd since the original source, Tove Jansson, didn\'t emphasize...them to kids especially...) but you can see a lot of mature themes and grim moments - I wasn\'t allowed to watch Moomin\'s before going to bed when I was a kid. Do I still watch Moomins? Of course! This is a good example of an animation that pleases everyone - at least I\'ve never heard of a person who hated Moomins.The lore and the world in Moomins fascinate me a lot. This movie is no different, and it serves as an ""origin story"" to the show and it underlines the tone that the whole show will have - except I remember that the show was a little bit more lighthearted, which can be explained by the plot of this movie; A gigantic star is falling from the sky! You remember when Final Fantasy 7 went grim and melancholic when the star was peeking from the horizon, soon to be crashed on earth? Well same here, except the gripping feeling is through the whole movie ""Will they make it in time?"".The story is done well, it really gives you the feeling of a long and exhausting adventure, even though it\'s a short movie. The setting is build up perfectly for the show to continue where they left off, but the movie stands alone perfectly - just like the show does (so you don\'t need to watch them both if you don\'t want to.).The art style... oh boy. I just love it okay? It\'s simplistic but detailed where it needs to be? That sounded confusing.I haven\'t seen same kind of art anywhere else. I love how the hills, forests and other landscapes look. The colors blend together beautifully and give away a serene and a mystic feel in some way. Sure, the characters may seem a little bit simply done, but I think that\'s a matter of opinion if it bothers someone or not.For it\'s time, it was really pretty and I think it has aged perfectly.The characters are the weakest point to be honest, but they are still pretty decent.I\'ve always loved Snufkin (really? that\'s what you call him in english/japanese?) and he definitely shines in this one once again. I just think he is so cool, travelling all the time and being handy, friendly, few with words and mysterious.The protag in itself is pretty neutral moomin, someone that the audience can relate to and look up to, since he is also quite brave.I was often referred to Little My as a kid because of my short temper... Eh, people either love her or hate her.But the blandest character... Floren. She is bearable in this movie, our heroes save her and her brother and she is pretty neutral, but in the show... She is just so meh. I never really liked her as a kid that much since she was too girly and moody in my opinion.This movie has it\'s great, okay and meh characters. All of which succesfully entertain you and makes you feel attached to them. The best character? The muskrat (a philosopher muskrat) who lives under the bridge. His most famous line ""Stupid woman - Cleaning doesn\'t help anything"" is a bit of a running joke in finland.and the music! It\'s awesome. Do I need to say more?

I really can\'t bear the voices in japanese. Maybe it\'s nostalgia, I don\'t know. Little My sounds really unbearable. I prefer the Finnish voice acting and subtitles. Maybe it won\'t bother you. It bothered me.I think that I fell in love with Miyazaki\'s films because of Moomins. They are in many ways similar. And no wonder; Akira Miyazaki worked in this! He may not be Hayao, but the similar feel this movie and the show has is striking. Moomins are enchanting and enriched my young mind with wonder and adventures. If you love Howl no Ugoku Shiro or Majo no Takkyuubin, I think you should check out moomins.This is a show/movie I\'m going to revisit many times and in a few years I\'m going to watch it with my own children.(I\'m sorry if my review is too hyped, I tried to tone it down. Moomins are my weak point and it\'s terribly hard to stay objective about them! I have notalgia goggles and I admit that.You can see if I\'m only talking and go watch it!

Originally created by Tove Janson, Moomins weren\'t originally ment especially to be mainly...for kid\'s entertainment, since the original strips contained pretty heavy adult themes, like drinking, life and death, our place in a world, loneliness, obsessions and fear. The original Moomins even looked pretty creepy, and the characters tended to be way more adult-like, than how I used to know them as a child! But, since Japan showed an interest to turn this dark, mysterious finnish creation into a slice of live- formula-based tv-show for kids, it\'s only natural, that in a prosess, the movie was also made! And, here it is! Moomins the Movie: the Armageddon!So, what\'s the story then? The story begins on a events even earlier than the actual tv-show ever took place. Moomin family is settleing down in a peaceful Moomin valley - how it was called, before this little convenient naming, I wonder? - and building up their vairly marketable blue round house, when one stormy night, a shady character under a bridge tells them, that something bad is on it\'s way, and there\'s absolutely nothing they should, or could do about it. After a heavy rain of unexplainable soot, Moomin trollen, accompanied by couple of his friends, decide to travel all the way to the Lonely Mountains, in a search for a observatory, and on the way, they meet many friends and enemies, like Snuffking, the travelling but world-wise hermit, crystal-obsessed lizards, dangerous bug-eating Angostura-tree, Hemulen, Octopus, and of course, know-it-all Snorken and his sister Snorkfröken, who becomes Moomin trollens immiedate love-interest. Together they learn, that a dangerous Comet is on it\'s way to the Moomin valley, and it\'s only about two days time to evacuate, and save whatever there is to save - funny thing is, that the astrologists have absolutely no idea, what will hapen when the comet hits, and are actually excited about it!The story is indeed exceptional, considering the sourcematerial, but oddly enough, it really actually works to it\'s favour! It\'s not overly complex, and it\'s thus easy to follow, but it gives constantly that odd yet curious vibe about something unknown approaching, not exactly knowing what it is or what\'ll does, and if the worst possible hapens, what\'s left after - rebuild, death, or search for a new home? Seeing how this steadily approaching threat from beyond the stars, with no name, personality or motive, simultaneously destroys everything on it\'s way and causes both panic, terrors and sadness to those, who\'re about to loose everything, but also exitement and joy for those, who won\'t understand the real danger and are just waiting in a amazed awe, is both terrifying and dark, that wouldn\'t so easily fly in many other franchises, especially aimed for kids. And, since this movie was partly made in Japan, the music is of course a top notch, since every single piece and note fits and plays perfectly in every scene, complimenting the beautiful landscapes and emotions, so that the overused exposition is almost completely left out. This movie doesn\'t hold any hands, or doesn\'t try to make something ""less frightening"" that it should be. It\'s a story about a world, that\'s about to end - how much sugar coating there really can even be?!That all being said, I really can\'t say, whom I can recommend this to, other than all the fellow finns, and those rare individuals abroad, who know the original Moomins. You don\'t need to know all the characters, or their stories, since most of the characters are actually met first time in this movie, as their own debute to the viewer. This movie was Finland\'s seventh most watched movie in it\'s time, but still, it never saw a light of day in any country outside of Japan and Scandinavia, and sadly, it was never dubbed in english - not in my knowledge, anyway. If you even happen to find it from the ether, I\'m pretty sure it\'s either on finnish, or swedish, and since not so many people actually really understand any of these two languages... yeah, good luck watching this movie, if you\'re at all interested. My condolences.Overall, this movie is great. It starts of the whole premise for the tv-series, introducing many of our favourite characters and even some of the actual world and it\'s wonders and dangers, without being too overwhelming, and even tough it is mostly suitable for kids, even adults can still enjoy watching it with them. If I could, I would translate this whole movie into english subs, since I know Finland is gaining popularity on abroad, as a relatively interesting country and culture, but because I myself don\'t own this movie in DVD... yeah, I\'m not that smart!Enjoy this movie, those of you who can, and keep the spirit of Moomins burning bright! And that theme music... omg what a earworm that is!Story: 9Art: 9Sound: 10Character: 8Enjoyment: 10Overall: 10 for kid\'s entertainment, since the original strips contained pretty heavy adult themes, like drinking, life and death, our place in a world, loneliness, obsessions and fear. The original Moomins even looked pretty creepy, and the characters tended to be way more adult-like, than how I used to know them as a child! But, since Japan showed an interest to turn this dark, mysterious finnish creation into a slice of live- formula-based tv-show for kids, it\'s only natural, that in a prosess, the movie was also made!

It doesn't matter if this movie is seen before or after the series, since it takes place before and, as I said, is a good introduction.Here we see how Moomin met Snufkin, Floren and Snork, his brother. They go on an adventure to find out about the comet that is going to fall on Moominvalley.Since I saw this movie before the series, I knew nothing about Moomin's world or the characters. Everyone is introduced in a natural way as they...are going to find out about the comet.We know that Snufkin is a wanderer who doesn't care much for material possessions; Snif is greedy for wealth but never gets anything; My lives a lot with the Moomins and so on. Of course, this was introduced in the series, but this for me, who saw the movie before, was a good introduction.I liked the characters in the movie, and did not intend to see the series. I ended up watching the series and liked the characters even more.The technical part of the movie is ok. It is on the same level as the series, when it comes to animation. What stands out most in this movie in terms of visuals is the extremely well-detailed scenery.The end of the movie is pretty cool, and it can make you want to see the series.In general it is a nice movie.

Pokemon Concierge,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54633/Pokemon_Concierge,"[""As someone who loves Pokémon but has never really commited to watching the entire series, I randomly decided to watch this after seeing it on Netflix and it was a cute little surprise for sure.I have no idea what sort of technique they used for making this but it seems to reminds me of that Old Pingu cartoon or stopmotion animations. The idea is really creative and no doubt a lot of effort went into this. It certainly looks and feels so refreshing that the Pokémon almost pop out of the screen lol. The world looks so beautiful yet you can tell it's made of...clay and even the Pokémon have that soft dough like texture to them which increases the aesthetic appeal of this.Basically even if you're not a fan of Pokémon, or just want a cutesy show to watch along with some tea and snacks then this is a good watch tbh.My only reasonable complaint is that it's too short but I can only imagine how much work must've gone into making this as compared to a traditional anime, I guess the episode count is low for a valid reason. I hope this gets even more episodes down the line.Thanks for reading! clay and even the Pokémon have that soft dough like texture to them which increases the aesthetic appeal of this.Basically even if you're not a fan of Pokémon, or just want a cutesy show to watch along with some tea and snacks then this is a good watch tbh.My only reasonable complaint is that it's too short but I can only imagine how much work must've gone into making this as compared to a traditional anime, I guess the episode count is low for a valid reason. I hope this gets even more episodes down the line.Thanks for reading!"", 'It really cannot be understated how great it is that in the 2020s, we\'re getting so many different Pokemon anime in very different animation styles. For decades, the only animated Pokemon property we got was the main TV anime starring Ash Ketchum. As popular as the games and the overall franchise is, and for all the innovations it provided across its associated media, the TV anime was pretty static and formulaic a lot of the time. But starting in the mid-2010s and into the 2020s, the Pokemon animated canon got to expand beyond just the TV anime. We got stuff like Pokemon Origins, followed by...Pokemon Generations, which are animated retellings of various notable events in the games, and later, we would get short web anime such as Twilight Wings, Hisuian Snow, the PokeToon shorts, and Paldean Winds. Pokemon would later dip its toes into the world of stop-motion, with the subject of today\'s review, Pokemon Concierge, which was announced in the February 2023 Pokemon Presents video. I thought ""Ooh! This looks cute! I\'d love to watch it!"" And just this December, Pokemon Concierge finally dropped for all to see. I\'m glad to say that Pokemon Concierge is a pretty good short anime on par with the others I mentioned in terms of overall quality, but I feel like it could have been something more.So what\'s the story? A young woman named Haru has been having a tough time of it, and nothing\'s been going right for her. To get away from it all, Haru decides to take a job at the luxurious Pokemon Resort, a resort that caters exclusively to Pokemon guests and isn\'t the stiff, stuffy work environment that Haru is used to. Through trial and error, Haru manages to carve out a place at her new job, doing everything from befriending a shy Psyduck to helping a Magikarp that can\'t swim to save its life. Every day is fun and filled with new discoveries as Haru comes to enjoy her new life at the Pokemon Resort. Oh, side note: This is gonna be my last review of 2023, and I\'m glad that this is the series I get to end the year on, because it\'s a pretty cute, wholesome little romp.For anyone who\'s only familiar with stop-motion animation via Tim Burton and the Rankin-Bass Christmas specials from back in the day, fun fact: A lot of the earliest stop-motion animation was done in Japan, including said Rankin-Bass specials. It\'s much harder to produce because unlike 2D animation which is just drawings made to move with technology, stop-motion is extremely intricate and labor intensive due to the level of technical skills needed for it being much higher than what\'s needed for 2D, such as prop setup and photography, among other things. Stop-motion as an animation form has actually evolved quite a bit and seems to be coming back into the limelight, what with stuff such as Pui Pui Molcar, Mad God, Guillermo Del Toro\'s Pinocchio, everything that Laika puts out, and so on. The animation for this was done by Dwarf Studios, who also worked on the Rilakkuma and Kaoru anime. As someone who\'s not familiar with their work, I have to say that the work they put into Concierge\'s animation is amazing. All the characters are made from different materials, and depending on the Pokemon, they can be either sleek plastic or soft felt. The fact that the animators put actually captured tiny details like the texture of a Pokemon\'s fur really helps the immersion. There\'s a lot of thought and care put into things like body movement and facial expressions for both humans and Pokemon, with some details about that being mentioned in a cute making of video that Netflix put up on their YouTube channel. Definitely check out that video if you can. The set pieces for the backgrounds are also very well done. I don\'t have as much to say about the soundtrack, as its cute and I did enjoy the Mariya Takeuchi song. I do appreciate that they made a remix for the evolution music at one point.I admit, I\'m kinda mixed on the characters. They\'re not bad or anything, but I feel the series\' short length of four ten-minute long episodes didn\'t allow the creators to let their characters to grow, nor do we really get to know any of them on a personal level. Because of the series\' short length and focusing more on Haru learning about how the Pokemon Resort works, the side characters all feel very one-note and bland. Tyler is just a laid-back surfer dude, Alisa is just Haru\'s helpful senior, and Watanabe is just the nice boss. I\'d very much like to learn more about this cast of characters and what they\'re like, but again, the series is so short that it\'s unable to do so. There\'s so many unanswered questions about all of them, such as: Is Watanabe the founder of the resort, or does she just work there? What are Tyler and Alisa like when they\'re off the clock? What made them decide they wanted to work at the resort? Do they all have lives outside the resort? How do they go about dealing with the guests? How do they handle stress? Seriously, there\'s so much potential with them and I do like them, but they really deserve to be fleshed out more. On the other hand, the Pokemon characters are all very expressive and full of personality, and the animators did their absolute damndest to bring them all to life.Actually, speaking of questions, there\'s a lot that I really want to know about the show\'s setting. Who founded the Pokemon Resort? Do Pokemon get designated rooms in the hotel, or since they\'re on an island, can they just go wherever they want? How do they accommodate big Pokemon like Metagross and Dragonite? Since Watanabe doesn\'t want her employees to treat working at the resort the same way as an office job based on how she reacts to Haru making data charts in the first episode, how does Watanabe handle the business side of things with the resort? How do they even get funding? As much as I like this short series and the idea behind it, its short length both in episode number and duration leave no room for fleshing out the concept and the characters more. Hell, it wasn\'t even revealed that Pokemon Concierge would even get just four episodes until it dropped on Netflix! The previous series Dwarf Studios made, Rilakkuma and Kaoru, had 13 episodes, so I was under the impression that Pokemon Concierge would have the same amount of episodes. Like...who decided it should just be four episodes?! And they could have at least mentioned this from the start!I hate to go on about Concierge\'s short length, and don\'t take this to mean I didn\'t like the show, because I did. I genuinely enjoyed Pokemon Concierge for what it is, a charming, wholesome, laid-back Pokemon series making use of stop-motion animation to bring the Pokemon world to life in a new way. It\'s a great new entry into the Pokemon animated canon, and I honestly wish there was more. Who knows, maybe they\'ll make another season in the future? I hope so, but if not, it\'s still a cute show for what it is. Whether you\'re a Pokemon fan or not, Pokemon Concierge is a nice kick-back-and-relax kind of show that\'s short, sweet, and to the point, and man do I wish there were more of it!

First off, can we just applaud how well-detailed each character's and pokemon's expressions and motions? Stop motion is a challenging art, and you can tell how much efforts and time everyone involved put in. Now this show isn't your typical trainer collect pokemon, train, defeat gym leaders, etc.. No, this show is a light warm, fuzzy, and just overall cute. It's meant for kids, and honestly, the childhood me would've loved this just as...much as the adult me (now). Cute family show.

Her fun is directly tied to the fun of the pokemon, and ultimately, she ends up doing her job - making sure both her and the pokemon are having a good time!Art: Stop-motion animation is NOT an easy art, so I have soooooo many compliments to the art direction and the way they animated the...motions and varying states of the characters' faces!

The stop motion looks pretty good, albeit some of the Pokemon themselves only have glued on expression changes. It’s fluidly animated and its human characters look good.That being said, the narrative is nothing to write home about. Little lessons are learned by our lead each episode as she picks up the concierge craft, but it all feels very safe. I give this some credit for just letting us sit in the Pokemon world for a bit without battles or major stakes, but it feels just like a day in the life of a neurotic young woman as she seeks to fit in...working in a Pokemon resort. That’s fine, and it does pretty well at it, but that’s a low bar for success. Worth the watch if you like the world (I do, well enough anyway), but nothing special. working in a Pokemon resort.

Worth the watch if you like the world (I do, well enough anyway), but nothing special.', ""Another really cute show by Dwarf in the same vein as Rilakkuma and Kaoru, however rather than being about the struggles a working woman faces, this show is more about relaxation and nurturing. This show is one part viewer wish fulfillment, one part reminding us to take things easy once in a while, and enjoyable throughout.The stop motion animation is gorgeous here. The human characters have that same sort of look as the previously mentioned Rilakkuma and Kaoru, but the real highlight was how the Pokemon themselves were adapted into this style. I love the use of textures on the models, which can differ from...fluffy and plush-like to sleek and clay-like, depending on the species. There was so much attention to detail on all these models, and each Pokemon looked perfectly like their in-game counterparts. The music is was also lovely and perfectly captured the vacation vibe they were going for. They got Mariya Takeuchi of Plastic Love fame to record the main theme for this series, and all these years later she's still got the voice of an angel.I also really like the handling of Psyduck, it feels like we finally got some form of Pokemon media where it gets to be a main star in a way that's not backhanded. Plenty of migraine sufferers tend to find Psyduck's headaches relatable, so it was pleasant to see the human characters treat it kindly and find ways to help it with the problem it faces. The episodes sort of face on helping Pokemon with their problems and what lessons Haru can learn from the situation rather than the battles of most typical Pokemon series media, so it's definitely something different and a show I could see parents enjoying with their kids.My only issue with this series is that it's a tad too short. I mean, right as I was getting into it, it ended. Here's hoping we can see more from it soon. fluffy and plush-like to sleek and clay-like, depending on the species.

Definitely a good message to give to any audience.This may not be the battle-centric Pokémon we've become so used to, but we still have a very good and light-hearted scenery with all sorts of fun human characters, as well as all the adorable Pokémon filling this world.The character design is really good. I love how they get around to each Pokémons's design and the felt textures some of them...have. This little anime is just one big good vibe and I love it for that.

Stop motion animation is a fun medium for Pokémon to experiment with for a Pokémon anime that has nothing to do with Ash, and the stop motion animation is great quality as well. Even if you aren't a Pokémon fan, this show is perfectly accessible. It's just a bunch of cute animals having fun. A valid complaint is that there are only 4 episodes so far, but according to Netflix, more will be coming eventually. The people who work at the Pokémon resort are all fun characters,...and like Haru, I am sure almost all of us would pack up our bags and seek employment at a Pokémon Island resort if we could. and like Haru, I am sure almost all of us would pack up our bags and seek employment at a Pokémon Island resort if we could."", ""Muito bem feito,uma animação de se aquecer os corações,cumpre bem o seu propósito,pois foi capaz de me passar as boas sensações que estão presentes nessa animação.A animação stop motion impressionou-me,ficou bem boa e os cenários estiveram ótimos do começo ao fim.Gosto bastante da franquia de Pokemon e fico satisfeito com tais lançamentos e trabalhos que entregam ao público.Very well done, a heart-warming animation, it fulfills its purpose well, as it was able to give me the good feelings that are present in this animation.

In this, there are definitely fans of the series who are looking for something following a different format, at the very least a series that doesn\'t involve Ash, the never-aging Pokemon trainer from yesteryear, not because there is any lack of love for the franchise or Ash, but simply because there is a want for something new. This, of course, can mean a series within the franchise that doesn\'t follow the never-aging Pokemon trainer, but there\'s also something to breaking away from the formula of not following another trainer on the journey to become one...of the greatest.Pokemon Concierge is in the latter when it comes to breaking the formula in that it doesn\'t just follow Ash; it follows nobody wanting to become a trainer and instead takes a more slice-of-life direction. Of course, in saying this, going in this direction in breaking the formula, this particular addition to the franchise is slice-of-life with no battles. There is a calm to it, a mellowness, but the episodes are also on the shorter length, making the series something that\'s definitely meant for relaxation purposes, not so much turning off ones brain, but more of sitting back and enjoying the day-to-day slice-of-life antics that happen at the resort.Which, yes - slice-of-life isn\'t everyone\'s cup-of-tea, I admit, but to say, ""Oh, I\'ve mixed feelings about recommending this because someone doesn\'t like slice-of-life"" really isn\'t fair to the series, as a slice-of-life series isn\'t meant for those who don\'t like slice-of-life, but anybody reading the review should be aware of whether they like the sub-genre or not. And for those who do like the sub-genre, this was certainly a pleasant series, one that I\'d even argue would appeal to those who aren\'t fans of Pokemon because it fits the genre so well. of the greatest.Pokemon Concierge is in the latter when it comes to breaking the formula in that it doesn\'t just follow Ash; it follows nobody wanting to become a trainer and instead takes a more slice-of-life direction.

Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso: Moments,https://myanimelist.net/anime/28069/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso__Moments,"['Even if you like the show, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso\'s OVA is an in-coherent mess, with events and backstories that should have been elaborated on in the show.Animation - 5/10In the show, the animation (besides the atrocious CGI hands) was beautiful in places. However in the OVA, most of the scenes are reused, and when a scene ISN\'T reused, it\'s probably a still frame. There were still an overabundance of chibis, and some very awkwardly animated scenes. Some examples are when Takeshi Aiza was riding on his bike, and there was a very oddly place perception shot. The animation while he was riding was...also just a loop, which would be fine, if the animation was so awkward and didn\'t repeat for as long as it did.The art was ok. Just about the same as the show but with an issue that I need to bring up. These characters are approximately 12 years-old in the OVA, and at this point of the story. Yet, they all look as if they are 3rd graders. It\'s a really big pet peeve of mine, that I feel was undermined for the sole purpose of making the characters ""easy to connect to"" or ""kaaaawaaaa---eeeeeee"".Sound - 6/10Voice acting was exactly the same. Nothing stood out in the OST other than the remix of one of the songs in the show. I had a big issue when Aiza was listening to Kousei play the piano at his house...yet I couldn\'t hear the piano...at all. Would have been nice to experience what Aiza was listening to.Story - 3/10An absolutely incoherent mess. The story is supposed to give background information on the relationship of Aiza, Emi, and Kousei, yet we see no interaction from Kousei. He\'s simply...not apart of the relationship. It felt as if the OVA was just screaming ""NOTICE ME SENPAI! NOTICE ME!"", and Kousei never noticed.Aside from Kousei\'s involvement, the story just jumps around too much to really understand what\'s going on. One moment they\'re at a concert, next moment, Aiza is sitting outside Kousei\'s house. The pacing is atrocious as events go by waaaaay too fast to comprehend what\'s actually going on. This all just felt as if it was supposed to be an arc IN THE SHOW, similar to how Kuroko no Basket has arcs dedicated to flashbacks to develop the characters.Characters - 3/10Emi and Takeshi both have the same, typical cliche\'d ""I\'M GONNA BE THE BEST!"" mentality, that isn\'t even somewhat heartwarming due to the pacing of the OVA and the lack of amount of time to establish a connection. Even if you are to watch this after marathoning the show, you won\'t feel anything, as these motivations were established in the show.As stated earlier, Kousei is very bland and has no involvement in what was SUPPOSED to be a 3-way development triangle of sorts. Due to him being the most interesting character in the show, by far, it makes no sense to have him act completely bland, other than to be an excuse to have the ""NOTICE ME SENPAI!"" mentality with Takeshi and Emi.Aiza and Emi are generic. Nothing happens with these two as neither of them really grow...well Aiza does to an extent, but in the end, he has the same mentality as he did at the beginning of the OVA. There\'s no development here, and the characters are very generic.Enjoyment - 1/10I\'d give it lower but I physically can\'t.Value - 1/10There\'s no rewatchability here, that\'s for sure. This was also built off of many typical shounen cliche\'s, and the OVA brings nothing new to the show.Final Verdict - 3.17/10The OVA/OAD is very hard to watch. The amount of reused clips is disappointing, but it\'s an OVA, so I guess that can be excused to an extent. The sound is average, and the characters are just...there.

(Honestly, I don\'t get why people hate this show so much.)  On one hand, many people praised the show for its themes and storytelling, while others thought of it as a piece of entertainment that was WAY too overhyped for what it actually was, essentially dumbing down the opinion of anyone who gave it positive feedback.  So, even with all of that, what did this OVA of one of the more recently debated anime give us?Story (7.98/10): For...the most part, OVA\'s of anime usually give us, the viewer, a little side story or comedic bit of a series that we have already watch before, acting as a little bit more of a series that we either enjoy, or hold dear to our hearts.  However, Shigatsu\'s OVA takes a different route than most OVA\'s.In this OVA, Shigatsu takes a step back in time, going all the way back to the time of Arima\'s first concert.  Acting as a precursor for the original anime\'s time, this OVA tells the story of the two piano rivals that Kousei has, Takeshi and Emi, and how they became the the rivals to Kousei with the ever growing musical bloodlust they have for going forward and beating Kousei in a music competition, as noted by the original 22 episode run of Shigatsu.  (Also, it throws in a little bit of Kaori in there as well.)  Personally, I find this to be a good use of an OVA for the anime, as it takes a step back and shows the viewer in greater detail, what happened before the original run of the series, and why some things and character relations are the way they are.In addition, the OVA shows a couple little small details, showing little tidbits of places, actions, and people from before the time the original series, which I personally thought was a nice touch, as it shows just how much things can change as time goes on.  Overall though, I thought the story of this OVA was a very fitting one in order to give the viewer more detail as to what happened before the ""present day"" time in Shigatsu.  While there were some imbalances, like Emi\'s story and motivation not being as prominent as Takeshi\'s (reminds me of what happened in the original series.  Yeesh.) it was overall, a good story that ties in well with the overall series.Overview:+ Flashback OVA that tells the events that lead up to the story+ Deepens some characters a little more-  Character stories still had imbalance in screentime and attention.-  Kinda bounces back and forth perspectiveCharacters: (8.00/10): The characters in this OVA are very different in terms of importance, than in the original series.  As I had mentioned before, the piano rivals Takeshi and Emi are put forth in center stage as the viewer gets to understand and learn why and how Kousei is what he is to them.  You get to see them grow up and go through the years leading up to the fated 2 years ago moment that centers around Kousei\'s character, thus giving a bit more detail to their characters and allow a bit more understanding to their motivations.In contrast though, the main four characters Kousei, Tsubaki, Watari, and Kaori, are pushed to the back, only having momentary appearances throughout the 30 minute runtime of this OVA.  (This is to be expected from having character importance shifted.)  Overall though, I appreciated the development that we got from this OVA, on account of the fact that the characters who got it were characters we as the viewer knew somewhat little about.  (Watari still gets jack.  Poor Watari, always forgotten.)Overview:+ Other characters gained development and importanceArt and Sound (8.75/10 and 8.80/10): The visuals for Shigatsu seemed to have dipped slightly in quality (though this is to be expected in an OVA.)  Similar to its full length predecessor, all manners of its artstyle are utilized, ranging from its symbolism backgrounds when Kousei is playing, to the over exaggerated facial expressions when someone is having a ""comedy moment.""  But compared to the original series, they didn\'t seem as grand as they could\'ve been, so there\'s that to take into account.On the sound department, this OVA takes form the beautiful stylings from the first half of the show, using ""Hikaru Nara"" and ""Kirameki"", the first OP and ED as the beginning and ending song for this OVA.  Both are wonderfully beautiful pieces, and my personal favorite duo of the two OP and ED combos, using a very cheerful and bright sound and tone that for me, warms my heart.Overview:+ Art is rather consistent+ Uses the beautiful tracks from the original series (my personal favorite tracks)-  Art quality has dipped from the standard of the original seriesPersonal Enjoyment (8.00/10): While many people argue that Shigatsu is a series that doesn\'t deserve the credit that it gets, I personally believe it is a beautiful piece of work and deserves at least the majority of the praise that it gets.  As for this OVA, well, it doesn\'t stack up to the original in my opinion, (I was actually hoping for a timeskip OVA where Kousei would be like 21 and in college, coming back to visit Kaori\'s grave or something like that.) I still believe that this OVA was a good experience.What did I like about this OVA?I liked more or less the fact that it was a development OVA.  It wasn\'t a generic OVA where comedy or a ridiculous plotline was used to fill up the time, but rather one that had to do with the story that was being told, and contributed, even slightly, to the grand scheme of the anime that it was tied into.  It gave the viewer greater detail on the events that took place before the period of time when the anime started, and gave a bit more backstory to some characters whose pre-existing backstories were lacking quite a bit of detail.What didn\'t I like about this OVA?The character importance really irked me quite a bit.  Similar to the original series, Emi doesn\'t get as much screentime as she does, losing out to her male rival counterpart, Takeshi, in detail, screentime, and overall importance.  In addition, the art quality drop wasn\'t something I took as kindly to since the show didn\'t look AS stunning as it was before.Would I recommend this OVA?If you watched Shigatu wa Kimi no Uso, and liked it, you might like this OVA.  If you didn\'t, I wouldn\'t recommend this.  Like all OVA\'s, this one is tailored to fans of the show, giving more of a series to viewers that liked the original show.  While this OVA isn\'t perfect as there are quite a few flaws with its execution, it should provide a decently enjoyable experience to those who have a more positive reception of this series.Overall Score: 7.99/10 the most part, OVA\'s of anime usually give us, the viewer, a little side story or comedic bit of a series that we have already watch before, acting as a little bit more of a series that we either enjoy, or hold dear to our hearts.

This is more of a incomprehensible mess than pretty much anything I can remember in recent memory. They reuse many clips used in the show and the the stuff that isn't reused does not correlate with the story the presented in the show at all. Maybe this is the story from the manga but it is directly tied with the show so I am judging it as such.

Now, I will...briefly say what I think about each area you usually find in a review.STORYMakes no sense with the one presented in the show. This would have been a great way to start off the show but then Shigatsu would have had to actually have had a budget since it relied heavily on reused flashback scenes.ARTAs stated they reuse more footage than even the show does and its truly disgusting to see how lazy A-1 was being with this OVA. The OP does look much better than it originally did and so does the ending song but I think they were cleaned up for the Blurays. The newly animated scenes mostly looked really cheap and the one or two that didn't probably were reused from the show that I didn't pick up.SoundNothing new here. Same old show. They did remix one track from the OST. There was one scene of note that had an insert song blaring over an important scene with Aiza eavesdropping on Kousei practicing his piano. That scene was extremely frustrating as we wouldn't have even known that Kousei was playing if it was told to the audience.EnjoymentIt was like getting stabbed with a rusty knife.OverallThis could have been an interesting episode or arc in the show if it was handled in the show but it wasn't.

(I\'m sorry if that\'s a little confusing)==Art==While the art isn\'t as good as it is in the original, it was still good, I didn\'t like how during the piano performance of Arima it was just stills.I also...want to talk about the CGi hands, in the original series you could tell that the hands where CGI but it blended in pretty nicely but in this they were horrible.Also when Takeshi was riding his bike the angle was really weird.==Sound==The sound is a bit of a mixed bag, on one hand the OP and ED were good, but there weren\'t enough Piano performances, one is hardly enough, at one point music was playing when Takeshi was eavesdropping on Arima\'s practicing but because of the music I thought he wasn\'t practicing until Takeshi out right said it.==Characters==I really liked how they gave Takeshi and Emi more screen time and some more development. However the screen time was shared really unevenly with Emi gat about 20% of the screen time and Takeshi getting the rest.==Enjoyment==Even though there were quite a few missteps, I really enjoyed it, because it was more Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso.==Overall==it did feel a bit rushed at times and do wish it didn\'t maie so many mistakes but Overall I enjoyed it and it was a fun OVA about the past of these characters. want to talk about the CGi hands, in the original series you could tell that the hands where CGI but it blended in pretty nicely but in this they were horrible.Also when Takeshi was riding his bike the angle was really weird.==Sound==The sound is a bit of a mixed bag, on one hand the OP and ED were good, but there weren\'t enough Piano performances, one is hardly enough, at one point music was playing when Takeshi was eavesdropping on Arima\'s practicing but because of the music I thought he wasn\'t practicing until Takeshi out right said it.==Characters==I really liked how they gave Takeshi and Emi more screen time and some more development.

The general picture is, back in the quite childhood days of the protagonists, all of them happened to have been to the same exact place (for plot reasons of course), it was then where their rivalry began. We don't get to see any of their older selves, and that was much appreciated. The animation was good?! Was it always like that? I...mean I always had a skeptical opinion on their creep-worthy mouths, and having them as kids not only made them exclude all of the FUPA topping and size shrinking, but also managed to erase some of their facial features, vital ones nonetheless, “noses”, as if the mouth wasn't already weird enough. You know what you're getting when you give a musical anime a shot, and this one is no different I'm not huge on classical music scores, however, my ear can tell a good flow from a terrible one, and it hasn't itched of such once. For once, Arima wasn't the sole focus, however, he did retain his crucial role, [pianist1] and [pianist2] were in the spotlight showing where their motives to challenge Arima came from. You never know that kids are able to concentrate on complicated topics, but gave the middle finger to logic and had it that way. Having not seen the show in a long time, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso: Moments packed along so much that a crappy PHP array can hope to ever accumulate. It was a remarkably interesting take but wasn't nonetheless any less mediocre. In the end, It would be as enjoyable as you found the original anime. mean I always had a skeptical opinion on their creep-worthy mouths, and having them as kids not only made them exclude all of the FUPA topping and size shrinking, but also managed to erase some of their facial features, vital ones nonetheless, “noses”, as if the mouth wasn't already weird enough.

Whilst me and everyone else is expecting some sort of aftermath, it's somewhat of a disappointment. We don't have a clue if Kousei pursued someone not named Tsubaki. It's only left to our imagination.Instead, we are given what's technically a prequel. I like it, and if you like Kimiuso, you would probably like it.Whereas Kimiuso is mostly from the perspective of Kousei, I think this Kimiuso: Moments seems to be from the perspective of an adult.* We see how the picture of a younger...Kaori and Kousei was taken.*We see the lives of the younger Kosei, Takeshi, and Emi. We get to learn what motivated them to play the piano, and what makes them continue trying to improve.*The cliche of putting the hours of deliberate practice is exemplified when Takeshi learned how many hours of practice Kosei does.*We also learn that in pursuing our goal, we should not forget to have fun.*Emi's playing reminds me of how Kaori played the violin: off-tempo and focusing on the performance. She has a crush on him, and she could've been his girl given another set of circumstances.*Tsubaki and Watari are probably meant for each other. They were briefly shown, and they seem to have better chemistry.Interestingly enough, this OVA uses the first opening and ending songs. Now when I listen to the opening song, it feels rather optimistic, which is exactly the tone of this OVA. It returns to the feelings of the idyllic childhood when all our desires were simple.It's a level below the main anime series but worth a watch nonetheless as far as I'm concerned.

One could say the source material, being a good piece of work was done justice by the studio who made this anime.The story is pretty fun and wholesome throughout all the episodes that I\'ve watched (6/12). All the characters are now starting to get together and its...just too gooooooood. Apart from the story and characters even the sound tracks and voice acting is pretty good.The animation and art is pretty average for a fairy tale of a story like this but who cares when it is so entertaining and fun to watch?

Tiger & Bunny Movie 2: The Rising,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12017/Tiger___Bunny_Movie_2__The_Rising,"['The second Tiger & Bunny movie, ""The Rising"", is definitely for the fans. Being a big Tiger & Bunny fan myself, I was very excited to see this movie. While it is not a perfect movie, it did a good job of being true to its source.Story: The movie\'s plot is very straightforward: we rejoin the heroes some time after the end of the TV series. Kotetsu and Barnaby are part of the Second League, but that quickly changes when a new owner buys Apollon Media. What follows is a predictable, but still entertaining story.While the TV series can be seen as ""Barnaby\'s story"", the...new movie is more focused on Kotetsu. Watching him come to terms with his new lifestyle is very heartfelt. The heroes\' struggles against the new villains doesn\'t have as much emotional investment as the series, but is still action-packed.While the overarching story of The Rising is mediocre, the sub-plot involving Fire Emblem is amazing. It may be that the producers/studio realized that having a hero who is transgendered, but a successful business owner and his own sponsor was an amazing positive message. Even if that is not the case, the movie goes into a touching back-story revolving around Fire Emblem\'s past insecurities, and the harassment he was forced to endure. It is a moving and very touching story, and adds more depth to his character.Art: The 2D animation is great, very fluid and sharp. It seems like the 3D hero suits have been given an upgrade as well. The 3D suits are not as jarring and out-of-place as the TV show (they weren\'t even that bad in the show, in my opinion). The 2D and 3D are almost seamless. The new suit design for Golden Ryan is also good, incorporating lion themes to contrast Wild Tiger.Sound: A lot of themes from the show are remixed and reworked for the movie. It was great to hear familiar tunes, but it is always nice to hear new things as well. The voice acting was fine, on par with the TV show.Character: The new hero, Ryan Goldsmith, is an interesting character. Equal parts conceited and confident, and a level-headed point-oriented hero, you don\'t know if you want to hate him or love him. Ryan points out to Barnaby that he ""sounds like his old partner"", and even says similar things that Barnaby said as a rookie hero. Ryan even knows that Barnaby needs Kotetsu as his partner. While he doesn\'t have any development, he serves a purpose in the movie, and he does his job well; Ryan reassures both the audience and Kotetsu and Barnaby themselves that there is no one else who could possibly replace a member of this team.The rest of the heroes get a great amount of screen time. It is fun to see what the heroes have been doing since the end of the show, and how they have changed. Small humorous bits with Rock Bison, the Second League Heroes and Kaede keep the movie from being too dramatic. While Lunatic does make an appearance, he did not get any further development, and that was a bit disappointing.Overall: If you love Tiger & Bunny, you will enjoy this movie. It  is a fun, fanservice-y movie that has a good balance of old and new. If you are not a fan of the show, you might not enjoy this movie as much; many characters are not given much of an introduction, and the interactions between characters are what really drives this movie.TL;DR 5 words/phrases to describe Tiger & Bunny: The Risingfanservice, mediocre main story, great character back-story, visually pleasing, funny new movie is more focused on Kotetsu.

Because when a big-ass screen with big-ass speakers pleasing your ears with big-ass surround sound is replaced by your outdated Cathode Ray Tube, chances are the intensity will be gone and you’ll no longer have anything to distract you from the fact that Peter Jackson might have used a wee bit too much obvious CGI in the final climax. That was definitely the case with the second Tiger and Bunny film, a movie I pegged...as one of the best of 2014 when I initially saw it in theaters because I loved watching Sky High get his ass kicked whilst Dragon Kid tries hard to get us to take her seriously against a gimmicky villain who couldn’t have been more hax without being given black hole powers. Unfortunately, my rewatch in 2015 not only lowered my opinion drastically to the point it was off my top ten, I think I might prefer Big Hero 6 over it – although I refuse to rewatch that film to find out.Sorry to spoil my opinion of the anime before I even get to describing it, but it’s not like it really matters. It’s more a fanservice epilogue rather than a true sequel that adds much of anything, although thankfully it’s more in vein of the fourth Rambo film rather than the Steins;Gate one. In fact, that’s probably why I’m so harsh on the thing: because it could have been Rambo and ended up taking the safe route whenever the opportunity presented itself. Obviously, I’m not expecting any of the heroes to turn their enemies into fountains of blood, but the very least you could have done was make the action less shonen-esque, let alone create some actually interesting villains – something Tiger and Bunny has always struggled to do.The plot of the anime centers on Kotetsu and Barnaby having to deal with the consequences of choosing the second-tier hero status life they did in the conclusion of the series, and how much harder it is compared to living the life of Sky High, if you know what I mean. However, a change in management allows Barnaby to re-enter the first-tier league on the condition that he partners up with an arrogant yet surprisingly rational jerk named Golden Ryan whilst Kotetsu and the other second-tiers have to leave the hero business in order to drive cabs or something. Whilst the two deal with this new change in their lives, a new superpower threat emerges, targeting the superhero business due to reasons that are incredibly cliche to the point that I’d feel no shame in spoiling it, but I won’t out of blogger courtesy. Long story short, you can see every single plot point coming and the movie doesn’t really explore them in a way that’s that refreshing.I suppose Tiger and Bunny: The Rising is worth watching if you want to see more of the characters and how they’re doing after all that Ouroboros business and junk, but there are several plot points that I felt really could have been done better in order to make the movie more than just simple fun. For example, about halfway through the movie’s run time, Fire Emblem is cursed with a power that forces him to relive the prejudice he suffered for being a flamboyant homosexual growing up. This had potential to be a lesser version of Wandering Son’s story, but Tiger and Bunny devotes too little time to it to really develop it beyond “well he was discriminated against and he has to accept that being a minority is just who he is in order to free himself”. Another example of an underdeveloped plot point is Golden Ryan. Whilst the expected route regarding his character would have been more predictably annoying, I’m not really sure why he’s even in the anime other than to give something for fangirls to drool over consider how little he contributes to much of anything. I suppose you could say he’s a critique against that sort of expected route, but it still comes off as kinda weak to me.But of course, the biggest disappointment is Tiger’s story. It’s not bad, but it’s very predictable on its own and explores the consequences of his actions about as well as a Gamer Gater explores the possibilities of being a human being. And when you compare it to his arc in the series, it’s even worse off. Not to mention, considering how he should have retired before this movie even started, it’s even more disappointing to see his daughter actively encourage him to live the hero life. But not as disappointing as the fact that that’s pretty much the only reason she’s in the movie in the first place.And then we get to the fight scenes, which come off as way way WAY too shonen for my taste. I mean the fight where Golden Ryan and Barnaby fight a lady who can clone herself is tolerable because it’s more a strategic battle than a straight-up kung-fu match, and the final one is enjoyably cheesy, if a little too busy. Unfortunately, the only thing good about the other fight scenes is that there’s no talking getting in the way of the action and that it has decent choreography. But Mr. Flawfinder, what else do you need for an action scene to be exciting? Um, a little back-and-forth maybe? Explain to me how it makes any goddamn sense that two heroes cannot lay a single scratch on one villain until a third hero arrives with a very simplistic plan that immediately causes said heroes to massacre their opponent. More importantly, explain to me how that’s exciting to watch in any way. Wong-Fei-Hung’s fight scenes in the Once Upon a Time In China series had more tension.I think you notice by now that I’m kind of struggling to say anything really meaningful about this film. Well you’re right, because really, what else is there to say? It’s more Tiger and Bunny except with a blander script, more wasted potential, and action that looks impressive technically but it’s executed terribly. I’ll admit that the movie is fun to watch if you just want to turn your brain off and see these fun characters doing their thing, but that’s all it is at the end of the day. It’s not even “fun” on the same level as the Trigun movie.

I think it would be more accurate to call it ""The Falling""; not because of the film\'s quality compared to the anime series, but the themes in the movie are more consistent with falling than rising...Story: 6/10Like any film, the story had its strong and weak points. The plot mainly went into further detail about Kotetsu\'s insecurities as basically a back-up hero, but the detail was rather lacking when it shifted focus onto the other heroes and how they fit into the story. It was almost as if they had to be given excuses for appearing.We...see some new backstory from one particular hero, whose name I won\'t spoil, but I think their history could have been fit into the story better than it did. Granted, it is harder to make a compelling story in a full-length movie when the anime was so strongly focused on an overarching plot.The scene snippets that appeared as the end credits rolled were good though, and they helped tie together some loose ends.Sound & Art: 7/10Not much to say about the art or the sound. Many explosions, and the usual visuals seen in the anime. The ost was fine and both the op and ed suited the movie.Characters: 7/10""Lion & Bunny"" would also be a more appropriate name for this film because as far as things go, Kotetsu and Barnaby didn\'t really have that much of an interaction with each other, rather the focus was mainly on Barnaby and his new partner Golden Ryan: a ring in from another city with great confidence and the power to back it up.Besides the main characters, there wasn\'t much noteworthy character development from the other heroes and supporting cast, however, they were all still consistent in their portrayals.The antagonists were fine, but did not leave any lasting impressions.Enjoyment: 7/10The film had a decent enjoyment level. I\'ve always loved the dynamic relationship between Kotetsu and Barnaby so although there wasn\'t much of it in this spin-off, what we saw was still good enough. Kotetsu\'s struggles between balancing hero and family duties were also continued from the anime, and I particularly enjoyed the scenes of him alone in his apartment- they\'ve always been good indicators of his current mental and emotional state, both in the film and anime.Overall (7/10), I think this film was worth watching, even just for the sake of seeing more of the Tiger & Bunny world after having enjoyed the anime. As a standalone film, it isn\'t quite noteworthy, but as a continuation from the anime, well it really could have been a lot worse so I won\'t fault it for that. see some new backstory from one particular hero, whose name I won\'t spoil, but I think their history could have been fit into the story better than it did.

But, again, polishing a turd.The best part of the show was the heroes being friends and there\'s a bunch of that strewn throughout, so that\'s nice. Fire Emblem\'s piece exploring the childhood trauma of growing up queer in a hostile world was fantastic and the whole reason I bumped this up to a 4. Such a great payoff at the end. Obviously, his declaration that being gay (and trans-spectrum) is powerful was the climactic moment. But I also adored his little laugh over how he\'d become self-conscious of himself at all after he...had long ago accepted himself. Wonderful.Alas. The additional characters really only affected the hero side of the show, which meant that every time they were on-screen they were distracting from the show\'s strengths. I\'m sorry, HeroTV just isn\'t a good framing device, even for its satirical intentions. It exists only to say that the heroes arbitrarily can\'t do things. That\'s true of real companies as well, but it\'s not interesting. It\'s boring. And Golden Ryan being a pure heel version of Barnaby from the beginning of the show is just boring, too. Ugh.There were stabs at trying to make Fire Emblem\'s story\'s theme relevant to the other characters, such as Sky High becoming self-conscious about his perpetual Captain America voice. But, as you can guess from how that is not a real problem people have, that fell flat.

Wonderful.Alas. The additional characters really only affected the hero side of the show, which meant that every time they were on-screen they were distracting from the show\'s strengths. I\'m sorry, HeroTV just isn\'t a good framing device, even for its satirical intentions. It exists only to say that the heroes arbitrarily can\'t do things. That\'s true of real companies as well, but it\'s not interesting. It\'s boring. And Golden Ryan being a pure heel version of Barnaby from the beginning of the show is just boring, too. Ugh.There were stabs at trying to make Fire Emblem\'s story\'s theme relevant to the other characters, such as Sky High becoming self-conscious about his perpetual Captain America voice. But, as you can guess from how that is not a real problem people have, that fell flat.

Watashi no Ashinaga Ojisan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1375/Watashi_no_Ashinaga_Ojisan,"[""This is a part of Nippon Animation's World Masterpiece Theatre, and I believe it to a masterpiece indeed. The story chronicles the life of an orphan girl named Jerusha 'Judy' Abbot through her teen-aged years up to her young adulthood.The many characters in this series truly have depth and are far from being one-dimensional - It is amazing that the writers can introduce such characters and without giving them hours upon hours of screen time are able to define their persona.  The feelings and opinions of Judy that is conveyed through her actions, interactions...with other characters, narrations, and letters (she writes them a lot - like a journal) are very sincere but most of all original and this makes a very interesting main character and a very interesting series.The animation itself is very good, showing a very early late eighties to early nineties style with beautiful frame-by-frame hand-drawn characters and watercolour backgrounds - none of that cheap cg you get nowadays.This anime is not a kiddy anime, it is suitable for all ages and not only children but adults will enjoy it as well, and are sure to appreciate the more complex storyline.  This anime also slips in some nice americana and historical references in once in a while that is absent from the book (e.g. the first solo transatlantic flight by Charles Lindbergh on the Spirit of St. Louis in 1927).  This is truly a classic anime that is not to be missed, especially if you are as big an anime fan as I am!Once you have seen the first episode, you are sure to continue on and follow Judy throughout her adventures from a child yearning to break free from the shackles of an orphanage and attend school; to her coming of age years when she discovers love and has her first crush; and in high-school where she develops ambitions of becoming a writer and a fully independent woman! with other characters, narrations, and letters (she writes them a lot - like a journal) are very sincere but most of all original and this makes a very interesting main character and a very interesting series.The animation itself is very good, showing a very early late eighties to early nineties style with beautiful frame-by-frame hand-drawn characters and watercolour backgrounds - none of that cheap cg you get nowadays.This anime is not a kiddy anime, it is suitable for all ages and not only children but adults will enjoy it as well, and are sure to appreciate the more complex storyline.

If you like historical fiction, this...is a great show to pick.  This series is full of fun and (in the second half) romance.  Judy and her friends Sallie and Julia get into many scrapes during their three years of high school, but if you don\'t mind watching some awkward experiences natural to the growing-up process, you\'ll enjoy all the episodes, not just the romantic ones near the end.All-in-all, this is a fantastic, accurate depiction of the educated female experience in 1910s-1920s America.

If this is what\'s going around your head, then all I have to say is ""Just do it"". This is my first time writing a review here in MAL and this show has amazed me. This show has influenced me in  ways I have never imagined. This show without a doubt is the best anime up to date. The first thing that got me interested about this show was the plot since it seems unique...and was adapted from a novel by Jean Webster. I love the characters development even tho it has 40 episodes long, it make me feel like I have growth along with the characters which makes me sad and happy at the same time. One thing to do while watching this show is grab a tissue box and enjoy the show.  I will never forget this show, as it\'s one of my most memorable anime I have ever seen. I want to thank the producers and ofcourse the author Jean Webster for an amazing job on this series. Much love :) and was adapted from a novel by Jean Webster.

I'm a really big fan of the book, and when I found out that someone made an anime of the book, of course I had to see it!All-in-all, it's a pretty decent anime... if you're a big fan of the book. Judy is a little obnoxious at the beginning of the series and the actual story doesn't get really good until right about episode... 25 or so, I guess.But, if you can sit through all of Judy's obnoxious, embarrassing situations, then it's completely worth it. Especially for the ending!...Also, having read the book, there were parts of the show that almost made it a comedy, because I knew already what was going on... but! Ah! Spoilers!To sum up...

Why was he trying to touch her hand when they went out to the cafe? Judy was sixteen when Jervis kissed her. The constant focus of the camera to Jervis\' eyes screamed pedophile. Who looks at minors with that gaze? Jervis stopped Judy from going to Sallie\'s house and forced her to go to his farm because he knows Judy will be happy if she sees him there. Jervis is basically trapping Judy with him by saying she doesn\'t know how cruel the...world is. Judy wants to be independent but he kept insisting that she must depend on him. Fast forward, Judy finally knew Jervis was his secret daddy and seems like she forgot about how manipulative the man was. Jervis groomed her by gifting expensive things so whenever she thinks she doesn\'t want to be with him anymore, she will be reminded of all the things he had done for her. Jervis claims if he revealed that he was John Smith earlier, then he wouldn\'t have fallen in love with her. But let\'s be honest here. There was a woman his age and rich but he still chose Judy, not because he loves her, but because he is a pedo. He doesn\'t want women he can\'t control that\'s why he trains them young. He said he had fallen in love with Judy because she was innocent and honest. INNOCENT... He also said that she was fun. Of course, she\'s a child?! Then married her when she was 21 and still in college. If this is reality, Judy will either end up being a housewife for the rest of her life or she divorces her ""daddy"" because she wants to be in her own for once.I believe Jerusha in the book started as 18 y.o. so I really don\'t get why the anime made Judy a minor. world is.

I first read the book when I was 18, at a friend\'s recommendation, then watched the anime adaptation afterwards. Just like many Nippon Animation adaptations that came before and after this one, it faithfully adapts all the good, the bad and the ugly from the source material, for better or for worse.I will begin with ""the good"", as there truly is a lot of greatness in this story. The anime perfectly adapted everything that is so lovable and charming about the protagonist, Judy Abbott. She brightens up the...lives of everyone around her and is a girl with a hidden talent for writing. An orphan thrown into the world of the upper class, we watch her grow as she navigates this alien world with wit and dignity. And though her friends and classmates seem stuck up and unlikable at first, they too change and grow as they learn to be more humble and kind like Judy.The world that Judy is surrounded by truly feels alive. This is also helped by the stunning art direction and strong sound direction. We watch the seasons change and the students of Lincoln Memorial School slowly physically age over the course of their education. The anime is filled with subtle and quiet moments where Judy will self reflect on her current situation with breathtaking background art and establishing shots of nature or the New York cityscape. As I watched these characters change I grew very attached to them all over again, only wishing for their happiness. However, as I knew the entire story already before starting the anime, the feeling of dread loomed over me knowing that under this easygoing slice-of-life, the problems that plagued the original novel were just as poignant here in it\'s on-screen adaptation. As they are problems rooted in the premise itself, there is very little even an excellent adaptation could fix.Now let\'s explore the elements which may be ""the bad"" to some. There are a lot of aspects of this anime and story with which many people will simply not resonate with. If you do not find Judy an enjoyable protagonist, the likelihood of you enjoying 40 episodes of her journey to adulthood is unlikely. The character design is very simplified; they don\'t appear very realistic and at times even resemble caricatures. The plots and twists were easy to follow even in the novel, since the source material was relatively short - this is even more so in the anime adaptation. It makes the plot easy to follow, but simultaneously it makes it predictable and many might find it boring or slow.By far the biggest change in this anime adaptation worth noting was the setting - while the novel begins with Judy Abott completing her university education with the assistance of her benefactor, in the anime this was changed to her entering high school. This was likely done to make the story more palatable to a younger and broader audience, as many anime under the World Masterpiece Theatre umbrella were produced in a similar manner.Finally, I would like to explore ""the ugly"". In the case of Daddy Long Legs, the new high school setting has become a growing problem as the already complicated relationship between Judy and her guardian only grows worse when viewed through the lens of an adolescent girl. And though this was what always plagued the original novel, all these issues become significantly magnified the moment that Judy\'s age was changed and thus had a very negative effect on my enjoyment of this adaptation. The scenes that made me uncomfortable in the novel become borderline unbearable in the anime adaptation because of this one simple change.There is no way of putting this lightly - at its worst, the core of the plot revolves around a glorification of grooming. And as these issues were always there in the source material, perhaps it shows that this anime should have never been adapted as a shoujo story. A seinen or jousei direction and with the original university setting would make this a more faithful and slightly more palatable adaptation of the source material. As I continue to watch the anime it becomes more difficult to ignore its problems, despite the charming characters and anime production.

This is a part of Nippon Animation’s World Masterpiece Theatre which was a bunch of novels which were turned into anime by Nippon Animation.StoryThis anime follows Judy Abbott, a child from the John Grier orphanage. She was abandoned in the slums of New York as a baby and was taken in by the orphanage. She is forced to stay there for all of her pre-teen life. Until one day, Judy is selected...out of a possible four to go to the prestigious Lincoln Memorial High School in New Jersey by a mystery man. Judy never sees the face of this man however she does the shadows of this man. Due to his freakily long legs in the shadows, Judy affectionalty calls him “Daddy Long Legs”. She also has to write to him every month which is referred to in almost every episode.It is at this school where we meet her friends, Sallie McBride and Julia Pendleton. There is also another roommate who comes in around episode 20 called Leonora Fenton, however she only lasts a couple of episodes as she is forced into Florida. This series lasts throughout the girl’s high school life, up until its graduation. I like how this is done as the older they get and the more they learn, the more mature they get. This is different from the novel as the novel is based in college. Throughout their time, relationships start to form and more characters start to form, Jervis Pendleton, Julia’s cousin who Julia does not like at the beginning however Judy falls in love with him since he is not your “typical rich person”, Jimmie McBride, Sallie’s brother who is a Quarterback at Princeton University who falls in love with Judy however Julia also develops feelings for him (even going as far to learn American Football), and Bob, Jimmie’s friend and captain of the football team who Sallie also develops some feelings for (however since they are both awkward, this does not really end anywhere). There are also some minor characters introduced who really do not do much in order to me to really talk about them.The last 15 episodes or so changes the story up a bit since Judy wishes to become more independent. This leads to her arguing with “Daddy Long Legs” and disobeying things by taking jobs despite Daddy telling her not to. She also is taken to a Farm against her wishes (this is most likely set up by Daddy Long Legs since some story plots take place here which may ruin the entire series if I tell them here). Despite this, Judy finally makes up with Daddy. Judy is asked to deliver a speech for the graduating students, Daddy even promises to show up, however he gets very sick and eventually, Judy has to go out and find him. It is here where finally, Daddy Long Legs is revealed.I rate this story an 8/10Characters:Judy: I actually like Judy quite a lot. I do find her to be quite a sympathetic  character. I do think she should have listened to her father a lot more during the last arc however I do understand her position based on her lifestyle and the fact that she has never allowed to experience true freedom before. I was cheering for her all throughout this series. She does grow up in maturity as well the teachers at the school (mostly the English one), her friends and especially Daddy Long Legs teach her about the world around her and how to act in situations. She was definitely the best character in the show as a show based around her should be.Sallie: She is the nice, kind and helpful friend to Judy. She has some quirks like her anxiety to public speaking however for me she was a little too bland. She really does not develop that much which is mostly due to the fact that there really is not many situations that you can develop her. Still, she is not a bad character by any means and won’t make you want to skip forward or anything.Julia:  She starts out as the snobby rich character who starts of as friends with Sallie however Judy doesn't like her. She does however get the 2nd most amount of development behind Judy (Around the time she meets Jimmie is where it really starts) and she does start to get friendlier with Judy. Furthermore, when you see her parents, it does become evident why Julia is not really happy with her life since her parents are absolute shitheads. I did really start to feel sorry for her at the end.Jervis: I did like him, however he really didn't offer much in terms of personality. He is the friendly, goofy guy in the series. I also find it a bit weird how he straight up falls in love with a minor even though he is about 30 however it does make more sense at the end of the series (It is a pretty massive spoiler). Still a pretty good character though as you do really feel his love for JudyJimmie: Again likeable, however not given to much development other than his relationships with Judy and Julia. Does seem to be a nice guy, even though he blatantly ignores Julia’s feelings for him because of his feelings with Judy.The other characters are really not given enough screen time or development for me to really comment on them too much.I rate these characters a 7.5/10ArtI love the art. Not because of the actual art style or quality since it is good for the time but not specular. What really gets me is the fact that they ACTUALLY manage to make the characters grow. Not from teenager to adult or kid to teenager but year to year, the 3 girls actually do grow in height. This is especially noticeable from flashbacks. I believe not enough anime that last years have this sort of continuous physical growth and that this should be more prevalent. I did have a few problems with the art/animation (especially those basketball scenes) however they are not really noticeable enough to ruin this seriesI rate the art at an 8.5/10ConclusionI like this anime quite a bit. It is not the best series out there I’ll admit however if you are looking a good lengthy show or perhaps an older style show then this would be a good one to watch. Your views may be different in terms of how you feel of the characters or story however I do believe this is suitable for pretty much everyone.I give the series an overall rating of 8/10 out of a possible four to go to the prestigious Lincoln Memorial High School in New Jersey by a mystery man.

I haven't read the book but from what I've gathered it does adapt it quite faithfully but differs in some areas. It tells the story of an orphan named Judy Abbott whose granted the opportunity of a lifetime to go to a prestigious all-girls academy by way of the mysterious benefactor John Smith. Judy knows nothing of his character or his identity other than having distinctively long legs and wearing a top hat. It leads her to penning him the...name Daddy Long Legs and sporting a fitting attire matching her colourful imagination of his appearance.The story following this summary is of a coming-of-age involving Judy Abbott's growth as a teen into young adulthood as she progresses through school, makes new friends, gains new responsibilities and increases her worldview as a formerly sheltered orphan. It's a simple premise backed up by very simple strengths - Its setting and its characters. It comes down to personal preference but early 20th century is an intoxicating period of time to peer into for me. It has this distinct sense of wonder and romance in an era of uncertainty but assured optimism. A beginning of a new quality of life to be brought to a larger spread of the populace. It's before skyscrapers and other tall buildings tower over neighbourhoods and towns, where the mainstream availability of locomotives was still a new way of traveling.This brings me to the visuals. From their humble beginnings of Heidi to Anne and eventually to the famous 1999 version of Hunter x Hunter, Nippon Animation are highly respected for consistency in their shows and a unique distinction from most other anime studios. If you've seen Anne of Green Gables this show will make you feel right at home with backgrounds that are breathtaking and with quality coming at a rate that's nigh unmatched for shows of similar length during its era. Not many anime have layout as considered and accurate to the era as World Masterpiece Theatre shows do and My Daddy Long Legs stands at the pinnacle of the year it came out in for TV anime. It seems like you can't watch an episode without pausing it at least once to just take in a shot. The colours and accuracy really go a long way to make the show have this romantic atmosphere representative of the promising new era these characters live in.And that's not to say it lives and dies by the layout, the animation is quite consistent and even stellar at times. Because it's the kind of show that doesn't need a lot of movement there was time to make most character animation detailed and smooth. Judy being a very energetic character lends to some very expressive character animation and she gets that chance to shine on multiple occasions. Some scenes involving the girls playing basketball have animation that is so absurdly smooth it could pass for a movie of its era.The character designs are a personal favourite of mine across the board. It has this distinctive slightly western influenced style blended in with traditional anime art of the late 80's. It feels wholly unique of its peers but anyone with a little knowledge of older anime could instantly pick up the country it was made in. It's a nice differentiation of the more Ghibli styled WMT shows like Anne and Heidi that indicated they weren't doomed to follow in the shadow of Takahata and Miyazaki's massive influence on Nippon Animation. Rather they were able to reiterate and build in other directions. My Daddy Long Legs is often considered quite similar to Anne but if you put the two next to each other they're significantly different shows only sharing familiar ideas and settings. Judy is less eccentric than Anne for instance and the drama is a lot more romantic. The central cast is older so it deals more closely with the prospect of growing up into young adulthood and acquiring the desire of seeking love. And while Judy is an orphan the setting is that of a suburban America rather than rural Canadian farmlands; as such locomotives, upper class parties, dances and the smell of industrialism is prevalent. Essentially what makes My Daddy Long Legs such an impressive work is that it can take a different source material that could not only stand alongside Anne but also be compared to it despite its obvious differences.On the topic of character designs I'll touch upon the characters themselves. This is My Daddy Long Legs' greatest strength. Judy is an amazing main character who would initially remind one of Anne, but her more uncouth and wild nature shows you that she's someone who's a little more bombastic albeit a little more predictable. Her struggles and story are endearing, being a girl who wants to fit in with a class of students dissimiliar to her upbringing. The other two main characters Sally and Julia are perfect at complimenting Judy's character. Sally being a little more shy but considerate while Julia on the other hand is more outspoken and snobby who initially considers Judy an outsider. Watching their dynamic transform throughout the show is both entertaining and heartwarming as they slowly turn into close friends looking out for each other and sharing hard times together.And in addition to the main cast is has a very strong side cast. Jervis, Jimmie, Bob, Mr and Mrs Semple and Miss Sloan just to name a few all offer something different while never feeling remotely out of place. And they maintain a lot of agency, they don't exist to make the story work at certain points. Mr and Mrs Semple are great at offering a setting that isn't represented much in this show as well as allowing Judy to find solace in a world that makes her feel alone sometimes. Jimme, Jervis and Bob are the designated good boys. You feel for them even though Bob isn't as important as the other two and even when they make human errors it's believable enough that it never turns into genuine frustration over their character or personalities. I even left out a character among those mentioned who offers possibly the best episode in the show who's voiced by none other than Hiromi Tsuru, the voice of Meryl Stryfe and Bulma. It's a cast that feels alive and makes you want to see more of them.Seriously if there's one thing that has to be said about the fantastic work put into this show, it's that it was done with a staff of nobodies. The most significant person who worked on this anime Kei Wakakusa, most well known for the soundtracks of Hikaru no Go and Kemonozume. And while the Storyboardist and Scriptwriter have been regulars for WMT for years it's just very impressive that a director who up to this point had only directed a handful of Anne episodes and to this day has directed barely anything else was able to put the visuals and writing to screen in such a captivating way.One piece of criticism I do want to give which I believe is more contentious is I didn't initially like the way the story shifted into a romance focus which heavily sidelined the simpler episodes of growing and experiencing new things. All the characters involved are great but I think the drama was a little too melodramatic that served to be pretty jarring compared to the earlier more endearing episodes. Once it shifts into gear going full throttle with the romance however that issue begins to wear off. Really what point needs to be made is that the earlier content where everyone's still growing up is absolutely fantastic. Up until around episode 27 I was very confident in giving it a 10/10 which I very rarely do and have never done for a TV anime. The scattered focus allowed for more ideas to come to the table and make more varied and fun episodes which was lost when the romance started being the meat and potatoes. I don't want to detract from the romance plot because it is well done, it just suddenly shifted away from the stuff I truly loved a lot rather than intermingling the romance with the everyday activities and struggles.I want to avoid going into spoilers as this is a fairly obscure show so I'll leave it here. I just wanted to express my love for this show that I did not expect to love as much as I did. It's without a doubt a staple in WMT anime and a very interesting peek into a style that acts somewhat as a predecessor to modern slice of life anime. It's a true slice of life with a female main cast hidden in the guise of an adaptation of classical literature. And granted while it does have an overtly sentimental execution with its plot points it gets so much right that it's hard to take away from its fantastic strengths. It's a brilliant anime. One with wonderful characters, a beautiful setting, visuals that maintain a detailed accuracy to the time period and an endearing story of growing up, discovering love and your place in the world. name Daddy Long Legs and sporting a fitting attire matching her colourful imagination of his appearance.The story following this summary is of a coming-of-age involving Judy Abbott's growth as a teen into young adulthood as she progresses through school, makes new friends, gains new responsibilities and increases her worldview as a formerly sheltered orphan. It's a simple premise backed up by very simple strengths - Its setting and its characters. It comes down to personal preference but early 20th century is an intoxicating period of time to peer into for me. It has this distinct sense of wonder and romance in an era of uncertainty but assured optimism. A beginning of a new quality of life to be brought to a larger spread of the populace. It's before skyscrapers and other tall buildings tower over neighbourhoods and towns, where the mainstream availability of locomotives was still a new way of traveling.This brings me to the visuals. From their humble beginnings of Heidi to Anne and eventually to the famous 1999 version of Hunter x Hunter, Nippon Animation are highly respected for consistency in their shows and a unique distinction from most other anime studios. If you've seen Anne of Green Gables this show will make you feel right at home with backgrounds that are breathtaking and with quality coming at a rate that's nigh unmatched for shows of similar length during its era. Not many anime have layout as considered and accurate to the era as World Masterpiece Theatre shows do and My Daddy Long Legs stands at the pinnacle of the year it came out in for TV anime. It seems like you can't watch an episode without pausing it at least once to just take in a shot. The colours and accuracy really go a long way to make the show have this romantic atmosphere representative of the promising new era these characters live in.And that's not to say it lives and dies by the layout, the animation is quite consistent and even stellar at times. Because it's the kind of show that doesn't need a lot of movement there was time to make most character animation detailed and smooth. Judy being a very energetic character lends to some very expressive character animation and she gets that chance to shine on multiple occasions. Some scenes involving the girls playing basketball have animation that is so absurdly smooth it could pass for a movie of its era.The character designs are a personal favourite of mine across the board. It has this distinctive slightly western influenced style blended in with traditional anime art of the late 80's. It feels wholly unique of its peers but anyone with a little knowledge of older anime could instantly pick up the country it was made in. It's a nice differentiation of the more Ghibli styled WMT shows like Anne and Heidi that indicated they weren't doomed to follow in the shadow of Takahata and Miyazaki's massive influence on Nippon Animation. Rather they were able to reiterate and build in other directions.

For something that was made back in 1990 it looks pretty good. No complaints with art or animation.As for the soundtrack the opening I like, the endings fine but I wouldn\'t want to listen to it too often. Music within the show I would say was was done pretty well nothing to be surprised about though.The characters are well written and their personalities shine through. The way the characters think and act are very precise to the time they are in, as least to my...belief. And as much as I might want to hate a character especially Julia I can\'t say they ever did something that was too out of character for them. Honestly there are times I get frustrated with the characters but I can appreciate that they have very realistic flaws that make them human.The story itself well as for this ""mysterious benefactor"" I don\'t think anything has been easier to guess. I\'s not bad but just wasn\'t expecting it to be ""that"" easy.I guess occasionally there is a little sexist comment about ""being more ladylike"" but it\'s understandable from that time.Now this is the part I hated most of all. I can\'t believe on one has said this yet but Judys romance is the absolute worst and if anyone actually thinks about it it is seriously messed up on so many levels. If you want to know more read all of it.SPOILERS JUST SKIP TO NEXT PARAGRAPH (it\'s really important though)I\'m going to ignore the big age crush Julia has and instead go on about Judys. Now at the start I didn\'t hate it so much because he wasn\'t making any moves on the girl and it was just a simple one side crush Judy had because she didn\'t know. But he knew and never told her, even worst he even made moves on Judy. Dude you should know better. Not even considering the age gap he knew he was a dad figure to her in the letters she wrote. Ordering her to not be allowed to hang out with her finds to the point where she now considers the letters to be a sad obligation and wants to get rid of you to the point she feels she has no control over her life and wants to be fully independent. Yet he still shows up not telling her a thing instead still trying to get her to fall you knowing she doesn\'t know you are the person in the letters. He is full on manipulative. With letters he\'s marrying someone he knew and was financially supporting when she was 12. Without letter he\'s marrying someone who is young enough to be his daughter. Daughter or could have been daughter you tell me what\'s worst both are incredibly bad.If I had to pick something I really didn\'t like from the story it would be the part where Judy says ""finally became a normal girl"" and expresses how much she hates to go back to the orphanage. Now I get she isn\'t exactly proud of being an orphan but really during her time there you telling me there wasn\'t anyone she wanted to see, no bonds she made with anybody?? it just makes the first episode where they show how tough it was her to leave and how much she cared about the other children seemed useless. For good parts Judy letters do feel genuine and something I actually look forward to reading.If there is anything that I like about this show is that you see how the characters grow up from children to adults. When they are young and basically everything before ep 25 the show is kind of lighthearted and focus on relationships with friends and ordinary student life. As they start to grow up you can start to see (literally) the characters mature and interactions with others and their how topic of conversations start to change. It really feels as if you grown alongside with them.The show is enjoyable enough though (completely ignoring existence of the romance thing) and I do plan to finish all of it. If you can sit through 10 episodes that\'s basically the tone throughout the whole series. belief.

Like many other people I watched it because of Daddy Long Legs, it was a truly good character that I had never seen before.4. But, maybe it's my own option and many might disagree but it was really lacking.First of all, the story was slightly getting boring and started to get hard to watch.Most of the things were easy to predict and I...didn't like them.The main character in my opinion was slightly annoying and stupid, there were many times I wanted to drop it but continued because of my favorite character.

Wu Dong Qian Kun 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42266/Wu_Dong_Qian_Kun_2nd_Season,"[""As Someone who has read the entire Novel of Wu Dong Qian Kun, I can honestly say the reason I even STARTED to read the 1300+ chapter Novel in the first place was because of these 2 anime seasons which made me realize how amazing some Chinese stories can actually be!Ling dong starts as weak and frail individual but slowly becomes an extraordinary existence later on when it is all said and done, and the things he goes through makes you want to cheer for him with all your might!After the end of the 2nd Season I could not wait for season 3 and I...took a chance on reading my first ever Chinese novel and it did not disappoint! I HAVE NEVER READ ANY ASIAN NOVEL BEFORE !Now back to reviewing the anime adaptation, when it comes to  comparing it to the novel I would say the anime leaves some things left on the table but still does it's best to cram in as much as it can into those 22 min episodes, and to estimate the first 2 seasons cover about the first 200 chapters in the novel. Meaning every 100 chapters = 12 eps so that means there will need to be 13 seasons to cover the whole story .....The fighting and art/animation are really good and well done for a Chinese anime. I hope they do come out with a season 3 soon. The fan subs are lacking and it was hard to find some quality translation subbed ones online.Very good story I highly recommend watching this! and reading the Novel! took a chance on reading my first ever Chinese novel and it did not disappoint!

I\'ll keep this nice and short as I think there are not much to really say about this anime anyways.Wu Dong Qian Kun is an anime based in an alternate version of ancient China all about this boy named Lin Dong, but if you are here, you probably already know all that. Lin Dong was weak and then he became strong for no reason blah blah blah.Listen, yes, this is another one of those Chinese...anime set in ancient times, where the main character is op and everyone who comes against him, even if 5 times stronger on paper will still lose. Is it trashy? Yeah. Is it predictable? Yeah. But I personal enjoy these types of anime for a brain dead viewing experience. If you are someone who wants 10 outta 10 story, 10 outta 10 plot, this ain\'t it, and it never will be. But if you like a bit of casual op main character ""trashy"" anime. Then here you go.Story and Character are a 5 outta 10 on a good day, quite bland and overdone. But the art and sound on the other hand isn\'t too bad. I did enjoy a fair bit of these two seasons so I\'m not gonna leave it with too bad of score but it gets a 6.5/10 from me.One last thing before I go, Chinese is my first language, and this anime\'s English subs are way less interesting than the actual dialogue and they sometimes even miss-translate things. But this happens with 90% of Chinese anime so there really isn\'t much you can do about it. Learn Chinese maybe? probably not.Ok, that\'s all from me folks, adios. anime set in ancient times, where the main character is op and everyone who comes against him, even if 5 times stronger on paper will still lose.

Visitors battle against Yan City disciples to reach the highest floor of the 8 floor Pagoda Tower summoned by the Yan City Mental Power Master. All the while, the Lin family battle against remnants of their past enemies in Yan City while Lin Dong struggles to solve the mystery of the hidden room in the Pagoda Tower. After these altercations are settled, Qin Tan's ice traumas have relapsed and put her in a comatose state...which forces Lin Dong to attend the Main Lin Family venture into the Nirvana Level Tomb in the Tianyan Mountains. It is in this tomb where Lin Dong finally gains some traction in powers while also making enemies of the Main Lin Family and Wang Family which come to bite him in the back after he leaves the Tomb.Story: 6/10Unlike other cultivation donghua, Martial Universe is overtly different in the sense that it doesn't take a million episodes for Lin Dong to explore the world. Many series like God of Ten Thousand Realms take a while to develop because the MC stays dwelling in the academy for so long which is a powerful weak point of many cultivation donghua. However, it still follows other series where MC finds a powerful treasure from ancient times that can boost their strength in a few years or the annual exam that benchmarks the MCs hidden powers. Martial Universe doesn't bring anything new to the table in terms of genius plot development but it still has entertainment value.Art & Sound: 6/10The art isn't too bad, I don't find Lin Dong attractive as a main character. HIs lashes are overextended into his peripheral vision, his short hair and edgy character design make it a bit hard sticking to the series. In the manhua, he looked more edgy and kid-like but I didn't think his character design would stick even in S2. The animations are pretty decent, you can still tell that the characters other than MC are unnaturally rigged.Sound design is ok, I didn't particularly have any interest in sound design of Martial Universe.Character: 7/10Like all cultivation donghua, the director expects us to have knowledge of cultivation levels and Seal symbol master levels. Lin Dong progresses fairly far in this season from what I believe is early Yuan Dan to Peak Yuan Dan and Seal Symbol Master Rank 2 to Seal Symbol Master Rank 3. The Tower Battle progresses his Mental fortitude and the Tomb venture progresses his cultivation base. We also get to see the Lin family affairs back together after being targeted multiple times in the early part of the season. In terms of character development, these arcs are proof that Lin Dong's journey is beginning. All that's next is the Lin Family tournament which I presume comes next season where Lin Dong gets underestimated again and again and again.Overall: 6/10Nothing important happens in this season apart from Lin Dong discovering the hidden room and 2 ancestral tombs that will boost his powers in time for the Lin family tournament (I suspect). which forces Lin Dong to attend the Main Lin Family venture into the Nirvana Level Tomb in the Tianyan Mountains.

In this encounter, the world around you, the people in your life, and the things they demand of you all lose meaning. Your attention belongs to that special someone and no other. Time itself ceases to move as your encounter unfolds; when that special someone carries on a conversation with you, it feels as if it’ll last forever. Your heart races, pulsating as if it’ll spring forth from your chest at any given time. Your nerves quiver, the butterflies fluttering freely inside your body. Your vision blurs and your face crimsons, the...blood coursing through your head at an alarming rate. Clouded by a whirlwind of strange thoughts, emotions, and instincts, you react to this encounter in a completely different fashion than you would in any other situation. The ideas you contemplate, the things you say, and the actions you create are a jumbled mess, shaken and stirred by the heat of the moment. Just as the conversation is gathering steam, that special someone departs from you and the encounter concludes. Time has moved forward again. While you’re mostly relieved to distance yourself from the situation, there’s a part of you that pleads to return to that brief encounter, that yearns to conversate with that special someone, that fantasizes of losing yourself in the moment once more.For those that have become infatuated with a crush, for those that are adjusting to their feelings of attraction for another, for those that are stumbling their way into their first relationship, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san is a reflection of their lives, their own romantic endeavors manifesting themselves on a grand scale. As this show ignites and refines the chemistry between its two protagonists, Nishitaka and Takagi, it reveals its understanding of relationships and the intricacies they possess. Subdued in its tone and serene in its outlook, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san’s handling of its central couple is accomplished with nigh-unparalleled ease, using their series of frivolous yet elaborate pranks to slowly and steadily transition into something more, and its examination of their relationship is delivered with a rather unconventional approach.When two contrasting personalities attempt to align, there is an army of problems that arise along the way due to the differences between them. Although said differences can generate a rift in relationships, they can also strengthen them; contrasting personalities naturally heighten common interests. While most works of the romance genre opt for discovering these common interests, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san almost entirely ignores this pursuit. Instead, what it values is how these characters think and why they’re attracted to one another. In particular, it values these concepts as they relate to Nishitaka.It is his point-of-view that Skilled Teaser Takagi-san operates from. It is his series of pranks, his attempts to outwit and “tease” Takagi, that this show mainly revolves around. Nishitaka is always thinking of ways to perplex Takagi, either by concocting a complex scheme to use on her or (more often than not) by solving the problems she gives him. Every challenge Nishitaka tackles, every puzzle he confronts, makes for a satisfying watch. No two obstacles are alike; each distinct in their own way, they’re deceptively simple at first glance but dangerously intricate the more you analyze them. And, boy, does Nishitaka analyze these obstacles. The music crescendos to a fever pitch, with saxophones screaming their way through, and the animation dizzily spirals out of control, its color scheme constantly changing, as he ceaselessly conjures countermoves and hypothetical solutions in his head. To Nishitaka, these pranks are far from trivial pastime activities. To him, they are battles of the intellectual variety, epic in scale, each choice determining one’s fate.It’s obvious that Nishitaka cares deeply about outsmarting Takagi, which makes it all the more depressing to witness him falling short time after time. It matters not what plan he formulates, what measures he takes, what approach he adapts; the result never changes. Nishitaka is Sisyphus, forever doomed to try changing his fate, to watch his efforts go to waste, to repeat the same pattern. It’s not his fault, though. With his remarkable tenacity, perception, confidence, and cunning, Nishitaka definitely distinguishes himself as a talented individual. Were he competing against someone else, against anyone else, one could argue that he’d easily be more than a match for them. However, as long as Nishitaka remains tethered to his current circumstances, he’ll always be defeated. Sure, he’s quite intelligent for someone his age but, for all of his virtues, he pales in comparison to the titular character.“Prodigy” is an overused word; it's a term that's often given to people who don't deserve such praise. Takagi, however, is an exception. Not only is she able to unravel the most intricate of Gordian knots but she also does so effortlessly. Not only does she repeatedly confound Nishitaka with riddles, traps, and decoys galore but she also manipulates each and every one to obscure her true motives. However, it’s not just Nishitaka that Takagi dupes. On multiple occasions, she easily deciphers the tricks her classmates pull on her, alongside subjecting them to a few of her own, and (in one memorable instance) she’s even able to deceive her teacher, manipulating him into disciplining someone else for her transgression.With each competition, with each episode, with each challenge, it’s almost pre-determined who's going to persevere in the end. On the one hand, this pattern of predictability causes Takagi to come across as a Mary Sue, one who's almost entirely defined by her ceaseless victories. On the other hand, you simply cannot resist watching her mercilessly outfox her peers time after time. Takagi is akin to a world-renowned chessmaster practicing against novices of the game, a decorated military tactician competing against cadets in the field, a veteran criminal investigator matching wits with rookies on the job; the inevitable outcome of each encounter never detracts from the entertainment value that they provide. While it is pleasing to witness Takagi flaunting her intellect, it’s in conveying this show’s themes where she really proves her worth.Skilled Teaser Takagi-san is, perhaps more than anything else, a master of subverting expectations.  With each issue that arises, the solution to them is never what you’d anticipate. Takagi and the show itself deceive you into assuming, alongside Nishitaka, that the motives, nuances, and hints in each situation are leading to one solution when the true answer is entirely different. Again and again, this show emphasizes that Takagi’s victories are due to Nishitaka overthinking each situation, attempting to uncover the deeper meaning behind it, instead of choosing the most obvious answer. Through its titular character, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san argues that the problems we encounter in life aren't as challenging or complex as we think they are. Through Takagi, this show argues that if we can push aside the details surrounding these problems (alongside our preconceived notions of them) and simply examine them for what they are, it'd be easy to find a solution for our issues.For Takagi, each challenge presents an opportunity for Nishitaka to acquire more knowledge, and she strives to accomplish that goal. Yes, part of why Takagi teases him is for her own amusement; she enjoys watching her opponent panic, struggle and ultimately collapse under the pressure she places upon him. However, the other part is because Takagi wants to see Nishitaka mature and grow. The puzzles that she tasks him with are crafted out of love; Takagi gives Nishitaka a hard time mainly because she cares about him, and this detail really strengthens their relationship.When Skilled Teaser Takagi-san directs its focus away from the smoke and mirrors, it's actually a genuinely sweet and charming show to watch, and the central couple’s relationship emphasizes its virtues. On the surface, Nishitaka and Takagi couldn't be more different if they tried. While Nishitaka approaches every situation with tact and caution, Takagi is far more direct. While Nishitaka leans towards the naive, Takagi is incredibly perceptive. While Nishitaka is something of a workaholic, Takagi is more relaxed. However, with a closer observation, one can see that, despite the surface-level differences, they are essentially alike. Both Nishitaka and Takagi are confident and intelligent individuals that adopt an extremely timid approach to their relationship (Nishitaka more than Takagi). Watching them develop more and more into expressing their feelings for one another, while supporting each other along the way, is easily the highlight of the show. In fact, the central couple's bond is so heartwarming, nuanced, and inspiring that it allows one to overlook the more unappealing aspects, the various deficiencies and mishaps, of this show that materialize just outside the insulated sphere of the central couple.100% Unrequited Love is an in-universe anime that not only inspires a few of Nishitaka’s schemes but it also serves to poke fun at other works of the romance genre. By overloading Unrequited Love with genre-specific stereotypes, cliches and tropes, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san claims that it's different from the other shows of its chosen field, more intelligent and self-aware than the rest. However, when it involves its supporting cast, Takagi-san resorts to the same tiresome and tedious cliches as its peers. Whenever this show transitions away from its central couple and towards the people around them, it almost always suffers because of it. While the supporting cast strengthens Takagi-san’s youthful charm, they also represent this show at its weakest. With each appearance the supporting cast makes, it becomes more and more apparent that, outside of its central couple, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san isn't all that adept at developing its characters.The relationship between Mano and Nakai, classmates of Nishitaka and Takagi, is among the most dull and lifeless that I’ve seen in recent memory. Mano is the “shy one”, blushing, squirming, and stammering about to no end, while Nakai is but a cardboard cutout, hardly worth mentioning, really, and they lack even a faint resemblance of chemistry. Then, there's Mina and Sanae, classmates of the central couple that serve as comic relief. The adventures that this pair embark on are rife with memorable gags - my personal favorite is a recurring act where they dub over random conversations, like an exchange between cats or a chat between the central couple - but they tend to wear themselves out after a while. Mina and Sanae’s adventures are meant to represent the protagonists’ shenanigans from a different, more carefree, perspective but they (more or less) come across as re-iterations of previous events than anything creative or unique. It doesn't help matters much that this show stylistically pigeonholes these two. One is the “genki girl”, manically working herself into a frenzy over trivial matters, while the other is the “quiet one”, silently observing the mess that unfolds around her, and Takagi-san never allows either of them an opportunity to establish themselves beyond these classifications.When Takagi-san strays from its intended course (mishandling a supporting character here, re-treading an old plot line there), it's the central couple's chemistry that helps re-adjust its focus. Skilled Teaser Takagi-san is, in part, an elaborate game of chess, a neverending battle of wits, with brilliant strategists on either side. It is also a refreshingly pure and simple tale of romance, a love story mostly unchained by the conventions of its peers. And all of it is deftly secured by the incredible bond between its protagonists. Fascinated with their intellect and awestruck by their passion, you cannot resist wishing to accompany the central couple in whatever direction their relationship guides them toward. Time itself ceases to move as you rush headlong into Takagi-san, allowing its loving, all-encompassing embrace to overtake you. blood coursing through your head at an alarming rate. Clouded by a whirlwind of strange thoughts, emotions, and instincts, you react to this encounter in a completely different fashion than you would in any other situation. The ideas you contemplate, the things you say, and the actions you create are a jumbled mess, shaken and stirred by the heat of the moment. Just as the conversation is gathering steam, that special someone departs from you and the encounter concludes. Time has moved forward again.

Time itself ceases to move as you rush headlong into Takagi-san, allowing its loving, all-encompassing embrace to overtake you."", ""Over a year ago I reviewed a little anime called Skilled Teaser Takagi San a show that disliked it for it's mean spirited comedy, repetitive teasing matches and annoying characters. The main reason for this it's because I watched the series at the wrong time when I was jaded towards the romcom genre thanks to bad experiences from certain romcom animes that shall not be mentioned.My jadedness eventually died out in November of that same year and I started to love romcom animes again.Fast forward 4 months later where I made a list of romcom anime that I should give a second chance. Skilled...Teaser Takagi San was the first anime on that list and I watched the whole series again in it's dubbed form on Blu-ray.After re-watching Skilled Teaser Takagi San I went from disliking it to loving it to a point it became not only one of my favourite shows of 2018 but one of my favourites romcoms period.The story follows a young boy Nishikata who mercilessly gets teased by his classmate Takagi. Not wanting to be an easy target\xa0he swears vengeance on his classmate Takagi for all the times she's teased him and made him blush out of embarrassment.Will he be able to make Takagi-san\xa0blush from embarrassment even once in the end? Find out in Skilled Teaser Takagi San.Saying that the story of Skilled Teaster Takagi San sweet is an understatement. This is one of the sweetest and innocent shows I have seen in a long while. Where do I begin? For starters does a fantastic job at establishing the shows innocent nature by having the kids in the series behave like actual natural kids that you will encounter in real life.No unrealistic, melodrama, no misunderstanding contrivances just actual kids living they youth as people. It is very grounded on that aspect as it makes the world of Skilled Teaser Takagi San unique and refreshing compared to most romcom anime.The teasing matches themselves range from engaging, smart and addicting. Some would say that the series is way too repetitive for its own and I can understand why however the teasing matches add more to this show then hinder it thanks to brilliant character interactions that never gets old.The best part of theses teasing matches is that is they were not contrived and mean spirited. Nishikata may do some stupid things during the teaching matches that causes him to lose but the show reminds the viewer that he is a kid and kid's generally would do anything to reach the goal even if it's a dumb move that Takagi often comments on.Another strong aspect of Skilled Teaser Takagi San is how it's romance. Dialogue wise, especially in the beginning, may not be much however it completely makes by having character movements and body language.(Spoiler Alert)Episode 10 is the best example of this as it was the episode that these two would eventually become a couple. From Nishikata bushing more frequently than usual to Takagi getting more physical to Nishikata\xa0Skilled Teaser Takagi San showcased that you don't always need long dialogue just to indicate love.(End of spoilers)If, there one thing that Skilled Teaser Takagi San does masterfully well that most other romcom anime lack these days is character chemistry.Despite them having these teasing matches on a daily bases they actually do support one another very well.Add up to this show's rich comedy that would make anyone and you got yourself a charming romcom story on your hands.If I had any nitpicks at with this innocent cute love story it would slow pacing at times then again this is a show that features primarily a child character cast and children tend to learn things slower compare to adults.However, this nitpick is nothing compared to the fact that the show at times still functions like a short despite having 24 minutes of run time. It wasn't noticeable in the first and last couple of episodes but when that slights issue happened it really showed as some episodes did not translate well to the 24 minutes format. This is especially distracting when the show decided to focus on the funny but less interesting trio of girls.Lucky these small nitpicks that I had didn't damage the overall story for Skilled Teaser Tagaki San as It's a simple, nicely directed and entertaining slice of life romcom.Naturally, this is a character driven show meaning the characters for a character-driven should bring they're A game. Thankfully the chararters in Skilled Teaser Takagi San are great and charming to watch from start to finish.Nishikata is a sweet and adorable idiot. He consistently screws up his teasing antics against Takagi, and he always feels bad for screwing up. However, while he may be an idiot he makes up with determination and humanity. Despite him flailing he's very detected to beat Takagi at a teasing match however at the same time he's not a mean spirited angsty brat who wishes Takagi out of his life. This makes him a great character to watch because despite everything that happens to him still a human.The real star of the show is without the question, Takagi. A first glance, she appears to your typical kindhearted and caring person who loves to tease her classmate Nishikata.However, there's more to her than her teasing antics. She has a strong crush on him where she is constantly doing these sexual teasing acts just to penetrate Nishikata bluishness.This makes her an interesting foil for Nishikata to overcome and seeing her tease and outsmart him in the most unpredictable and savage ways was intriguing to watch.Despite Takagi being my favourite character in the show, there was one slight problem I with her is that she can be a bit of a Mary Sue at times. She's not one of the theses annoying types or anything but at times she can be too perfect for her own good. Hopefully, this slight problem will get fixed in season 2.Despite that small complaint, Takagi is an incredibly fun and likeable character to watch.The supporting characters are surprisingly good. While they don't develop as characters they were enjoyable chararters especially the main girl trio who were some of the funniest supporting chararters I have seen from 2018 thanks to nicely done short stories.I'm glad that the series was able to have a strong cast because it wasn't for the characters then the series would be nothing more than a tedious slog feast.On to the visuals side of things, Takagi San is gorgeous. The background scenery is masterfully drawn in a realistic way and it only made better with the show smooth colour palette that brings the scenery\xa0to life.Character designs were simple and nicely drawn especially Takagi. Forehead memes aside her design is gorgeously cute to the eye and I really adore her expressions.The animation may not be as good as the art as the series relays on basic animation techniques for movement but it was still serviceable for what it is.As for the sound department, it's very good and fits well the cute and innocent show.This is all thanks to the Hiroaki Tsutsumi did an outstanding job at bringing this charming romcom series to life with the light instrument pieces that play in the background.Both opening and ending themes are super cute and perfectly fitted the show.Romcom anime generally have a hard time when it comes to English Dubs as many of them especially back then suffered from subpar audio quality and bad acting. When I decided to watch this show dubbed I was worried that these two cute love birds (Takagi and Nishikata) would be butchered by poor acting.Thankfully Funimation manages to produce a fantastic dub for it.Funimation's rising figure Sarah Wiedenheft did an outstanding job voicing and portraying the cute Takagi. Another great performance in the dub goes to Aaron Dismuke voicing the determined Nishikata. Every other performance ranges from good to great.Great job Funimation.Skilled Teaser Takagi San won't be winning the best romcom anime award from me but it is still a great, fun and engaging show that I loved from start to finish.The characters were great, funny and nicely written, the visuals for a slice of life, romcom anime were stunningly beautiful and music is sweet.If you're looking for an innocent and charming romcom anime to watch on a sunny afternoon than Skilled Teaser Takagi San would be a fantastic choice.

Forehead memes aside her design is gorgeously cute to the eye and I really adore her expressions.The animation may not be as good as the art as the series relays on basic animation techniques for movement but it was still serviceable for what it is.As for the sound department, it's very good and fits well the cute and innocent show.This is all thanks to the Hiroaki Tsutsumi did an outstanding job at bringing this charming romcom series to life with the light instrument pieces that play in the background.Both opening and ending themes are super cute and perfectly fitted the show.Romcom anime generally have a hard time when it comes to English Dubs as many of them especially back then suffered from subpar audio quality and bad acting. When I decided to watch this show dubbed I was worried that these two cute love birds (Takagi and Nishikata) would be butchered by poor acting.Thankfully Funimation manages to produce a fantastic dub for it.Funimation's rising figure Sarah Wiedenheft did an outstanding job voicing and portraying the cute Takagi. Another great performance in the dub goes to Aaron Dismuke voicing the determined Nishikata. Every other performance ranges from good to great.Great job Funimation.Skilled Teaser Takagi San won't be winning the best romcom anime award from me but it is still a great, fun and engaging show that I loved from start to finish.The characters were great, funny and nicely written, the visuals for a slice of life, romcom anime were stunningly beautiful and music is sweet.If you're looking for an innocent and charming romcom anime to watch on a sunny afternoon than Skilled Teaser Takagi San would be a fantastic choice. It's an innocent and charming romcom piece that I hold in high regard."", 'Life is like a game, if you play right, you’ll win. Well, that’s sounds like bullshit but life can feel like a game sometimes. You’re like a player in a world with others and to be successful, you need to play right. Now, what the hell does that have to do with a show like “Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san”?To put it simply, this show feels like watching two players compete but not in the way you’d think. To me, Takagi and Nishikata are two characters that play with each other in life. However, it’s a little bit different than competition. Between the two, Takagi is...always the one that stays ahead of the game. Think of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. In that show, the coyote attempts to catch the road runner but always comes up short. For this show, Takagi is always successful in defeating Nishikata at pretty much anything. As predictable and tedious as that sounds, the show is actually more than that.I’ve read the manga and even as a 1-cour adaptation, the show manages to deliver what’s needed to achieve success. The majority of the story focuses on the duo of Takagi and Nishikata as the two main characters. Every episode takes on multiple segments that features the two in various shenanigans. Even though the show is fictional, many of these shenanigans can occur in real life. These range from being tricked into strolling down a shadowy tunnel, competing in sports, test of courage, school academics, and among many others. The main attraction of the show is to sell the character chemistry between Takagi and Nishikata. This pair’s relationship will undeniably be the take or break for most viewers.On the individual level, Takagi is a clever girl with a cute face and crafty mind. While she isn’t a prodigy or gifted with extraordinary talent, she often thinks outside the box to outsmart her opponent, Nishikata. Takagi’s character and personality also makes her quite likable as she carries a youthful charm. Even as she teases Nishikata, it’s more than just teasing. She wants to know him more and through their interactions each time, they unintentionally grow closer. There’s also no malice between the two despite the low key drama. From my perspective, Takagi considers Nishikata as more than just a friend. Some people may call that nonsense since she often plays Nishikata like a toy. However, if you really pay attention to their character interactions, it’s easy to realize how close they are. Does this venture into the territory of romance? That’s actually left for viewers’ imaginations. There’s the genre tag of romance for this series but it’s far from a love story.Nishikata is pretty much the boy that gets defeated by the master of tease, the one and only Takagi. The show often tries to make audience anticipate with a thrilling feel on whether he can ever beat her or not. For me, this made me come back to this show every week. From simple games involving erasers to more complex mind games with playing with emotions, it’s the type of show that categorizes game as more than just winning. Nishikata himself is an average kid with an average personality and living an average life. We don’t find out much about his past and honestly, I don’t think we need to. This show focuses on the present and what’s ahead rather than characterization. In essence, the show’s character dynamics lies in how characters connect rather than how they develop.Speaking of characters, there are also three others that show up in the show although they are unrelated to the series as a whole. Well, technically they are in a way but they don’t get involved with the teasing and games. That’s probably one of my complaints about this show. They should keep the characters from Ashita wa Doyoubi away in this anime as it feels like a distraction. Thankfully, their screen time isn’t long and mostly added to make the show flow a bit as a slice of life. That being said, I think the show succeeds not just in the character chemistry but also in pure comedy. The way characters react comes out naturally in many ways. This is especially true for Takagi as she often gets the joy of teasing Nishikata shown through her reactions. While Nishikata feels annoyed by this, he never truly hates her. In fact, you could say that he gets a joke out of losing countless times in their daily life games.A simple show like this only needs simple visuals and TMS Entertainment accomplishes that. Takagi is undeniably adorable with her charming smile, bright personality, and facial expressions. She’s able to carry this show thanks to these characteristics that are adapted straight from the manga. Similarly, Nishikata has a goofy looking face that often makes him look like a fool, as viewers will expect in many episodes. It makes this pair incredibly cute to watch thanks to how they act. The art style enhances that experience. Their voice mannerisms also stays pretty consistent throughout the show. Even someone like Yuki Kaji can play a character like Nishikata as he’s been in the roles of goofball characters before. The incredible voice acting of Takagi makes her character even more believable as a master of teasing.I decided to give this show an 8 after reflecting on what I watched. At first, it seems like a high score for such a dry story. However, it’s the pure comedy and character chemistry of the main character pair that won me over. Every episode made me laugh and it never betrayed expectations. There are times when I wish this show’s segments would last longer than it should.

(Has no impulse control, has no control over the volume of his voice and incapable of recognizing basic causal relation.) That's the premise for 12 24 min episodes. If that sounds like something you enjoy, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san provides.I hope that teachers in Japan don't actually use their mentally challenged students with no volume control as target practice for...throwing chalk. That's a legitimate thought that came across my mind as I watched this.It wouldn't be so bad if the story actually progressed somewhere, but 12-episode adaptation syndrome is in full effect, so story goes nowhere. throwing chalk.

That sort of attitude is missing these days.Each and every episode is refreshing and gives you smile especially seeing the expression on Nishikata's face, because they are priceless like Takagi states and teases him.While the starting episodes have lots of teasing, as the series comes near ending, they are reduced and the focus is more on romance.Like I said it, It is a slice of life, so basically there isn't any story at all and not much characters either. Excluding the 2 main characters, we have 7 side characters who would'nt impact the main characters much.The art is funny, cos the head is big while the body is small, but it gives a better opportunity to understand the emotions of characters.Coming to soundtracks, The opening and ending songs are really good and pleasing to hear, while the soundtracks in middle are just some monotonous tones to convey the situation.Overall, If you are a fan of 5 minutes short comedy like Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan or Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, which do not have much story but make you smile every 5 minutes and remind you of your childhood days crush stories, then I am sure this anime is best suited for you.If you want story, or development of characters or something meaningful to learn, then this isn't the choice for you :) or crush between the kids, the tension in air and being careful not to hurt the other person (Nishikata with Takagi).

The blog goes into a lot more detail but in summary, I completed all 12 episodes (not 5; MAL won\'t allow me edit that field), my assessment of episodes 1-5 was about the same as described here but I found episodes 6-12 more enjoyable, and I have revised my MAL rating upward from 3 to 6.The rest of this review below is my original unedited review from 2019.The description of this anime had me a little skeptical whether I\'d be able...to enjoy it, but the above average score and the numerous comments about how cute it was convinced me to give it a try. Two episodes in, I was finding it very discomforting, even cringy, leaving me doubting whether to continue watching. Where is this story headed? There was still plenty of room at that point for the main characters and their relationship to develop in a way that would make it a worthwhile journey. But my efforts to get a feel for what lie ahead suggested that it was largely more of the same. Still, for whatever reason, I watched some more. Episode 3 was actually somewhat enjoyable. The fourth was a return to the unpleasantness of the first two. And then came episode 5.What\'s the problem? Without mincing any words, I cannot help but see Takagi as a horrible person for the way she bullies Nishikata. No matter how cute she is, treating another person like that isn\'t cute or funny, it\'s just mean. As the saying goes, it takes two to tango, and quite frankly Nishikata is an idiot in how he handles her treatment. Too often he tries overthinking things when he could just end it by saying \'I don\'t care\', \'No thanks\', or by ignoring her and walking away if possible. But every time he falls into her trap, even when he knows it\'s a trap and could easily avoid it.Is it teasing or bullying? My take on it is that teasing means keeping it within the bounds of the parties\' sense of humor, limiting it to stuff they\'d be able to laugh about after the fact. I don\'t see Takagi exercising any such restraint. She has little sense of when enough\'s enough. Furthermore, her actions have tangible consequences for Nishikata, such as getting extra cleaning duty as punishment, or failing a math test, and when things like that are the result, it\'s over the line from teasing into bullying. Some have compared their antics to Road Runner and Coyote, but that comparison fails when you consider that Coyote is usually the perpetrator, the one who starts it, and that\'s generally not the case for Nishikata. As a general rule, bullying scenes are uncomfortable for me to watch, even when the bully is the antagonist and the victim is the protagonist. That they\'re trying to unapologetically make it out to be cute and funny just makes it worse.In other respects, the show gets better marks. The OP and ED animations are impressive and well done, and I enjoyed the setting and give the background artists high marks. The scenes that feature the three girls, Mina, Sanae, and Yukari, were enjoyable in a CGDCT kind of way. In a lot other anime I might complain that they\'re filler that only takes time away from the main story, but in this case they\'re welcome relief from it. Character design is average. Takagi is actually very cute, but then so are the characters in Happy Tree Friends. On the balance, I\'ll give the show a 3/10 rating.Full disclosure: I couldn\'t finish the series. I tend to be a \'completist\' and with over 250 anime completed at this writing I had never dropped one before. The closest I\'ve come before was a few that had me pondering whether watching something else would be a better use of my time. But with this one, after the math test scene in episode 5 it was too painful to go on. The streak is broken as ""Teasing Master Takagi-san"" becomes my first ever drop, as well as only the second to score below a 4. Now I hear there\'s going to be a second season, which makes me think about how many other shows I would like to see get another season that probably never will. One thing that might make me decide to resume watching is if Takagi does a turnabout ala Shouya Ishida in season 2, but I\'m not holding my breath. to enjoy it, but the above average score and the numerous comments about how cute it was convinced me to give it a try.

To normalise such a horrible practice under cloak of cuteness is not only distasteful but it’s also reckless given the target audience. This Takagi girl is a total piece of shit and trying to make her cutesy doesn’t rid her of her utterly horrible, evil personality. She mercilessly, constantly teases the protagonist to the point it has a real impact on his life and personality, plus he seems constantly stressed and nervous because of it, and somehow we are supposed to enjoy this “humour”. Total cringe packaged as...an anime. It would be one thing if it was just offensive, the anime is not even funny. The gag patterns are repeated over and over several times per episode and there is no element of surprise. I literally didn’t laugh even once on any of the scene so what is even the point of this shit show existing. Very rarely do I drop anime, specially popular ones, this early on into the series. But this one was so painful and cringe to watch I just cannot come up with a single reason to continue. an anime. It would be one thing if it was just offensive, the anime is not even funny.

A war between 2 middle schoolers. Enjoying their youth to the fullest comes the ecstatic interactions between our two main characters, Nishikata and Takagi. In short, the females always win.That’s basically the whole premise, a girl teasing a boy to no end and his failed attempts at retaliation only fans the flame even more. However, there’s always variety in the way she does her schemes. It’s fun to watch each time and highly enjoyable. As a manga reader, I am glad they were able to present all the...emotions correctly and keep the tone as it should be originally. I appreciate the staff at Shin-Ei Animation for making this anime as fun as possible.I also enjoy the extra cast with their small screen time. The random but appropriate situations the girls make are just as adorable and fun to watch even when it’s for a short time. Works as a lovely transition to the Main Cast once more.If you’re having a hard time on a Monday and just can’t seem to get in any sort of mood, watch this anime and it’s sure to bring your spirits up.The art is more nicer than I expected, especially the eye design. The manga had a super simple drawing for the eye unlike the anime where they added a bit more. I like it since it adds a bit more spice to the characters. I love the background art and the colours used in it. The animation is also great. The facial expressions are super fun to see and the character movements, although small, adds a more human feel to the characters. It’s small details like those that I appreciate in a series.The soundtrack isn’t too special, but it does its job properly, making the anime sound even funnier was accomplished by the soundtrack and I enjoyed listening to it. Both the OP and ED are indeed super catchy and I never skipped it for its cheerful visuals. I loved how we got both Yuki Kaji and Rie Takahashi to play our mains. That makes it even better for the series.The crazy antics between the two characters are what makes the interaction so...middle-schooler like. Seems just right when it comes to 2 kids having fun teasing eachother. Although, it’s quite one-sided. Even so, the character chemistry is great and you mostly never get bored watching the dynamics between them.Overall this is an anime that you wanna watch for fun. Nothing too endearing, but there to help with boredom and to put a smile on your face if it does at all. I loved reading the manga and the anime is just as good as it’s presented.

The comedy element is present in here, I have laughed in all episodes so far, and the management of different stories but being faithful to their (plot,plans tease, backfires, tease) without making it annoying its really amazingly executed.The last 4 episodes made me change my score from 8 to 9, amazing enjoyment I got from this series, amazing ending, I wish we have some of this simple but unique shows more frequently.This show was a huge surprise. The ending is beyond Perfect story there is a little screen time for 3 girls, whose names I don\'t remember, and it\'s really good, with just a few minutes they show us 3 likable and different characters which are in the same class as the main, experiencing their problems, they show childish relatable stories with great comedy.Art 9/10The animation background it\'s amazing, the character design isn\'t my cup of tea but i got to admit that it is  really impressive, it represents the age of our characters so well, by being kind of a childish artstyle, every background when Nishkita and Takagi walk together is great, just as if it were from a movie, I was really impressed by this aspect of the show.Sound 7/10The ending, and op are not good at all and there is no point on reviewing. 3/10The voice character its really adhoc to its characters, this a feature i really like.Takagi\'s voice is adorable and it suits her so well when he teases Nishikata 10/10Nishikata\'s voice represents well the age of the character, and the weird sounds when he gets frustrated can\'t be better 10/10Character 9/10You might say ¨Nishikata is a pussy"" ""Oh man he is so dense"" ""What an annoying character"" they are 12 years old, try to picture yourself at that time and basically you will describe yourself as the 3 words I used above, I think his attitude really portrays the age in which he is right now.Takagi is really likable, she basically carries the show herself,  appealing attitude, combined with a good representation on how girls really act at that age when they like someone and with a some mature comedy makes Takagi the star of the show 10/10Lots of chemistry between this two characters, you can kind of feel the ""love"", every episode  Nishikita starts getting more in love with takagi without really realizing(just when we were younger), great interactions between characters.Enjoyment 10/10I really enjoy watching this series, it show us a simple life we all lived, with characters that actually feel kind of real, the teasing of girls when we were younger, the fluster moments you had without knowing why, they show us love seeing it with eyes of kids.

The ending is beyond Perfect', ""A story that is in a constant state between irritating and boring, Takagi-San is far from the light hearted slice of life rom com its commonly referred to as.The moment I found Takagi an unredeemable character is when Nishikata is studying for a test in the library.  You see Nishikata stay longer and put in more effort than the other male students.  Takagi joins Nishikata while he's studying, he momentarily opens up to her despite all of the 'teasing' she has done at his expense.  He states that his parents want to see him score in the top 50 in his class...and he doesn't want to let them down so that's why he's staying longer to study compared to the other students.  For the smallest amount of time you're led to believe that Takagi genuinely cares about Nishikata as she helps him study, correcting mistakes he made and explaining how to come to the correct answer.  As she's leaving the library Takagi tells Nishikata that everything she helped him with won't be on the test, the following day and he ends up getting a failing grade meanwhile Takagi gets one of the highest grades on the test.  If Takagi genuinely cared or had feelings for Nishikata this would have been the pivotal moment where she refrains from her constant 'teasing' and help her classmate crush in need.The side story amongst the 3 female classmates only serves to break up the nonstop harassment/bullying portrayed in the main story.  During these interludes nothing ever happens and it brings the flow of the anime to a halt, however boring these side characters and their plot are if they were not present it would be 20 minutes of school bullying.To summarize the plot of the series, Takagi is always 2 steps ahead and can out-think Nishikata therefore he can never win against her.  He tries everyday to not be 'teased' by her, he has endless internal monologue trying to out-think Takagi, he gets outsmarted by Takagi, his face gets red and she laughs at him rinse and repeat for 12 episodes.Something that I thought I could at least overlook was how the characters are drawn, but the more I watched the more their giant foreheads make them look like weird anime aliens. and he doesn't want to let them down so that's why he's staying longer to study compared to the other students.

Though, you will know most  those things from episode one, so that doesn\'t matter much...I came to this show from Kaguya\'s recommendations.Expected it to be funny, easy-going show, without many dropped cliffhangers, which i would watch and enjoy slowly (it never happens, but nevertheless, i hoped). And romantic, maybe a bitInstead... Well, i am jumping on a hate train. I probably won\'t say much that other people hadn\'t said. So, short theses:- Supersmart mature girl- Ultrastupid childish guy...- That\'s while they both are ~12 years old- Girl constantly makes fun of a guy, bullies him, sometimes in pretty hard ways- Girl clearly sees and predicts guy\'s every move! (no hope for him = everything is predictable = boring)- Guy makes revenge efforts again and again, but always fails (miserable to watch)- Guy constantly sweats, blushes and can\'t speak normally. He always has a bunch of different emotions, every single one of which shows on his face- There are also 3 sidekick girl characters, which sometimes take the screen time. They are pretty useless and boring- Story stays in place, pace is slow and isn\'t fun in pretty any way- Most of the problems and dramas are so actually tiny... The guy could easily ingore most of them, but he dives in because of his stupidness and keeps failing. And he never learns!- There is some threads, like there is something romantic between those two... but because of everything higher, i can\'t digest this ""romance"" and it feels just cringeWhy would this genius girl do this to such mentally retarded guy? Why does he even has her interest? Why would she influence him to fail the test in that episode 5, goddamit??? Is she really a sadist?""Cringe"" is definitely a proper word to describe this anime. Not on the outside - on the insideWill place this at 3 because art was somewhat nice (not for main hero). And, I guess, to make lower score, it could trigger me harder, right?Anyway, this is the first show I drop (at episode 5, btw).

And this is my lowest rated anime (at the moment of writing this)', 'She teases him; he blushes and resolves not to let her tease him again.Rinse and repeat every single episode. The anime is divided into a series of shorts each a few minutes long; there are normally about 4 or 5 per episode. Each is a small self-contained story about Takagi’s and Nishikata’s daily lives in and out of the classroom. This isn’t a plot-heavy series and it’s not meant to be. What it is meant to be, however, is a character-oriented series, and so that shall be my main focus.Just to get the art and music out of the way: the art style is...really cute. Huge heads, massive eyes (even by anime standards), high foreheads and relatively simple drawings altogether. It suits the characters and show style nicely without being too extravagant. The animation is done well, even if not much is being animated besides the characters. The music is good, nothing spectacular but again, just nice. No complaints on these areas.So now to the characters. There are the two main characters, Nishikata and Takagi, who take up the majority of the shorts, and then there are a few supporting characters (a trio of girls in the same class) who feature every now and again. Nishikata and Takagi engage in a variety of activities, from making bets with each other to tandem riding to doing homework or going shopping. All basic daily activities, and nothing really happens in any of them event-wise, but they provide a lot of opportunities for exchanges between the two.Nishikata seems to take these exchanges as mental matches between the two of them - constant sparring to see who comes out on top verbally. He reads deeply into every single thing Takagi says, wondering if she’s trying to tease him and then trying to play bluff and double bluff. Whilst it’s true that Takagi does slyly tease him a fair amount of the time, watching him thoroughly analyse every single little sentence of hers becomes irritating after a while.  It’s obvious to the viewer (although not to Nishikata) that her teasing is well-intentioned and that she actually likes him, perhaps even has feelings for him. (The latter’s shown more subtly until the last couple of episodes.) Nishikata does seem to like her (hence the blushing) but the feelings seem to be pretty pure and innocent. In any case, her teasing is always incredibly mild. If she wins a bet and gets the opportunity to order Nishikata to do anything she wants, she’ll just choose something like going shopping together or another harmless activity.Nishikata, however, sees every single tease as a personal failure, and a blow to his pride. He never seems to be able to best her in anything, and to be fair to him this is probably incredibly frustrating. But it never ends! He never actually tries to talk to her properly about anything! He never tells her unequivocally to stop teasing him, because it would be a ‘loss’ to let her know that she’s gotten to him. He just makes every exchange, no matter how harmless, into a mental sparring match and thus causes his own inferiority complex to worsen, because she always ‘beats’ him. (Even when there’s nothing to ‘beat’ him on – sometimes she just asks him a simple question that is literally only an attempt to make small talk.)There is almost no character development whatsoever. If you look at the beginning episodes, and compare them to the later ones, you’ll notice barely any change. She still talks to him and teases him in the same way she’s always done, and he still tries and fails to best her the same way he always has. This was the main flaw of the anime, as a character-driven series. The characters just become boring after a while, you can predict almost exactly what will happen and how it will happen. Even Takagi’s initially adorable laugh becomes grating after hearing it every few minutes, episode after episode.The show does try to add a few more characters into the mix, but they suffer from the same problem of one-dimensionalitis. Their exchanges are also cute, sometimes funny and sometimes boring, but I think the only reason I liked these three girls was that they were a break from the endless cute monotony that was Takagi and Nishikata’s exchanges. They were nothing special in and of themselves.In conclusion, I wouldn’t say that I dislike Skilled Teaser Takagi-san. Whilst I didn’t exactly look forward to it every week, it has a lot of sweet moments, and it does have a few funny parts. I just can’t binge watch it.If you want to try it, I wouldn’t recommend watching more than one or two episodes at a time, with a large break in between sessions. That should keep it from getting too tedious, and instead just be a cute and mildly comedic series. XD really cute.

XD', 'Before I embark on my review of Karakai Jouzu no Tagaki-san, I would like to first mention that this is my first review; I am sorry if this does not meet your expectations in terms of length, word usage, or points I make. In this arguably harsh review, there will be a few spoilers that I would not quite categorize as candidates for ruining the show, but rather general, disappointing realities of it. I did not enjoy Karakai Jouzu no Tagaki-san if not at all because the concept became too repetitive (as many have also pointed out) and I did not enjoy it to begin...with. The character models were okay, the music fit, and the animation was quite nice. Unfortunately, the strengths end there, which leaves us with the flaws of the show.The story is a hit or miss with most people: The main protagonist, 12-year-old Nishikata, is constantly being teased by a girl in his class who secretly has feelings for him, skilled teaser and forehead goddess Tagaki-san, who is entertained only by embarrassing him every day. Although this may be refreshing and different for some, I believe there is a reason that we have not seen something like this explode before. I use the words “every day” and “constantly” with all potential force that they carry - the entire show is episode 1 repeated over and over. If you do not like the first few episodes, you likely will not enjoy the rest of the series. Every time Nishikata plots revenge, it is immediately ruined by the fact that he will never carry it out successfully because that is what the entire show is about: this kid’s hopelessness for getting back at the girl who teases him. For me, I could not help rooting for Nishikata when he devises a plan of revenge, but I always stop myself from getting too excited because I know it will never happen. This frustrates me because Tagaki always finds a magical way to work around his plan or conveniently say something that will throw Nishikata off and destroy his - in some cases - imaginatively formulated ideas for debunking this chick’s ruling over him. The best example of this that I can remember is when they are comparing heights and the boy is actually taller than Takagi-san, so he thinks in his mind “Man, I bet she’s really bitter because she’s shorter than me” then the girl immediately says “Oh, and I’m not bitter”... like HOW WOULD YOU KNOW HE WAS THINKING THAT?!?! The show becomes so unrealistically biased towards Takagi-san that I cannot help hating her. This show seems to rely on their cute-faced characters when it comes to hiding the rather embarrassingly poor story.The characters in this show were unenjoyable because they were either too stupid or too shallow-minded and predictable. The aforementioned fact that there seems to be little to no change throughout the show leaves us with characters that developed in no way and told the same joke over and over again. Nishikata never carries out any kind of revenge or suddenly becomes less of a pansy, and Takagi is always entertained by his clumsiness and inability to not be an idiot. I would imagine that this quintessential category of development throughout the story would be present, but it seems this one just does not provide that factor. It feels like I am watching a clip of a fat man falling on repeat; it may be funny the first few times around, but it just cannot last 12 episodes. The show also follows the story of the cliché group of friends containing a clueless girl (Mina Hibino), nerdy but witty girl (Yukari Amakawa), and sad and quiet but smart girl (Sanae Tsukimoto). I did not care much for this side-story because although it drew attention away from the atrociously repetitive story of the two main characters, it also did not have much substance itself. Each member of this friend group shows their character (all of which were extremely stereotypical) the entire show so they never changed or showed any signs of progression. Overall, the characters in this show are either cliché, lifeless stereotypes or tell the same joke the entire series and do not change at all.In conclusion, I would not recommend this show because of the sick, unchanging concept. If the idea of getting a friend to blush or become embarrassed interests you, try it. The fact that Karakai Jouzu no Tagaki-san carries out this idea for 13 episodes is the reason I composed this review: to save you innocent people from wasting the 5 hours of your life you would be spending to watch this anime. Obviously, it is your choice, so if you would like to know if you would enjoy this show, the best test for that would be to watch the first episode... because that is basically the entire show. with.

Indeed, we learn more about Takagi and Nishikata during their chat and here is the feat, it is hard to foretell how Takagi will trap Nishikata.When you mix this with an interesting visual choice, one cannot deny that this  anime a little...pearl, that unfortunately, you can miss if you don't give it a try. pearl, that unfortunately, you can miss if you don't give it a try."", ""After not being able to even force myself to watch past episode 5, I might include some  g r o u n d b r e a k i n g  spoilers.The ''plot'' in the anime gets predictable and overused already after episode 3.Takagi teases the protagonist, protagonist tries to tease back but fails miserably because takagi already predicted his next move which leads to the protagonist getting teased again.The anime fails to deliver anything new to the story after the second - third episodes, interactions are extremely cringey and uncomfortable, protagonist blushing needlessly after every second sentence doesn't help much either.Many...people are talking about how cute and uwu the anime is, but fail to notice how Takagi is literally bullying the protagonist, true, she is cute when she smiles after teasing Nishikata, but her constant teasing leads him to always being paranoid, stressed out and anxious of getting teased again. I don't really understand how this can be defined as entertainment. Normalizing bullying because anime girl makes uwu faces is disturbing, and yes, Takagi does have a crush on Nishikata but that does not justify her bullying, that makes it plain abusive.As I've already mentioned, story is extremely boring and predictable, I can't bring myself to continue this anymore, wonder what they will milk out of the bland repetitive story for the second season (not really). people are talking about how cute and uwu the anime is, but fail to notice how Takagi is literally bullying the protagonist, true, she is cute when she smiles after teasing Nishikata, but her constant teasing leads him to always being paranoid, stressed out and anxious of getting teased again.

Coz she always tease him without he revenge her tease.Actually, takagi likes nishikata. But she express her love with tease. And only with tease she can be closer with him.Why i select this anime for AoTS?Because Takagi too cute in her way to get Nishikata heart. Her VA also so suitable with takagi characteristic, make a Takagi more lively of the manga series....Another character like mina, yukari, sanae, etc interesting too. especially trio baka-girl. They make a anime more colorful, make a manga not only about takagi and nishikata.In the last, this is a masterpiece anime! I hope you can enjoy when watch this animeSorry for my bad english Another character like mina, yukari, sanae, etc interesting too. especially trio baka-girl. They make a anime more colorful, make a manga not only about takagi and nishikata.In the last, this is a masterpiece anime! I hope you can enjoy when watch this animeSorry for my bad english', 'I can see why this anime would be amusing to some people, it does have a lot of teasing and a main character that isn\'t treated like a human being as he is mentally abused over and over again, some people can\'t get enough of doormat mcs.Now, I don\'t really care much about that since I couldn\'t care less about a mc like this, whether he is abused to death or not, that\'s not why my score is fairly low. The jokes were pretty witty at times, I\'ll have to give it that and this is why the score isn\'t lower. A lot of...kinda funny scenarios are added where she f*cks him silly mentally.

There\'s no real point to it and I somehow don\'t really feel any spirit or personality from the characters. They don\'t feel even remotely ""real"" or ""alive"", they just feel like machines that exists purely to deliver jokes. Not sure how to best explain it, but normally you feel like the characters have a proper purpose and they\'re almost ""alive"" instead of dead and static. You feel that you actually like the characters and you want to see what they\'ll be up to next, that if they were real, you\'d love to spend some time with those people, be it alone or in the ""gang"" they usually have.Well, there\'s nothing like that here. I wouldn\'t say I hate them, but I don\'t like them either. They feel empty and I certainly can\'t get behind any of them. It actually feels cringeworthy at times to see the excessive overreactions and unrealistic situations in a setting that is supposed to be pretty realistic. This just wasn\'t a good anime in my opinion, at least for me it was a complete miss. The only thing it gets plus points for is that the jokes are witty/smart/well thought-out, but that\'s sadly the only thing this anime has going for it and it just isn\'t enough. kinda funny scenarios are added where she f*cks him silly mentally.

Humor used is beyond cheap and sad. Storyline along side that is horrible due to misguided attempts of humor and trying to keep pressing the point failing every time. The characters keep being stuck in their roles and show no change in any sense of the word which makes it worse.I know this is rather harsh, but so far I seen the only thing that this anime has going for it is a okay art style that is fairly unique from the regular styles. The sound on it's own is actually...not that bad. Problem is that none of the other points will get any sympathy from me. It just grinds my gears way to much, I like to see a series that shows at least some intelligence. This for storyline, humor as the characters and their progression.

That getting out of the way how does the show hold up so farThe story is very loose but it works. It is just a bunch of pranks and childish fun at and after school between two kids who kinda have a thing for each other, and their friends. Its very episodic but it leads to amazing moments and some character development in an episodic show. Its romance. The kids have a thing for each other. Also there are lots of...jokes about growing up and teenage life which are relatable. Maybe some owo jokes here and there but this is not an ecchi. G O O D.

I haven't noticed a single point in where the animation was noticably sub par like in other shows i have watched. The characters are very simple and stylized which works well. The detail in some parts of the background scenery is amazing too.The sound gets across that childlike innocence with whistles and exaggeration in certain points. The acting is solid and OMG THATS FRICKEN KOICHI FROM JOJO'S VOICE ACTOR!!! The acting overall is believable and adorable. Then again the voice actors seem to have played adorable characters before.The characters are adorable as hell.

Takagi (the title character and the secondary protagonist) is a girl who likes to toy with Nishikata by teasing and pranking him a lot.But this is because she kinda loves him. She also kinda makes a few dirty jokes on Nishikata without it turning into softcore porn like (generic animu number 9266664632882). Mina is a girl who acts like a younger child as she always wants to be cheerful. She also is very immature and sometimes borderline dumb, but it makes her lovable.

Sure, you might like someone, but how do you even approach that person? Even if you do manage to approach him or her, how do you make sure that you don’t make an utter fool of yourself? Most kids end up arriving at one answer – show your interest by teasing the target of your affection. Sure, the target may not take it all that well, but at least you get to interact with them because of it, right? Karakai Juzou no Takagi-san (henceforth abbreviated as ‘Takagi-san’) is an anime...about one such girl, Takagi, who shows her interest in a boy, Nishikata, by teasing him.Takagi-san follows an episodic format, with each episode containing 2-3 short stories about Takagi and Nishikata, and usually one story about three girls who are in the same class. As far as story is concerned, there isn’t much to speak of. Nishikata tries to come up with a plan to win against Takagi, only to be completely foiled by her, after which she proceeds to tease him. Pretty much every episode follows that format, with various little changes here and there. While it does seem to be the sort of thing that would get repetitive and dull over time, it has a certain charm to it that keeps things interesting.As far as Art is concerned, it makes use of rather minimalistic artwork. The coloring and details are nothing spectacular, but it doesn’t look all that bad either. Still, due to this, it looks rather clean overall. The Sound is relatively forgettable, although I found the opening to be rather catchy (or annoying – take your pick).The show mainly revolves around the interactions between Takagi and Nishikata, and they are generally rather cute. Takagi always makes sure never to go too far, and it always stops at the level of minor teasing, rather than bullying. She simply teases him because she likes him, not because of any real animosity. The other characters that show up are usually nothing all that important, except maybe the three girls (Sanae, Mina, and Yukari), who get some screen time in every episode. These segments are usually just youthful ramblings of young girls, but it can often be rather funny as well.All put together, Takagi-san is a cute anime which works really well as a palate cleanser, to watch in between more serious anime. It may feel rather repetitive if watched all at once, so I advise against binge watching the whole thing. A simple way to describe Takagi-san would be a gender-bent version of Tonari no Seki-kun, with a little more of a (childish/innocent) romance focus. I’d recommend this one to just about anyone, since it’s a rather difficult show to hate.

Just without the slapstick humour and even a glimpse of hope for Tom to not only ever emerge victorious, but even get the upper hand for a brief moment. This is a very ""hardcore"" slice-of-life series, with no plot and no real conflict, since any possibility of friction is denied by a single, indisputable rule: Takagi-san always wins.The plot is as simple, as they come. A boy named Nishikata constantly ends as the victim of his female classmate\'s, eponymous Takagi\'s, ""teasing"". Bulk of the runtime is dedicated to Nishikata trying to one-up his...opponent by carefully analyzing all his options and eventual outcomes, and without fail, always making the worst possible decision, thus ending as butt of Takagi\'s jokes. There are no exceptions, no ties, no lucky victories, no wins granted out of pity and no consolation prizes - unless one would consider Takagi actually being in love with Nishikata, which he is obviously being oblivious about, as such.This relationship was not enjoyable for me to watch. It\'s far too one-sided and with Nishikata never getting a break or a breather, it\'s simply frustrating. Under the guise of all the teasing there\'s apparently strong affection, but I can only wonder how twisted and sadistic one\'s personality has to be to enjoy seeing their loved one in a state of perpetual distress. Any decent person would hold back seeing how often the teasing ends up with Nishikata getting in trouble with teachers, not to mention the negative impact on his academic performance.I\'ve been told that it would have been an innocent flirt, if only Nishikata wasn\'t so dense, which I would agree with, if the whole relationship wasn\'t defined by this power struggle where one of the sides is assigned a role of the loser for life.While Nishikata does seem somewhat convincing as a middle schooler, the same cannot be said about Takagi. To begin with, her demeanor and wittiness make her appear at least five years older than her peers. She\'s completely flawless, makes no mistakes, always wins her gambles, can easily read everyone\'s minds and never gets flustered (at least not in front of others). Takagi is basically a goddess, with everything going her way and the story itself being dedicated to her, without ever delving into her thoughts - an entity possibly meant to exact vengeance on behalf of all girls ever teased by boys. Do I even have to say that a series revolving around an infallible Mary Sue is not very entertaining?It seems that there was an attempt made to break the monotony of constantly watching Nishikata getting the short end of the stick by bringing a small cast of side characters with their own comedy routines, but they too grow old really fast while further emphasizing repetitive nature of the whole show.In terms of animation and sound design there is not much say. It\'s a solid craftsmanship, but the audio-visual techniques accentuating jokes are used rather sparsely. The opening sequence is saccharine and feels very by the numbers. Fortunately, every two episodes end with a cover of a different pop song, performed by Takagi\'s voice actor, which is a nice touch. As a side note, Yuki Kaji\'s screaming and high pitched tone quickly become grating.Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san in the span of 12 episodes keeps recycling the same jokes, usually in the form of Nishikata\'s exaggerated reactions (which also serve as fuel for Takagi, so she can keep tormenting him without ever growing bored) and inability to get a clue, mixed with moments which were probably meant to be heartwarming, but come off as forced, because seeing the same song and dance of a girl dropping hints the boy she likes just cannot pick up to save his life, due to the blindfold the author forced on him, is just not very convincing. I\'m certain the series would benefit immensely from Nishikata growing over time more resistant to teasing, forcing Takagi to put more effort in devising her schemes, which could also serve as stimulation and maybe even make her fall in love with him a little bit more thanks to increasing challenge. With illusion of progress at best, ""status quo"" brought up in the second episode really sums up the series\' nature nicely. I don\'t expect anything to change in the second season, so I won\'t be picking it up.While I\'m no stranger to comedy series relying on Schadenfreude to bring smile on the audience\'s faces, I didn\'t have much fun watching Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san. With so much repetition and humour simply lacking any spice, I cannot recommend this series as anything more than a side distraction to be watched with one\'s brain turned off, but even then there\'s probably a number of anime better serving that purpose. opponent by carefully analyzing all his options and eventual outcomes, and without fail, always making the worst possible decision, thus ending as butt of Takagi\'s jokes.

The moments of Nishikata wanting to win over Takagi in numerous ways sets up the ONLY plot for the show, and my heart fluttered as I remembered the manga original and finally getting to see it in action. Every single detail, though simple and plain yet appropriately beautiful was handled exquisitely well and props for retaining the original designs of the manga art.So, with a plain, boring but yet endearing series, what do you get with it? A boy who\'s always frustrated at the girl whom has an edge over him, with the girl finding that the naïve, innocent-looking boy is her fun factor. Every ""plot"" that Nishikata comes up with is a total failure and wreck at the same time, but that doesn\'t always pose a problem for Takagi, who has always been able to outwit and outlast Nishikata, at times charming him with simple things like tickling to the more heart-to-heart embarrassing moments like getting together under an umbrella when raining, closing on faces that look like a kiss and blushing like mad when she doesn\'t mean it, oh how we wished our younger sweetheart days were like that.The art is simply beautiful and gorgeous, that reminds me of the typical Sunrise and Tatsunoko Productions\' type of old anime backgrounds made modern-age and it truly is a sight that looks simple but yet it delivers. Musically wise, what better way than to express the romantic love than to come up with songs of young, romantic expressions? The OST here is simple too but great in its own regard; the OP and numerous EDs (sung by Rie Takahashi) are light-hearted, giving the whole series an appeal that will never run dry.For people that absolutely love rom-coms in its entire simplicity, I recommend you to check out this show.

At best i would consider watching the first episode then the last two to save yourself the time on this.Although the art style and the sound tracks and effects are decent enough, it doesnt come even close to make up for the lack of character development and story line.

I found this season to be boring and lacking in story, and not that funny compared to it's sequel.I can understand why people would like this anime, but it's just not for me.I did watch it all the way through because that's my goal with any anime, but I was hoping it would pick up a bit more in the end. To me, it didn't.I have yet to see the OVA in between seasons, but...I gotta find where to watch that first. I gotta find where to watch that first."", '""Ah, youth"", a phrase that harkens back to a simpler time without adult responsibilities like taxes, work, or complicated interpersonal relationships, and everything can be summed up with having fun with friends or having an innocent crush on the girl sitting next to you.\xa0 Ooo, I\'ve been waiting for this one.Story:Our story starts between the two middle schoolers who sit next to each other in class, Nishikata and Takagi.\xa0 It\'s become glaringly clear for Nishikata that Takagi enjoys seeing his flustered reactions and teasing him at every opportunity she can get, leading this boy down the rocky path to get back at this girl for...all of the light torture he goes through, persevering day after day to get his first win unbeknownst to the fact that he has already stolen her heart.Wholesome.\xa0 That\'s the word I would use to describe this show in a word.\xa0 Throughout its twelve episode run, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san paints a picture of youth and moments of childhood fun as each episode compiles several mini stories, chapters from two of Yamamoto-sensei\'s works, primarily focusing on the school mishaps of the titular character outwitting and teasing Nishikata despite the boy\'s desperate attempts at getting back at her.\xa0 While the concept at first appears stale, much of its presentation varies after the initial few takes of Nishikata failing to outwit the girl who\'s always two/three steps ahead of him, creating different scenarios in how he gets teased rather than him having his plans fail ninety five percent of the time.\xa0 All the while, the story manages to make slow, but noticeable progress on the relationship between these two that creates something of an ideal \'youth romance\' that feels warm and fuzzy to watch.Quite often, the story will also switch from its main focus to adapt chapters from ""Ashita wa Doyoubi"", a different manga series from the same author that follows the adventures of three girls who are canonically take place in the same town and school as Karakai Jouzu, providing a change of pace that still manages to emulate the same air to it as the casual and lax nature of these girls is nearly identical to the tone that we\'re normally used to.\xa0 Personally though, I feel these stories generally have a lot less weight to them compared to the show\'s main story, as the unlike Takagi and Nishikata, the three girls Mina, Yukari, and Sanae don\'t have a developing relationship that creates personal investment, and instead emulates more of the \'slice of life\' with girls story we\'re used to.Overall however, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is a show that does a solid example of a slice of life show with a slow but positive impacting romance element that gradually grows to fruition with each passing episode.\xa0 It\'s a fun and relaxing school comedy that\'s just a blast to watch trying to see the various things Nishikata tries to do in order to get

and Nishikata is the boy who tirelessly and fervently desires to be the one standing over Takagi-san, even if it\'s for one time.\xa0 The duo is an inseparable aspect of the show that gives the show its charm, their interactions acting as both the heart and soul of this series.\xa0 While from a story standpoint, it seems like as characters they can\'t function without each other, much of the series dedicates to various their various quirks and interests, filling in blanks like their relationships with other members of the cast, favorite manga, and what they do without the other around, which helps to expand this show to be more of a slice of life on youth rather than just a school slice of life, as is what is commonly seen with much of the genre\'s school examples.\xa0 As a result, these characters feel a lot more believable and leads the show into many other situations outside of school which for how often they\'re seen at school, is really refreshing to watch.And as mentioned before, we get the girls Mina, Yukari, and Sanae who spend much of their screentime creating character dynamics within each other; Mina is the kind of dumb energetic one, Sanae is the blunt and deadpan one, and Yukari is the levelheaded, almost sensible one of the group.\xa0 Apart from them, the few characters we do see don\'t get explored much if at all, and really only serve to fill up cast slots and make it so that Nishikata doesn\'t just spend all of his free time with the girl he sits next to (even though that is totally the case).\xa0 Everyone but the main protagonists are

push it needed to make it from just a normal teasing scene to a really fun to watch teasing scene.ED\'s are a bit of a different story, as we have seven different songs all sung by the voice of Takagi-san, Takahashi Rie.\xa0 Most of the songs fall under the same category of being relaxing and cheery songs, each of the seven falling into a spectrum between energetic to calming, which is honestly a nice variety that I didn\'t expect from the series, but is something that\'s quite welcoming.\xa0 My personal favorite is ""Chiisana Koi no Uta"", or the fifth ED in the series, as it falls in the midway of that spectrum so you sort of get the best of both worlds that way.Overview:+ Bright and energetic OP+ Varying but all very good EDsPersonal Enjoyment:Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is bar none one of my favorite romance series, both to read and to watch.\xa0 As someone who has followed and loved the original manga to the extent that I drop everything I\'m doing just to read the next translated chapter, seeing that it was getting an anime was like euphoria.\xa0 And I\'m so happy that the show fulfilled everything I as a fan could\'ve ever wanted.\xa0 Seeing my favorite chapter get animated was so great to see, and I feel embarrassed to say just how excited I got every Monday just to see the next episode.\xa0 I love the gradual pacing, I think the show is wholesome to a fault, and Takahashi Rie while at first I was apprehensive at her casting, is now something I\'m so glad they did.While I admit that I didn\'t do much but spout just how much love I have for this series, it\'s genuinely nice to see an adaptation get the amount of care and attention that the show got.\xa0 The chapters were adapted almost 1:1, the accurateness of the characters blew my expectations, and the music was so much better than I ever thought it would be.\xa0 While my recommendation is heavily biased, if you enjoy a good slice of life romance without any melodrama, watch this show.\xa0 It\'s cute, it\'s fun, and most of all, it\'s wholesome. all of the light torture he goes through, persevering day after day to get his first win unbeknownst to the fact that he has already stolen her heart.Wholesome.\xa0 That\'s the word I would use to describe this show in a word.\xa0 Throughout its twelve episode run, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san paints a picture of youth and moments of childhood fun as each episode compiles several mini stories, chapters from two of Yamamoto-sensei\'s works, primarily focusing on the school mishaps of the titular character outwitting and teasing Nishikata despite the boy\'s desperate attempts at getting back at her.\xa0 While the concept at first appears stale, much of its presentation varies after the initial few takes of Nishikata failing to outwit the girl who\'s always two/three steps ahead of him, creating different scenarios in how he gets teased rather than him having his plans fail ninety five percent of the time.\xa0 All the while, the story manages to make slow, but noticeable progress on the relationship between these two that creates something of an ideal \'youth romance\' that feels warm and fuzzy to watch.Quite often, the story will also switch from its main focus to adapt chapters from ""Ashita wa Doyoubi"", a different manga series from the same author that follows the adventures of three girls who are canonically take place in the same town and school as Karakai Jouzu, providing a change of pace that still manages to emulate the same air to it as the casual and lax nature of these girls is nearly identical to the tone that we\'re normally used to.\xa0 Personally though, I feel these stories generally have a lot less weight to them compared to the show\'s main story, as the unlike Takagi and Nishikata, the three girls Mina, Yukari, and Sanae don\'t have a developing relationship that creates personal investment, and instead emulates more of the \'slice of life\' with girls story we\'re used to.Overall however, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is a show that does a solid example of a slice of life show with a slow but positive impacting romance element that gradually grows to fruition with each passing episode.\xa0 It\'s a fun and relaxing school comedy that\'s just a blast to watch trying to see the various things Nishikata tries to do in order to get back at Takagi, blissfully unaware that he has in a sense already claimed the biggest victory of them all.\xa0 Personally I would\'ve liked the show to have ended on a different chapter (Chapter 31), as it would\'ve given the show a more definitive end, but if Shin-Ei decides to do a second season, I wouldn\'t mind.Overview:+ Well-paced development+ Wholesome.\xa0 Very wholesome.-\xa0 Ashita wa Doyoubi sections feel

It knows exactly what it wants to do, how to go about doing it and then does it really well.Basic breakdown below ⬎== Impressions / Presentation: 7.5/10 ==The basic formula involves Nishikata (the boy) trying to tease Takag (the girl), but fails and gets teased instead. Before you know it, you too are thinking: ""What is Takagi scheming this time!?"". It\'s not only a game for Nishikata, it\'s also a game for us, and this is how the show keeps the formula fresh and exciting....While there\'s nothing exceptional about the art and animation, the anime has been drawn with plenty of love and care. And it shows in the many character interactions in the show.== Story: 7/10 ==Every interaction Nishikata and Takagi share feels like they\'re getting closer to each other, and it\'s very endearing to watch. With lots of moments that continually flesh out their relationship, it\'s hard to say that the show doesn\'t have a story, or there is no character development/progression.If anything, their relationship probably feels more real and believable than the ones in traditional romcoms.== Characters: 7.5/10 ==Nishikata and Takagi have great chemistry with each other. Yes, they react to each other in entertaining ways, but simply watching them hang out is a wholesome and fulfilling experience in of itself.The background characters don\'t get a lot of screentime, but the show has done a good job incorporating them in various scenes so it feels like these kids are inhabiting a fun and lively world.== Enjoyment: 7.5/10 ==Because Nishikata and Takagi hog most of the show\'s spotlight, your enjoyment will be heavily dependent on whether you like them or not. The easiest way to find out is to just watch an episode and find out for yourself, as the reasons I like them could easily be the reasons you hate them.Otherwise yeah, I clearly got a lot out of a show just about two kids teasing each other.

My two favourite Naruto quotes spring to mind.1) Look underneath the underneath2) If the bait is obvious then don't fall for itUnfortunately for the male lead he is the biggest sucker on the planet and the female lead plays with him like a wolf plays with small prey.This is what gives this innocent show its comedic edge and it works pretty well.This is not a serious anime in any sense and is meant for pure laid back enjoyment of young love....That is the most I can say on this one without spoiling anything. That is the most I can say on this one without spoiling anything."", ""As far as this anime goes so far, I have enjoyed it quite thoroughly these past few weeks. Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is a Slice of Life anime in which two middle schoolers have a relationship where the girl teases the boy (contrary to other similar popular anime).The story has no real plot to it, and is fairly repetitive; but I don't think it should pose any problem because of the way in which this anime is laid out. The art and soundtracks are well done, and I even went to such lengths to try...and cover the opening on my piano.The two characters Nishikata and Takagi have a decent amount of synergy with each other as the episodes go by, but I do find Nishikata's tsundere-like attitude a bit repetitive. I gave this area a 7 only because the roles are reversed and strays from the normal anime stream. Otherwise, it might've been lower.As far as I got in the series (10 episodes so far), I have really enjoyed this purely for smiles and teasing comedy. I tend to watch more slice of life anime compared to action anime, so if you tend to have the same tastes I believe this anime would be something to watch for sure.Overall, I gave this an 8/10; if you like comedy, slice of life, maybe even a little bit of romance, I definitely encourage you to watch this anime! I smiled and cringed (in a good way!) the whole way through, and is definitely worth the wait every week. and cover the opening on my piano.The two characters Nishikata and Takagi have a decent amount of synergy with each other as the episodes go by, but I do find Nishikata's tsundere-like attitude a bit repetitive.

"", ""Everyday lives which can bring silly smiles on your face.That's one sentence which can describe karakai jouzo no Takagi-san. It will tease you by showing and repeating the male MC pitiful being over and over(if you see the VA you'll remember Arita from Accel World xD). And Takagi cute laugh will haunt your boring life, because it's very adorable (as expected of Emillia-tan).This show is simple and silly, yet I will wait every week wanting to see more. I'm not bored because the events and places are varied and of course all of them are cute. Though the personality of Nishikata stay the same, but...his determination increased day by day and I can feel him and Takagi getting closer. Hopefully, even if it's just once we can see some drastic moment when he triumph against Takagi. Because I somehow understand that Takagi teasing him is actually some form of love, or at least that's what I want to believe.The anime is still ongoing, but I can recommend this. I didn't experience something like Nishikata does in the past, but I still find this anime is very charming and can brighten up my Monday life. his determination increased day by day and I can feel him and Takagi getting closer.

Takagi-san is an adaptation of the manga of the same name by Souichirou Yamamoto that also pays homage to characters from his previous manga, Ashita no Douyubi (Tomorrow’s Saturday). Takagi-san wasn’t necessarily a project that caught my eye given any one name attached to its credits, if I’m being honest here I didn’t even bother to read a premise. I’d go so far as to say it was a series that...I watched on a whim to keep up my facade of “seasonal garbage-eater”. And what I got out of it was a Slice of Life series that worked for me on almost every level. I don’t typically go out of my way to white-knight shows I enjoyed, but Takagi-san managed to capture my heart and imagination with something that so few series of its ilk offer nowadays, charm.Time for the technicals. Animation this time around was done by Shin-Ei, probably most known in the west for “My Neighbor Seki” but perhaps most famous for producing the monstrously popular “Doraemon” and “Crayon Shin-chan”, two franchises that never translated well in the West but have remained relevant for decades in Japan. The series was helmed by Hiroaki Akagi, a director whom beyond a few key animation and episode credits has remained a relative unknown until now. Slice of Life series tend to sneak up on me when it comes to the quality of their animation, and that’s probably due to the lack of action set-pieces to grab me by the horns. But even I get sick of Yutapon cubes, laser light shows, and obnoxious movement lines. Takagi-san’s average was consistently high, and on first viewing, it never dipped under that average. On the other hand, it never set out to impress with dynamic and polished sakuga as much as it aimed to keep everything polished and vibrant. Some studios take liberties with the art-styles of certain source-materials (e.g. Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, *cough* Berserk) but from what little I’ve read of Yamamoto’s manga, I can say confidently that his art-style was translated pretty accurately from panel to screen (not that his art-style is all that unique to begin with).The soundtrack is about as unassuming as you could imagine. Slice of Life series have the most potential to have varied soundtracks, unfortunately, this was not one of those shows to creep up on me with its fantastic composition. Rie Takahashi, as always, is a great singer and provided a not entirely skippable opening theme. Some of the ending themes throughout this show’s run were also pretty catchy.Instead of harping on the relatively average score and middling theme songs, I’d like to pontificate on Yuki Kaji and Rie Takahashi’s performances as the two leads. Because of his youthful rasp, Kaji has a natural aptitude for and tends to shine in these younger roles. Pair that with Rie Takahashi’s perfectly smug cadence and you have one of the better casting choices for a series in a while. Kaji and Takahashi have such good chemistry that they may as well have recorded all of their sessions in the booth ad-libbing off each other. With a series whose quality is contingent on the chemistry between its two leads, Kaji and Takahashi provided two of their best performances to date, practically making the lines of dialogue jump right off of the page. They loved their roles so much in fact that they helped produce a chapter of the still ongoing manga together with Yamamoto. For you dub purists out there, for reasons mentioned earlier, I can’t in good conscience recommend watching this series dubbed. Funimation has been producing consistently better dubs in their “SimulDub” program, and while the Takagi-san dub is no exception, Aaron Dismuke and Sarah Wiedenheft don’t come close to having the amount of chemistry that Kaji and Takahashi do.Takagi-san is a series whose content could be argued, on a surface level, to be repetitive. In fact, that’s such a surface level observation that 99% of the negative reviews being posted about this series have taken the liberty of framing a good chunk of if not their entire review on this observation. While some might find Takagi-san’s repetitive nature to be a detriment to its quality, I’d argue that it’s only repetitive for viewers who are too caught up in the “teasing” gimmick, which entirely misses the point of the series. Not only that but narratively, Takagi-san is episodic, series that by definition are MEANT TO BE REPETITIVE. Takagi-san, first and foremost, never set out to be more than an episodic Slice of Life series with light romantic-comedy elements peppered throughout. It doesn’t pride itself on conjuring up intricate punchlines every episode or populating its cast with over-the-top joke-factory characters. Takagi-san plays to its strength, and that strength is the relationship and chemistry between its two leads.So many other Slice of Life series to come out with similar premises would’ve easily taken either an obnoxiously mawkish or unbearably sophomoric approach to its content. Instead, Takagi-san’s meat and potatoes is an honest and refreshing innocence. The measured and “repetitive” approach to the comedy is deliberate, creating a believable rapport between characters at this age. Nishikata and Takagi are the centerpieces, clearly, but that’s not to discredit the sporadic segments featuring the charming trio from “Tomorrow’s Saturday”. The low-key vibe that this series will often utilize makes it teeter closely towards the unambitious yet steadily growing “healing” subgenre, but the characters are grounded and believable enough to where it’s not just a gaggle of perpetual tropes getting away with providing the bare minimum.Takagi-san may unfortunately never get the credit it deserves. In this ever stressful political climate where society is inundated by snarky edgelords squeezing laughs out of fart jokes, nihilism, and sardonic humor, Takagi-san has little room to breathe. Takagi-san is a much smarter show than it might seem on its surface. When you strip this show down to its most basic elements, the comedy deliberately makes up very little of what this series is truly made of. Instead, Takagi-san focuses more on believably pacing and portraying this burgeoning relationship between two infinitely likable characters.It's that forehead, man.

Nishikata and Takagi are the centerpieces, clearly, but that’s not to discredit the sporadic segments featuring the charming trio from “Tomorrow’s Saturday”. The low-key vibe that this series will often utilize makes it teeter closely towards the unambitious yet steadily growing “healing” subgenre, but the characters are grounded and believable enough to where it’s not just a gaggle of perpetual tropes getting away with providing the bare minimum.Takagi-san may unfortunately never get the credit it deserves. In this ever stressful political climate where society is inundated by snarky edgelords squeezing laughs out of fart jokes, nihilism, and sardonic humor, Takagi-san has little room to breathe. Takagi-san is a much smarter show than it might seem on its surface. When you strip this show down to its most basic elements, the comedy deliberately makes up very little of what this series is truly made of. Instead, Takagi-san focuses more on believably pacing and portraying this burgeoning relationship between two infinitely likable characters.It's that forehead, man."", 'Sorry for the mistakes. English is not my first languageIt\'s my first review.Story: 4/10The story is simple and uncompromising. This must be respected, but it will never justify not being good. Basically you have a kid who is constantly trolled for a girl and wants to change that, but it\'s always trolled again in the end. And this is repeated over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. The problem is not just having a formula but especially repeating 3 times per episode. It is extremely repetitive and rarely any moment of humor is creative. If romance is just a heap of random...and predictable moments (with a few exceptions) that do not make much difference if they don\'t exist and is not going anywhere, so it\'s not a well-developed romance, and romantic or sensual insinuations are just one useless plus. The goal is just to show situations that should be funny. Sometimes between a skit and another one, there\'s a trio of random girls talking about random things, and I\'ll never understand the point in their existence.It\'s no use having a simple base and doing nothing with it. It\'s almost the same as Yuru Camp, another anime from the same season that has a simple idea but does nothing creative or memorable inside it, but is considered a masterpiece because ""it\'s cute"".Some people are comparing with Tonari no Seki-kun, which is also largely centered on simple (but not very straightforward) interactions involving two characters of different sexes, but this one is not so repetitive, it\'s more original, humor is more creative and the reactions of the characters are not so predictable.Anyway, the ending was cool.Art: 6/10It\'s ""ok"". Remember: cuteness is not an automatic synonym of excellent art. The character figures are very shallow. The animation is not very important in this context, but it did not seem so good at some necessary moments (like in a racing scene).Sound: 6/10It\'s ""ok"". Music and voice acting are forgettable, but they have not done a bad job.Characters: 3/10A dumb boy with a girl you\'ll only remember for being a smiling troll and having a big forehead. Without good characterization, (explicit) development or chemistry that makes a lot of sense, and reactions to situations are predictable (even if many jokes are not). Many one-dimensional characters from animations are functional within their contexts and they can be charismatic and memorable for some reason, not the case of these characters. I do not find it very comfortable to watch everything from the point of view of the boy who is always being ""victimized"" in situations and the fact that the pranksters only work to one side.And the 3 random girls are ... just 3 stupid random girls.Enjoyment: 4/10It is not detestable, but it has a formula that wears out very fast and becomes a boring experience to me.Overall: 4/10.It\'s not so bad because some moments can still be fun, but why is it still not a good anime, if it\'s unpretentious and supposedly we should not be rigid?  Some genres of this anime include romance, comedy, school and slice of life. Failed as a comedy because it is repetitive and uncreative, fails as a romance because it is just ""bait"", school is just a scenario that could easily be replaced, and it\'s a normal slice of life. The result? A bad anime.I do not recommend it unless you can easily enjoy any romantic school comedy or be part of a select group of people who love to see little girls commenting about their own body.In other cases, I would recommend watching Tonari no Seki-kun. and predictable moments (with a few exceptions) that do not make much difference if they don\'t exist and is not going anywhere, so it\'s not a well-developed romance, and romantic or sensual insinuations are just one useless plus.

It's not executed badly thought if it were a hit or miss, it'd be a miss for me.From the first episode we are shown Nishikata's competitive ego, overconfidence and inability to hide his emotions leading to Takagi, teasing him every time. Never has he actually tried to understand her or act differently.This doesn't change over the next episodes & watching quickly becomes more frustrating than amusing as Takagi beats a fallen man over and over.As someone who isn't...much of a fan of these childhood stories, a slice of life without character development isn't attractive for long.The show does, however, reflect well the competition, excitement, embarrassment, overthinking, making a big deal of the trivial & so on that we experience during our younger days. A bit romance is hinted at and the characters are relateable to an extent.Overall, very slow paced but not bad. I'll be skipping until the final few eps when they come out. much of a fan of these childhood stories, a slice of life without character development isn't attractive for long.The show does, however, reflect well the competition, excitement, embarrassment, overthinking, making a big deal of the trivial & so on that we experience during our younger days.

And also, this is my very first review of an anime so please bear with me. :)*SPOILER-FREE REVIEW* (Well a bit)(Although there are some recommendations throughout this review)I’ll start my review with the Story — Rating: 10Ok. Not much to say but it is based on two characters Nishikata and Takagi who are middle school students who sit next to each other during class and Takagi is a “skilled teaser” (as mentioned in the English Title) who teases Nishikata. But it...also includes short moments of three other girls who are in the same class: Mina, Yukari and Sanae. That’s basically it. But I do love the story between two young middle schoolers enjoying their young youth at their school/outside of school. “You blush, you lose” - Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2018Now towards the Art — Rating: 10I absolutely adore the art. It’s beautiful, cute, bright and colorful. The character designs on each character really suit what type of character they are and are absolutely cute (but seriously surprised on how the arts differentiate between the manga and anime, well at least for a few chapters of it. But I do suggest reading the manga too). The tv cover art is what made me attracted towards this show and made me want to watch it of its innocence, childish-plays and very happy themed. In my opinion I think this show did a very good job incorporating those aspects towards this show.Next, is the Sound — Rating: 10I ABSOLUTELY looooooove the sound and music incorporated because of how happy each sound/song has been well used in different scenes and it really suits the theme of the anime. You know why I say that? Because all the sounds/music that has been used in this have really made it worthy to be incorporated onto this anime. The musics, oh god, I am absolutely in love with both the Opening Theme Song and the Ending Theme Songs (there are 7 Ending Songs). But my most favorite out of the 7 Ending Themes are the 2nd, 6th and the 7th one. I won’t go in depth on why they are my absolutely favorite, but, I suggest you find out yourselves why and I RECOMMEND to never skip the Opening and the Endings, you will not regret skipping them. Lastly I want to say is that the use of the sounds and musics give me a sense of nostalgia, refreshment and relaxing listening all the sounds and musics. But yeah, don’t skip the songs. :DNow, the Characters — Rating: 10Hmm... The characters were rather unique as far as I have seen in anime. I’ll firstly talk about Nishikata. Nishikata is a rather sweet, funny, and a gentleman character. But some of the times in the show made me say “Niiiiishiiikaaataa, why would you do that?” Or “Just, why..?” But these things were said in a good way and not a negative way because this is one of those shows where you want the character to do that and do that etc. Now I’ll talk about Takagi. Probably my newest favorite waifu at the moment. You know why? Because she is just a heartwarming, honest and cute character. There’s absolutely nothing you can complain about her character but just to enjoy her smiles and laughters when teasing Nishikata. Lastly I’ll talk about the 3 girls: Mina, Yukari and Sanae. Their shorts were fun to watch as they live out their life. Not much to say, but just to watch them. BTW #NishikataXTakagi <3Probably the shortest one out of the other categories, my Enjoyment — Rating: 10Man, I’ve absolutely enjoyed each and every one of the episodes watching as they live their life as middle high school students. I’ve DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY, and DEFINITELY enjoyed this show! :DOverall — Rating: 10Out of all that I have said, I’m giving this a SOLID full 10. If you guys don’t agree then you don’t have to agree with me but it’s what I think personally so I’m completely fine if you disagree with my statements.

Once you saw the first episode you can predict how most interactions down the line would go. This is made even more glaring by the fact that the show attempts to preserve the status quo for the majority of its run. You will be stuck mostly watching the male MC repeatedly attempt to pull a shenanigan against the female MC and she is of course one step ahead of him. Much of the show’s attempt at humor is centered on how she flips...the table on him and his reactions to that. That’s pretty much it. The skits are not punctuated by overly strong punch-lines that will leave you gasping for air. What it instead does is leave you with a big wide knowing smile looking at one skilled teaser, who obviously has a crush on the guy, try to tease him day in and day out into quasi-dates with her because it’s the one sure excuse she has to stay near him without freaking him out with the idea of dating.Much of the appeal of the series therefore lies on the delivery of the main characters and it is here that I must recommend the English dub. Aaron Dimsuke performs admirably in a series that puts a lot of weight on the male lead’s reactions to being playfully teased. And, of course, the star of show, Sarah Weidenheft’s Takagi, brings out a performance that is equal parts childish, playful, devious, and endearing all at once, while still selling the idea that she longs for him to notice her feelings. the table on him and his reactions to that.

If you want to watch a cute show where two middle schoolers constantly pull childish pranks on each other, but one side wins every time, then you\'ll enjoy this anime. As for me, I constantly found my self begging for this show to give me more to chew in. The main two leads Takagi and Nishikata are both adorable to watch don\'t get me wrong, it\'s just disappointing that that all this show has to to offer...in each episode is the question of ""How will Takagi make Nishikata look like an idiot today?"" There\'s also a B story where the show follows 3 female classmates of Takagi and Nikshikata, but it\'s undoubtedly the dullest part of show. When ever you see the 3 girls come on screen, i\'d recommend skipping. Now even though I may have made myself sound like I hated this show, which I don\'t, I just wish there was more here. I still recommend everyone who can find the time to give this one a shot, because it really is super cute, and all the other aspects of this show whether it be the animation, sound design, and the soundtrack are consistently fitting for what this show is doing. It just doesn\'t do more. in each episode is the question of ""How will Takagi make Nishikata look like an idiot today?""

In the case of Takagi, the female protagonist of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san, her way of proving it is to mock the object of her affection without mercy.This series of 12 episodes concluded a few weeks ago, leaving the door open to continue, although it is not necessary to do so. The mission is accomplished for Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san, created to satisfy manga fans (and its sequel or spin-offs). In addition, it captured the...attention of many anime lovers who did not know about the original work.However, despite how effective it is as entertainment and as a sweet demonstration of preadolescent love, it is the clear example that an anime does not have to be perfect to succeed.Mediocre, but perfect in its own wayAs I said, the premise of this series is mediocre. As I said at the time, this premise has nothing new. The strength of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is in how it manages to have fun despite it.The pranks and jokes at Nishitaka\'s expense and his frustrated desire to defeat Takagi-san become repetitive and yet continue to work. It does not stop being funny or sweet, especially when it seems that the tables are going to turn ... to finally not happen.This series is a light comedy, it has no greater plot pretensions and that\'s fine. If I had to find some fault of it, it would be the fact that the power dynamic is never shaken. As a character Nishitaka is too soft, to the point that Takagi does not even try too hard to beat him.This circumstance can make Takagi look a bit one-dimensional, because she simply seems to know everything and there is no real effort on her part to troll Nishitaka. There are few lovers of the series who call Takagi the ""master troll"". But is it really, or is it simply that Nishitaka is too stupid?In my opinion it is the second and that would have ballasted the series if it were longer. Fortunately for this anime of Shin-ei Animation based on the manga of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san, having only 12 episodes avoids premature fatigue. The jokes are not particularly complicated and I repeat, they can be repetitive. Maybe in the manga work much better, by how fast you can read, but in anime more than 12 episodes and it would have been an outburst.Curiously, there is a manga that shows them as adults, and, to my surprise, it is much better. But I will not discuss that work here.As for the technical section, we can not expect animated pyrotechnics in such a simple slice of life so the animation is correct for what it is. Nothing impressive, but it does not affect enjoyment either. The voice work is very good, especially that of Rie Takahashi as Takagi. Yuki Kaji does not do badly as Nishitaka, but his work is subject to Nishitaka\'s exaggerated reactions, which sometimes get tiresome.The secondary characters are that, very secondary. This despite the fact that the trio of Mina, Sanae and Yukari receives a lot of attention, because they have their own spin-off manga and their little stories are included.In conclusion we have a correct anime, without more. To have a good time and, if you like this kind of inoffensive romances, enjoy it and laugh a little. If you are unable to understand that they are two children of 11 years old and you can not wait much in the romantic field, better not see it.It is an anime for a younger audience, although it can be enjoyed by people of any age.

The best word to describe this series is ""pure"". You won\'t see any huge plot twists, action, not even real drama, is is literally about ""that"" first childhood love, which is embarrassing and confusing at the same time.The first thing you need to understand about the story that it is not continuous. This doesn\'t mean that I recommend watching this...anime out of order, but there will be only small references to the previous episodes throughout the series. Of course, that doesn\'t mean that there is no character development, just that it is a light anime, which doesn\'t heavily depend on the story itself. I wouldn\'t go into detail regarding the story elements, other than it is about two (aside from some minor supporting characters) middle school student, who sits next to each other, and walk home together regularly.As for art, it is nothing too special. Very clean, very easy to watch, no flashy elements, no 3D effects, it is what it is: an anime about middle school students. The art is perfectly mirrors and adjust to the story.Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san has a very clear and nice soundtrack. The opening song, and the ending songs are perfectly in balance with the anime itself, it describes and sets the mood for the series. I liked all of the songs for the anime and I found myself listening to the opening song in my free time as well, although I am not sure it was because my love for the series or the catchyness of the song. The soundtrack aside from the opening and ending song are perfect, in every possible way. I would easily say that it just give the anime a whole new layer of adorableness.Now the true strength of the anime are the characters. Takagi-san and Nishikata are perfect protagonists. The cheekiness of Takagi-san, and the clumsiness of Nishikata are perfectly in balance, and it is just so nice to watch how these two characters are developing during the series. I loved all the characters though, even the supporting characters are cute -- although they are not as detailed as the two protagonists. Also a huge shoutout to Rie Takahashi, who made Takagi-san so adorable. I truly believe with another seiyuu it wouldn\'t have been as enjoyable as it was with Takahashi-san\'s acting.Overall, I enjoyed this series, and I would recommend it to everyone. It gave me a very nostalgic feeling, made me remember my years in middle school and the purity of the characters and story was truly refreshing. I watched this series every week as it came out, and I always found myself looking forward to the next one. I really hope there will be a second season, there are much more potential in this series than just 12 short episodes. There is enough manga material for a new season, also I really hope for the spinoff manga to be turned into an anime Karakai Jouzo no (Moto) Takagi-san. Check out both if you loved the series.

Until the next episode!', 'Funny show, but totally pointless. Don\'t be fooled, this is not a romantic comedy : it\'s a comedy with a very small pinch of romance.STORYIt\'s about a boy and a girl in love with each other and teasing each other, and... that\'s all. Literally.There is no development at all on the situation nor on the characters. Even in each episode there is no actual story, as each episode is only a set of several indepedent sketches.That\'s why this show is pointless : there is nothing to learn from it, and nothing to expect from it.That said, story is far from being everything in an anime!...ARTI\'m in love with the art style.

That said he is fun to watch as well!As a ""main couple"", it works quite well.The other characters, on the other hand, are totally pointless.

I know that there's a lot of reviews here saying that it's great and stuff, but really, I just couldn't. I liked the first episode, not gonna lie, but the second episode was literally the same thing. The girl teases him, and he gets mad. That's it. Repeat. I tried looking into the 3rd ep, but it was just boring. Like the dude keeps saying that he's going to get her back, but does he actually get her back? No, LOL. yea, it reminds me of Tom and Jerry, this situation. Plus, the girl bullies him, which i do...not tolerate. Always getting him in trouble and distracting him from his education.But to be honest, girl looks like a boiled egg. I had to point that out. That kind of annoys me a bit, but then again she's a middle schooler. Who looks like a 5 year old. Kind of weird, but okay. Plus the sexualization of little kids. ya'll noticed that? Bikinis, boobs, wet shirt, being naked, all that stuff, it makes me uncomfortable, especially for the girl. Yea, no. Just no. Imagine all those sweaty old people watching that? not tolerate.

While it is true that in the beginning it is mainly about our main character Nishikata being teased by our main heroine Takagi-san and wanting revenge on her, it slowly turns into a development between both middle school kids and their relationship with each other. While Nishikata tried different kind of ways to get back at Takagi he actually goes on to try to improve his body and mind as well. Constantly doing pushups throughout the series in an...attempt to become stronger.Meanwhile we see a stronger bond form between the two of these kids. Which eventually leads to some victories for Nishikata. Add in the fact that Takagi never crossed the line in my eyes. Never physically or even mentally scarring Nishikata. She knew her boundaries.The art and animation was like watching a better CGI anime at points. It was far from great. However it seemed to fit this anime quite nicely.The opening was really cute and catchy. The endingS were very well done as well. When you get an anime where the Main Girl sings multiple endings I feel like it makes the anime more special. The bgm during the show was rather good as well.Character wise I thoroughly enjoyed both Nishikata and Takagi. They\'re just two cute kids enjoying their youth. What\'s not to like about them?I rather enjoyed this anime. I found myself wanting to watch it immediately even though each episode was left with zero cliff hangers.

If you're going into this show looking for a complex, original, mind bending masterpiece- this isn't for you. But, if you're looking for what this show clearly is: A lighthearted, feel good, slapstick romcom with beautiful art- it doesn't get much better than this.This is an episodic show, and being combined with romance- as you'd expect (and rightfully so), there's virtually no plot progression. But while the plot doesn't truly progress, you can't help but feel a step was taken in right direction. The tease-skit holds true to itself throughout, and yet...each episode still inches you on that they're so close, almost there, just a little further. This is often the demise of slapstick's repetitive nature, but it manages to keep you sucked in; it's executed masterfully to make each and every single interaction refreshing via creative schemes and deftly executed sudden intense moments.I couldn't, and still can't help but want more- and that's meaningful considering the amount of competition in this genre. If you're looking for either romance or a fuzzy-feeling / awkward comedy, I highly recommend giving Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san a shot. each episode still inches you on that they're so close, almost there, just a little further.

Not just for me but to the community in general. After all it has a rating in Mal of 7.92 (at the time of my writing) and you ask me why is that?Well, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is a story about love. What?? You ask. It is. It's a story about love in middle school and most of us don't remember our early years of middle school and can't phantom to remember if we felt love OR how we express it. One thing I know for sure - after all I am 37 now so...Boys...usually tend to pick on girls they love or at least care (or lust?) about. We tease and tease - that's the way young teens mind work. And thus enter these series BUT it's not they boy teasing the girl but instead the girl teasing the boy and at the same time understanding that both love one another but they really can't express.She seems more mature giving hints that she likes him but he is a boy and thus become timid and screws up - while she teases some more. We never know what she really feels until the last episode.I am not going into much spoilers (If we can call it that because from the start we know what this show is all about) but even if you have no interest in romance you will enjoy seeing Nishikata losing again and again against Takagi who is a mastermind in Nishikata psychic.The 12 episodes follow the lives of these two young teens and each episode is divided in several segments (where Takagi-San teases Nishikata or Nishikata plots to tease Takagi-san). In most episodes we also see small 3/4m segments with three of his collegues and their interactions (Mina, Yukari & Sanae).For those who do not know (I didn't) this anime is based on two manga. The main manga is obvisouly Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san  and the small three girls manga is called Ashita wa Doyoubi.The Art and animation is very simple but works very nicely in this kind of anime. Takagi-san and Nishikata expressions are priceless. The sound and voice acting is great as well. No qualms. Not gaining an award but they do their job.Talking about the show, you ask me, isn't a bit repetitive formula? No! There is a charm with each episode and never gets dull. With so much stuff going on on bullying you might ask but I will say - no. It's never bullying. They tease one another although Nishikata sucks on teasing her back after all she gain pretty easily read his expressions and mind.Btw, in terms of character development it's one of those shows we see a main character (Nishikata) really develp throughout the anime since we follow him most of the time.It's not an anime to watch in one go lest will be boring no doubt. It was made to watch a single episode between more serious anime. It's an anime to watch before sleeping OR in my opinion they should have made it a 5/6m anime but instead of 12 episodes they could have made 52 or something like that. That would be very interesting!Well, to me, it was a very interesting show to watch throughout the season and I didn't let accumulate 3 or 4 episodes and watch it in one go like most shows.Btw, this show is a lot alike Tonari-no Seiki-Kun minus the romance part and in this show there isn't a tease per se.......Spoilers AlertThere is also a Manga about Takagi-San and her adventurous with Nishikiata and their daughter.

Sometimes we are oblivious to our own feelings, other time we are aware but don’t act in them or sometimes we do. Karaki is basically playful love between two middle school students, Takagi and Nishikata, via teasing.Karakai is structured in snippets of the daily occurrences in the lives of these two characters and the teasing that occurs during these occasions, usually initiated by takagi. The teasing for the most part is okay as it’s usually playful, and never end up being just downright bad even...though Takagi is usually the one that comes out winning in each occurance. It also really doesn’t come off as a bad thing that Nishikata always gets the short end of the stick since it’s always his own personality that let’s hime get teased so easily.  He always try to think things through and guess the ahead of takagi, but it usually tends for him to overthink it causing him to doubt his own thoughts and dupe himself in the end. He’s also very expressive about his emotions that he has to turn his face so that he can literally hide his emotions from Takagi even though that in itself is very telling of his emotions. It’s also because of this he is no longer able to make eye contact with her so he’s unable to tell what she’s might be thinking making him more susceptible to teasing. So while the teasing is fine, but it does wear thin after a while and the creators may have taken note of that. So instead of having a short length time, the show sometimes intermittently intercuts with the life of three other girl students who are schoolmates of the duo, and their stories are usually parallel with the main story and it’s just fine and not much else.Everything else about this show is just fine across the board. The show has a bright generic colour pallet that suits the show fine. The background art is very close to a japanese countryside town as a sign of innocence which this show basically is. The character designs are alright, but the noticeable large foreheads may put some people off but i think it’s cute on some characters. There’s no real issue with the animation because for the most part it’s kept to a minimum in shows like this, and that’s alright The voice acting in the show could have been better with different voice actors as the ones voice acting them make them sound older than they actually look which does come off as odd, although it takes a little bit of time to get used too.

She is fun, intelligent and smart, and of course she likes to tease the protagonist, Nishikata, who is a bit on the slow and foolish side. But I honestly like both of them.Their games and teasing is fun to watch. Not much else to it but that.THE BAD:...Since I'm a big fan of this anime, I'll try to be nitpicky to have things to talk about.This is a story about the main characters and their everyday life. Since it's slice of life, there is the feeling of 'not much is happening', and sometimes it sinks in more prominently. It didn't bother me, but it could bother others who like shows where things actually happen that push the plot forward and completely change things. This show isn't like that, it's pretty relaxed and fun.I'm not a huge fan of the voice actors. The voices don't really match what I expected them to sound like in my head. They sound a bit too old, I think.I also think the manga is the better experience - not that the anime isn't good! Just, I remember laughing harder with the way the manga presented the jokes.One last thing to mention: sometimes Takagi's bullying is a bit too mean for my tastes, and almost leaves the territory of friendly teasing to enter 'bullying', specially when Nishikata never gets an upper hand or a chance to 'fight back' against her antics. My point is it does sometimes feel a bit mean spirited.TL;DR - CONCLUSION:A lot to love and very little to dislike, the tale of Takagi and Nishikata is cute and fun as expected. It's a typical boy-meets-girl love story, but it's a fun one with plenty of laughs and entertainment value.

Part of the experience of living with Asperger’s is that you’re both cripplingly deficient with social communication and painfully aware of that deficiency, so every social interaction is just one mangled sentence away from plunging you into a witch’s brew of bubbling shame that drags you down the more you helplessly flounder to escape. From that experience, watching fictional characters embarrass themselves for the sake of “comedy” that derives mocking pleasure from their social agony doesn’t so much trigger laughter from me as it triggers PTSD flashbacks. So on the surface, this show might...resemble nothing more or less than my personal hell. An entire anime dedicated to the idea of watching some poor fuck get repeatedly embarrassed in public over and over again? I can feel my inside trying to throttle themselves at the mere prospect. But against all odds, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san ends up being a really funny, really sweet, really wholesome time that captures the awkward, earnestly relatable nature of young love without falling prey to its menaces.And yes, the premise is as simple and direct as I made it out in the previous paragraph. Nishikata is a middle-school boy living an average middle school life, with one exception: his classmate Takagi has made it her personal mission to tease him at every possible opportunity. She lives for the chance to catch him off guard and leave him in flustered confusion, and she knows his insecurities and thought process well enough that she’s really fucking good at it. Nishikata vows to get her back one of these days, but he’s unable to crack her code as easily as she’s cracked his. From there on, the show really does just follow them (and a handful of their classmates on occasion) as they hang out, getting into bets and challenges, with Takagi always leading Nishikata by the nose into her mischievous games and coming out on top. With such a simple premise and such a simple formula, the show leaves itself very little room for error. If it can’t make this poor kid’s suffering continuously funny, it will crash and burn on its face.It’s a good thing, then, that Takagi-san is actually able to pull that difficult feat off. These two dorks’ interactions are a frigging delight; every single time they’re on screen, which is 85% of the show, has a kind of infectious charm that’s impossible not to get swept up in. What keeps it from descending into genuine mean-spiritedness is that you really get the sense that both of these kids truly enjoy the time they spend together. The enjoyment Takagi gleans from watching him suffer at her hands isn’t the power trip of a bully; it’s real appreciation from someone who can’t believe how lucky she is to have such a fantastic ally by her side. And more critically, for all the embarrassment she puts him through, it’s clear that Nishikata genuinely relishes the chance to match wits with her at every possible opportunity, even if he can’t quite put it into words himself. She makes life fun for him. Add to that a pair of stellar lead performances from Rie Takahashi of Konosuba fame, capturing Takagi’s earnest enjoyment of the time she spends with him, and the ever-stellar Yuki Kaji cranking up his Eren Yeager-patented theatrical determination with all the goofy sincerity this kind of character deserves, and I never felt the need to cringe away from their interactions because it’s so abundantly clear that neither of them truly feel the need to cringe away from their interactions. And Nishikata slowly realizing how much Takagi actually means to him makes for one of the most heart-fluttering experiences of anime in 2018.Because yes, this show is a rom-com, and it captures this kind of immature, puppyish adoration better than pretty much any other show I’ve seen. Over the course of the show, the teasing gets less straightforward, the time they spend together grows more meaningful for both of them, and their interactions become increasingly tinged with a growing understanding of what’s lying underneath the mind games and flustered flailing. This is young love at its best: sweet, sincere, a little cruel at times, but innocently cruel in the way only kids can be. There’s something so pure in how they approach each other, how they handle their feelings in such vastly different ways, how they never lose the bite of the teasing games that brought them together in the first place. I can’t remember the last time a joke about periods felt this overwhelmingly clean-spirited, or flirtation with sexuality felt this refreshingly understated. The simplicity of their interactions feels more genuine than any attempt to heighten the situational absurdity could have been. This is a show about two kids in very awkward love, and it doesn’t pretend to be anything more or less.Admittedly, while that simple, straightforward quality is what makes this show such a delight to watch, it’s also what keeps it from being any better. This is a purposefully light affair, with not much on its mind other than observing the endearing nuances of these two kids at a very particular time in their lives. The side characters are decently entertaining but not too memorable, and it sometimes feels like there’s a little too much space in between each line. But you know what? Sometimes, that’s okay. These two don’t need a grand adventure or bitter trials for the sake of their connection; the simple joys of each other’s company are enough for them. They were certainly enough for me. Skilled Teaser Takagi-san is a real gem, and it’s sure to make you day a little bit brighter with every clarion call of its titular character’s joyful laugh. resemble nothing more or less than my personal hell.

It will surely leave a carve in my heart. The ending was not what I expected it to be, but I think they're saving that chapter for later ;)I watched all the episodes and it was very cute <3, Takagi and Nishikata never fails to put a smile on my face. They're chemistry is getting better and better each day. Some flaws but I'll let that pass.The story was very well connected at the end bringing the flashback of an item that means a lot to them (This is episode 12).This anime was...abruptly nice and it was better than I thought. I mean who doesn't want someone like Takagi-san to be with them? She's so cute and clever and fun! Menn, if I were Nishikata then I'll be truly grateful for all the blessings I have.I might have a different taste on anime, so this anime hits the jackpot for me.Overall, it's a nice anime. If they're gonna make season 2 then it's okay to not end with that 'chapter', but if not, damn they missed one hell of a chapter.Releasing OVAs might make season release a little longer.Episode 12 review: The last chapter along with the ending made me cry. The last chapter was very connected with the second chapter. Very improved and high progression. These kinds of endings are nice <3SEASON 2! PLSSSSSS.. abruptly nice and it was better than I thought.

PLSSSSSS.."", ""Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is a nice short slice of life anime with 12 eps that gives you soemthing to laugh at. A good comedy, reminding us of those good old days when we were kids going through puberty and trying to explore what love is. Takagi-san's voice actor, rei takahachi is super duper talented and her voice really syncs with the character, without her this anime would be a different story. I would sometimes skip the three girls' side story and just focus with the main story. I also enjoy teasing kinda girls as they're so ecchi but indirectly and act  innocently, it...is so fun and entertaining to watch. I hope they in plans for a season 2 cause I'd be glad ! is so fun and entertaining to watch. I hope they in plans for a season 2 cause I'd be glad !"", '""Mwahahaha! Winds, blow harder and harder! Now, gale, I command--""""Morning, Nishikata.""""uAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!1""Skilled Teaser Takagi-san, is a slice of school life type of comedy anime in recent years. There is no particular storyline expect for the little romantic development of the two main characters Nishikata, an average middle-schoolar shy boy, and Takagi-san, an unbeatable teaser girl who loves making fun of Nishikata more than anything. This is an anime where you will enjoy a small, little by little progress of their relationship changing from friends to somewhere above that.I thought at first that a full-time, I mean an anime that takes 30-minutes of the TV programs,...is too much for this anime, because the major part of it is only the conversation between the two, or Nishikata\'s (inner) talking to himself. The starting few episodes made me unsure if the anime was worth watching to the end. But I learnt soon the situations varied effectively from inside school to shoping malls and then I was gradually getting interested in how the relationship of the two will progress. Of course I should not tell much about it, but now I am sure this anime is worth to watch for all sorts of people.Also, I am kind of astonished how greatly the English dubbing work on this anime has been done. I found the Nishikata\'s English voice actor was awesome. Maybe it\'s the first time I liked a guy\'s voice in anime this much. He sounded always energetic/emotional that every time he spoke, or rather cried, I could\'nt help smiling and laughing a lot. And Takagi-san\'s English voice is way better than Japanese, in my opinion. Totally she best acted throughout the show. When she pets a cat in episode 11, her tone of voice slowly changes into really funny, while Japanese tone doesn\'t much change. Beside of the two, the voices of the all side characters are very well done too. Voice acting is really something to bring anime characters to the lives. So, I think the dubbed version of it is better than the original.I won\'t be so interested in anime with no story, recently. But for some reason I enjoyed this anime very much. If you ask me what is the point watching a slice of life anime that has no storyline, I will answer that a good slice of life anime certainly has \'some\' story you can discover even though it looks not has at first.

Takagi-san is an anime something like that.', ""This show could have been great, but it settled for mediocre at best. There are 2 MC's Takagi as the female and Nagisa I think as the guy. Honestly the Male MC went from humorous, to annoying real quick. He has no growth, he is essentially  the same in ep 12 as in ep 1, his goals are the same, his methods though tech different are the same level of shallow, executions the same and his reactions the same. Honestly he is the weakest part. The show had an interesting premise, think Kaguya-sama but younger. However no, Takagi as an MC was alright, she...seemed more 3d then the Male mc, she would show restraint when she thought the male was sick, offer help and what not though it was still fairly minimal.  The show has supporting characters though they are barely worth a mention.the Male MC friends pop in every now and again but don't really contribute much save for one episode later where they offer the setup. then there are 3 female side characters which honestly I have no idea why they were in the show. There is no interaction with the main cast they just kind of are there doing things.. and yea, perhaps a palate cleanser? Outside of this there are two others a couple who you are introduced to early on in the show and pop in periodically. Its obvious they know the MC's and serve mainly as a juxtaposition to the main 2 and to hint that they appear to be in a relationship.Outside the characters the art in the show is pretty solid though nothing groundbreaking, The audio is alright the opening was fun to watch for the first couple episodes but nothing was especially catchy.Overall, it was an alright show nothing I would go out of my way to watch and likely won't be very high on my rewatch list. I know there are 2 more seasons out now though I am not super excited to check them out. It's not bad if your bored and have nothing else to watch just don't go in with too high of expectations. seemed more 3d then the Male mc, she would show restraint when she thought the male was sick, offer help and what not though it was still fairly minimal.

The art and background music is standard, water colour backgrounds, simple shading, lot of wood winds. However the voice acting and writing is better than usual, it is not over acted but there is enough effort put in to make it seem natural plus the manga provided a good base for the script.I like that the show is low key just a girl negging a beta male in the hopes that he likes her, and he...hates every moment. Its is everything I remember from grade school, and it is great to see a show about a girl winning dispute her opponents skill without be a Mary Sue. I dislike that the background characters have no real development but still take up a portion of the show, but that is just nit picking. hates every moment.

I would put 6.5, but I would have to 7 due to the lack of the opportunity to put non-integer grades (really myanimelist add the function to put fractional grades). This anime does not contain any cringe, jokes below the belt, but it also does not contain something very good. This anime is run-of-the-mill, you may like it.  I\'ll explain why.Plot.Very boring narration, the romantic line practically does not move.  In reality, it was only after 24 episodes that they were able to hold hands, and they had an acquittal (you can really fall...down and die from that ladder), AFTER 24 SERIES KARL, I like when the relationship moves slowly, but in this anime because of such a relationship,  it becomes boring to watch it.  Well, in reality, here, like in a sitcom, there is no character development, there is no plot development, everyday life is also not interesting here, it consists of some kind of completely ""non-standard"" joke about how Takagi teases this motherfucker, everyday life here is just a tool for creating unfunny jokes  , is absent here, as I have already noted above, the promotion of the romantic line.  Great, isn\'t it?Characters.  Takagi is a pretty cute chan, she\'s not fucked up like a Nagatoro, she doesn\'t tease him so much that it starts to piss off(partly), I liked she more or less (I love loli, after all).  But Nishikata, he\'s just a cretin.  It’s so shameful and embarrassing to watch him. His intelligence is at the level of 0 IQ.

It's same grade as Nagatoro - but while Nagatoro progresses and have some idea and story hidden under 7 tons of dung and trash, Takagi is just 10 hours of brown noise.Basically, unless you are child or very young teen, you should feel bad watching and even worse, if you were to enjoy this."", 'The best characters in the show are Takagi-san and nishikita by far.

But that's probably because those sorts of characters are always in shows like One Punch Man, where stakes are pretty high. When the main struggle of a story is a middle school boy trying to prank a middle school girl, yeah, having the middle school girl not only be impervious, but a perfect retaliator… It makes for a great, if at least somewhat predictable comedy.The other thing you should know going in is that a substantial amount of the pranking and teasing isn't necessarily the innocent, imaginative school material of...your Tonari no Seki-kun. A lot of it is very much a flirty sort of teasing that is meant to tease *you*, the viewing audience, with a will-they-won't-they sort of romance.Takagi and Nishikata aren't great characters (though they are exactly what they need to be for the teasing subplots to work at all), the story isn't groundbreaking, the foreheads are a little distracting, and a trio of side characters steal about three minutes per episode being a very generic school-style comedy bit far away from the teasing gimmick - but overall it's just a fun comedy that actually sucked me into the will-they-won't-they, despite my usual disdain for that style of romance.Basically, I liked it more than I should have. your Tonari no Seki-kun.

It pushes you to root for our MC Nishikata, and to simultaneously have fun teasing him with Takagi.While Takagi-san is certainly repetitive, based on several teasing vignettes per episode interspersed with brief glimpses into the lives of some of their other classmates, the formula is effective. Takagi-san keeps both Nishikata and the viewer on their toes, and her mischievous smile and voice, provided by Rie Takahashi (Megumin in Konosuba and Emilia in Re:Zero), are as relentlessly disarming as her teasing is.Takagi-san is simple, pure,...embarrassing and delightful.

I really liked her a lot, and I might have been guilty of teasing her once or twice.  Well, as it happens my good friend also liked her and as such I never did confess my feelings.  Years later when I became an adult I looked back on the situation and I realized she must have liked me too (at one point I overheard her say, ""I liked you so much ~"" under her breath,...but this was apparently too vague/ambiguous for my middle-school self to understand). However, my strange personal code of conduct (bros before super cute girls?!  How stupid was I?) prevented me from enjoying my youth with someone who still sometimes shows up in the odd dream or two.  Not that I regret my actions one bit.  (I regret nothing!!!  *Sniffle*)Ahem, enough about me.  This show reminds me of those days, and so I really enjoyed this anime more than I ought to have.  I say ""ought"" because while the anime is indeed quite cute, I do have some complaints.  The relationship between the protagonists is not equal in any way.  The girl is super cute, witty, clever, gets excellent grades, kind, considerate, knows what she wants, and mature beyond her years.  The boy is awkward-looking, gets poor grades, is apparently slow-witted, disruptive in class, has problems controlling himself and his inside voice, and apparently doesn\'t think anything through before blurting it aloud.  Seriously, one wonders what Takagi sees in Nishikata.  I\'ll buy that she\'s further along in her emotional and verbal development, since that\'s basically all girls at that age.  That part is pretty accurate.But seriously, he\'s not even more athletic than she is, apparently losing at every single contest in which they compete.  This includes their endless attempts to see who can cause the other to embarrass themselves.  However, since Nishikata is about as subtle as a brick, he is pretty much just Takagi\'s punching-bag.  One would think it would grow old, picking on such an easy target.  To the show\'s credit, she\'s never excessive or truly malicious about it.  There are side-characters who have their own amusing conversations, and I\'m especially a sucker for the two girls that fill in a dialogue they observe but can\'t hear.I\'d like to complain about how dense Nishikata is regarding how Takagi obviously likes him given how much attention she lavishes upon him.  But then I re-read the first paragraph of my review...  um, yeah.The artwork is fantastic; I think the style chosen fits the mood perfectly.  The voice acting is superlative, and Takagi\'s seiyuu in particular is remarkable.  However, the same formula (can we even call it a plot?) is repeated over and over.  I think this show might make for a good watch as it airs, but it would be a little boring to binge the whole series in a single go.My advice to you is: watch if you really have a weakness for cute kid interactions, if you wish you were even a little more self-aware at their age, or if you don\'t like your stories to actually go anywhere.  On the other hand if you lack self-confidence, you might have trouble enjoying this show to its fullest.

"", 'A tale of two middle schoolers, and innocent love. The chemistry between Nishikata and Takagi was so powerful, hence why I loved following this show.It\'s not your generic love story with a cheesy storyline, rather it plays on the idea of love with both happiness and thrill.1: Story Score -> 5 (Mediocre)-> Something that this series lacked in my opinion. I felt there was no sense of story progression between each episode, because of how they chose to break it down. In short and sweet ""Topics"" they showcased a spectrum of different situations and feelings that both Nishikata and Takagi went through, as well...as the trio of friends. I liked how they took the approach of cutting it down to different showcasing but it doesn\'t support a easy to sense timeline or story structure.2: Art Score -> 6 (Fair)-> It takes a lot to impress me on the section of Art, as it implies a powerful influence on the entire story. For this show, I think its fair to give it a solid 6/10. It didn\'t quite wow me, but at the same time it wasn\'t terrible. Decent scenes in the typhoon period and others but that\'s pretty much it.3: Sound Score -> 6 (Fair)-> Pretty much the same description from the art score fits my sound score. Nothing wowed me, but again. Not terrible. From voice acting and situational audio, it was fine.4: Character Score -> 8 (Very Good)-> Being a short 12 episode series, it is pretty hard to maintain a strong cast of characters who pass a charm to its viewers, and thankfully this show does this extremely well. With these seamlessly short and passive scenes in the show, I felt as though the chemistry between both Nishikata and Takagi was amazing. The way they communicate with each other shows a realistic approach to the \'innocent love\' or \'young love\' aspect. Being an inexperienced lad, Nishikata is completely oblivious to Takagi\'s feelings, so much so that he often lowers his guard at the worst times for Takagi to tease him. Strong potential for these two in the future. Although we did see only did see a handful of scenes between the three friends Yukari, Mina and Sanae, I am comfortable with stating that they were also well portrayed for their ages.5: Enjoyment Score -> 8 (Very Good)-> With its fairly simple story, I was surprised. I was always looking forward to my Monday afternoon to watch this show, as each episode made me smile and laugh at how dumb Nishikata can be! :D|-_-_-_-> Final Score: 7/10 (GOOD)  <-_-_-_-|I really enjoyed watching this show, but as I stated, it takes a lot to impress me given this short stack of just 12 episodes.I would\'ve raised this score IF:-> We had a much more fullfilling ending.

Fill the air with some sort of organization instead of just following a broken ""topic"" based timeline.-> Increased quality of the art and sound aspect.

I thought this would be just another boring cliche ""kids fall in love then suck on each others faces"" but I was surprised that it wasnt like that (thank god). The story is a 6/10 because it is just kids and young love but the way the pull it off is pretty funny with all the light heart humor and minor harassment of the sexual variety. The art is a 7/10 because holy crap the character design is the funniest animation style ive ever seen....Why have giant foreheads? why not! They somehow made it work. The sound is a 7/10 aswell. The opining isnt anything special and the overall OST isnt bad but its not memorable at least for me. Now for the characters. I think the reason i love the characters so much is because of their giant forehead, this aspect of the show is better than the story. Sure Takagi is cute and Nishikada is funny to watch but holy moly the foreheads make it golden but i digress. 9/10 for these amazing creatures. I enjoyed this show alot and id watch it again.

I guess I misjudged it.This is a slice of life anime so there's little plot. Every episode is just a collection of small stories adapted from the manga.The character writing is where this anime shines. Nishikata narrates...everything with his internal monologue so you get a good idea of how he thinks, and Tagaki is very cunning and unafraid to push his buttons. The end result is lots of cute scenes between them.I only have a couple of minor complaints. I was a bit disappointed with how Nishikata never really grows out of being constantly flustered and embarrassed. You'd think that after spending months being teased by Tagaki he would start to develop a thicker skin, but throughout the entire series he is just constantly embarrassed and overthinking everything. In moderation this would have been charming, but they overused it a bit too much.There are also complaints about this anime ignoring a certain chapter from the manga (#31). Since there's a lot of chapters in the manga that were missed, it might just be that they were planning for a second season where they could use the remaining unused chapters. I dunno. The series did have a kind of anticlimactic ending so I can see why some people might be upset.The art, sound and voice acting are all fine.

After struggling to decide what should I watch next I came across with this title. Good choiceEven if I was right, about it being childish, I really enjoyed a lot this show. The blend between the romance and comedy reaches a very interesting level of perfection. The fact that they are innocent children from start to end is very refreshing.  I must admit tho at first, I thought they were like 8 years old or something (because...they look like), but they are actually 12-14 years old.If I had to be friends with these characters, it is very probable I would. I’ll give a short non-professional review on these characters, there isn´t much to spoil so read freely.Characters:Nishikata: he is the typical teenager that can’t see past what’s obvious. He is only thinking on how to “defeat” Takagi-san and it becomes somewhere between frustrating and mildly-infuriating. Like, jeez boy, chill for a minute and grow up. Sometimes Takagi-san is being nice for real and you are spoiling it because of your childish thinking. I believe “annoying” characters should only be annoying to the other characters in the show, not to the viewer, and Nishikata sometimes is annoying to the viewer. But you know, we have to give him some credit, he’s going through out high school with this girl that keeps pocking him… he might feel like he will lose respect or something like that. I don’t remember what was like being a teenager. So yeah, watching Takagi-san openly telling him she likes him and him not taking it seriously is a pain.On the other hand, we have Takagi-san, who seems to be more mature and aware that all of this is just childish. She just enjoys making Nishikata blush, it is very clear from first 15 minutes of the show both like each other. That´s the main reason she is there constantly bothering him. There isn´t much to say other than Takagi-san is very smart and fully aware of the simple-immature thinking of Nishikata.Story:The plot is quite simple. Nishikata exists=Takagi-san bothers him. There’s obviously some character development that is very fun to watch, but you’ll have to see it yourself.Art:The artwork is… special? When I first saw I had this little weird feeling that their heads were way too big. But other than it is smooth and satisfying to watch. They are cute characters. Period. The backgrounds are well drawn in my opinion and it looks very natural to the eye, like you would believe those are real places.Sound:I’ll have to stand up right here and say music is not one of the strengths of the series. It is good but not remarkable. Sometimes it just brakes the atmosphere with the transitions from serious character development to silly scenes of people walking in a hallway or something like that. And openings are quite soft for my taste. However, voice acting (Japanese) was perfect. Their voices fitted perfectly the personalities portrayed.If you want to have some good laughs and enjoy your afternoon make sure you don’t take this anime too serious and just let it be, you will love it. 100% enjoyable.Overall: 8 they look like), but they are actually 12-14 years old.If I had to be friends with these characters, it is very probable I would.

Anyway it tells the story of Nishikata who gets teased by the girl sitting besides him, this girl being Takagi-San, she is in love with him, she teases him because his reactions are funny and she cares about him a lot, Nishikata on the other hand has feelings as well but doesn't capitalize on them because he's not ready yet. He tries to get back at Takagi...San over and over again, but loses all the time, because he overlooks simple things and overthinks about certain decisions and answers. The show is iniatially very childish, immature, yet very cute and enjoyable at the same time, the pranks are mindgames, and the dialogue is witty, but the same repetitive formula kinda holds it back a little bit. The show is also different, as I have never seen a concept like this before in any media, plus the show is comprised mostly of a bunch of shorts compiled to form a episode. The show does have other characters and interactions like the three girls, who are somtimes funny, yet at most times cringe, I don't really like these 3 stooges actually. I also found myself constantly annoyed at how Nishikata does and approached things, his way of thinking and acting is very immature, but I supposed that the show is based around immaturity, since instead of confessing your love for your crush you tease them to no end, and the dude is kinda dense to them or overlookes these feelings most times, I guess thats what makes the series fun and enjoyable tho, the charm, wit, and dynamic of Nishikata and Takagi is the thing that made me able to stand the show, and not get bored of it.

I give it a 7/10 for my overall anime rating. San over and over again, but loses all the time, because he overlooks simple things and overthinks about certain decisions and answers. The show is iniatially very childish, immature, yet very cute and enjoyable at the same time, the pranks are mindgames, and the dialogue is witty, but the same repetitive formula kinda holds it back a little bit.

I get that some people may say ""Oh you\'re wrong that\'s how she expresses his love to...him"" and yeah, I get that, I know people do that, I\'m just not a fan of it especially when takagi makes Nishikata do challenges that embarrass him publicly.edit: I think i just realized the reason why i gave this anime a 6/10, its not because of takagi, it\'s because of the brainded nishikata who can\'t take a hint (although takagi could\'ve made it a little bit more clear) him"" and yeah, I get that, I know people do that, I\'m just not a fan of it especially when takagi makes Nishikata do challenges that embarrass him publicly.edit: I think i just realized the reason why i gave this anime a 6/10, its not because of takagi, it\'s because of the brainded nishikata who can\'t take a hint (although takagi could\'ve made it a little bit more clear)', ""As an anime in the same vein as Nagatoro-san, there's not a lot to complain. You've got the same protagonists teasing each other, as well as cute moments between both of them.However, I'd compare this more on Kaguya-sama, as they both feature protagonists that actually want to try and outsmart the other (though in this case, only one ever wins). Both lovable protagonists with an amazing VA cast as well as moments that are so sweet you might as well get diabetes.There are some lower points here though, like sometimes the teasing part can get too much when it goes personal, but other than that,...this anime is a must-watch for all rom-com lovers. this anime is a must-watch for all rom-com lovers."", ""This anime has so many cute, amazing moments and its so wholesome that I cant stop thinking about it.

Sure the first 5 times it happens it gets a giggle. After the same basically ""there\'s no way this guy can get the answer right"" on repeat it just feels more like she\'s making fun of a kid with autism. He is the definition of a walking L, he takes no W\'s....There\'s also the problem of a romance tag added to this, when it\'s basically not at all. All she does is make fun of him, there\'s 0 reason that he should at all be attracted to her.

If you enjoy the main concept - incredibly dense Nishikata tries (and fails) to outwit and prank his friend Takagi, who remains two steps ahead of him in all aspects, including love - then you\'ll likely enjoy this series. It\'s light, bubbly fun that essentially plays out the same scenario over and over again.I don\'t really get the people who say that Takagi\'s behavior in this show constitutes ""bullying"". I consider myself to be pretty sensitive when it comes to bullying content in shows, but nothing in this show ever struck me as being overly-aggressive or...mean-spirited. Notably, Nishikata tends to initiate the scenarios (which then blow up in his face) - while Takagi\'s teasing annoys him, he openly admits that he\'d rather be teased by Takagi than not interact with her at all.I will admit that it got a bit repetitive seeing Nishikata fall into obvious traps over and over and over and over. But that repetition also makes the show\'s unambiguously sweet scenes stand out that much more. I would suggest watching this show a few episodes at a time rather than binging it.If you\'re looking for something light, breezy, and nostalgic to cleanse your palate, I recommend this series! mean-spirited.

It has absolutely nothing to offer besides the overly fuzzy nature of it, which makes me wonder why you\'d ever watch this instead of something like The Peanuts Movie (which is a certified banger). I feel like it\'s almost unfair to try to rank this only having been...able to stomach half of it, but if anything that only reinforces my distaste for it.Both of the main characters have little to no development beyond their basic cookie-cutter premise.

They are a major highlight for me. As well as Nishikita’s constant need and desire to get one over Takagi. His internal monologue is very believable and grounded for a young boy like that. And it’s also just absolutely funny how he goes from very simply trying to humiliate Takagi in some way to being wary of any possibility she...can pull one over on him. By no means my favorite kind of comedy but it was enjoyable.In terms of other stuff, I generally like the music and backgrounds, but the character design took some getting used to.

However he doesn’t really manage to pull that off even once, at least over the course of this season. Thus, this is simply a series of short stories of him being outsmarted and teased. This can certainly be amusing at times, but that’s pretty much all there is to the anime, and it didn’t really feel like it was...enough. As it becomes clear that Nishikata will always fail there isn’t really any suspense or tension to things at all since you know it’s going to end in Takagi’s favor. There’s also some very light background on the two of them, but it didn’t really feel like there was much of any character development or relationship development outside of a few cute moments, so the romance aspect of the romcom wasn’t all that strong. There’s not really any overarching plot outside their relationship either. So comedy is all there really is in this series so far. In addition to the dynamics between those two, they interact with a few other characters and there’s even a trio of friends that some of the stories focus exclusively on which adds some variety to the comedy. But the focus is still largely on the main two and the exact same interactions between those two, so the comedy still felt repetitive.The art and animation are pretty solid. The art style is pretty basic but fits well and Takagi and Nishikata’s facial expressions come through incredibly well. The OP is solid enough in terms of audio and visuals. The ED is a bit strange in that it has several different songs, but plays basically a remix of the same visual for all of them. This visual is decent enough and the songs are all decent enough as well and sang by the voice actress of Takagi so they fit pretty well.

The plot is very simple of Takagi voiced by Rie Takahashi teasing Nishikata voiced by Yuki Kaji but Nishikata tries to tease her back by over-analyzing things and fails. Where the ""journey is better than the destination"" works into this is because of most of the anime comprised of these two at it with mind games in making one of them blush and as LA said before that...most if not ALL the time Nishikata\'s counter-teasing fails, the results are obvious, it\'s HOW Takagi rounds up Nishikata is where the beauty of this anime comes into.There are other minor characters who has some limelight, namely Takagi\'s friends Mina Hibino voiced by Konomi Kohara, Sanae Tsukimoto voiced by Yui Ogura and Yukari Amakawa voiced by M.A.O who have their own comedy skit going on and sometimes they intermingle and even contribute later to Takagi\'s next teasing. Yukari are the cloudcuckoolander\'s minder of Mina and Sanae, Mina more often with her non sequitur and spur of the moments things she wants to do while Sanae encourages Mina and gets in on the action.Now LA had heard both sides of the argument on whether Takagi or Nishikata are horrible characters, LA has heard that Takagi is an utter troll who gets Nishikata into trouble EVERY single time with Nishikata getting into trouble in the process, while LA has heard Nishikata is in the wrong by how he tries to HORRIBLY fail in trolling Takagi with some malicious intent. Now mind you LA doesn\'t see either of them as ""horrible characters"" however for LA, LA is on Nishikata\'s side for a ""bad character"" (which is LA\'s very loose definition by the way), as by all intents Takagi is mainly here for Nishikata\'s overreactions with her teasing and her liking Nishikata, while Nishikata tries desperately to repeat Takagi\'s teasing or comes up with an even more projected tease to try and embarrass Takagi and most obviously fails as Takagi has caught on already by this point and add that he\'s kinda dense in the romance department and him over-thinking things is a major sign he misses Takagi\'s real intent. So yeah LA did like Takagi as a character better however Takagi by all intents can\'t be ""her"" without Nishikata because without it we\'d have no anime.Which goes into LA\'s next point of the romantic edge Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san has, as Takagi mainly teases Nishikata through some romance teasing showing that she does like Nishikata and them both being adolescent kids they can\'t show their emotions that well most of the time thus for Takagi she uses her teasing to show that she likes Nishikata and it\'s shown throughout the anime that this is the case.In terms of animation by Shin-Ei Animation, LA thought for the most part the character designs were fine but with some decent backgrounding added as well. The animation wasn\'t that bad but the animation for LA lies in the character emotions shown in simple but great detail of our main duo, as we KNOW how they are feeling at the time by them not even needing to speak and LA praise that highly animation-wise, other than that, not much beyond the decent character designs and backgrounding.Now the voice acting, well for a rather minimalistic voice cast of 5, but the voice cast is excellent with Nishikata doing great in his overreactions and his schemes while Rie Takahashi\'s poker face and expert teasing vocals being masterfully done. LA hasn\'t heard Yui Ogura in her kuudere vocals in a while and this is also a first for LA hearing Konomi Kohara doing genki vocals as Mina in Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san. Overall the voice cast is kinda crucial to Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san thus LA would praise the voice cast as minimalistic as it is.Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is soo simple in it\'s execution but works out great with the good chemistry of Nishikata and Takagi as characters and their mind games of trying to tease one another being interesting enough, the minor characters of our trio Mina, Yukari and Sanae was also good additions as they had their comedic moments as well as an inadvertent hand in some of Takagi\'s teasing later on.

And...the MC, is kinda retarded, and that makes it hard to relate to him. I get that i does not catch the signals that the girl are sending to him, but the way he doesn get it, just feels out of place somehow. At least to me.

I do hope that the show will evolve his character, or at least give him something that can make him more trust worthy and relatable, because the premise of the show is very nice!7/10 for now, and then i hope for it to get better.Ps.If you wanna try to re-live some of the ""kids love"" that you feel as a young teen, when you first fall in love with a girl, then this anime is trying to create does moment.

I do hope that the show will evolve his character, or at least give him something that can make him more trust worthy and relatable, because the premise of the show is very nice!7/10 for now, and then i hope for it to get better.Ps.If you wanna try to re-live some of the ""kids love"" that you feel as a young teen, when you first fall in love with a girl, then this anime is trying to create does moment. I think that you should give this a try, and if you can relate to Nishikata, then I belieave that you will love this anime.', ""Whoever wrote this top review is wack.  This was such a sweet and innocent story.  I enjoyed it and easily saw myself returning to this show when I had to take a break.It's been a second since I've seen it so I'm going purely off of memory, but I can remember it pretty easily which is more than I can say for other anime.  It's seriously so sweet and their chemistry is really cute.  I appreciate that nothing really happens in this story, though I do know that they actually end up getting married.  If you're looking for sweet, mindless...fun, then yeah you should watch this :3 fun, then yeah you should watch this :3"", 'Overall I rate this 8.5!!_Quick Rev_: Great little story snippets about two middle schoolers, a boy and a girl. If you enjoy dramadies of the charming innocence of youth and to be reminded of your own personal inner anguishes or behaviors at that age then this show might be for you! Check out the first 15 min. its all you need. It sets the tone for the whole series._Story: Not much. Its just about this girl that has a crush on her friend and we get to watch her torment him on the daily. Great thing is it doesn\'t get old. There are other characters...thrown in just to mix it up a bit._Negatives: Hmm, can\'t think of any really. Other than at times I felt like I was out of the appropriate age group to be watching a show about kids._Bottom Line_: Finished it in a week by watching about 2 eps a night after work. This show made me smile and at times have a good laugh. There were also times where I replayed a scene a few times because the moments were captured so well (I have a favorite, but I\'m not gonna say, it might be your own if you watch) So, I\'m glad there\'s already a second season out, gonna save that for now.

Keep up the good work!', 'I try to watch at least one romance anime per season and the lucky winner of the previous season is Karakai Jouzu no Takagi san. Karakai Jouzu no Takagi san is a slice of life, romantic comedy which unfortunately doesn’t manage to keep invested in the story or the characters.Story – 5/10Takagi and Nishikata are both in the same middle school class and as luck would have it, they also happen to sit right next to each other, much to Takagi’s amusement and Nishikata’s despair. The story revolves around these two characters and the interactions between them, and other than that very little happens during...the twelve episode run-time.Every episode is divided into three parts, each of which focusing on a different keyword. These keywords are simple and are the main focus for that sections teasing. Unfortunately the teasing, which the title is so proud of, is the only form of dialogue between the two characters. To make matters worse, after the first episode the teasing starts becoming repetitive and predictable. What remains to keep us engaged in the story? Nothing is left, as all the supposed ‘story’ focuses on is the teasing. During an era of five minute short episodes, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi san is the perfect anime to get a short adaptation, because the entirety of the plot has a single gimmick and sticks to that gimmick until the final episode.Art – 7/10Karakai Jouzu no Takagi san’s art is really simple, but effective. Because focus is placed on the dialogue between the two protagonists, the characters designs are well done. Both Takagi and Nishikata have extremely cute character design’s which are appropriate for the series. The focus unfortunately remains on the two characters, which doesn’t allow for any proper world building. I can only describe the art style of the anime as a single word: adequate.Sound – 7/10Unfortunately is Karakai Jouzu no Takagi san’s OST as barren as its plot. One thing that kept bugging me throughout the series was the lack of background music. Sure there are one or two tracks which form part of the OST, but these were only played once or twice an episode. Where the anime manages to hit the ball out of the park, is with the opening and seven endings. All these are soothing and an absolute joy to listen to, which is mainly thanks to the fantastic vocalist and voice of Takagi, Takahashi Rie. Her gentle voice makes for some great tracks which work well with the aesthetic the show is going for. Speaking of voice actors, the most enjoyable part of the two protagonists were their voice actors Takahashi Rie (as aforementioned) and Kaji Yuki. They really managed to make the characters more enjoyable and I believe that few voice actors could accomplish the same effect. The rest of the cast all performed their roles admirably, but these two in particular were fantastic.Character 6/10Karakai Jouzu no Takagi san sports a total of ten characters, five of whom are simply present. Takagi and Nishikata are the center of attention for the majority of the series. What little personality they have can be summed up as: cheerful, mischievous, witty and over-complicated. The other characters who managed to get some screen-time is the trio of friends.  Their different personalities lead to some interesting conversation and for that reason I found them the most likable.Enjoyment – 4/10Other than the fantastic voice acting, sweet OP and ED, there was nothing which drew me into Karakai Jouzu no Takagi san. Neither the repetitive jokes nor the weak characters helped the fact. I might have enjoyed the series more if it had a shorter run-time and the dialogue wasn’t as predicable or repetitive.Overall – 6/10Karakai Jouzu no Takagi san is an anime which sets out to make you smile and manages just that. Whether it is the innocent setting, the adorable voice acting or the sweet opening/endings, these combined elements will most definitely accomplish just that. However, if you are looking for a romcom dealing with young love and personality to boot, I suggest you look elsewhere.Thanks for taking the time to read my review! the twelve episode run-time.Every episode is divided into three parts, each of which focusing on a different keyword.

Characters are almost perfect. Solidly good show.Story: 9To be honest there\'s very little to the story, however, we must assess it in slice-of-life genre that it belongs to. The story is simple, boy meets girl, girl teases boy, cue the romantic undertones.Art: 7...It\'s alright I guess. Nothing stunning but nothing bad either. The animation is quite nice.Sound: 7A nice, simple, mostly piano and flute based soundtrack.Characters: 9Initially wanted to give it a 10 but got progressively annoyed by Nishikata\'s reactions. They\'re too extreme and should\'ve been handled better. Instead of reacting outwardly with screams like he so often does, instead he should have had internal conflicts. An alternative is to use metaphorical devices such as in Nichijou, where an exaggerated reaction is obviously not part of their reality but goes to show the state of mind of the characters.In Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san, this is absolutely vital. The female MC seemed to be a little too stiff at times. She is almost always smiling and in a good mood. I\'d love to see some more emotions from her. Even with her stiff emotional role, when other emotions do come though, it leaves a huge impact.The show thrives on its characters and really needs to nail this aspect to be considered good.Enjoyment: 10Regardless of the flaw in characterization, I still thoroughly enjoyed the show. It was not boring. I care about these characters... even about the other characters that are involved. They\'re all likable and their personalities are distinct. They\'re not over-the-top moe or unrealistic.What the... I\'m talking about characters again?Overall: 8Anyway, it\'s a solidly good show and deserves a strong 8 in my opinion.

Takagi is the only female lead and is the one who is always Nishikata in always than one when it comes to said teasing she is nice and again straight forward when it comes to teasing Nishikata.

What i didn't like: i guess this would be more for people that yes this anime CAN get repetitive and old after while with all the teasing between the 2 but i thought it was always good this is just here for some people who might not like the repetitiveness otherwise i would say yeah at sometimes it was repetitive but i still enjoyed myself here.Overall: id give this a 8.5 (would give it a 9 but maybe you could kinda understand why i wouldn't) ill admit the only thing i didn't like was yes it was kinda repetitive for me but just the interaction between Takagi and also Nishitaka with and also the fact that i just really loved the comedy as well as the teasing going on and such was really well done here i would recommend this anime to anyone. watched the dub but they were easily good for the anime.Characters: Nishikata is the only male lead in the anime and is the bunt of when it comes to takagi and her teasing of him he is a really nice and just a good dude overall who tries to get back at takagi but fails a lot at it.

But it failed. Not all, but almost. The whole series starts with a bit interesting slow start. The comedies, skits and scenes are very cliche and you can see all the teases coming. Somewhere in the middle starts to fall, its very boring and not fun to watch. But the last 2 eps is somewhat good. Takahashi Rie Voiced Takagi-sa. was a good choices. I love how she delivers a very heart warming tone. My heart melts hearing both the Opening and Ending. I can say that the OPs and EDs are more heart warming than...the whole series. Ep 11 where Takagi-san was been Critical Hit is a good choice to spark the ending. And again, I did expect a way better ending of the series. It could be better if they put a more romance on the ending, where the confess or hug or hold hands, or something like that. But still. The series is a medicore. My scores: The story? Hmm not good. The MCs? Medicore. But I could see the potential of the series if it was centered on a romance rather than a sliceoflife / teasing anime. Romance! A little hugs and hold hands wont hurt. The art? Very bad. Very dry. I guess the animation budget is not that huge to begin with. The Ops & Eds? The best. Ending? Good, but it could be improve a lot. Can I recommend this to other people? Maybe no. There are other good series to watch. Maybe watching this 12eps is a little waste of time and boring. But ... having a little romance some times is good for our health. 😀 the whole series.

Cute anime, with cute main leads and 3 cute side characters. As we get through each episode we see the development of our 2 leads.

I heard that the manga goes all the way to their adulthood years. Sooo... I am really hoping for it pls.That is all that I can say about the anime for now.

Not unlike Danshi Koukosei, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi san is one of the most relatable slice of life for any teenager around the world. The show involves a very simple yet relatable plot: a boy named Nishikata that constantly tries to outwit a girl named Takagi-san but ends up always being outwitted and teased instead.Plot: 8/10The show's biggest selling point for me was how relatable it was to my teenage life. Even in college, i am always looking for ways to tease people (family and friends) or am always on the receiving end of being teased....Karakai's way of portraying teasing is attractive, interesting and SOOO relatable it's ironic. It's like getting to see yourself in the main protagonist's shoes as he plots his plan meticulously only to have them thwarted effortlessly by Takagi-san. Throughout all 12 episodes, there is so many ways of teasing introduced that it always feels fresh, and rarely boring. Even though some of the teasing methods were familiar to me and predictable, i never once found the desire to skip ahead. Seeing Nishikata's inner monologue and thought process is a treat and a very different perspective you never expect to see when you think about teasing in real life. Most time,  I find myself comparing Nishikata and myself from years ago and laughing at the antics that he pulls or plan he fails at, just because i understand his desire to get back at Takagi or his humiliation at Takagi's hands. This relatable feeling to the protagonist is what kept me interested and eager to watch the continuing episodes, be it to reminisce about my life or see what my life could have been like if it were full of tease like Karakai. The little romantic gestures between Takagi and Nishikata is also portrayed so sweetly in this show. The way Nishikata looks at Takagi and the way Takagi hides her true feeling by teasing him is so sweet and nice to watch. It's like watching how a secret crush between 2 people progress and develop, while also seeing how both of them cope and feel towards one another.The side story about the 3 girls is also one of my favorite things about the show. Each of the 3 girls's unique personality is something to adore and adds something a little more to the already fun show. Not only is it funny, and adorable, but it also serves as an interesting distraction from the overloading of teasing the show already has. Rather than suffocating you with overabundance of teasing, the show cleverly inserts the daily lives of these 3 girls, to satisfy you before being pulled back to the main story.Sound: 8/10I LOVE THE OPENING THEME. The opening song to Karakai jouzu is so smooth and sweet. It's so relaxing and fitting to the theme of the story. It's a nice pace away from the fast paced / rock / pop of the usual anime openings. I'm not so sure about the Ending songs though. Some of it were nice, some of it were ok, but it's not long enough to have a long lasting impression on me.Character : 10/10What else do i have to say. The characters are adorable. I honestly have no reason to dislike any of them, probably couldn't find any if i try. Nishikata is an extremely relatable character to me (and probably most guys out there). Always getting teased, having such a complex thought process, always failing at plans, gets embarassed easily, not knowing how to express himself. Takagi is like that girl is our lives. THE ONE WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. Cute smile, always getting on our nerves and yet we can't live without them. She's the girl we don't want other guys looking at / talking to, and we want her all to ourselves, despite not being able to stand her. The trio girl group always has great personality, with a fun/ clumsy one (Mina), a cool one (Sanae) and the sensible one with the biggest headache taking care of the other two. (Yukari). Apart from being lovable, the best part about these characters is the relatability i have with them. All the characters shown in the show are characters we could easily understand. We could also just as easily have been in their shoes at any point in our lives.Enjoyment: 9/10Really nice slice of life.Unexpectedly funny comedy value.Relatable plot and charactersRelaxing and nice opening themeCreative way of portraying teasing.Recommended: Yeah, a very nice and relaxing anime, and suitable for everyone.

If they\'re presented with emotions, they would only be more confused with more abstractions.Initially, I didn\'t have high expectations for Takagi-san, since it was just about childhood romance. I mean, what could be so interesting about that? Kids just fooling around, playing on the playground and swinging on monkey bars.However, I quickly realized that I was so wrong about this anime. What appeared to be a children\'s show turned into...a good bittersweet cup of chilldhood romance.I blushed. I lost.Takagi-san explores the emotions between two elementary children, a perceptive girl named, obviously, Takagi-san and a klutzy boy called Nishikata. Without knowing how to deal with the emotions that they feel for each other, Takagi-san proceeds to tease Nishikata to interact more with him and help him grow to realize her affection, while Nishikata plainly rejects any evidence of affection, or any girly behaviour such as loving ""50% Unrequited Love"", mainly due to his gender expectations. The series runs through their interactions with each other, which I believe are more comic than serious. There were some exceptionally hilarious and interesting scenes, such as when the 100% star-crossed elementary couples go tandem riding, when Takagi makes faces at Nishikata while he\'s drawing a portrait of her, and when Nishikata is always on the receiving end of Takagi\'s prowess as a witty teaser. However, the more that I progressed through the show, the more that I realized the heartwarming portions of it, which was the fact that although Takagi may seem to be treating Nishikata like a poor goldfish with  unattainable fish food in sight, she really is just trying to help him become more open to her affection. That fact becomes progressively apparent as Takagi show her weakness to emotions more and more towards the cute ending of the series.Ha, looks like all poker faces can break, even the ones made outta gold.Anyways, I gotta say that Takagi-san was quite a relaxing and touching watch for me. I do agree with many on this review page that the minor characters were very weak. They\'re the characters who resemble the poor quality that I initially expected from this anime. However, I think they can be basically overlooked since there many more outstanding pros than cons: The romance between Takagi-San and Nishikata was sweet and nostalgic, the ending was great, the humour is solid. I give this anime a 7/10 only because I still enjoy animes with more complex plots/themes better (eg. Code Geass, Caligula Effect) and I put a lot of emphasize towards soundtrack quality, which is not all that great for this anime but I can\'t really blame it since it represents the anime\'s school-setting style. Despite my picky criticisms, I highly approve of this anime and would recommend it to anyone who\'s just looking to reflect on their childhood or just looking to relax. a good bittersweet cup of chilldhood romance.I blushed.

Is there somebody that you just love getting under their skin, or maybe you just love their reactions? Sure, teasing is a lot better when you’re the one doing it. The person getting teased usually doesn’t enjoy it, but teasing typically has no malicious intent.  As weird as it seems we often tease the people we love. There are many ways to show affection after all.Our story centers around Nishikata and Takagi, two friends and classmates who are very competitive with each other. Takagi loves to tease Nishikata whenever the two of them are together, this often leads to...Nishikata getting in trouble in class. These two love to try and one-up each other, but Takagi is often the winner of their tease battles. “I’ll get her next time,” is what Nishikata often thinks, but will he ever actually get the upper hand? Hilarity ensues as these two friends fight the ultimate tease war, a war that is most definitely one-sided. This may seem like a pretty simplistic concept, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Teasing Master Takagi-san knows exactly what it wants to do and does its best to honor that. It wants to make a sweet and funny love story of two friends who constantly try and get the better of each other, and it does a fantastic job.There is a very small cast of characters in Teasing Master Takagi-san. Again, that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. You have Nishikata, our main character who is at the mercy of Takagi, and Takagi, the scarily intelligent master of teasing herself. Nishikata is pretty naive (I want to say stupid at times as well) and is always falling for Takagi’s tricks. You’d think he would catch on to her by now and keep his guard up, but it isn’t entirely his fault, Takagi knows exactly how to manipulate him to get a reaction she wants. She’ll also often manipulate Nishikata to think or say something perverted then viciously tease him for it, again showing how cunning and sometimes cruel Takagi can be. I’d talk about the side characters a bit, but there honestly isn’t that much to talk about. They fall into archetypes for the most part and aren't that memorable. They’re a nice diversion from the tease war and that's about it.The art isn’t the best thing I’ve ever seen, but it’s far from bad. There’s aren’t any noticeable quality drops, at least that I’ve noticed. It gets the job done fine. I will say that I don’t think I’ve watched an anime that had character designs quite like these. When I say that I mean Nishikata and Takagi mostly, the rest of the cast is pretty normal. I don’t know what it is, but I just don’t see many characters that look like Nishikata. I also really adore Takagi’s design. Again, I don’t know what it is and can’t exactly put it into words. They both just look different and I love it. Something I love about the opening is how much personality they managed to cram into it. You watch this opening and you get a great look into the characters of both Nishikata and Takagi. You also get a good grasp of who the side characters are in the second or two they’re on screen. I think it’s impressive to get that through in such a short amount of time. The opening song “I Didn’t Say That,” and the whole thing in general just bleeds personality and is really nice. This anime has quite a few endings, 7 to be exact. Now the visuals usually change slightly between each ending, but the song is different for each of them. Having that many songs for a 12 episode series is pretty incredible. They could’ve just had one normal ending for every episode and have one more for the last episode, but they went beyond that. That amount of work definitely deserves some praise. As someone who tends to skip endings unless I really like them, this series is a little wake-up call that will make me watch them for now on. I never want little details to go unnoticed like that again.I also want to give special credit to Takagi’s VA. I love her voice and her laugh and they both fit Takagi’s character so incredibly well. I couldn’t imagine another voice for Takagi honestly, it’s fantastic.If you’re looking for a fun anime to watch, one that you don’t have to think too hard about, one where you can just relax and take in the characters and adorable story, you could do a lot worse than Teasing Master Takagi-san. I was originally going to watch this when it was airing, but for one reason or another, I never did. Man, am I glad I came back to it. With all that being said, This was just my opinion and isn’t any more or less valid than anyone else’s. As always I highly recommend you watch it for yourself and form your own opinions.Thank you so much for your time, I really appreciate it.And as a little side note get excited for season 2 this year, I know I am.I give Teasing Master Takagi-san 8 blushing Nishikata’s out of 10 Nishikata getting in trouble in class.

Although this sounds like it would get repetitive, it really does not. Here's why this show does not get old and was always putting a huge smile on my face.Characters 10:This is one of the categories this show THRIVES in. Nishikata is the perfect protagonist for this show. He is very shy and also adorable but is a really good person over all, but he does'nt take the spotlight in this show(which he is not suppose to). This is because Takagi-san is SO PURE AND ADORABLE...AND I WILL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO PROTECT HER. Okay, but seriously, not only is Takagi extremely adorable but she is extremely smart and always makes me bust out laughing with her new schemes to tease Nishikata. The best part about this show is the bond these two characters share. Takagi and Nishikata have some of the best chemistry I have seen in anime. I can not get enough of these two and I love them so much. Now, they aren't the only characters in this show there also these scenes ( usually shorter then Takagi and Nishikatas ones) that include Sanae, Yukari, and Mina. There scences are usually good and they do not hog up too much of Takagi and Nishikatas screen time. There is also Nishikata's friends who play there roles perfectly fine. Nishikata and Takagi are what make this show work and they make me easily give this show a 10 in this category.Sound 8:The sound in this show will not blow your mind. But that does not mean it is average. The music fits the relaxing and happy middle school vibes of the show. The voice acting is great. Overall, the sound is very good.Art 9:The backgrounds in this show are GORGEOUS. The classroom is very detailed, and so is every place they go. This show has a very bright yet relaxing feel to it. I love the painting feeling of the backgrounds in this show. Overall, not only does it get the job done but it is great with amazing backgrounds with varied character designs that pop out of the backgrounds.Enjoyment 10:This show is extremely enjoyable. The comedy is so pure and great. This show come up with new scenarios for Nishikata and Takagi to experience together and each episode the scenarios get better and better. This show had me with a huge smile on my face every second.Overall 10:I would reccomend this show to everyone (unless you need action in your shows or something).  This show will have you smiling left and right and you will grow attached to Nishikata and Takagi. So if you want to have a good time, watch this show. You won't regret it.

Yes, Nishikata does suffer from the, all too common, stupid Protag-kun syndrome. However, in this case, I make allowances for his age. Since I know (from personal experience) how much slower boys are at getting started in the romance game. Some people regard this anime as having a bullying theme, but I think they...are very wrong in that regard, since it is clear from the off-set that Takagi has a MAJOR crush on Nishikata and the ""teasing"" in never mean spirited, but I can see how some people might be misguided into believing this from the title and synopsis.. Takagi\'s character design is more \'big forehead\' than \'big tree\'. I can see how it might be off-putting to some, but I found it endearing.Now, for the good stuff:.The show format is broken down by chapter, which means that, while there is progress in the overall story, it is never monotonous and repetitive, especially when it is interspersed with chapters dedicated to the three girls; Mina; Yukari and Sanae. They each had their own unique characters, but Mina was, by far, my favourite as she was the quintessential tomboy. Their contribution was always lighthearted and was responsible for the best of the comedy..The romance is clear to see (to everyone except Nishikata, as you\'d expect) but it is genuine, gentle and heartwarming. It gave me a great sense of nostalgia. Takagi\'s teasing is never mean and when her facade does occasionally slip it\'s really enjoyable to witness (if you like \'young love\' stories, as I do).. The music is another highlight, primarily due to the variety. I\'m not certain, but it appears that there is an entire album\'s worth of ending songs in this anime, all from the artist Rie Takahashi...most surprisingly, they are all well in keeping with the lighthearted nature of this anime and I liked them all, without exception.Would watch again, especially as a mood booster. Left me with a similar good vibe as the anime Amaama to Inazuma. are very wrong in that regard, since it is clear from the off-set that Takagi has a MAJOR crush on Nishikata and the ""teasing"" in never mean spirited, but I can see how some people might be misguided into believing this from the title and synopsis..

I enjoyed the unique art style of the anime, and the music that goes along with Takagi-san's teasing. The characters are also well developed. I enjoy that the anime doesn't just focus on the main duo, it also focuses on more characters, mainly Mina, Yukari, and Sanae.

Pretty much every situation the two leads get into always ends with Takagi getting one over on Protagonist-kun.

Honestly I feel sorry for the guy, the only winning move for him would be not to play. What neither party would ever admit is that they both obviously like each other and this is just some very advanced form of...flirting. It's a little like Love is War where the first one to admit they like the other will probably lose, but at the same time if either of them actually did admit their feelings it would also probably embarrass the other so much it'd be a win anyway. Really all Protagonist would have to do is man up and call her bluff one time and the roles would instantly be reversed.

Additionally, the side stories of the three other girls from Nishikata's class are particularly unengaging, and are mostly unrelated to Takagi's and Nishikata's own story. Near the end of the series, I just started skipping their segments because they were too boring.Art: 5Why can't Nishikata...have big eyes like Takagi? It would make him more distinct as a character. With his tiny pupils and black hair, he looks like a stereotypical anime minor character.Sound: 5The music matches the overall tone of the series. The opening song is pleasant to hear, but not particularly distinguishable from any other anime song with a happy tune. The ending song wasn't memorable at all.Character: 7Takagi is a great character with an entertaining personality and a perceptive mind. Nishikata is pretty much her punching bag. He is determined to get revenge on her, but he has a tendency to overthink or worry how others will view him. The other three girls who get their own side story aren't that interesting. One's overenthusiastic, one's quirky and silent, and the third . . . can't even remember what she was like.Enjoyment: 7There were enough funny and cute moments between Takagi and Nishikata, particularly in the second half of the show, for the series to merit a 7.Overall: 5I think the series would have been better if it stopped having sides stories for the three other girls in Nishikata's class and focused the episodes entirely on Nishikata and Takagi's interactions.

There are some specific titles which meet specific conditions which make them “epic”, but those are really rare. However, I must say I relatively liked this one even if not that much; it did greatly for the romance part especially in the last few episodes so at least it didn't disappoint me as most romance do.StoryIt’s not that bad. Takagi obviously is in love with Nishikata and everyone is aware of that except for… You guessed it. So with Nishikata unaware of her feelings, Takagi-san continues to tease him all...the time while implicitly conveying her feelings to him little by little. Nishikata, however, is more interested in paying her back for all that teasing she puts him through.

You must watch, I'm highly recommending to you.OVERALL 9"", 'I’ll try and keep this review short and sweet, at least compared to some others I’ve written. Karakai is a very straight forward and easy to watch show. Not only are the characters enjoyable, but due to the atmosphere of the show, there aren’t any rough edges or any major twists/turns to deal with. You’re given a cute plot right from the get go, and it plays out as a series about new experiences, funny moments, and the basic day to day interactions of the main protagonist duo.I suppose this show is not for everyone, but what show is? Honestly, I decided to give...this show a chance after watching Don’t Tease Me Miss Nagatoro (loosely translated). If you’ve never seen that show, no problem. I would just be remiss if I didn’t mention it. Had I not been advised of the similarities between the two (I’m a big Nagatoro fan) I probably would not have given Karakai a chance, however, I’m glad I did. I noticed that this show, in comparison, was in better favor than Nagatoro was as well. That’s definitely relative to the viewer, but by no means do I think there’s an objective way to measure the difference, and the only similarities being both are romancey and involve teasing (to different degrees I’d say though). I honestly can say I enjoyed both shows equally in there own unique way, so don’t think you’re getting a carbon copy in either watch order.I won’t go through the plot or anything, I’m sure you’ve got the gist of it. Girl teases guy because they are emotionally involved…maybe one day they’ll admit their true feelings (that’s basically it). It would be difficult to describe how quaint the storyline is though, even if I had wanted to describe it. There’s not spectacular art, it’s not a 100% original concept, nor is it anything that’s going to take you on a roller coaster of emotions. But I’ve watched through several romance anime’s recently, and it’s refreshing to have such a light hearted storyline, with no jealousy, romantic rivals, or unnecessary drama. It’s just a cute show. I will say, no 14ish year old girl is this clever with men unless she’s grown up wrapping guys around her finger from birth. I honestly doubt girls at my age are even as clever as the female protagonist in Karakai. The character feels real somehow though, so kudos to the developers. I liked seeing each new way she would poke fun at the male protagonist and in return see his responses, or lack of. The side characters do not play a large roll by any means, they just help move the story along and sometimes will guide how an episode may go for the main duo.I really just wanted to write this review for the people that are pondering if they should give this a chance. The answer is obviously yes, especially if you’re not looking for something overly dramatic, or involving a love triangle/harem. Not saying there’s anything wrong with those shows (I actually really enjoy shows like that as well!), but I appreciated this quaint and quirky show. Glad I gave it a chance.

That or it would be filled with annoying fanservice and boob jokes or something.I was pleasantly surprised that it has next to none of that. The main romance between the two characters never feels weird and is very wholesome. Its a sweet romance and Takagi while teasing is always respectable towards Nishikata and it never felt annoying or mean spirited. That and the whole fact that she likes him and keeps giving him hints helps create the cuteness factorOnly gripe was...sometimes I found myself skipping through episodes as it was a little boring but thats kinda how slice of life shows like this go.Overall 7/10Very sweet would recommend to romcom/slice of life fans. sometimes I found myself skipping through episodes as it was a little boring but thats kinda how slice of life shows like this go.Overall 7/10Very sweet would recommend to romcom/slice of life fans.', 'This goes for all seasons and the movie, this show is cute, fun and adorable through and through. Can the series be repetitive? Yes, but I’d like to clarify that season 3 alone does so many unique twists on the otherwise routine nature of the show that you should watch the first two seasons for season 3 alone. From having a majority of an episode going completely silent, to putting our cast in a school play, wavy hallucinations and dreams you cannot differentiate from reality. So you find the mind games played between Nishikita and Takagi a little tiresome, alright. Then you might find the...side characters more interesting or your speed. I’d say that as much as I love the duo of takagi and Nishikita I would raise the roof and yelp in glee when a segment of the show would transition its focus to the side characters. Namely the trio consisting of Sanae-chan, Minae-Chan, and Yukari-chan.A great addition to the cast that most would agree could very well be in a show/manga of their own. I preferred their segments for the more unpredictable nature and also when it would play off of a prior segment/bit that primarily involved the main duo. My favorite trio bit would be a three-way tie between “presence”, I believe it was called, them at the beach, and the bit in the very last episode where they solve Nishikita’s own, “love quest”.Maybe you find the trio’s presence so upsetting that you wanna drop the series entirely. Well fret not, for there are also other characters too! Including a side couple consisting of a girl with a forehead that’s somehow even bigger than takagi-san’s and Brock from pokemon. Their relationship is reflective of a typical highschool romance more so than Takagi and Nishikita’s. You wonder why they don’t stick around more often and just go on a double date with them. Speaking of scenarios I wish I had a chance to see, I wish we got to see the rest of the picnic Takagi and Nishikita had with the trio. We hardly get to see Nishikita interact with the trio, let alone any girls that aren’t Takagi san. It would’ve been a hilarious romp I’m sure. There’s also Takao, Kimura, and Hamaguchi which comprise Nishikita’s friend group. Takao’s the lovable and rotund oaf (probably has a thing for Sanae-chan), Kimura is the inquisitive glasses dork of the group, and Hamguchi is shown as otherwise normal, looking more like a typical anime highschool protagonist than Nishikita. Yet he fumbles around his crush, Houjo-san(a girl who likes “mature” types) almost as badly as Nishikita does.Alright, you despise the entire cast and find their antics annoying rather than sweet and wholesome. You pity Nishikita for losing to takagi-san all the time. Well fear not, despite not happening much, the moments where Takagi is btfo’d by Nishikita makes all his losses worth it. In fact, that was the main reason I kept coming back episode after episode. Because the rare instances he does win against Takagi are so warm, you can feel the love beaming through your screen. “But Nishikita is always winning even when he loses since he always has Takagi-san by his side”. Yeah, but you gotta understand how much my man’s suffering. To us the viewer, yeah the guy should take a step back and realize that he’s set for life. But to him, even if he likes takagi, he’s still losing in some capacity due to the games they play and no one likes losing over and over again. Even if it’s a game of rock, paper, scissors.Look, all I’m saying is that you should watch this series even if it does get repetitive. Because hidden behind all of Nishikita’s losses, are moments worth cherishing forever, even if he doesn’t acknowledge them. You the viewer can. side characters more interesting or your speed.

You the viewer can.', ""Teasing Master Takagi-San is my favorite anime, and yes I really do mean that. While it may not be a “top-tier” anime objectively, the series has received a positive reception over the years and has garnered a good amount of fans. It’s a cute, wholesome, hilarious and even nostalgic anime that resembles the feeling of being young, reminiscing the days of middle school, and making fun memories with the people we spend time with. Takagi has all of that, and it does an excellent job at making these moments feel natural and organic. It’s the kind of series that serves as a nice breather to...help balance out from the more deep and complex stories out there, but still having moments for the viewer to keep themselves relatively engaged.With Season 3 currently out, I thought I go back and review the Takagi anime as a whole, highlighting the charm of what this series brings, and how much it has progressed overtime. While I will admit Seasons 2 and 3 are good sequels that improve the qualities of the 1st season, I still find Season 1 to be quite underrated and there are some nice moments here that people tend to overlook. The season may not be perfect, but it manages to keep its overall narrative consistent which later gets improved in future seasons.Art: The art and the animation is pretty solid. I love the visuals and how the setting is based on the real life Shodoshima, which fun fact, this is where the author of the Takagi manga grew up in! The anime manages to recapture a couple of the island’s locations such as the school, a few neighborhoods, the shrine, the library, the tunnel, and the bookstore to name a few, and when you look at a side by side comparison to its real life counterpart, the shots are pretty similar, almost looking like a faithful recreation. While Takagi isn’t the only series that manages to recapture Japan’s notable locations and landmarks, it still does a good job at making the viewer feel interested in wanting to visit sometimes.Moving back to the in-universe stuff, I like the character designs and how they actually look like middle schoolers. A lot of series tend to either overage or underage their characters from their respective age group/school year. This is mostly a nitpick on my end when it comes to those series, so it’s not really a huge issue for me unless it becomes taken too far. Aside from that, the anime does a good job portraying the behavior of most middle school children, from their youthful appearance, to their playful, innocent expressions. Nishikata’s reactions are hilarious and his expressions, complimented by his sounds effects, are what makes the comedy land. Takagi’s expressions are great too ranging from adorable cuteness to playful teasing. Those smug faces she makes are pretty hilarious.Overall, the art for Takagi is solid. Its got good looking visuals, and the expressiveness of the characters captures the nostalgic feeling of being in middle school, giving a sense of adorable wholesomeness and hilarious laughs. Shin-Ei did a good job in this aspect, which they later improve in the future seasons.Story: The story follows two separate plots. One focusing on the two main leads Takagi and Nishikata, and the other revolving around 3 best friends being Yukari, Sanae, and Mina.Takagi and Nishikata Story: In Season 1, the narrative is relatively straight forward, Takagi teases her classmate Nishikata and Nishikata tries to find ways to tease her back, but often finding himself failing to make a comeback, so he continues until Takagi succumbs to his teasing. Its a simple plot that's easy to follow, but still leaves the viewer engaged as to how Nishikata will try to tease Takagi. Season 1 manages to keep this narrative consistent, and gives a similar vibe to a classic Tom and Jerry episode. Although some people may find the segments repetitive after watching a few episodes, the interactions Takagi and Nishikata have leads into the most important aspect of the series, their relationship.Season 1 focuses on establishing their relationship, how they met, and how they grow closer to each other. In a relationship, this is the initial stage. Nishikata sees Takagi as a rival at first, but as time goes on, he notices that he spends a good amount of time with her, and even though he loses most of the time, he is able to learn and slowly grow thanks to her. The interactions the two have feel natural and organic, and I love how the anime paces itself and its dialogue when it comes to fast paced comedy and slow paced intimate moments.This in my opinion, is what highlights the series’s charm, because it emphasizes one of the main love languages, quality time. You get invested in how these 2 characters slowly start to think about each other throughout their daily activities, talking in class, going bicycle riding, playing games, walking together, all of which show the natural progression of how a friendship is formed, and only then do these two eventually start to see that they enjoy each other’s company, and later see each other as something more which is something the later seasons start to focus on. It feels organic, it feels natural, its well paced, it has this nice sense of flow when the episode transitions into their next segment. You start to see the relationship change bit by bit, and while Seasons 2 and 3 show this development more evidently, Season 1 has some nice small moments that often go unnoticed, which makes the finale of this season all the worthwhile, opening the door for what’s about to happen in the next stage of their relationship.B-Trio Story: The secondary plot revolves around 3 best friends being Yukari, Mina, and Sanae, who i will refer to as the B-trio. Their segments consist of the usual slice of life parts that serve as a nice comic relief away from the Takagi and Nishikata segments. Now to be fair, if I had to pick one criticism people have with the series, it’s that the B-trio segments don’t often serve too much to the overall story, and often times their segments can be seen as fillers, which could of been used to develop Takagi and Nishikata’s relationship. Personally, I enjoy these segments and I don't mind their presence in the anime because I find them to be solid comic relief characters, and their segments also expands on the SOL middle school life, plus their segments don't go on too for long so its not that big of a deal, at least to me. If you don't like these segments, then its perfectly fine, because I agree that these 3 as standalone characters wouldn't work, hence them being here helps to serve as a breather to give a quick laugh before transitioning back to the main plot.Season 1's overall narrative focuses on the starting stage of establishing the main lead's relationship, and focuses more on the slice of life/comedy aspect with small bits of romantic interest. The romance is definitely on the slow burn side, but it does manage to pace itself in giving subtle hints of development worth investing towards which will then be expanded on in the later seasons.Characters: Takagi and Nishikata may be your typical middle schoolers, but their dynamic is what makes the series enjoyable to watch.Nishikata is a fun character. I love how expressive he is and his reactions always give me a good laugh, even upon rewatch. His development in Season 1 may not be as impactful to some compared to the later seasons, but he does slowly improve himself after some of the losses he takes, and he slowly starts to learn more about Takagi, not only as a rival, but eventually as a friend.Takagi is also a fun character. I enjoy her fun teasing side since her teasing isn’t seen in a mean spirited way, but rather showing her affection towards Nishikata. Granted we don’t know too much about Takagi since we mostly see the story through Nishikata’s perspective, so it leaves both Nishikata and the audience having to use visual cues such as tone and expressions, especially with how each encounter with Nishikata slowly strengthens her feelings for him.Yuki Kaji and Rie Takahashi do an excellent job at making their interactions feel very natural. The dialogue is smooth and well paced, talking at a speed where it’s easy to pick up some of the basic Japanese language.The B-trio and various other side characters in the series are also your typical middle schoolers and most don’t serve too much importance to the overall plot, just people Takagi and Nishikata interact with if they aren’t hanging out together.Soundtrack: The soundtrack for Takagi is interesting as it doesn’t follow the standard 1 opening song, 1 ending song, for a 12 episode series. Instead it does 1 opening, sung by Yuiko Oohara (who also does the songs for Mushoku Tensei), and has multiple ending songs (this season has 7) that change every 1-2 episodes, all sung by Rie Takahashi. The songs are wonderful to listen to, and I recommend looking at the lyrics as it does give more insight on Takagi’s feelings.Enjoyment: After rewatching Season 1, I found it to be pretty fun to watch, even if Seasons 2 and 3 are a definite improvement. A good amount of the iconic jokes were in this season, and the development was pretty subtle. I still got a good laugh from Nishikata’s reactions and I appreciate his motivation to better himself once he starts learning more about Takagi. I also saw the B-trio plots to be fun as well, even if they didn’t serve too much to the story. Finally, rewatching most of the segments in Season 1 helped to see how much the relationship has changed, as there are parallels that correlate to how Nishikata from Season 3 is a different person there than he was in Season 1. He acts less flustered and is starting to become more aware of his feelings for Takagi. All of those small moments of development he had in Season 1 were foundations as to how his character starts developing in the later seasons.Conclusion: Takagi-San Season 1 isn’t a perfect season, it’s a simplistic plot with a premise that repeats itself, and development that may not be as noticeable compared to many other series that have an overarching storyline, fleshed out characters, and complex themes. So why do I still give the season a 10? Takagi is a simplistic story that works, not every story needs to have this layer of complexity, and simple stories like Takagi are needed to help give the audience something to relax to, a story that invokes happiness, and a story that’s easy to follow but still make it engaging for the viewer to feel interested. It gets the job done of the story it’s trying to tell, and the later seasons manage to improve the qualities the first season had, making the series definitely worth the time investing in. If you’re looking for an anime with good romance, or something to relax your brain with, then I definitely recommend this one. help balance out from the more deep and complex stories out there, but still having moments for the viewer to keep themselves relatively engaged.With Season 3 currently out, I thought I go back and review the Takagi anime as a whole, highlighting the charm of what this series brings, and how much it has progressed overtime. While I will admit Seasons 2 and 3 are good sequels that improve the qualities of the 1st season, I still find Season 1 to be quite underrated and there are some nice moments here that people tend to overlook. The season may not be perfect, but it manages to keep its overall narrative consistent which later gets improved in future seasons.Art: The art and the animation is pretty solid. I love the visuals and how the setting is based on the real life Shodoshima, which fun fact, this is where the author of the Takagi manga grew up in! The anime manages to recapture a couple of the island’s locations such as the school, a few neighborhoods, the shrine, the library, the tunnel, and the bookstore to name a few, and when you look at a side by side comparison to its real life counterpart, the shots are pretty similar, almost looking like a faithful recreation. While Takagi isn’t the only series that manages to recapture Japan’s notable locations and landmarks, it still does a good job at making the viewer feel interested in wanting to visit sometimes.Moving back to the in-universe stuff, I like the character designs and how they actually look like middle schoolers. A lot of series tend to either overage or underage their characters from their respective age group/school year. This is mostly a nitpick on my end when it comes to those series, so it’s not really a huge issue for me unless it becomes taken too far. Aside from that, the anime does a good job portraying the behavior of most middle school children, from their youthful appearance, to their playful, innocent expressions. Nishikata’s reactions are hilarious and his expressions, complimented by his sounds effects, are what makes the comedy land. Takagi’s expressions are great too ranging from adorable cuteness to playful teasing. Those smug faces she makes are pretty hilarious.Overall, the art for Takagi is solid. Its got good looking visuals, and the expressiveness of the characters captures the nostalgic feeling of being in middle school, giving a sense of adorable wholesomeness and hilarious laughs. Shin-Ei did a good job in this aspect, which they later improve in the future seasons.Story: The story follows two separate plots. One focusing on the two main leads Takagi and Nishikata, and the other revolving around 3 best friends being Yukari, Sanae, and Mina.Takagi and Nishikata Story: In Season 1, the narrative is relatively straight forward, Takagi teases her classmate Nishikata and Nishikata tries to find ways to tease her back, but often finding himself failing to make a comeback, so he continues until Takagi succumbs to his teasing. Its a simple plot that's easy to follow, but still leaves the viewer engaged as to how Nishikata will try to tease Takagi. Season 1 manages to keep this narrative consistent, and gives a similar vibe to a classic Tom and Jerry episode. Although some people may find the segments repetitive after watching a few episodes, the interactions Takagi and Nishikata have leads into the most important aspect of the series, their relationship.Season 1 focuses on establishing their relationship, how they met, and how they grow closer to each other. In a relationship, this is the initial stage. Nishikata sees Takagi as a rival at first, but as time goes on, he notices that he spends a good amount of time with her, and even though he loses most of the time, he is able to learn and slowly grow thanks to her. The interactions the two have feel natural and organic, and I love how the anime paces itself and its dialogue when it comes to fast paced comedy and slow paced intimate moments.This in my opinion, is what highlights the series’s charm, because it emphasizes one of the main love languages, quality time. You get invested in how these 2 characters slowly start to think about each other throughout their daily activities, talking in class, going bicycle riding, playing games, walking together, all of which show the natural progression of how a friendship is formed, and only then do these two eventually start to see that they enjoy each other’s company, and later see each other as something more which is something the later seasons start to focus on. It feels organic, it feels natural, its well paced, it has this nice sense of flow when the episode transitions into their next segment. You start to see the relationship change bit by bit, and while Seasons 2 and 3 show this development more evidently, Season 1 has some nice small moments that often go unnoticed, which makes the finale of this season all the worthwhile, opening the door for what’s about to happen in the next stage of their relationship.B-Trio Story: The secondary plot revolves around 3 best friends being Yukari, Mina, and Sanae, who i will refer to as the B-trio. Their segments consist of the usual slice of life parts that serve as a nice comic relief away from the Takagi and Nishikata segments. Now to be fair, if I had to pick one criticism people have with the series, it’s that the B-trio segments don’t often serve too much to the overall story, and often times their segments can be seen as fillers, which could of been used to develop Takagi and Nishikata’s relationship. Personally, I enjoy these segments and I don't mind their presence in the anime because I find them to be solid comic relief characters, and their segments also expands on the SOL middle school life, plus their segments don't go on too for long so its not that big of a deal, at least to me. If you don't like these segments, then its perfectly fine, because I agree that these 3 as standalone characters wouldn't work, hence them being here helps to serve as a breather to give a quick laugh before transitioning back to the main plot.Season 1's overall narrative focuses on the starting stage of establishing the main lead's relationship, and focuses more on the slice of life/comedy aspect with small bits of romantic interest. The romance is definitely on the slow burn side, but it does manage to pace itself in giving subtle hints of development worth investing towards which will then be expanded on in the later seasons.Characters: Takagi and Nishikata may be your typical middle schoolers, but their dynamic is what makes the series enjoyable to watch.Nishikata is a fun character. I love how expressive he is and his reactions always give me a good laugh, even upon rewatch. His development in Season 1 may not be as impactful to some compared to the later seasons, but he does slowly improve himself after some of the losses he takes, and he slowly starts to learn more about Takagi, not only as a rival, but eventually as a friend.Takagi is also a fun character. I enjoy her fun teasing side since her teasing isn’t seen in a mean spirited way, but rather showing her affection towards Nishikata. Granted we don’t know too much about Takagi since we mostly see the story through Nishikata’s perspective, so it leaves both Nishikata and the audience having to use visual cues such as tone and expressions, especially with how each encounter with Nishikata slowly strengthens her feelings for him.Yuki Kaji and Rie Takahashi do an excellent job at making their interactions feel very natural. The dialogue is smooth and well paced, talking at a speed where it’s easy to pick up some of the basic Japanese language.The B-trio and various other side characters in the series are also your typical middle schoolers and most don’t serve too much importance to the overall plot, just people Takagi and Nishikata interact with if they aren’t hanging out together.Soundtrack: The soundtrack for Takagi is interesting as it doesn’t follow the standard 1 opening song, 1 ending song, for a 12 episode series. Instead it does 1 opening, sung by Yuiko Oohara (who also does the songs for Mushoku Tensei), and has multiple ending songs (this season has 7) that change every 1-2 episodes, all sung by Rie Takahashi. The songs are wonderful to listen to, and I recommend looking at the lyrics as it does give more insight on Takagi’s feelings.Enjoyment: After rewatching Season 1, I found it to be pretty fun to watch, even if Seasons 2 and 3 are a definite improvement. A good amount of the iconic jokes were in this season, and the development was pretty subtle. I still got a good laugh from Nishikata’s reactions and I appreciate his motivation to better himself once he starts learning more about Takagi. I also saw the B-trio plots to be fun as well, even if they didn’t serve too much to the story. Finally, rewatching most of the segments in Season 1 helped to see how much the relationship has changed, as there are parallels that correlate to how Nishikata from Season 3 is a different person there than he was in Season 1. He acts less flustered and is starting to become more aware of his feelings for Takagi. All of those small moments of development he had in Season 1 were foundations as to how his character starts developing in the later seasons.Conclusion: Takagi-San Season 1 isn’t a perfect season, it’s a simplistic plot with a premise that repeats itself, and development that may not be as noticeable compared to many other series that have an overarching storyline, fleshed out characters, and complex themes. So why do I still give the season a 10?

Dive into the world of Takagi-san and Nishikata, and you won't regret it!"", 'If I were to best describe the Karakai jōzu no Takagi-san, it is like a serving of an extra-large triple-sundae strawberry ice-cream. With its warm animation, cute chemistry between the two lead characters and wonderful voice-acting, the show has the capacity to hook the viewer with its sweetness. And like strawberry ice-cream, the series is sweet and oh-so-delicious. However, by the time a viewer has seen 3-4 episodes in a row – that same sweetness is like the third scoop of the strawberry ice-cream. It begins to overwhelm the taste buds, makes you more likely to get diabetes and the viewer either ends up disgusted...with the sweetness or ends up chucking the last ice-cream scoop in the trash-can. The show suffers from the same problem – if you end up binge-watching this show, the formula becomes easy to predict and it ends up becoming repetitive.This is because Karakai jōzu no Takagi-san is ridiculously simple – Takagi and Nishikata are 12 year olds who are in love with each other. However, while Takagi is upfront about her feelings, Nishikata is not. The entire show is how Takagi spins circles around Nishikata, teasing him, enjoying him see blush and in the process make him realize how he feels about her. That’s it. That’s the entire show. There are no major dramatic flash-points, no unnecessary love-triangles, not even a major confession between the two lovebirds. It’s just sweet – and one-dimensionally so.Now, in the defense of both strawberry ice-cream and the show – I will have to argue that the limitation lies not with the product but how the product is consumed. Admittedly, the day I viewed four episodes back-to-back, the final episode began to feel annoying. All I wanted was to Nishikata was to be honest with himself and admit that he liked Takagi, especially when she had been dropping hints about she felt all through the series. But when I paced myself and limited myself to a single episode a day, the enjoyment factor increased considerably.What makes it enjoyable is the chemistry our lead characters have with each other. Nishikata is hilariously inept but an innocent-lad while Takagi is clever, charming but never manipulative. Where the show shines is slowly developing the chemistry between the two main characters. Takagi is relentless in her teasing but knows to never cross the line. After all, the teasing is simply a cover so that she can spend time with him. At the same time, she helps him out with his Math exam, his summer vacation homework and his tandem-bicycling skills. In return, she gets to hug him while sitting on the back of his bicycle. It’s a win-win for our characters and a win-win for the viewers to see their wholesome interactions. My only advice would be to remember that this show is like a palate-cleanser that is meant to be consumed after a long hard day at work. Like a palate cleanser, it is designed to leave you with a sweet aftertaste. And remember, one doesn’t binge on the palate-cleanser! with the sweetness or ends up chucking the last ice-cream scoop in the trash-can.

Only showing the same thing, there is no meaningful conflict, makes me a little bored watching it. Yes, naturally, this is a comedy anime and a slice of life. The comedy elements that are displayed are sometimes not funny, but there are also some that make me smile to myself. It doesn't matter.This anime also makes me a little annoyed, annoyed because of Takagi's behavior. He teased Nishikata and had his own way, or it could be called a cunning way. And strangely, Nishikata is always shown losing when playing with Takagi, and Takagi always wins,...which means Nishikata is always unlucky. There are ways that Takagi used to tease Nishikata. That's what made me a little annoyed with Takagi. Like Tom & Jerry, Jerry always wins against Tom, and Tom always gets bad luck when he faces Jerry. And this anime only shows scenes of Takagi's pranks with his strategy to face Nishikata. Usually 1 episode has 3 scenes, similar to the anime Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, Asobi Asobase, and Kaguya-sama. This anime is quite entertaining, but somehow I'm a little sleepy watching it, because the plot is too flat, and the comedy is also a bit crunchy. The story only focuses on the 2 couples, Takagi who likes Nishikata, but Nishikata is not sensitive at all. Even so, other characters are also shown and there are separate scenes.Graphics and animations that appear 'ordinary', nothing special. Naturally, because this is a slice of life anime, which doesn't require fantastic animation. No problem.You can watch this for entertainment, it is even suitable for children. But don't expect more with this anime, because maybe some people will get bored watching it. which means Nishikata is always unlucky. There are ways that Takagi used to tease Nishikata.

It's simple. Nishikata is always being teased by Takagi, whom knows Nishikata from the inside out. He's always trying to make a comeback to her teasing but to no avail (most of the time), despite this, he vows to someday get her back. While this sounds like a formula that's bound to get repetitive and predictable, which admittedly it does feel like it does to a certain extent, there's always a new situation that...the two characters are put in (with more emphasis on Nishikata of course) with new jokes and ways to tease to keep the series from ever becoming boring or repetitive. It's formulaic to a certain degree, but it makes sure to keep things fresh and flavorful. Think of Tom & Jerry, or more specifically, Coyote and the Road Runner. It follows a basic premise that the viewer can usually predict how an episode will play out, but manages to remain entertaining through the creative ideas that the creators come up with and the situations they put the characters through. That's Takagi-san. It's premise is unique but nothing groundbreaking, but that doesn't really matter since the execution of this simple premise and what is done with it is really good.Characters - 8.5 - The relationship between the main characters, Nishikata and Takagi is what makes or breaks this series for many viewers. If you don't like it, you're unlikely to enjoy the rest of it, but if you do like it, you're in for a good time, as you'll find the chemistry between the two to be quite adorable. Always trying to outsmart one another, but one always comes out on top, yet they keep going, or should I say, playing? Takagi-san is, while not a prodigy or a genius, is fiercely clever and extraordinarily masterful at her craft: Teasing Nishikata. She's always one step ahead, thinking outside the box, and coming up with creative ways to tease and outsmart Nishikata. Despite this, she is very charming and likeable. You may think that a character like this would feel inhuman, like a Mary Sue, but no, there are moments where she's caught off guard and it becomes apparent that she's still an ordinary girl who's just as human as everybody else. Nishikata, while he appears to be just your average kid, he isn't as shallow as one may think he is. Despite falling for Takagi's tricks again and again, he's shown himself to be adaptive and smart. He's always over-analyzing the situations Takagi puts him through, taking a cautious approach to executing his plans as opposed to doing it directly like Takagi, which ironically, is almost always the cause of his defeat. Nor Takagi or Nishikata have any malice between them; Takagi seems to be teasing him so much as a means to spend more time with him. Through all of this teasing, their relationship grows and they grow closer and closer to each other and develop into expressing their feelings for each other. This is seriously so damn cute.Now, why all this praise and an 8.5? Unfortunately, the main couple are really the only selling point for the character department, all of the supporting cast stays undeveloped and buys into commonly used tropes and cliches. Mina, Sanae and Yukari are really just comedy relief characters that aren't really part of the main story since they don't affect it in any major way that I've seen thus far. They aren't part of the shenanigans of the main couple, but rather they live through their own, which isn't really all that interesting. But if you don't mind that, you're welcome to continue watching, I found the skits to be fun anyway.Visuals - 7 - Standard anime visuals. This is a SoL show so there's no need for flashy animation or stunning art. Average art and animation is enough for a show like this. Therefore this doesn't really affect the final score. I do have to say, that the close-up shots are greatly appreciated, since Takagi has an extremely cute face.Audio - 8 - Meets the bar as well, but does better than most other SoL. The voice acting is pretty good, with performances by Takahashi Rie and Kaji Yuuki that bring the characters to life and express the lines perfectly. From Nishikata's exaggerated gasps to Takagi's relaxed voice and laughs, it's overall pretty good! Not to mention the Opening song and SEVEN different ending themes!Overall: I love this series.

I watched the first season of this series about a year ago, and I generally enjoyed it.  It wasn\'t anything special, but I liked it nonetheless.  When I saw that a third season was coming out this fall, I decided to watch the second season in preparation.  The second season is really damn good.  It has more structure, and...a lot more work went into crafting the situations and stories.  So needless to say I was expecting the third season to deliver the same quality content.  Unfortunately... it failed to do so.Season 3 isn\'t bad, it\'s just dissapointing.My first issue is with the story.   Given that each episode is a measly three minutes long, it can be difficult to cram in much of a story.  With these constraints, there\'re two options:1. Each episode has a self contained story (this was done for season 1).2. Have several story arcs that develop over the course of several episodes (this was done for season 2).This kind of story structure is the reason season 2 is better than season 1.  As long as you have competent writers, an arc-based story structure is always the superior option.  Unfortunately, season 3 follows the former formula, and every episode has a different story.  This makes for some very mediocre episodes, and plotlines with some potential don\'t extend beyond a singular episode.For the contents of the story itself, the plot follows a student named Shi Fen, his little sister Shi Mao, and their friends.  They get into various hijinx and experience all kinds of absurd situations.  There\'s a fair amount of slapstick and situational humor.  The sheer absurdity of some episodes didn\'t really make them all that funny, and this season certainly didn\'t get as many laughs out of me as season 2 did.The animation, art, and audio are all good.  The art isn\'t very ""anime-like"", but it has it\'s own charm.  The characters have very cartoonish motion, but it\'s all done smoothly.  And the voice actors do a fine job as well.Overall, Ani ni Tsukeru Kusuri wa Nai! 3 is a decent little mini-series.  But I still found it dissapointing.  I\'ve already gone over how the story structure hurts this season,  but I think it\'s actually worse than season 1 as well.  But if season 1 had the same story structure, then why is it better?It\'s better because it\'s fresher.  In season 1 you\'re introduced to the characters,and they don\'t need to go through a lot because they\'re new.  The situations are funnier because you haven\'t seen some of them before.  And the character interactions are better, because you\'re experiencing them for the first time.  In season 2, the characters developed.  You learned more about them and that changes how you view them.  Barring a singular episode, this doesn\'t happen in season 3.  The characters are largely static.These characters have existed for two seasons already, and they\'ve grown and experienced things.  For them to suddenly have no growth for this season... is a huge letdown.Ani no Tsukeru Kusuri wa Nai! 3 had something to live up to in the form of season 2.  It had an opportunity to be as good as (if not better) than what came before it.  But it failed.  And while that doesn\'t make it bad, it certainly makes it dissapointing.  6.5/10So, would I reccomend you watch this mini-series?  Sure, it can be funny at times, and the episodes are very short.  But if you\'re a fan of the previous two seasons, than you may want to lower your expectations.  Because while season 3 is still enjoyable, it isn\'t like what came before.Hopefully they make a fourth season.  And I hope it\'s more like season 2. a lot more work went into crafting the situations and stories.  So needless to say I was expecting the third season to deliver the same quality content.

Go watch them.....seriously everyone needs to laugh at siblings  doing absolutely absurd stuff...together!!!!! together!!!!!"", ""Still as ridiculous and hilarious as the previous seasons, hahaha! Sometimes things don't need to make sense in order to enjoy watching a show~I think there isn't much character development unlike the previous season, but I'm pleased that this season did so well in developing the relationship between the main duo. It didn't put too much emphasis on the sister beating up the brother (we've already seen so much of that in season one); it even showed moments when they get along... or acting alike. Shows that no matter how different siblings appear; they can't be THAT different.What a fun ride~ Looking forward to...more seasons! more seasons!""]"
Bakuten!! Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49283/Bakuten_Movie,"[""One of the most beautiful animes, which I've ever seen. The story takes place after the series, when the boys prepare to their Interhigh competition. So, it's not a spinoff and not a recap movie. We can see scenes of the everyday life of the characters and I liked it, because I find the characters interesting, so I watched those scenes with interest as well.There are more emotional scenes, the boys are more emotional in the movie than in the anime, but I sensed their feeling. They were before a crucial decision and it was important for them to feel that there are others with...them. Some funny moments made the movie more colorful.The movie made me bigger fan of the series and Yuki Hayashi's awesome work on the music makes the movie even better. them.

It was nice to see what happened after the original series, and my favourite thing about it was getting to see a side character get more time in the spotlight- Koutarou Watari. I adored getting to see all of these sides to his character, the little hints that there's indeed a lot more behind that smile and loud personality he displays more often than anything else. I also loved seeing the bond they've all formed in action - the fact that Ryouya [Misato] called Watari out and told...him to be a proper captain or he could just give the role to someone else. I always liked Misato's levelheadedness in the series, and unsurprisingly it made its way into the film as well, where it was very much needed in times when people around him were insecure, worried, unfocused, etc.The rhythmic gymnastics scenes were, like in the series, such a delight to watch. The animation struck me from the very first scene in the first episoe and it doesn't fail to deliver and wow me even this time around. I would've liked to see the actual 'failure' of their performance at inter-high instead of them cutting it short right after Watari's moment of panic. As much as I loved that final performance, the whole anime series built up to the inter-high and so did the beginning of the film, so it felt strange that the climax of the series would be cut short like that. But nevertheless, their final surprise performance for Shuusaku was beautiful and I loved that Shiro High teamed up with Ao High for it.Overall, I really enjoyed this film and teared up at least twice. The animation was gorgeous, wacci and Centimillimental delivered fantastic songs that really encompassed the general feeling of the series in various ways, I already really liked the characters and continued doing so in this film. It's going to be sad to see the series go, because part of me wants to see Shoutarou and Ryouya in their second year, Watari continuing to be their captain in his third year, and how their new team would be together both as friends but also during practice and performances. But at the same time, I'm satisfied with this ending and that the series doesn't drag on like so many other series have done in the past.

The style matches the series style. Some of the characters were irritating to me in the film. They felt slightly out of character from the series. I was looking forward to the competition and hoping they would win since they previously lost. To have them lose twice and for almost the same reason but with a different character was a gut punch. I lost interest in the rest of the movie after that. I finished it just for the sake of finishing it but there was nothing for me to look forward to. In conclusion, I loved the series but...hated the film. I’d you also loved the series and wanted to see them win, then you should skip the film. hated the film.

It is actually based off the manga, though in my opinion the manga was way better (you even get to see a party in the beginning of the manga as well as Usagi using the Luna Pen, which she hasn't used in a long time!2. I happen to like Luna, who some may think is a nag, but at least she does care for Usagi and is actually quite useful in a lot of ways. Anyways, this is based mainly on...Luna.3. C'mon, you just gotta love the plot as well as the background music and the characters and villians too. And may i say, the artwork is gorgeous!It's about a guy named Kakeru, who dreams of going up to the moon And dreaming of a princess from the moon named Kaguya, who he is fascinated by. He is a scientist who has deep feelings for his childhood friend and partner, Himeko, who secretly loves him in return.Anyways, Luna begins to fall in love with Kakeru after saving her from getting ran over, during which she caught a cold and stuff. Anyways, Luna falls in love with Kakeru and a love triangle forms in front of them and Himeko.Meanwhile Earth is being controlled by a snow demon named Kaguya also, who wants to take revenge on Earth and stuff.It's a really good movie that is my favorite out of them all, and i recommend in buying the movie as well as watching the movie too.

I can't stand Chibi-Usa, so you can probably imagine how I feel about the Super S movie.In my opinion, the S movie stands head and shoulders above the other two in almost every way.  I'm glad that the focus is on Luna instead of Usagi.  Not that I dislike Usagi (quite the opposite), but we get plenty of her in the TV series, so it's nice to see something different....Also, they managed to fit quite a bit of stuff into a short running time without making it feel too rushed.  The story isn't the most original or innovative, but it still hits all the right notes.Speaking of hitting all the right notes, the best thing about this movie is the music!  It uses all the various musical cues to great effect, without going too over-the-top.  My favorite is the beautiful, heartbreaking theme used for Luna-- I cry when I listen to it.  The music does a great job of punctuating and enhancing every scene and without it, I don't think I would have enjoyed this movie so much.

I wasn't too sure what their connection was to the movie's villain, or what was going on between the two of them. After watching it again when I was older, I finally slowly understood it. They seemed to mix up the timeline with the past and present, and it can get easy to mix them up.Other than that, the story consists mainly of Luna, and her feelings towards...'stuck being only a cat'. I was disappointed; they didn't take this chance to explain more about both Luna and especially Artemis's past as the manga did, but overall it still was a pretty good plot even with our usual main characters not being seen as much.Art: Once again, the art is basic Sailor Moon style and there is nothing really that stands out. The ending scene is really nice to look at, especially the transformation sequence.Sound: Sound wasn't so much of a deal. Didn't have breakthrough songs, and the sounds of the Snow Dancers made my ears bleed.Character: I'm going to say it here and now. Luna's outcome at the end was the only reason I liked this movie. I cared little for the supporting characters, and the main characters were hardly present.Another good point was the outer scouts made a believable appearance in this movie with the absence of Saturn, who hadn't yet appeared in the series timeline. The movie even managed to squeeze in short moments between Sailor Moon, Tuxedo Mask and Mini Moon.Enjoyment: I liked the movie and thought it was cute to see Luna's outcome and Artemis acting adorable.

That alone isn't the reason I like this movie the most. I find this side story to be very engaging and I daresay it gives the biggest spotlight for Luna, bigger than any filler episode in the main seasons.Taking place somewhere in the middle of the Infinity arc, an ice creature seeks to turn the Earth into a frozen paradise. It is shown early...on that she intended to do this a long time ago, but a mysterious silver light from the moon prevented her from doing so. Since that silver light is nowhere to be seen, she now has a chance to take over the Earth. She travels to the planet via a comet that's said to be a part of her. On her way, a piece of the comet fell off and dropped onto the Earth's surface and she is unable to proceed with her plans until she recovers it. The comet piece is picked up by an astronomer named Kakeru who has an overactive imagination that there's a princess living on the moon. He isn't wrong if he was born in a much earlier time if you know what I mean.Next, we get to see what the main characters are up to. Usagi and her friends are doing some shopping. It's not too long until it's shown that Luna isn't feeling well, and she decides to go home alone, even though everyone suggested that Artemis should tag along with her so she can get there safely since her sickness has her barely able to stand up. She should've heeded their warning since she couldn't cross a street in time and collapsed on the middle of the road by the time the traffic light switches. Fortunately, Luna is saved by Kakeru and she is taken under his care until she recovers from her illness. During her stay at Kakeru's place, Luna developes romantic feelings for Kakeru. She wants to help him in return as little did they know, the comet piece he picked up is draining his energy. However, there is so much a cat can do for a human. Plus, Kakeru already has a love interest named Himeko, though their relationship is sort of awkward since Himeko hardly takes Kakeru's theories seriously. Meanwhile, the ice creature creates minions called Snow Dancers to attack people and search for the missing comet piece.You might've noticed I haven't said the antagonist's name this whole time. That's because Princess Snow Kaguya isn't her real name. It's the name Kakeru called her comet when he discovered it. When she heard him say it, she happily accepted the name. Either way, it's up to the Sailor Soldiers to save the Earth from Princess Snow Kaguya's invasion while Luna wishes to have a human form, so she can help Kakeru. Not only would she help him recover, she would also fulfill his dream of meeting a princess from the moon.I will say that this is by far the best movie of the entire Sailor Moon franchise. Yes, I think it's even better than the second anime adaptation of the Dream and Stars arcs. What's even more interesting is that there are two other side stories from the manga that haven't been given an anime adaptation. Well, it makes sense for the one called Parallel Sailor Moon, which is a non-canon alternate universe where Usagi and Mamoru don't become monarchs and establish Crystal Tokyo. However, I do hope that Toei Animation will one day make an adaptation for Casablanca Memory. They really did an excellent job adapting The Lover of Princess Kaguya into a 1990s anime movie, even with differences made from its manga counterpart.

She should've heeded their warning since she couldn't cross a street in time and collapsed on the middle of the road by the time the traffic light switches. Fortunately, Luna is saved by Kakeru and she is taken under his care until she recovers from her illness. During her stay at Kakeru's place, Luna developes romantic feelings for Kakeru. She wants to help him in return as little did they know, the comet piece he picked up is draining his energy. However, there is so much a cat can do for a human. Plus, Kakeru already has a love interest named Himeko, though their relationship is sort of awkward since Himeko hardly takes Kakeru's theories seriously. Meanwhile, the ice creature creates minions called Snow Dancers to attack people and search for the missing comet piece.You might've noticed I haven't said the antagonist's name this whole time. That's because Princess Snow Kaguya isn't her real name. It's the name Kakeru called her comet when he discovered it. When she heard him say it, she happily accepted the name. Either way, it's up to the Sailor Soldiers to save the Earth from Princess Snow Kaguya's invasion while Luna wishes to have a human form, so she can help Kakeru. Not only would she help him recover, she would also fulfill his dream of meeting a princess from the moon.I will say that this is by far the best movie of the entire Sailor Moon franchise. Yes, I think it's even better than the second anime adaptation of the Dream and Stars arcs. What's even more interesting is that there are two other side stories from the manga that haven't been given an anime adaptation. Well, it makes sense for the one called Parallel Sailor Moon, which is a non-canon alternate universe where Usagi and Mamoru don't become monarchs and establish Crystal Tokyo. However, I do hope that Toei Animation will one day make an adaptation for Casablanca Memory. They really did an excellent job adapting The Lover of Princess Kaguya into a 1990s anime movie, even with differences made from its manga counterpart. Since I don't see any negatives, I believe it deserves a perfect 10/10.""]"
Dakaretai Otoko 1-i ni Odosarete Imasu.

In fact, I think the short flamenco duet that was used as a teaser is 10 times better than what appears in the movie, and it wasn't great either.However, I think the shading and art style in general is a bit more polished than in the anime. And the story follows the same line that we already saw in the anime, so on that side I have no complaints.In short, it's not bad, but it could have been better. "", ""I mean, this is what it is. I can't say that, if you really liked the series, you'll like this. It revolved around a pretty weak plot that didn't have any weight behind it, so pretty much the whole thing falls flat. The animation has never really been this series' strong suit (though I do still think that the art style can be very pretty at times when landscapes are involved), and adding dancing into the mix didn't help. There was kind of an attempt at intensity by going into flashbacks for Junta, but honestly, I didn't feel like they held up without the support...of the rest of the film. The cringy interactions between the two main characters is still very present in this film, as it was in the series, and that can actually be a bit of a charming aspect of DAKAICHI, so it was for you, you'll like a decent amount of this film. I will say that the voice acting saved it a bit for me at the end because it brought a lot of emotion to a scene or two that I didn't expect to feel much for (because of the aforementioned cringe). This film did actually leave a nice taste in my mouth, if you will, because the emotion hit how it was supposed to. If I were you, dear reader who liked the series, I wouldn't bother with the movie unless you're *really* invested in Junta and Takato. of the rest of the film.

It has the exact same problematic behaviour as the first one.For anyone who has read the manga, this follows the spain arc very true to the original.

I found forced the main situation because what a coincidence that the country that the main is going to is the same as the country where Chunta grew up.

I admit that I didn't have the most positive vibes throughout the film, as I recognize the dancing scenes could have been animated better, and the plot had moments when it felt coincidental/could have been stronger. Although to be fair, the animation team is being faithful to the manga as best they can, so any criticisms of the story aren't their fault. I loved that the 13-episode anime series reduced non-consensual scenes as much as possible (manga had non-consensual moments), and I like that the film did the same.Story: The story was easy to follow. Our characters are still...very much in love with each other and are devoted to their jobs. Each job comes with new challenges and demands which they work through. There wasn't a strong relationship problem - the focus was on self-improvement. Through self-improvement, we're also able to have better relationships with our loved ones.Characters: Our characters are the same as they were from the 13-episode series and we are introduced to new faces in Spain! Junta is quarter-Spanish since his maternal grandfather is [a good-looking and charming] Spanish man. We learn more about Junta's maternal heritage through the Spain arc (including who Junta inherited his stalker side from, haha) and get a glimpse of his childhood, including his childhood best friend.There was one character in the Spain arc who I adored for being so open about his sexual preferences and being proud of who he was. This series continues to be charming when folks are so open with non-heterosexual folks without fearing the stigma of being othered.Sound: The ending theme song gave me the feels! Especially those lyrics. <3 The voice acting made simple moments so heartwarming, like the scene before the ending theme song. The scene after the ending theme song reminds us of simple domestic bliss, which was expressed well by the voice actors. You hear the anxieties and their demands and their hopes so well!Art: The colours were beautiful! I liked the way the scenery in Spain came alive. Otherwise, the art was like what we saw in the 13-episode series.Enjoyment: I enjoyed the film for what it was. I knew what the characters were like already, so it was fun to see what their next steps were in their careers and relationship. I enjoyed seeing the characters reaffirm their feelings for each other and knowing they were always there for each other.Overall: This film was not perfect as there were areas that could have been better, as I described at the beginning of my review.

D.Gray-man Hallow,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32370/DGray-man_Hallow,"['How long has it been since LA watched the original series...5 and half coming up 6 years?...you have NO idea how much LA had been waiting for this.8 years later since D.Gray Man finished and we have FINALLY gotten a continuation to one of LA\'s most nostalgic anime, so did Hallow live up to the original or did the sequel curse fall upon it???The plot say the least have some major problems with it\'s pacing, mainly it being inconsistent, however it can easily be compensated for it\'s tightly woven character development to some of our main characters, Hallow especially focuses on Yu Kanda, Allen Walker,...the Millennium Earl as well as some newer characters like Alma Karma and the short arc with Timothy. Nonetheless with all these characters moving around along with the MANY new villains\' plans and motivation can rather make this anime\'s plot feel rushed but do take it\'s time when trying to unravel character development to these characters and take it\'s time in doing so. Hallow also seemed to skip a certain portion of the anime so it can quickly move to the Timothy arc, what LA think about this, well LA didn\'t read the manga til that point so LA really didn\'t know until a character handwaved the missed plot...ehhh if it was the get to the better plotlines or wasn\'t as crucial that TMS Entertainment did leave it out for a reason, LA didn\'t mind. What Hallow also comes into light is the Order isn\'t what it seems as the good two shoes organization trying to eliminate the Akuma as it really isn\'t the entirety of the Order who are at fault, but more like two certain members *cough* Lveille you bastard hypocrite *cough* and the Alma Karma arc not only develops what evil deeds the Order did and how magnificently it backfires on them with the Third Exorcist Project but simultaneously gives Alma Karma and Kanda the development they needed (Kanda especially as he really didn\'t get much development more or less hints in the original). Finally Allen goes into the crossfire of ALL of this plot and becomes a rather unique case of a main protagonist, sure it brings into light that both the Order and the Millennium Earl might as well be both evil and yet in brings up ""who is the TRUE evil"" and this statement goes straight back to Allen as a character. Yeah the plot has pacing problems to say the least and takes more of a focus to certain characters and the rest becomes either plot devices or supporting characters, but if it character development and world building (TRUE world building) you want Hallow gives it to you.Well since the plot is interwoven by it\'s characters...LA already talked about the characters. Well there\'s one thing LA missed. LA\'s favourite character?..it has always been Lenalee Lee and always will be and she was the MAIN reason LA came to love the series in the first place, sure it doesn\'t become Lenalee Lee\'s story in Hallow, but just seeing her again was so nostalgic (new hairstyle and all...as for the new voice actor...well that a bit later).The soundtrack felt like a blast to the past, keeping the original soundtrack for the most part just under a lighter, softer tone remix. Nonetheless, having this soundtrack with that slight remix gave LA a quick approval to this soundtrack. Call it nostalgia blindness...but LA loved the soundtrack even if is a remix.In terms of voice acting, well there is actually alot to talk about this as Hallow gave us a entirely new voice cast. Allen\'s, Miranda and Kanda\'s voice actor (Ayumu Murase, Ami Koshimizu and Takuya Satou respectively) fit in to both the characters and their original counterparts, LA didn\'t really have a problem with Lavi\'s new voice actor Natsuki Hanae (though LA thought he\'s missing something), however LA had something that irked on Lenalee Lee\'s new voice actor Ai Kakuma (now LA will say that LA could actually see Ai Kakuma voicing Lenalee, heck for LA it made sense as LA thought that Ai Kakuma would be something like a spiritual successor to Shizuka Ito, however Ai Kakuma had something of a higher pitched voice but that wasn\'t LA\'s problem with Ai, it was that Lenalee lost her ""ojou-dereness"", however LA quickly grew with Ai Kakuma\'s voice acting for Lenalee, though LA just kept thinking Shizuka Ito voice her better and why Lenalee was LA\'s favourite character in the series in the first place. If there was anything Ai Kakuma could have done to properly fit into Lenalee Lee, she could have projected a bit of Isuzu Sento from Amagi Brilliant Park (for her maturity and her deadpanned ojouness) and less Hanabi Ayase from 12-sai.: Chicchana Mune no Tokimeki, Ai Kakuma thankfully got better...by the final episode, but still, SHE GOT BETTER. LA will emphasis this for the voice cast, for the most part, the new cast fit it quite well in some regards, as for Lenalee Lee\'s new voice actor, LA doesn\'t hate Ai Kakuma voicing her, she just had to adjust from being a squeaker kind-hearted character to an ojou-kind hearted character. Now onto some better news, LA quite enjoyed Millennium Earl\'s new voice actor Yutaka Aoyama who replaced Junpei Takiguchi and thought that Yutaka\'s replacement was ok in LA\'s books. Now for the best voice actor in Hallow however goes to Yui Kondou for LA, where Yui voiced Road Kamelot who replaced Ai Shimizu, same psychotic yandere and anti-villain charm she had in the original and the change of voices didn\'t change it. Wow LA talked ALOT about the voice actor section..moving on...In terms of animation, done once again by TMS Entertainment to say the best it feels really polished from the original (to be expected), the characters are alot shinier in design and the battles move more smoothly than before, also the eldritch abominations that appear in this anime (and no not JUST the Akuma), it\'s amazing what detail they put into it. The comedic moments also bring up the typical anime emoji what little comedic moments it has considering the VERY serious tone it starts and ends with. Overall, Hallow had some very decent animation across the board and LA can overlook the few rare times of animation errors.LA won\'t tell much about the ending as it still has lots of plot threads left and it just feels like that Hallow has only just touched the tip of how D.Gray Man could have turned into. There is SOO much more left and LA obviously wants another season.D.Gray Man is such a nostalgic shounen anime which LA wished and begged for another season and LA wished has been fulfilled, yeah Hallow has several flaws that it can easily be subjected to sequelitis, but for an anime sequel LA has been waiting ALMOST HALF A DECADE for, LA can overlook these flaws and see why it even exists. LA is soo happy to even see a sequel to D.Gray Man and call this nostalgia blindness (similar to LA view on the soundtrack) but LA doesn\'t care.

T~T(Oh, But I liked the old music background they put, It gave me a nostalgic feeling.)#Art & EnjoymentThe art and animation were average overall to poor at some points and jokes and funny interactions between the characters were dead even though their amount was small in this point of the original work but their presentation was bad.#OverallFor their defense MAYBE  the short limit of the 13 episodes which had to cover this arc was the reason of such POOR Performance, STILL its disappointing and heart breaking for me no matter the reason .

The new arcs in this season are very interesting but are poorly skimmed through to meet 13 episodes which I thought was poorly done as the studio did add in new scenes. However the overall story is still good and does remain true to the manga which I thought was very good.Art 7/10Art in this season has been changed from the previous to match the authors art, it's good but too inconsistent with the animations some episodes seemed poorly done...and others felt outstanding, there really was no overall standard in art and animation in this as the animation in some scenes were just poorly done and kinda ruined the experience for me.Sound 7/10OP is amazing and catchy but also quite generic.Overall the voice acting does take some adjusting to if you loved the original like me, however I did get used to them all, Miranda's new art and voice acting is pure shit and I think they screwed up here trying to match the last VAs voice acting rather than doing their own thing.Characters 9/10I really love the characters in D gray man and hallow, the reason that this isn't a 10 is simply because some of the old characters that we know and love are unessesaryly involved in this series where as in the manga they were not important at all, yet every episode we'll see Lavi and Lenalee but they're really not important at all and I think that's where the anime also screws up because this season was meant to be about Allen and Kanda.Overall 7.5/10I really did enjoy this but I also had hype for the series return and unfortunately I was disappointed in some areas and the studio really didn't seem like they were putting in their 100%, I've seen much worse anime but they at least had consistent decent animation throughout the entire cour and others felt outstanding, there really was no overall standard in art and animation in this as the animation in some scenes were just poorly done and kinda ruined the experience for me.Sound 7/10OP is amazing and catchy but also quite generic.Overall the voice acting does take some adjusting to if you loved the original like me, however I did get used to them all, Miranda's new art and voice acting is pure shit and I think they screwed up here trying to match the last VAs voice acting rather than doing their own thing.Characters 9/10I really love the characters in D gray man and hallow, the reason that this isn't a 10 is simply because some of the old characters that we know and love are unessesaryly involved in this series where as in the manga they were not important at all, yet every episode we'll see Lavi and Lenalee but they're really not important at all and I think that's where the anime also screws up because this season was meant to be about Allen and Kanda.Overall 7.5/10I really did enjoy this but I also had hype for the series return and unfortunately I was disappointed in some areas and the studio really didn't seem like they were putting in their 100%, I've seen much worse anime but they at least had consistent decent animation throughout the entire cour"", ""D Gray Man Hallow is a hard show to recommend. In one case it is a blessing to the D Gray Man fans that desired a sequel to the show following the climatic end of the last series. However, for viewers that watched the anime only it might seem as a bit of a disappointment.Story: 8/10. Prior to this shows announcement, I read the D Gray Man manga and realized that their are elements of the story that the anime series ignored or replaced with filler. I felt more attached to the story of the manga after reading it and watching the original show over,...so I have a long for the story that D Gray Man Hallow is telling (as it is one of my fav Arcs) but when removing my bias, I can see why people won't like the story of the anime. It kinda jumps all over the place in the early episodes rushing through story arcs in order to get to the main story that lasts for the majority of episodes before ending with another climatic ending (which is frustrating but understandable as there isn't enough manga material to continue on). But I don think that there is enough enjoyment for both the readers of the manga and the anime viewers to enjoy.Art: 7/10. D Gray Man has never had amazing animation, it has good animation but never stunning and expensive animation like Ufotable puts outs. It is kinda evident that the show didn't have a large budget during certain scenes early on in the show. However, the show was much more like the manga's designs than the first series was (kinda like how FT 2014 switched to designs like the manga) which was a welcome change to me (though I don't think it was the best choice). Also I do not understand why Allen's hand is suddenly red again when in season 2 of the original show it became black...ugh nitpicking.Sound 9/10. Nothing much to say here its basically the same soundtrack as the orignal show which is awesome. I do have to say that I enjoyed the opening and ending song of the show as it was the mixture of somber and action packed fights that the show possesses.Character 7/10. Again, nothing much to say. The characters other than Allen and  Kanda don't get much development. But this is likely due to the shows run time of 13 episodes compared to the 103 episodes of the original. If you liked this cast though there really isn't much of an issue, one thing I can say that I liked about this show is that I didn't have to listen to Lenalee's past again (they like repeated it 5 times in the original show, we get it she has a lot of problems with the order before her brother came).Overall, I can give this show a solid 7.8 or 8 out of 10. Its definitely not perfect and won't appeal to you much if you don't know anything about the show. Yet, its a love letter to the fans of the original and perhaps that hints there's more to come. so I have a long for the story that D Gray Man Hallow is telling (as it is one of my fav Arcs) but when removing my bias, I can see why people won't like the story of the anime.

You and your awkwardly spelled title have been haunting me since that level 4 Demon jiggled it's titties around.For those who are interested no the anime hasn't improved. Scroll lower and you'll see why.Animation.You know how old Grayman had it's nice and a bit unique art style? Well that buggered off. Greet the bland style of 2015-2016 anime for the first few episodes and a bit improved version of it after those eps. It's completely devoid of imagination and uniqueness. Fight scenes are even less interesting than before, there's barely any...energy in them. Character designs didn't change much, except for Allen who looks even more gay now. Speaking of designs there's lots of powers that look pretty uninteresting, apart from two that barely get any screen time. Oh huge blades? Haven't seen that one before! Laser beams too? Gee please stop with such drool inducing innovation Picasso. To make it worse all the interesting looking, and interesting overall, characters have been pushed aside to make space for Kanda and his fuckbuddy, two of them in fact one is Allen and another one shan't be spoiled for you. So here's a 5 and you know why? Because art still mostly sucks. Oh sorry did you expect some other non obvious conclusion? Too bad you'll only find an awkward ending to a paragraph here.Sound.I swear the creators read my mind and picked the only song that I liked in the first Grayman. It's that piano piece that Allen plays near the end of old series. Unfortunately they didn't learn that repeating a good thing makes it pretty agitating pretty fast. As for new opening I ought to recognise they did well to recap old series trough it buuut the actual sound in it is pretty lame. Here's a fiver for ya chap now leg it.Story.It continues on from past one. It's really rushed tho and every important scene has lessened impact due to that. Probably one of the most boot to the pacing moment was when baddies have a get together to count their numbers and present strategies. Now after that you'd expect them to show up after three episodes and execute their plan. Not in this anime tho! Three minutes later they are already in the midst of their master plan wrecking havoc.There is this flashback that was actually pretty interesting and added something to the upcoming fight,that being context and stakes. Quite baffling that the best part of an anime is a flashback considering those are usually shunned. I oughta acknowledge it amused me slightly in some portions so I'll give it a 5 and move on.Character.You expected characters but it was me, bad writing! Okay, okay maybe I'm overreacting let's go over the characters, at least those with any bloody time given to them, and their interactions. Allen Walker is attempted as a formal general guy in the first two minutes after which he just goes back to his usual behavior,which is being an usual shounen protagonist. Wanker is accompanied by his old companions( Kanda,Levi,Lenalee) and some fresh ones but they barely get any time in this banana poop cake so they can butt off. No I'm serious they don't even get shown during their fight scenes, at least I assume fight happened cause next cut to them showed 'em tired and battered. Kanda is still Kanda, cold and a bit mean. Lavi is a bit more cheerful than in the past which is okay, he does get the same treatment as everybody else and get's airbrushed away after five episodes or so. And Lenalee... Is back to bland female character tho I know that bitchy annoying girl is still in there and is just waiting for an opportunity to piss all over my lasagna. There's more characters,as I mentioned a few paragraphs ago,but I needn't point out my frustration with characters themselves when their interactions take the Oscar from most migraine inducing aspect of this anime. Every talk feels dry and cheesy like it was written by a dehydrated mouse. There's no emotion or reactions at the times that should provoke ones. There's some attempt at comedy that falls flat because,again, no emotion. The original had some rivalry between Kanda and Allen,their bickering being the most notable part, but here it feels arse painfully forced. Somehow a part that was implemented into so many cases that didn't fit it but still managed to work with it felt forced. Here's a 3, that number has more representation than some characters.Enjoyment.After all things I disliked about first one I still derived some enjoyment from it due to some extremely intriguing mini stories. This one I can label a grand disappointment. However despite my utter contempt for it there was a thing I enjoyed. This being the aforementioned flashback. It was something that feels like a part of the past series, which looks like God incarnate compared to this.Unfortunately after the flashback it went to a fight scene that was as lifeless as the past ones.The best I can do is 2. Besides the flashback anime is a pain for it's extremely rushed story, lifeless dialogue and characters,boring fight scenes and blargh.Conclusion.Screw this anime. Here's a 3,an average of grades should be 4 tho that'd mean I rated it decent. I recommend you stick it up your arse and die from rectal bleeding. Or if you like watching half naked hot guys jumping around with other half naked hot guys in a rain of lasers I recommend this anime greatly. It's a hot guy extravaganza. energy in them.

I loved the aesthetics, the creepy scenery, the overall dark tone, the seiyuu, the art style, the soundtrack and the pace.

I also don't like the color palette and the seiyuus that were chosen for Hallow. Why does Hallow look so cheerful and happy when it's the exact opposite?The expression were horrible too.

Most of the people watching the sequel are doing it out of nostalgia for the original. So when the creators fundamentally change the art style and character designs that were so endearing to so many fans, it's obviously going to come off as abrasive.For example, Lenalee, especially in the initial episodes, was turned into a carbon copy of every other cute anime girl. Essentially without substance, she just felt too sweet and artificial. The Lenalee from the original anime, while still excessively sweet, felt real. Her story wasn't all lollipops and rainbows and it SHOWED. It...showed through her actions and her dialogue and even simply her character design.Besides that, D.Gray-man has always had a problem with power scaling and consistency, relying more on guts and nakama power. This is partly what made the show so endearing, but it also makes it extreeeeeeeemly irritating. Akumas that wipe the floor with Point Breakers last season, now seem to be a walk in the park. On the other hand, the Noahs are even more overpowered than they ever were before.However, even with all its flaws, D.Gray-man can still intrigue the viewer and pull them into the web of mysteries once in a while. It still functions as good entertainment, and while I get irritated watching it at times,  I never had to force myself to finish.

Although tbh, even in the manga, the plot line has a number of holes already (like, wtf, as if Link could actually manage to hold off more than one Level 4 when it takes like 2 to 3 exorcists to kill one) so I wasn't really expecting much from the anime version. Although I kinda don't like the way they switched/changed some parts of the plot at the beginning.Art:...6/10Ahhhh. The most disappointing of all. I don't know what happened with this one. Is it the low budget? not enough time? or whatever?I can kind of accept the fact that the characters doesn't look exactly like Hoshino's work, but my gaaaddd at least be consistent. Most of the time, the characters are drawn off-model, and tbh, the new look for some characters (my baby Kanda!!) is kinda urgh-ish for me.As for the animation, the action scenes are ok to me. But some of the slow-paced ones not so much. And the facial expressions! Some times they don't match the emotion in their voices at all. I feel like I'm watching lame actors trying (and failing) to lip sync their lines. UrggghhhThere are also some scenes that I think could have been composed better. And there are a lot of cheat-scenes (scenes where instead of having actual animation, they just draw a single frame/illustration of the scene and then rely on camera movements/effects/shake-shake and whatever) which is quite unprofessional for me. The only excuse I can accept for this is low budget, otherwise I would think the animators are just plain lazy.The color script is good to me as well as the compositing. The backgrounds are excellent too.Sound: 9/10I have no problem with the music and sound effects. They're actually quite good. The voice actors, not so much (though that may just be my biased mind talking. Bring back Takahiro Sakurai and Kenichi Suzumuraaaa!!!).

I'm rating the characters more on how they are portrayed in the anime and not... how they actually are?Anyways, they only got 7 because I can't accept the new voices XDThey felt like different people to me. Not to mention the disappointing way they are drawn some times, but that's definitely the animators' fault :PEnjoyment: 3/10Maybe I shouldn't have expected too much. 'Cause the disappointment definitely hurt after I had my hopes soar so high.I love D.Gray-Man. I really do. But this season just killed whatever enthusiasm I have for the series' anime adaptations (current and possible sequels).Ahhhh... And most of it is centered on Kanda's background too, which I've been looking forward to since forever. Which makes it more disappointing since I expected so much.Overall, this season is something I can't be proud of. It doesn't matter that I've waited for a lifetime for the anime to finally be resumed. If I had known it would turn out like this, I wouldn't mind waiting for another ten lifetimes. At least maybe THEN the animators would have finally gotten enough practice and produced something better.

Then yes.- did you watch D.gray-man the anime a few years ago and stopped there? Then no.This is a very hard anime to recommend, because it\'s very hard to understand who this anime was made for. Unless you are a die-hard fan...I can\'t in good conscience recommend this show (I cried when the show was announced).Story: the story picks up form where the original ended skipping some content form the manga. I\'m okay with this because they clearly want to animate the entire Alma Karma saga and the only way to do that within a 13ep run is by cutting a lot of content.Even if you are up to date with the manga, it is really hard to get a grip about what is happening, the story is moving way to fast and anyone who just saw the original a few years back will be lost on what\'s happening and you will wonder who most of the characters are.The story itself is great, but the way it is presented leaves a lot to be desired.Art: ...it\'s bad. Now D.gray-man was never a really good animated show, but it had a decent art style. It\'s clear that the budget for this show is very small and you can tell, from the backgrounds to the characters. The art style is actually worse in my opinion, while the animation remains somewhere bellow average. There are some good moments when the animation shines, but overall the art and animation are ""MEDIOCRE"".Characters: there the best thing about this show. For me the characters were always the best part about the original and that carries on to Hallow BUT unless you creamed you pants when you saw the poster, they are very and I mean very BAD. Because the show is moving way to fast, the characters don\'t really have time to shine or to interact with each other like they did back in the days. Yes they are the same characters you loved (or not), but their presentation is lack luster.Sound: same old good music, same old good sound effect....yaaa will all now where this is going. So they changed the voice actors for most of the characters (who knows what\'s the reason) and while we can accept it and move forward, let\'s be honest we can\'t. That doesn\'t mean the actors are bad, ow no they are quite great and they do a damn good job on bringing the characters to life, but they\'re not the same. The problem is that if you are a ""veteran"" this will eat at you the entire season and if you are not then why are you watching this.Overall: Now I will continue to watch the rest of the season, but I am a die-hard fan. If you have never saw D.gray-man this is not a good place to start. Now my advice to anyone thinking of picking this show up is to go back and watch the original in DUB and pray to the gods that when Funimation brings out the dub they will manage to get the original actors (I\'ll prob rewatch it myself in dub).This brings me back to what I originally said: Who is this show for?We know why it is airing and that is to bring more light to the manga as it has a new serialization, but the show clearly had a really low budget.Ultimately this is a very average show, BUT for a D.gray-man fan this is the best thing since sliced bread.Post Completion:How people manage to watch seasonal anime is beyond meOkay so I just finished the show and boy was it glorious.I stand by what i initially said, but I should mention the fact that I didn\'t give the music enough credit. It truly is amazing, yes it is almost the same as the original, but even by today\'s standards this show has some of the best soundtracks available.Now the animation really does not get any better although one thing that I got used to is the voice acting (not that it matters because we won\'t have a second season).A few things about the story, yes it was almost unbearable for anyone who was not up to date with the manga, but I did forget to add that this is partly to do with the Hoshono\'s health problems at the time of writing D.gray-man while forcing herself to put out new chapters and also some problems with the licensing of the manga. While I understand if you will not forgive this for D. Gray-man Hollow very ""confusing and  messy"" story I do still hope you understand the reason behind it.Overall this still is my favorite anime of 2016 (it became my favorite when it was announced), but this is not a show for everybody, it is mostly for us fans and as well as bringing some much needed love to the manga.I truly doubt there will be another season any time soon as there is not enough content, and the more they wait the more people will start caring less. I am really happy that this show was made and I look forward the the new D.gray-man chapter 224 that will come out in october.#hoshinokatsuraiszabest I can\'t in good conscience recommend this show (I cried when the show was announced).Story: the story picks up form where the original ended skipping some content form the manga. I\'m okay with this because they clearly want to animate the entire Alma Karma saga and the only way to do that within a 13ep run is by cutting a lot of content.Even if you are up to date with the manga, it is really hard to get a grip about what is happening, the story is moving way to fast and anyone who just saw the original a few years back will be lost on what\'s happening and you will wonder who most of the characters are.The story itself is great, but the way it is presented leaves a lot to be desired.Art: ...it\'s bad. Now D.gray-man was never a really good animated show, but it had a decent art style. It\'s clear that the budget for this show is very small and you can tell, from the backgrounds to the characters. The art style is actually worse in my opinion, while the animation remains somewhere bellow average. There are some good moments when the animation shines, but overall the art and animation are ""MEDIOCRE"".Characters: there the best thing about this show. For me the characters were always the best part about the original and that carries on to Hallow BUT unless you creamed you pants when you saw the poster, they are very and I mean very BAD. Because the show is moving way to fast, the characters don\'t really have time to shine or to interact with each other like they did back in the days. Yes they are the same characters you loved (or not), but their presentation is lack luster.Sound: same old good music, same old good sound effect....yaaa will all now where this is going. So they changed the voice actors for most of the characters (who knows what\'s the reason) and while we can accept it and move forward, let\'s be honest we can\'t. That doesn\'t mean the actors are bad, ow no they are quite great and they do a damn good job on bringing the characters to life, but they\'re not the same. The problem is that if you are a ""veteran"" this will eat at you the entire season and if you are not then why are you watching this.Overall: Now I will continue to watch the rest of the season, but I am a die-hard fan. If you have never saw D.gray-man this is not a good place to start.

I am really happy that this show was made and I look forward the the new D.gray-man chapter 224 that will come out in october.#hoshinokatsuraiszabest', ""Ten years ago, there was this lovely little anime called D.Gray-Man, the series ran for about two years before it ended. Rather than take the route of making it's own ending that alters points from the manga as some animes of the past have done, it instead ended on a rather cliffhanging moment which begged to have a sequel. At the end of D.Gray-Man (2006-2008) we had the Exorcists defeat the Level 4 Akuma, but even with that victory under their belt much was left to be desired. The Millennium Earl was still running amok, almost all the Noah were shown to be alive and...well, meanwhile the Black Order had taken a devastating blow, losing many of the exorcists and scientists working alongside them. Now, presently, we have D.Gray-Man Hallow, which starts approximately where the previous anime ended and continues following the manga so we can finally see what happened to our heroes.Story: 7The first four or so episodes of this were not to my liking. Almost entirely because the series was so rushed. There's a few small arcs within the story in the first couple episodes and there were so many details cut out I was beginning to believe that the entire show would be this cut and quick. I got the impression that the showrunners wanted to power through the arcs leading up to the main Alma Karma arc, and it shows. Characters and plot points prior to Alma were practically tossed to the side. And while the Alma arc was truly a great arc with many incredibly interesting plot twists and character developments, the events leading up to it are no less important. Characters such as Timothy were, in my opinion, just tossed aside as minor details in the anime when in reality they had an entire arc dedicated to their development with (most likely) the intention of being more important later on. These first few episodes are, without a doubt, the weak link of the entire show.However, as the series progresses and we find ourselves in the main arc of the series, that is when things became much more intriguing for me. As I said before, the Alma Karma arc is really packed full of information and the show begins to take it's time and savor the moments within this arc. Alma himself is a bit of a spoiler, so there is little I can say about him without revealing important details, but it is an arc that many fans were looking forward to since it directly ties into Kanda Yu's backstory, a tale which had not been told in the 2006 D.Gray-Man series. All of the other main characters, such as Lenalee and Lavi, had their backstories told in order to give the audience a better understanding of them as characters. Kanda was given no such luxury, until now at least. His childhood is without a doubt one of the most interesting, and it was a treat to see it animated even a decade after the original series aired.Art: 7Another notable point that needs to be discussed is the art. Since it is 8 years after D.Gray-Man, there is a bit of difference in the art. Not just a bit, actually... a huge difference. There are times when I found myself loving the art and times I just kind of “ehh??” The art is /much/ more vibrant and colourful than the original, bordering on a pastel colour scheme. It is truly up to the watcher whether this is a positive or negative. Certain battles between characters really stood out to me, notably during the Alma arc, and I can appreciate the show for making the style quite a contrast from the original. However, there are also times when a more subtle and even more 'dull' appearance would have worked in the show's favor. During the more somber and mournful moments, I almost would have preferred the 2006 art style when the art was /literally/ darker. This isn't to say that the art is bad, not at all, it's just a matter of preference.Sound: 7 / 8There was an entire new cast of voices brought in for the series. At first I was hesitant because I'm the kind of person who doesn't like change. But very quickly the talent of the new voice actors came through and brought the characters to life beautifully. There was some incredible raw power and emotion coming through the screen; evidently the voice actors gave it their all and I couldn't ask for more.Interestingly enough, there were several songs in the series that were the same (though mildly different) from the original. Perhaps it was my imagination, but there were multiple times I thought “hey I know that song” but remade and updated to fit the new series. A small detail that I thought was clever since it shows that there are ties to the original more than just using the same characters.Character: 5Kanda, Alma, and Allen are all given very interesting story arcs in this series. Unfortunately, I felt that there were several other characters who deserved just as much attention but their stories were cut for some reason. Characters such as Link and the 3rd Exorcists had some history that we got a sneak peak into but deserved to have more time put into establishing them as more than just background noise. Same goes for Timothy, a new exorcist introduced very early in Hallow. His entire story was cut tremendously so that only a few episodes were dedicated to it when in reality I believe he deserved more screentime.Simultaneously, the introduction of several new Noah's felt a bit messy at times. Very little time was given toward introducing them; however this is not necessarily the fault of the show as much as it is the fault of the manga; I can only assume that more information about them will be given later on in the story but for this series, many of them were only given 1 line at the most. My hope is that more time will be given to the minor characters in the future, because in this series it was lacking on the 'character' front.Enjoyment: 8As I said before, once the Alma arc hit things started to look up. I found myself much more engaged in what was happening on screen. Allen's development and conflict with the Fourteenth, as well as the tension that builds within the Black Order kept me on the edge of my seat. The stakes are higher than they have ever been. So many things that we had hoped to see 10 years ago in D.Gray-Man are finally happening; all the characters we know and love make appearances and give us a satisfying yet short arc to tide us over until the new season comes out (whenever that may be). I certainly think that returning fans will find enjoyment in this new season despite its differences to the original.Overall: 7The series has some problems, I think the pacing could have been better and there are times the art felt like a bit too much, but it is a great ride. I enjoyed watching it, I enjoyed seeing these characters again after so many years and I can only hope that we will get another season in the near future that follows the manga's storyline in the way this one has. If you like D.Gray-Man, I'd say check this season out. well, meanwhile the Black Order had taken a devastating blow, losing many of the exorcists and scientists working alongside them.

And because Allen broke Lenalee's heart. <- (Only spoiler I will write. Also, that's just my opinion. )I couldn't wait for D Gray-Man to get a continuation after I finished the anime, which was 3 years ago. I kept checking in every few months. And then all of a sudden it is announced?! And you know what, It was amazing! And now, I can't wait for DGMH season 2!If you loved the first one, then you'll love this one. Episode 1 is kinda dry, as...it doesn't pick up immediately after episode 103, but it is still worth your time. Trust me! it doesn't pick up immediately after episode 103, but it is still worth your time. Trust me!"", ""I am a hard core D.Gray-man fan so I feel I can honestly say this a mixed bag.First off the Japanese cast, has perfect replacements for the original cast, Yutaka Aoyama is wonderful as the Earl and a perfect replacement forJunpei he takes a bit to get used to however, and Ayumu murase is a good Allen also Nobuo Tobita is just how I wanted Cyril to sound so yeah that's good.Then theirs the dub it's kinda bad, the English earl is horrible like he was in the original his voice does not fit the earl and it sounds demon like and he can't emote...at all, Cyril can not emote ether and Zu Mei Chang sounds annoys every time he talks, every one else is good so I will leave it at that.No spoilers or anything but I will mention there is a little reference to a plot point in the manga in the voice cast I won't say what but since they won't be going that far it's a nice touchThe art is mixed, the redesigns are mostly good for instant the earl looks good but the animation is poor at times also why are the akuma mostly red now?, the color is a little to much, but the design do look more like how the manga art is now so that's good.On a side note the soundtrack is beautiful it's mostly rerecorded stuff but there are some great stand out stuff, the new version of tsunaida te ni Kiss wo is the best.Unlike the original anime there is not to much filler but there is some, also I suppose to compress it down to 13 episodes they cut a lot of stuff out but it does not suffer for the lost scenes unlike the original, also with no spoilers I will say the ending is a little rushed.So over all it's a good adaptation of the manga but it's a little off at times only recommend for those who watch the original first, but for a 8 year wait it's a fun ride, but stick to the Japanese version for the a fulfilling watch. at all, Cyril can not emote ether and Zu Mei Chang sounds annoys every time he talks, every one else is good so I will leave it at that.No spoilers or anything but I will mention there is a little reference to a plot point in the manga in the voice cast I won't say what but since they won't be going that far it's a nice touchThe art is mixed, the redesigns are mostly good for instant the earl looks good but the animation is poor at times also why are the akuma mostly red now?, the color is a little to much, but the design do look more like how the manga art is now so that's good.On a side note the soundtrack is beautiful it's mostly rerecorded stuff but there are some great stand out stuff, the new version of tsunaida te ni Kiss wo is the best.Unlike the original anime there is not to much filler but there is some, also I suppose to compress it down to 13 episodes they cut a lot of stuff out but it does not suffer for the lost scenes unlike the original, also with no spoilers I will say the ending is a little rushed.So over all it's a good adaptation of the manga but it's a little off at times only recommend for those who watch the original first, but for a 8 year wait it's a fun ride, but stick to the Japanese version for the a fulfilling watch."", ""Okay so lets begin this.Phew.....here we go. Honestly I have mixed feelings about this. I was super exited when I heard D gray man was returning as it was one of my favorite anime's/manga so I think maybe my hopes were just too high. At the same Time I feel like I'm still just glad that it came back and with improved animation quality and seeing one of my favorite main characters Allen walker back in action. That being said I give Hallow a 7/10 rating because I feel that the skipping of arcs left me confused and out of the loop since I did...not read the manga. And on top of that the pacing seemed bad like it was rushing through the story. Not to mention the unnecessary model change for lenalee. if it wasn't for that it would have gotten a solid 9.

Like my other review about Mahou Sensou; it has a good story line compelling but not well done.

I found myself trying to watch every new episode, it was unfulfilling with the amount...of hype i felt for the project it left many of us fans disappointed.

I should confess I feel empty, I feel frustrated that I don't know or don't have any further information on what is going to be on of this marvellous history... I have post-anime depression after been absent in me for a long long time. Here are some thoughts:D.Gray-man Hallow is the sequel of the 2008 anime D.Gray-Man. So the first thing that should be taken into account is that this anime, Hallow, in order to have a maximum enjoyment and understanding, it should be seen immediately...after the 2008 series. If not, it would absolutely have no sense.The history continues exactly where the 2008 version was left, with the main character struggling to understand his condition and position in the Black Order that combats the Millenium Earl and the Noahs in the task of reinventing the world. The story, again, can be seen as a trivial approximation of any shonen anime by which the hero opposes any evil in the name of justice. This is what makes Hallow interesting: it diverges from this stereotypical view and enters into a more confronting story in which at the end we don't have any good and bad guys, but rather individuals who go from one side to another.The history, like in D.Gray-man, is marvellous. And in Hallow the good thing to see is that the original history is further developed for a more matured audience.  And the strongest point of this history relies on its characters.In Hallow, we see mostly the same characters as in D.Gray-man, with the difference that this time we will get the focus on other secondary important characters that on the first season weren't of that relevance. The biggest example of this is Kanda, but with other examples such as Mana and Link. The success relies on the fact that the initial essence of all main characters of the first series remained intact. Furthermore, we see a deeper development of Allen as a character and we get even closer to other facets of the antagonists like the Millenium Earl, Road and Tiki Mikki.In terms of art and sound, the series is well developed. Although I missed the emotional openings of the first season, the opening was pretty decent and the ending was outstanding.In general, I see Hallow as an outstanding continuation of the first season that successfully condensed in 13 episodes a marvellous amount of epicness and emotionality. Hallow's audience is, on the other hand, more mature than the audience of D.Gray-man due to the increase of violence and strong moral issues treated. I should definitely praise the Kanda's History arc... without any spoilers, the development of Kanda as a character and its history is just: beautiful, perfect. One of the most charming histories I have seen in anime.Hallow may not be up to the level of its predecessor as probably the most brilliant shonen anime that I have seen. However, it is the product of an arduous work to continue such an amazing history and it by far deserves a place in the hearts of D.Gray-Man fans. Do not hesitate to see it.Here it finishes one of the most intriguing histories I have seen in anime and I cannot wait to see what it will bring after. after the 2008 series.

Although I missed the emotional openings of the first season, the opening was pretty decent and the ending was outstanding.In general, I see Hallow as an outstanding continuation of the first season that successfully condensed in 13 episodes a marvellous amount of epicness and emotionality. Hallow's audience is, on the other hand, more mature than the audience of D.Gray-man due to the increase of violence and strong moral issues treated. I should definitely praise the Kanda's History arc... without any spoilers, the development of Kanda as a character and its history is just: beautiful, perfect. One of the most charming histories I have seen in anime.Hallow may not be up to the level of its predecessor as probably the most brilliant shonen anime that I have seen. However, it is the product of an arduous work to continue such an amazing history and it by far deserves a place in the hearts of D.Gray-Man fans. Do not hesitate to see it.Here it finishes one of the most intriguing histories I have seen in anime and I cannot wait to see what it will bring after."", 'D.Grey-man Hallow – SS Overview(Short and Salty Overview)Hallow be thy Name. If D.Grey-man ever got a new video game, that is what it should be called. D.Grey-man: Hallow by thy Name for PS4 & PC (sorry I’m a PC man myself).I read the manga and have watched the previous anime, its good typical shonen goodness. This is a simple overview I will not give any plot points or basic synopsis only my opinion on it. D.Grey-man has a few shortcomings but on the whole it’s a good series, too be brutally honest I wasn’t really expecting a new anime considering. The manga has quite a...few hiatuses due to the mangaka’s health but fair play to her for continuing the work regardless and I wish her all the best.How is this series compared to the original 103 episodes, not too bad, it covered a lot of ground (in other words a lot of chapters) in the 13 episodes but unfortunately due to this the pace was incredibly fast and felt rushed. Animation was good; I was actually surprised at how far it went into the manga leaving a small gap between the last episode of Hallow and the current manga chapter. Even though the pace is fast it’s still good, but I would recommend watching the first series as this is an continuation.D.Grey-man Hallow – 7/10 Not as good as the original series but still pretty good. few hiatuses due to the mangaka’s health but fair play to her for continuing the work regardless and I wish her all the best.How is this series compared to the original 103 episodes, not too bad, it covered a lot of ground (in other words a lot of chapters) in the 13 episodes but unfortunately due to this the pace was incredibly fast and felt rushed.

the manga itself is fantastic, it shows how katsura has one of the best drawings in an manga of action ever, the girl deserve all the praise, also if you plan to watch the previous series, make sure to find a list of all the fillers to avoid you know boredom and go straight to where it matters. and have the risk of going downhill like naruto did.It was also shameful this wasn't on many top 10 animes from 2016 lists, this series is seriously underrated, it's also sad that it is taking so long for chapters to come out again for the manga.That aside, like i said earlier, the story and characters is the biggest driving force on d-gray man hallow, and a bit of atmosphere, it is filled with great main characters and villains, so much my favorite villains in anime/manga earl of the millenium is back even more twisted and if you readed the manga you know the kind of sad backstory behind it and even more noahs were revealed, giving space to Sheril and Nea who is starting to show up.The season sort of skips/ignore a few things on the manga, but nothing to drastic, mainly the sort of filler arc it had before this, it tries to be quick and precise avoiding any sort of unnecessary moments which works for the most part, so much it only has 12 episodes since there isn't enough content on the manga to go beyond the point this season ended.D-gray man has what many shounens lack sometimes which is depth and true character motivations, not some excuse to motivation, i always wanted to see more female characters like lenalee who may not be so freaking strong but at least has presence and you always remember her, her character puts sakura for example to shame, unfortunately she doesn't have much space in this season, same applies to lavi which is almost forgotten here, but to compensate that Kanda and Allen which often battle as the most popular character in the series are the star here and their chemistry work well and you feel the pain and everything that is happening hereI think the few weak spots is the animation and the soundtrack, the opening and ending credits may grow in you after some time, but not so much as the soundtrack that plays during the anime itself, the animation is visible different from the previous series, this one is more light and more colorful in contrast of the previous Gothic and more dark style of animation which worked well, the new one is also made in a way to reflect the change in drawings after the time skip in the manga, which makes sense, could be better but still acceptable, nothing to cause anger.If you're a fan of the series like me who got really sad because of the hiatus due to all the health problems katsura hoshino went through, especially if you care about the author like me, you will like this season really quick, especially for the story, the character designs and characters themselves who are in perhaps even tougher situations, although some of them have almost no space on this season, for rather understandable reasonsIf  you never heard of d-gray man, you should give a try, it's a heck of great series that is strangely underrated, it does more success in europe for some reason, maybe the setting?

Gray-man Hallow.I do not quite know how to start. Since I\'m an unconditional fan of the original work, which includes the first anime and obviously the manga, I might be a little taken up by the emotion.I cried when I received the news that the anime would have a sequel. D. Gray-man was a part of my life, and I have wonderful memories of coming home from school and running around looking for my DVDs to marathon with my sister.I knew that after ten years, a lot of things would change. I...also knew that, like the 2006 anime, the story would be incomplete. Even so, for a fan desperate for new material from the work he loves, that was a wonderful gift, right?Okay, the first episode started, and I, like an idiot, cried when I heard ""innocence, hatsudou"" after so long, and when I saw again the characters I love so much. It was indescribable. Then the emotion diminished and I was able to see clearly.First: The animation. Wow! I really expected more commitment to the work of Hoshino-sensei ... The animation is much inferior to the first anime, and although it is following the current features of the manga, it is something poor and disappointing. They could have done more.Second: The voice actors. Oh boy, What have they done to Lenalee? She had such a perfect voice in season one, combining her sweetness with her determination. Now she\'s just another generic kawaii girl. They simply destroyed her personality in that voice.The rest ... Well, I do not have much to comment on. As an old fan, I missed the old voices simply because I was used to the previous ones. They do not look like the same characters I met 8 years ago, but that does not mean that the voice actors did a bad job. Quite the opposite.About the story ... Well, it\'s based on the manga, but it seems to be running too much. What was that Timothy arc? People who have never read the manga simply have no way to feel affection for him or create some kind of feeling simply because he was not developed.Unlike other exorcists who were introduced to the first anime and had an entire arc dedicated to them, for the public to sympathize with them, such as Miranda Lotto, Arystar Krory or Chaozii Han, poor Timothy was not so lucky.I know the goal was to focus this season on the arc of Alma Karma, but the speed of all other events was a bit ... Anyway.The soundtrack is nostalgic and I was thrilled to hear the so classic music of when exorcists activate innocence.On the first episodes I was like ""Wow, this new opening is just one of the many generic anime openings now,"" but I changed my mind, because in the last episodes I was all happy singing together. Even so I do not think it\'s as ""Innocent Sorrow"", ""Doubt & Trust"" or ""Gekidou"". D. Gray-man has always had wonderful openings. sighsThen that\'s it. After all, it was a wonderful gift to see my computer screen running a new episode of my favorite series forever.I find it difficult for someone who is not a real fan to like HALLOW. Unless you follow the manga faithfully and know the previous season of the anime, I do not recommend it, because you will get lost in the hasty plot.Even though I find it difficult to have a third season, I\'m happy with HALLOW. I hope Hoshino-sensei will give us more and more to this wonderful story.And I hope the Jasdevi twins get more space !!

I'm not going to rush this review, but I'd like to keep it shorter than some of the other extremely long ones that I'm tired of reading.Story: 8The story is pretty good, as it accurately reflects part of the manga that make it such a masterpiece. But, I'm sad to say that the animation studio for Hallow has cut out some of the best parts of the manga that make it the beautiful and moving story it is. I would have...given it a 7/10 for it's mediocre job of imitating the manga, but I just couldn't underneath respect for the manga.Art: 8The art is definitely a step much higher from the original D.Gray Man anime, as they have changed the art style to match the one in the manga. I think this was a really good choice, as my mind was blown to see Hallow with such a nice change of art styles. But they do make it inconsistent at some spots, which I understand as the studio couldn't have had much funds for Hallow. Still, I'd give it a 8 for the delightful change of art styles, even though the inconsistencies kind of threw me off at times.Sound: 9Pretty good- much better than the sound track used in the original anime. In all reality, I loved it the original's sound track, but it was used quite a lot of times- so the newer refresh of sound tracks was quite nice I also think the sound was moving and really helped set the tone of the anime to reach a place that was as far as it could to the manga. The OP was very good and refreshing too.Character: 10Hallow just didn't have the same quiet sadness and internal remorse that we feel for the manga, but every character's subtle yet definite development set this score extremely high. The characters, particularly Allen and Kanda, slowly unraveled themselves and made you really feel for them. Especially the Alma Karma arc, where his art was stunning and made my heart throb in ache.Enjoyment: 9The inconsistent art ruined it at times for me, but besides that I enjoyed it immensely- seeing the anime version of the masterpiece of the manga.Overall: 9Very good anime! Definitely should watch it! given it a 7/10 for it's mediocre job of imitating the manga, but I just couldn't underneath respect for the manga.Art: 8The art is definitely a step much higher from the original D.Gray Man anime, as they have changed the art style to match the one in the manga.

This does follow the manga closely and have an interesting story to follow. However, the pacing of the story is rushed in the middle portion of the season. You may need a few minutes to pause and sort out what happened so far in the plot.In my opinion the opening of the season was pretty good. The song was upbeat and helped prepare you for the fights in the season. But the look and sound did feel like your ""typical"" shonen anime...opening: upbeat rock sound, flashing through all the characters and that clash with the lead protagonist and antagonist at the end of the opening. opening: upbeat rock sound, flashing through all the characters and that clash with the lead protagonist and antagonist at the end of the opening.', ""Unfortunately, D. Gray-man Hallow fails to live up to the expectations of an established fanbase from its previous series as a looked up to sequel.I've been with D. Gray-man for years and was thrilled when I found the mangaka was healthy enough to continue the series (after 4 years of hiatus!) and find that it was getting a sequel anime adaption. And that's how this was for many of the fanbase. Therefore, if you are probably not as dedicated then this might not seem as bad, although you will still need to either read the manga or watch the previous series to comprehend what happens...in this one.STORY: 8The anime continues off where it left previously and follows the manga pretty faithfully throughout. Although it is a little regretful that some chapters were skipped which included adapting to their new headquarters setting and were most definitely fun and entertaining chapters (possible spoileers? think zombies lol).ART: 8Most might find the redesigned characters to be a little off putting but the mangaka herself has redrawn them quite beautifully in the manga, sadly this translates a little off in the anime. My biggest peeve is with Miranda, who now looks like some minor background character without any of her unusual charms. That being said the animation overall is consistent visually although there are definitely notable drops at times.SOUND: 6The biggest issue with this series, a completely new cast of Seiyuus. I did try my best to accept and adjust to this change but for the most part I was thoroughly disappointed with these choices and direction. My biggest problem was with Lenalee, who now sounds so jarringly high pitched (and completely ruins her previous image) and now becomes an excessively sweet generic girl that just seems so forced and fake. That, and in the casting of Ayumu Murase for Allen. As he plays Hinata in Haikyuu!, the vocal tone sounds so similar that Ayumu struggles to create a clear distinction from this character.Of worthy note, the bgm definitely is D Gray-man thankfully.CHARACTER: 7Kind of hard to rate because of the Seiyuus mostly, they really have a hard time selling and embracing their characters as they were established previously. Though this arc definitely moves in to focus around and develop Kanda particularly, although I'm not sure the presentation was the absolute best. Ugh.*SPOILER* I was also really pissed that they showed their fully designed past appearances in the memories because that chick really just looks like Saber, wtf. Loses all of the dreamy romantic nuances and atmosphere. *END SPOILER*ENJOYMENT: 6Harshly put, I had to struggle to enjoy this and am still contemplating on finishing the last bits. For such a dedicated fanbase that's supported the series for years, even in the dark, it's extremely disappointing.OVERALL: 7Without the huge bias of my personal enjoyment, this anime was rather decent in fulfilling its basic requirements as an anime adaption.

I couldn\'t wait to see my favourite characters Allen Walker, Kanda Yu and all their other exorcist pals donning their cool black suits and fighting Akuma again. D.gray-man was my ""gateway anime"", in other words the anime that introduced me to the wonderful world of anime and Jpop. Hence, I must say I had very high expectations for the sequel.Story: 6 At 13 episodes, Hallow is a very short anime, compared to it\'s predecessor\'s whopping 103 episodes. It covers several arcs in the manga,...namely the Timothy/Phantom Thief G arc, Alma Karma arc and also the Seed of Destruction arc. Trying to squeeze so much content into so little episodes was fatal to the pacing of the show. Watching D.gray-Man Hallow as a long-time fan, I could understand what was happening, but I feel that newcomers to the show may struggle to do so. I was also disappointed by the execution of the Alma Karma arc. Kanda\'s dark past as being one of the experiments in the second exorcist Project deals with very dark and mature themes like ethics of scientific experimentation, torture, loss and grief etc, and it is during this arc where we see how broken Kanda is. Having to dice up your best friend and witness the bloody massacre of an entire crew of scientists is horrifying but I could not feel the full emotional impact. This was because the entire flashback was crammed into 1-2 episodes, making it hard for the scriptwriters to flesh it out properly.Art: 5  I am actually okay with the new character designs/art style since it was probably meant to follow that of the manga\'s current style. In fact, some characters look even better. I like how Kanda and Lavi look 10x more manlier than before. However, the color scheme was too BRIGHT. Hallow should have followed the darker color scheme of the original anime. This bright, shiny color scheme made Hallow lose some of the gritty, gothic-y atmosphere and more like a typical shounen anime. The biggest holdup for Hallow was it\'s animation. Gosh, there were some moments in Hallow where I cringed from seeing the poor animation. Some action scenes looked really bad (esp when the Noah invaded the Order).  And in other scenes, background characters looked like balls smushed together. And ALL THAT PINK. LIKE WHYYYYSound: 7.  I adore the Openings of original DGM and this  new opening did not cut it for me. It felt like any Opening from Naruto or maybe Black Clover idk. Ending was okay. Background music was good. Playing Lala\'s lullaby during Kanda and Almas last moments in the place where Lala died brought me to tears. Voice acting was great. All the voice actors did a commendable job at bringing their characters to life. I looooved Ayumu Murase as Allen and Takuya Sato as Kanda (maybe even more than their previous VAs?) But Road\'s VA was a little too high pitched for me.All in all, I give DGM Hallow a 7/10. Despite all it\'s flaws, I found myself enjoying the show. I found myself chugging through all 13 episodes in no time.  Perhaps if TMS Entertainment had funnelled more money into this show, changed the color scheme and increased the no of episodes, it would be a better show. namely the Timothy/Phantom Thief G arc, Alma Karma arc and also the Seed of Destruction arc.

In the beginning, it kinda took its time to set the season, but then it started falling off halfway because the pacing got really fast and then things started happening for the sake of moving the plot, then more characters got introduced and there are a lot more people involved now, the stakes are high which is pretty lit. One thing that is still here that made me annoy the fuck...out of me during season one was the comedy, again it\'s okay if you do it when it\'s just the characters bantering and shit, but it annoys me when you do it during serious scenes, if else, then i can\'t take the story seriously. Then we had some plot twists happening which i really liked, that kinda got me interested in the story.I really like the animation for this season, by like, i mean a lot, because there\'s a big step up in the animation, i mean this is years after season 1 was made and the technology for animating became a lot better, so wouldn\'t be weird if the animation was still the same as season 1? There\'s a slight difference in the character designs as well, i almost couldn\'t recognize lenalee because her design looks so much different than season 1. We got new types of monsters too.In the beginning, i didn\'t really notice it until Bookman spoke and i was like ""Wait... that\'s not your VA, that\'s jiraiya\'s VA"" and then it suddenly unveiled the curtain for other characters and i started hearing the differences in their voices and i was like ""Oh wait! New voice actors!?!?"" but props to some of them because they kinda sound similar, so it wasn\'t really off putting that much.Overall, this season was okay for me, because it\'s a full pack of action and twists and turns, but with just a bad pacing. I\'m just happy because this is the tone and vibe that I was looking for in season 1. out of me during season one was the comedy, again it\'s okay if you do it when it\'s just the characters bantering and shit, but it annoys me when you do it during serious scenes, if else, then i can\'t take the story seriously.

New voice actors!?!?"" but props to some of them because they kinda sound similar, so it wasn\'t really off putting that much.Overall, this season was okay for me, because it\'s a full pack of action and twists and turns, but with just a bad pacing. I\'m just happy because this is the tone and vibe that I was looking for in season 1.', ""And here I thought that the second season would be better. Nope, dead wrong.This second season is just a pain to watch. The pacing is too rushed, and oh boy this is one of the worst pacing that I have ever known in my life of watching anime. Character development? who cares about that, let's just throw all of the plot from the manga to let people know more about it and let it end absurdly.to summarize what this season is, they basically squeeze a bunch of plot from the manga (although I don't read it) into a 13 episode long anime. There's just so...much happening in an episode that I had to close it and watch the previous episode to see if I missed anything, and that happened in almost every episode.I give it a 6 just because they stay true to the manga and I know that they probably are trying to promote it, but I guess it backfired due to the poorly executed anime which leads us to a no more anime sequel of this series. much happening in an episode that I had to close it and watch the previous episode to see if I missed anything, and that happened in almost every episode.I give it a 6 just because they stay true to the manga and I know that they probably are trying to promote it, but I guess it backfired due to the poorly executed anime which leads us to a no more anime sequel of this series.""]"
Hakuouki Movie 2: Shikon Soukyuu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13119/Hakuouki_Movie_2__Shikon_Soukyuu,"['The second movie of Hakuouki gives us now the conclusion of this 2-part movie, with a new story, different from the TV series one.The movie already starts in the middle of a battle, with a little time-skip from the last scene of the first movie. We started discovering stuff about the furies, and then the focus goes back to the Shinsengumi, which from what we can see from the beginning of the movie, it\'s already in crisis, in its declining phase.Here in this movie we have two main focuses: the conclusion of the war, leaded by the main guys of the Shinsengumi, and...the Chizuru\'s story, which is a mix of the onis and furies story with her own love story.As the movie goes, we\'re shown lots of battles – epic battles I must say –, all focused on the Shinsengumi guys, they\'re a mix of sadness, pride and what I think the movie expressed very well, the way of the samurai. So this movie diverges from the first one in these battles; the first movie was more focused in introducing characters and preparing the story, and the second one finished showing more the feelings of the characters and their personalities, together with the whole plot, which in the beginning seems that would take a tragic ending, but end up taking an interesting romantic way.STORYAs I said above in the brief summary of this review, the story is very much focused in the decline of the Shinsengumi forces in the war. The characters are all already in the limit but they keep fighting for what they believe, and again, it\'s shown in many ways during the movie how they respect and follow the way of the samurai – some in pure way of the concept, and others in the way they believe is right –. Chizuru again also have an important role in the story, trying to unite the Shinsengumi somehow, even during the crisis, and it\'s by doing this that she\'ll discover her true feelings for Shinsengumi and for the one she loved all the way.After I finished the first movie I was concerned how they were gonna do the second half of the story and the battles, but I was very happy while watching it \'cause the studio did a great job again. They wrote an amazing plot and gave an important mission to each of the remaining characters, none of them were forgotten.Also in the ending of the movie we get to know the true meaning of the title ""Hakuouki"", which is very beautiful considering the whole atmosphere of the final scene.CHARACTERSThe characters have much more development than in the first movie, especially in the battles, it\'s where we see their true emotions and their pride as samurai.There are lot of meetings and goodbyes between them and the main character Chizuru, but they all help her somehow. I think different from the TV series, in the movie we get to see – at least if it\'s just a foreshadowing –, how the characters loved Chizuru and how they want to protect her.A character that shined in this movie, for me, was Kazama. As a villain he didn\'t get much attention in the TV series, but in the second movie he\'s definitely the star. I loved how they portrayed him at the same time being a bad figure and someone who can be lovely and protective.In general, what I liked the most about the characters in the second movie was how they shown their sentimental side, considering mostly of the characters have become furies at this point, I liked the ""I can be a demon but I still have a heart, and this heart will follow the path I believe is right"" thing.ANIMATIONAgain, I want to applaud Studio Deen for the amazing animation. These movies might be the best of the best the studio have done so far. Like in the first movie, the characters are perfectly animated, as well as the scenery. What called my attention the most in this movie was the animation in the fight scenes, it doesn\'t disappoint! If you\'re a fan of samurai + fight scenes, this will be your cup of tea.SOUNDThe OSTs are ok. They aren\'t anything special, but they fit with the scenes they\'re present. The ending song though is something memorable. The song is very beautiful and the lyrics fit with the whole story of the movie, so after you finished watching you should definitely check them. My only complaint was that the song just played on the credits, and as I watched the last scene I thought it would fit much better if it had started playing in the middle of the last scene, or if at least they had put another song during that scene.Overall, the second and last movie of the retelling story of Hakuouki was very good. As I mentioned in my review for the first movie, it was more enjoyable than the TV series. It was very nice see two different things happening in an historical anime: the story of the samurais and a love story, and better, the movie portrayed both very well! I would recommend to anyone who likes good fights, good looking guys and a beautiful and romantic ending. If you already watched the TV series, or watched just the first movie, you also should check out this movie as well, it has a different story during the first part and then a very similar ending to the one of the TV series.Check out to see the conclusion of the Hakuouki story! the Chizuru\'s story, which is a mix of the onis and furies story with her own love story.As the movie goes, we\'re shown lots of battles – epic battles I must say –, all focused on the Shinsengumi guys, they\'re a mix of sadness, pride and what I think the movie expressed very well, the way of the samurai.

I usually don\'t like the ""Recap with new animations and scenes"" type of movies, but this was different than I had imagined.I really liked how the story focused a lot more on Kazuma and Chizuru\'s side of things, as well as the little Cameo appearance. The story development is different than TVA version, and you get to hear the truth about Chizuru\'s past. Although I disliked how rushed everything was, I feel the story and the ending was much better than TVA\'s ending.Overall I would give this 8/10...because I felt that the character development was a little bit rushed too much, but that was to be expected. because I felt that the character development was a little bit rushed too much, but that was to be expected.', 'This review compare heavily to the TV series!Given how bad the two TV seasons were, I was hesitant to start the movie recaps. Surprisingly, movie 1’s pacing turned out to be great, introducing characters with incredible fighting animation (and Chizuru is finally not as useless). However, movie 2 went back to the pacing TV series were, in fact, worse. By trying to incorporate every charcters feeling towards Chizuru, the plot lines were very incoherent and messed up. We get to know each character a little more (ex. Kazama’s and Harada’s story) on the sacrifice of the overall story. In conclusion, this movie made me so...much more confused that the 2nd season of the TV eps. The only good thing were the art designs and animation (way better than TV), Shinsengumi’s hotness just went up by another level.P.s. there’s some small scenes that contains characters from the prequel (reimeiroku)! much more confused that the 2nd season of the TV eps.

Hakumei to Mikochi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36094/Hakumei_to_Mikochi,"[""For me Iyashikei is a mixed bag. While I usually find myself enjoying them somewhat, often times the shows focus too much on the healing ascepts without anything deeper under them. While the nice simple moments of life are nice, it can get repetitive if that is all a show has to offer. Luckily in the case of Hakumei to Mikochi there is so much more that it has to offer.Hakumei to Mikochi features a unique setting that it uses the fullest of it's potential. Each element of its setting is explored and is fully thought out. It's not just a bunch of random...ideas scrambled together. Nor is it just a start so they can get into the usual antics. It feels real, and each episode gives another picture of the tiny world that they inhabit. Small animals inhabit the world as well and their size makes sense given the size of our main characters. Things are much bigger than them, and the show is fine with displaying that. A peanut is small to us but is big to them. A mouse is small to us but is bigger than either of the main characters. And other small animals do appear. It is a life in the woods. It's not just resized humans. It truly is the woods. Each element of their culture is well explored and utilized. The ending even goes into detail about all of the various places and people that they meet in the episode and goes into their backstory, fleshing them out and bringing an extra element to the characters or setting that we had just watched.Everything feels thought out. It doesn't feel like they scrambled something together. Rather it all feels connected and is utilized very well through out the course of the show. Each part of the setting says something about another part and about the general world that they inhabit. The world feels vibrant and by going into the different professions, festivals, homes, taverns, and attractions it makes the world feel that much more real, and has it shine that much more. It's not a simple picture but rather an encompassing one, where we get to see where they shop, where they work, where they play, and all of the different elements that makes up this tiny life.The main characters also shine. It's hard portraying a reserved couple. If the two are too reserved then their bond feels too fake and feels like one of convenience rather than of love. If they are too indulgent then it's no longer reserved. While it's easy to portray a relationship by having one pair of the relationship continually glomp, hug, and kiss the other, that isn't necessarily realistic, nor does it account for all relationships.But Hakumei to Mikochi is able to do this. The two of them never overtly discuss or confess their love for each other, and yet they feel like a strong pair with an unbreakable bond. It's about the little things. The two of them know each other so well. Each moment between the two of them comes off as two people who know each other so well that they know how the other will act and why they act that way. They know when to support each other and when to give each other space, which can be just as critical. Both Hakumei and Mikochi can get engrossed in their work and at those times both of them know that it's best to leave them to their work. It's hard to get distance right, but it feels like these two know each other well so well that they know exactly when they want to be alone, and that is pretty great. And outside of that? They're often together. Whether it be something that one party is more interested in than the other it doesn't matter. The two of them are there to support each other and be with each other. Many times the two of them are together right next to each other. They may not be gushing over each other, but the closeness between the two of them can be felt.The characters themselves are also noteworthy. Both of them are talented in their fields and show different levels of talent. Hakumei is an adept handygirl, and Mikochi is very good at sewing, cooking and the like. They both respect each other's talents and so does the show. There is no sense of one being better than the other due to their talents. Rather the different benefits of their talents are expressed in  the show. The show is also able to avoid the trap where their skills are too correlated to how one might act. Hakumei may be a good handygirl and be more active but that doesn't mean she can't get motion sickness under the sea. Nor does that mean she's always going to be the one to spring to action. The two of them really do work well as a pair both complimenting each other's strengths and weaknesses.Not only do they work as a pair but they also work on their own. While the show is just as reserved as the characters are there are some hints towards the inner workings of the characters via some of the episodes. For example, Hakumei seems to show a level of need of approval and worth in the world that she inhabits. There are a couple of times in the show where she wants to join a group, usually based off of work, and gets upset when she can't do so. The show never brings this up in dramatic fashion but it does hint at it with many of its episodes showing this element of her.And the art and the sound are also fantastic. The show has a beautiful art style and is well adept at showcasing the better points of the world that its showing. It has an interesting style that works very well in the context of the show. Not to mention it can show and make action feel real without actual displaying that much. It may not be the most technical form of animation but they're able to make everything feel real and storybook-like with the use of style and directing and in my eyes that's just as good. It never feels like it's lacking in animation quality. Each moment feels rich. The sound may not shine as much but it certainly does well to help feel the mood of the setting and the episode, and express what the show is going for.Hakumei to Mikochi is the best that Iyashikei has to offer. It's comfy, rich, and does have a lot to say and show under it's comfiness. Filled with interesting characters, a fantastic reserved character bond that I have yet to see done well elsewhere, and a vibrant developed world Hakumei to Mikochi provides a unique and wonderful viewing experience, which I heartily enjoyed. ideas scrambled together.

The episodic format of...chapters taken straight from the manga really works well here, as is evident with the setting the chapters are based upon, and all these are given with no expectations, just some ol' good storytelling like from a fairy tale book.If you're wondering there's any similarity to it, remember Chi and Yuu from Girls' Last Tour last season albeit a different setting and the context of the world around them (post-apocalyptic world vs. insect-like world). Nevertheless, it helps to cement that like with Chi and Yuu's purpose, Hakumei is the one who is capable of working and solving issues while her life buddy Mikochi can help cook dishes and do woman stuff, and they both are a fresh breeze of air from the stereotypical girls-doing-stuff archetypes.The art and animation is well deserving of studio Lerche's production, though the SoL and light-fantasy themes are not their major niches when it comes to the style of the anime done by them.

A soulless adaptation of a great manga. The music and backgrounds are nice, but the way they're used is very uninspired, and every other aspect of this show, especially the direction, feels completely flat and lifeless.This flatness is especially present in the camerawork, with pointless manga-like panels, flowery borders and movement suggested by zooming backgrounds. All of these, combined with mediocre (on-model but unexpressive) animation and fake-looking computer-generated scratchy lines, put this show a long way from the eyecandy that is the manga.You'd think that the main appeal of this show would be its small scale. However, the...staff of this show have completely neglected to capitalize on this. The flames look like normal-sized flames. The water flows like normal. pots shatter like normal. All of the sound effects are just seemingly stock, the same you'd find in a normal-sized anime. But worst of all, there are sources of drama in this show that are COMPLETELY unbelievable because of this neglect of physics. There are at least 2 such scenes where a character falls from a great height, except that in reality, a creature as small as these girls would barely even FEEL a fall like that. In the manga, these scenes were present, but didn't really bother me that much. In the adaptation, where they're significantly more dramatized, they stand out like a sore thumb.Watching the first trailer, OP and ED feels like watching what this show could have been. 3/10.By the way, I think there's plenty of things to like about this show, and that the nitpickiness of my review is partly based on the fact that the first trailer gave me really high expectations. I am not trying to disagree with the positive reviews on this page, just highlighting the elements that made it hard to watch for me. staff of this show have completely neglected to capitalize on this. The flames look like normal-sized flames. The water flows like normal. pots shatter like normal. All of the sound effects are just seemingly stock, the same you'd find in a normal-sized anime. But worst of all, there are sources of drama in this show that are COMPLETELY unbelievable because of this neglect of physics.

The underrated and the darkhorse series that no one talks about. There’s gotta be that one anime that flies over everyone’s radar. Hakumei To Mikochi everyone.So...no ones talking about this show...why???It’s weird really how this is one of my favourite anime of the season. I mean it’s about the life of tiny people and how they go through events everyday. It’s a good way to end a Friday if you ask me.The main story centers around our two main characters Hakumei and Mikochi. The two of them has some of the best character chemistry and interaction I have ever seen. It’s clear how...much those 2 care for each other and how they both go through obstacles together. Mikochi is like your housewife who does a lot of the housework and food prep. Hakumei on the other hand is the one who works outside and do lots of mechanical work. It’s fun watching those 2 do what they do best.Some of the side characters’ personalities prove to be great and well and some of them have a pretty sad backstory. Even if they have minimal screen time, every second they appear I receive joy from them.I really am tempted to ship Hakumei and Mikochi and want to make this shoujo ai as much as possible, but I shouldn’t.The animation and art style is super stylistic (as expected from Lerche). Beautiful colours and background art including amazing cinematography. With Andou Masaomi directing, it’s no surprise we get a lot of paneling during the series. He’s also done this with his previous work “Kuzu no Honkai.”The music is great for it also composed by Evan Call, who is doing music for the series “Violet Evergarden” at the same time. It easily sets the tone and atmosphere for any given situation. He’s looking to be the Kevin Penkin of the season.The OP is spectacular with captivating visuals as well as a smooth and charming song that just helps you relax. But for maximum relaxation comes the ED with some extra info that forces you to watch the whole ED without skipping. Smart.Overall Hakumei to Mikochi is one of the best series slice of life has to offer with beautiful characters, soundtracks, art/animation, and interactions. I love the scale comparison when it comes to the characters and objects we see in everyday life. You begin to get a feel for them and be able to put yourself in their shoes. Sad how this has a low score and not many people talk about it. But if you have any time to watch tiny people live in a forest and your Friday ain’t going well, I guarantee you that this series will lighten up the mood as well as your day.Thank you Lerche. much those 2 care for each other and how they both go through obstacles together.

That's something I like to see.There is not too much to be said about Hakumei to Mikochi, besides the fact that it really does a good job at breathing new life in to the Slice of Life genre. While it doesn’t stray too far away from the idea of a Slice of Life, it’s unique setting makes this all the more enjoyable. This review will be...extended once this anime is completed. I use a 100-point scale when rating each category.Story: 90When I think of Slice of Life, I usually think of a story where people with normal lives in a modern time go through some of the many life experiences anyone would have. However, Hakumei to Mikochi is different in a way that makes this very likeable. The fantasy world of this anime is quite wondrous and it’s always fun watching both Hakumei and Mikochi have different experiences, whether they’re together or separate. I think it’s very interesting how humans are only around 9 centimeters tall; it makes me think of how life would be like if we all were equals to animals and we could communicate with them. Of course, the fact that fantasy is incorporated into this is the main point that breaks the normal Slice of Life tropes, since we do not really see many anime where both Slice of Life and Fantasy go together like bread and butter.Characters: 97.5I don’t know why, but I really, really like the characters of this anime a lot. While they aren’t that relatable, both Hakumei and Mikochi are great characters within themselves, and they both have their specific talents, with Hakumei being a hard worker and dedicated person while Mikochi is a good cook and singer, despite being quite insecure with many things. They have their likes and dislikes, and sometimes their differences make watching this anime really fun. A lot of supporting characters are also revisited in different episodes as I’ve seen so far, and I appreciate that they are able to be reused for many different parts of the plot, as with Slice of Life it makes the experience much less boring. Seeing the bond strengthen between Hakumei and Mikochi, as well as all the supporting characters is great. I think the best thing about the characters is that there's nothing keeping them from being themselves, allowing them to have their personalities as well as progress through the story. Iyashikeis are the best at doing this, so this is to be expected.Animation: 92.5There isn’t much to say about this, besides the fact that the animation is pretty damn good. It’s used in a great way whenever it’s needed to be used, especially for facial expressions in this anime. I like the way the animation is used in specific scenes, such as the more scenic moments, like when they fly or when detail is needed intricately. I haven’t watched enough Lerche anime to be able to judge how good this is compared to the rest of their anime, but I just know this is impressive.Sound: 100With an OST produced by the badass we know as Evan Call, who also made the OST for Violet Evergarden, I think it’s safe to say this guy’s one of the best composers I’ve seen in anime so far. His compositions fit just right with any scenario in Hakumei to Mikochi and nothing ever really feels off. The OP and ED are absolutely spectacular and it makes me want so much more from Evan Call in other anime. As of right now my favourite composition in the anime was used near the end of Episode 1, when Hakumei and Mikochi are at the port in front of the marketplace, and the sea shanty starts. This is a prime example of how an OST can be used, because this was used in such a “too good to be true” way that it felt almost impacting when I heard Mikochi start to sing. I felt connected and it’s something that’s very rare to come out of an OST from any anime, so I appreciate Evan Call’s music a lot.Art: 100This will be the very first thing you notice, and it’s kind of obvious that Hakumei to Mikochi wants to visually please the viewer with it’s beautiful scenery and landscape. Considering this takes place primarily in a forest full of tiny people, it gives you a really close up experience of what living in this forest looks like. The attention to detail in almost every frame of the forest is very pleasing to look at. Yet another rarity that appears in this anime, Hakumei to Mikochi doesn’t spare the viewer’s eyes with the beauty that appears before them in the many different places they present to you; the forest, their house, the marketplace, everything. If you want to see something Made in Abyss esque, maybe Hakumei to Mikochi is for you in terms of art style.Enjoyment: 100I don’t even need to say a couple words about how enthralled I am by Hakumei to Mikochi’s beauty and overall premise, and I know it’s not just me who feels this way. This anime is a lot like a few other anime I’ve watched, except it’s also completely different at the same time. If you want something as accurate as possible, this is like Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou, combined with Made in Abyss, making a really fabulous slice of life anime about not just the joys of life, but also the hardships and how even if you’re going through rough patches, there’s still more to look forward to. Not to say this anime teaches you a valuable lesson or anything, but I feel like there’s always something underlying in any anime that’s just stunning in every manner. While this is probably the most underrated and overlooked anime of the season, I think it should have a bit more attention. It’s a really great Slice of Life and I haven’t really seen much like it besides the only two other anime of the many I’ve seen.For those who are just looking at this anime, please give it a chance. It might bring you on a journey you’ll never regret going through, because that’s basically how I felt when watching Hakumei to Mikochi. There really isn’t much that’s very unique in anime anymore, and this is just one of the few refreshers I’ve needed. This is one of the best anime of the Winter 2018 season by far. Even with the abundance of slice of life this season, I think it's best you skip out on most of them and watch Yuru Camp or Hakumei to Mikochi, since they best carry out the formula of a healing slice of life. I hope this review helps you out.Overall: 96.6/100 extended once this anime is completed.

I hope this review helps you out.Overall: 96.6/100"", 'Slice of Life.\xa0 As a genre, it\'s become so oversaturated with content that it\'s branched off into comedy, supernatural, romance, what have you, causing the trend of missing a few diamonds in the rough here and there is a common occurrence.\xa0 Hakumei to Mikochi is in this reviewer\'s opinion, the poor victim of this phenomenon in the Winter 2018 season, and one that deserves light being shed on its deceivingly cutesy self.Story:In the woods lives the little people, a species of three inch tall elf-like beings who live their daily lives in the woods.\xa0 In Hakumei to Mikochi, we peer into the lives of the...titular duo, Hakumei and Mikochi, as they quite literally live their lives in the woods in the town of Makinata.Not surprisingly, Hakumei to Mikochi is a show that follows the day to day lives of these two girls as they encounter various obstacles in their lives like surprise adventures, daily disappointments, overcoming various hurdles, or unwelcome guests in their home.\xa0 Each episode is structured mostly in an A part and B part format, with the occasional roundabout episode with an overarching episodic narrative.\xa0 As such, the show is mainly episodic in nature, and very contained within its own story with aspects such as character relationships carrying over from episode to episode to give it natural progression.But beyond that, the thing I feel makes Hakumei to Mikochi special is its generally somber and relaxed tone.\xa0 Even in tense situations or scenes with higher stakes, the show never elevates itself to a level that separates it from its established tone, doing all of this surprisingly well due to the show\'s themes of life and self reflection.\xa0 Often in the show we see moments of characters by themselves collecting their thoughts by the adventure or event that has just occurred, letting what has happened sink in both for the characters and for the audience.\xa0 As such, the show exudes this strangely natural feel about it, an almost therapeutic feeling that has put me at ease with each proceeding episode.\xa0 The show never goes out of its way to be too outlandish, and stays grounded in being about its characters, telling its stories simply for the desire to tell each episode\'s story.Much of this is also spiced up by the show\'s more fantasy elements, creating a society filled with talking animals that live alongside these tiny people with a surprising amount of details slowly fed into the overall narrative to give the audience more to process.\xa0 My favorite aspect of the world building is the \'tiny\' element to all of this, as fruits and vegetables, as well as their animal coworkers/neighbors are scaled to match the actual size of the characters, which while small, gives the show a stamp for attention to detail because of how consistent these elements of the show are, and quite hilarious how something like one whole peanut can serve as a fulfilling snack for two people.When culminated,\xa0Hakumei to Mikochi is comes off as a whimsical and episodic story that exudes both charm and whimsy with its episodic stories and world building that ends on a nice somber note that lets the entire self-contained adventure or event come to a solution that feels both comforting and satisfying to watch.\xa0 It\'s for this reason why the story feels worth investing into, and makes the show something more than just a \'slice of life adventure\'.Overview:+ Good worldbuilding+ Rooted and consistent toneCharacters:The titular characters\xa0Hakumei and Mikochi are in a way two sides of the same coin.\xa0 Hakumei is the more rowdy of the two, working as a repairwoman and enjoys more physical labor whereas Mikochi is more of the homemaker, usually cooking for the duo and makes homemade products to sell.\xa0 But this only scratches the surface of these two girls, as each episode slowly feeds in more details about their past, more of their talents and fears, ultimately giving them both a nice and smooth polish that turns them into well-rounded characters that work well both individually and when together.\xa0 I felt really invested with these two because they always had this nice positive vibe about them, and the show\'s whimsical and lax nature prevented them from having any annoying traits that would spoil their overall positive qualities.But more than that, the side cast manages to be just as impressive than the titular characters.\xa0 Adding in various characters both animal and little people like Konju the songstress, Iwashi the weasel repairman, and Sen the \'necromancer\', the show provides an expansive cast full of recurring characters that get built upon with each proceeding episode.\xa0 As a result, the cast feels like a group of people rather than one-sided background fodder, providing a richness to the cast that makes them all feel alive and enhances the already solid worldbuilding that the show establishes.Overview:+ Well-rounded characters+ Equally well-built side-castArt:Produced by Lerche,\xa0Hakumei to Mikochi has bears much of the company\'s style in having a lighter color palette with more of a white blend to give everything a light air about it.\xa0 The show also provides extensively detailed background images from the various towns, the forests, and the main characters\' home, all of which are very consistent in quality and are very nice to look at, especially with how leafy and full of life the forests look.I do also want to bring attention to the character designs and just how much I love them.\xa0 If nothing else, the designs for the little people especially are adorable.\xa0 The chibi design of them really makes them look far more appealing than they have any right to be, and Konju\'s design especially with the linens on her arms and the harp on her chest is something I really, really like.\xa0 They also all wear an adorable hat that looks just slightly too big for their heads.\xa0 There really is just something to love about how they look.Overview:+ Adorable character designs+ Consistent and quality art+ Very detailed backgroundsSound:Much like the story, sound plays much into the series\'s overall somber and relaxed tone.\xa0\xa0""Urar"", by Chima is a mix of both bizarre yet calming, where the song is primarily harmonious tones with Chima\'s voice primarily acting as the song\'s melody.\xa0 It\'s an interesting song that took some time for me to grow fond of, especially because the accompanying visuals were real life pictures of the forest rather than either Hakumei or Mikochi doing anything in the show, which at first glance is quite odd.The ED by contrast is something that sounds more on par with the series.\xa0 ""Harvest Moon Night"", sung by Aoi Yuuki and Shino Shimoji, the voices of both Konju and Mikochi, is a more energetic piece in comparison to its OP counterpart, providing a piano flourish that leads into a more festive beat that comes with a joyful duet of two characters noted as being some of the best singers in the series\' canon.Overview:+ Great ED+/- OP is a tad strange to mePersonal Enjoyment:Hakumei to Mikochi is my favorite slice of life of the season.\xa0 And that\'s rivaling Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san, a series that takes the title as one of my favorite romance series.\xa0 For me, I appreciate this show more for what it did to expand more from the \'slice of life\' bubble, providing highs and lows throughout each episode, always making sure to end on a nice somber note as a sort of closing statement so the audience feels relaxed, something that I felt after every episode and pushed me more to want more.More than that, I love Konju as a character.\xa0 Aoi Yuuki is already an amazing voice actress, and having her play my favorite character in this show made Konju even more fun to have, especially since she was a recurring character.\xa0 More than that, the show made me care about these characters.\xa0 At the end of it all, I felt happy about Hakumei\'s journey from where she came from to where she is now, I smiled at how even the grumpiest of characters managed to smile, and how not a single character in this entire show was either annoying or overly annoying that I wish they weren\'t there, cause there\'s always one I\'ll tell ya.\xa0 I\'ve even gone back and forth on which of the main duo is my favorite, often times switching from Mikochi to Hakumei, to back again because each episode managed to give more information about them that made me favor one or the other.\xa0 I just think they\'re that good as characters.If you\'re looking for a diamond in the rough, Hakumei to Mikochi is the show to provide that.\xa0 It\'s a show that I haven\'t seen under may peoples\' radars, and I feel goes unappreciated for more popular picks.\xa0 Its emphasis on the somber and relaxed parts of life are something that gives the show its own identity, a rare occurrence in a genre that\'s oversaturated with many of the same or similar shows that battle it out for dominance.\xa0 So if you ever feel like you want something to relax to, something to end the night off on a pleasant mood, this is a show that\'s definitely one for that role. titular duo, Hakumei and Mikochi, as they quite literally live their lives in the woods in the

characters managed to smile, and how not a single character in this entire show was either annoying or overly annoying that I wish they weren\'t there, cause there\'s always one I\'ll tell ya.\xa0 I\'ve even gone back and forth on which of the main duo is my favorite, often times switching from Mikochi to Hakumei, to back again because each episode managed to give more information about them that made me favor one or the other.\xa0 I just think they\'re that good as characters.If you\'re looking for a diamond in the rough, Hakumei to Mikochi is the show to provide that.\xa0 It\'s a show that I haven\'t seen under may peoples\' radars, and I feel goes unappreciated for more popular picks.\xa0 Its emphasis on the somber and relaxed parts of life are something that gives the show its own identity, a rare occurrence in a genre that\'s oversaturated with many of the same or similar shows that battle it out for dominance.\xa0 So if you ever feel like you want something to relax to, something to end the night off on a pleasant mood, this is a show that\'s definitely one for that role.', 'This anime took my breath away~. The most underrated anime and also a beautiful one.Definitely, want more and sad to see that the show ends. What a wonderful and relaxing anime.Pretty sad this is my the number 1 underrated show this season..it was surprisingly a cute anime, so relaxing and chilled, hope more people will give it a shot.Not anything mindblowing but extremely satisfied.This anime is a ""Healing"" anime just like Yuru Camp that you just need to watch when you\'re having a rough day in work or dealing with your life.Art: 10Artsiness of this anime was just perfect.

There are plenty of highly detailed positive reviews and they should already give you an idea of how this show is good. I believe that every season many new Anime of excellent level come out, but so well done like this, there are one or two. It is simply magical, it accompanies you in this world so colorful and fun, it\'s relaxing and enjoyable, it makes you forget you\'re sitting in an armchair and makes you dream of being there. Notes of merit certainly...go to the entire artistic sector, I love this style, so cute and ""morbid"". I always see comments like ""Is it worth to watch!?"", ""Is it good!?"", ""If I see it, I will lose time?!""... I really don\'t like these questions and I don\'t like answering, but I can understand why. In any case trust me, if you look at it you will not regret it and surely you will immediately enter the ranks of people who want the second season. Thanks for reading.

See you soon ^_^', ""Narrative and design similar to that of a children's story, without falling into the basics, nor the negative aspect of these. The design is inspired by the great classics of European tales. Hakumei is imbued with this tradition, creates a magnificent world, but manages to differentiate himself from this genre by not having obvious morals.It is to be praised that there are no anthropomorphic animals, or moe. Creatures are more real and therefore credible.The plot takes place between sequences and planes, not between tired dialogues. Nature and friendship are portrayed lightly, without exaggerating the values of it. Showing the simple life. The wonder of simplicity. "", 'A beautiful anime, that heals with the peaceful life of tiny beings and their cuteness. Hakumiko clearly stands out as one of the notable SoL and Iyashikei anime in this season.Story 8/10The story revolves around hakumei and mikochi. It\'s about their everyday life, from their daily work, shopping, events, etc. The storyline itself might not that deep, but the world building aspect is a deep one. Althought this anime presents those in an episodic way, but the timeline still can be defined clearly.Thing that notable from the story of hakumiko is that we can feel the ""connection"" that has been made by those two MC....The ""connection"" persists, quite developed and well-kept in a very light-hearted manner. This amplifies the iyashikei nuance. ""Connection"" can make our heart smiles.Art 8/10The art aspect is quite definitive, in the way that it has originality in its style. The form of things in hakumiko is still definitely that of normal form - leaves as leaves, people as people, fish as fish. But the style makes those normal things seem original enough to appreciate.There are also many things beside the style that can be appreciated, but i have to note that there\'s one thing that this anime fails at : the animation. It\'s not actually fails, but the animation is that of average anime or even less than that in the term of quantity.Sounds 8/10The seiyuus, all of them, played their role greatly. We can know the personality of the character just by hearing their voice.The songs are also very fit for this anime. The OP song, urar, has this light, natural yet mythical nuance which amplifies the sensation of peacefulness. The ED song, Harvest Moon Night, is light-hearted and cheerful song that closes the anime with a smile + there\' some trivia that helps with the world building.Character 8/10Each of character can be clearly defined by their characteristic. This suggests that this anime has a nice characterization. But it must be noted that, with the exception of a few characters, the characterization isnt that deep. Many of side characters only has 1 episode screen time - hence it can\'t played deep. But the characterization certainly is wide.Enjoyment 9/10This anime has its own uniqueness in ithe way it plays SoL and Iyashikei genre. Despite its faults, this anime still can deliver those genre successfully with a clear and defining characteristics.

I like to think I'm more discerning than that, but I'm probably not.In Hakumei and Mikochi, you get exactly what you might expect if you take the usual slice of life formula but swap out the setting. While in most slice of life series, the setting-swap-out is just some different after-school club that only marginally changes things, here there are two substantial swap-outs. First, and most obvious from the synopsis, is...that it takes place in a fantasy-heavy setting - tiny humans, talking animals, and a touch of the occult.Second, and perhaps less expected, is that each little story is mature and adult. A typical story might be about Hakumei's struggles at her work, Mikochi's friends and acquaintances in the city, renovating their house, befriending a new cockroach neighbor, and helping a friend with their skeleton-commanding sorcerous research. There are a ton of interesting relationships between people that get explored, whether it's Hakumei's mentor and supervisor at work, or the shopkeeps in the city that all seem to know Mikochi.Ultimately, it carries all of the serene relaxation of a nice slice of life, while still having a fresh setting, tone, and theme with characters that fit all of that perfectly. that it takes place in a fantasy-heavy setting - tiny humans, talking animals, and a touch of the occult.Second, and perhaps less expected, is that each little story is mature and adult.

This show calls to a certain whimsy that my inner child has been starving for for years, while at the same time fulfilling my present need for character writing and conflicts to keep the show engaging.I always find shows centered around two best friends to be the best of slice of life - Maiko-san Chi no Makanai-san, Yuru Camp, Kyuuketsuki Sugu Shinu. You get a lot of that fluffy feeling of the leads finding ""home"" with...each other, minus the angst that is comorbid to romance animes. This show truly takes that premise and elevates it to the max, with two absolutely lovable characters (Hakumei, a slightly boyish, easygoing handy(wo)man, and Mikochi, a faint-hearted but capable homemaker and businesswoman). Though their current life seems cozy and idyllic, both leads have uneasy histories that are slowly recounted throughout the show, and each episode challenges the leads in a new way.I really enjoy how this show depicts the idealistic ""cottage-core"" lifestyle while still showing that even with this life, the leads face the same human conflicts and emotions we face every day; frustration about not performing well at work, that ""never-enough"" feeling when it comes to our material desires, etc. The show has an adult, bittersweet tinge while still delivering comfiness at every turn. It delivers the Ghibli-like delight of cheese and jam on a wooden cutting board while showing us that it\'s so delicious precisely because you\'re having it after a long day of hard work, drenched to the bone by the rain.To speak on the art of the show - it is just gorgeous. I fell in love with the manga\'s background and character designs a long time ago (the egg salon!

Hakumei to Mikochi is definitely not an anime that will appeal to everyone, but to those it would, it’s hard to see how it will not steal their heart. If you enjoy Josei or seinen, this might be something for you. I would also say it is important to understand the delicate relationship between the two females in order to enjoy this show, so if F/F isn’t for you then you might not be able to appreciate it fully. Now on to the review:The characters:This series is all about simplicity and reflecting the very serenity of...life, and the characters are no different. They aren’t rich, have superpowers, look like a star or have any other outstanding features, which is exactly why it’s so easy for viewer to focus on their emotions, thoughts and enjoy the atmosphere of melancholy. Hakumei is a dependable go-getter that works hard and kicks up her feet to relax harder once she is done. Mikochi is very sweet without being annoying, and it’s easy to see her dedication to Hakumei, even though she is a person of her own and has hobbies, friends etc. besides these two there are new characters in every episode and level of creativity in character designs is truly enchanting. The idea of tiny human like people co existing with working animals is really cute. Even if I didn’t remember all the side characters, at no point did I feel annoyed by introduction or exit of too many characters.The story:There isn’t any so to say, which is the beauty of it. Each “segment” of episode is like looking at photograph and trying to understand what was going on in that very exact moment that was captured in the frame. There is no beginning or end, it is simply a journey of living life with tranquility and love each passing day. And what more could one ask for? Although each standalone short story was amazing in itself, what really made me clap my hands like an excited little kid was the finale, which is one of most satisfying show ends for me in recent times.Enjoyment:A total ten. I took a long time to finish this series because I really wanted to savour it and prolong the watching period as long as possible, not knowing if I will come across something so relaxing again. I usually would put on a episode right before I would go to bed and it put my mind at such ease that I could feel all day’s tensions and fatigue melting away. A show like this is perfect for working adults who may not have the time to sit down and watch something with dedication, because no matter how many days you skip before watching next episode, the journey just goes on.Art:I mean... who doesn’t love those tiny chibi humans? They are adorable and that’s just all I have to say about it. The sceneries are also beautiful and take you right in the middle of nature. There’s not much to say except that it’s fantastic.Sound:It was fitting for the show, not something I will remember for a long time but definitely complimented the show very well.Overall:Like I said before this series might be a hit or miss. This is not a attack on Titan or romantic comedy or any of those sorts. Nothing is going to happen. There are very few highs and lows in the series. The whole point of it is to go along this journey with the two main characters and get lost in their everyday life, however simple and mundane it may be.

These lilliputians go about their daily lives, working, eating, and drinking, and occasionally getting involved in (low-stakes) intrigue. Their fellows are animals, most larger than themselves, and other members of their tiny race, with whom they generally get along well. This is a slice of life series among slice of life...series.

Not for any reason, as the premise did appeal to my tastes and I put it on my list of anime I planned to watch, but at the time it came out, I was burnt out on anime. From 2010 to the end of 2015, I watched a ton of anime...but after I graduated college, I felt myself unable to watch even a single episode per month unless it was a new episode of Pokemon. A number of things contributed to this for me: Too much time on my hands,...too many titles that had elements that turned me off, job hunting with no success, cyberbullying in one particular fandom, having seen too many shows, and so on. Anime always brought me joy, and I honestly tried to get back into it, but I couldn't muster up the motivation to go back to what I did before. I just couldn't get myself in the frame of mind to watch anything anymore, even the shows I really loved. Then the crapshow that was 2020 happened and one day, I watched an episode of an anime. And another. And another. Slowly but surely, I found myself going back to the old routine that sustained me throughout my school years. I think I finally managed to claw myself out of it. Not completely, but I'm feeling a lot better and more motivated than I was before. To think it actually took a pandemic for me to get back into the medium that brought me so much joy throughout my life. In that regard, I finally managed to watch and finish shows I was interested in watching, with Hakumei and Mikochi being one of them. God, this series is so cute and sweet and deserves way more love than it gets!But what is Hakumei and Mikochi about, anyway? In an unnamed fantasy land, talking animals and people reaching only a few inches tall co-exist in peace. Two such tiny people, Hakumei and Mikochi, live together in a house built into a tree. Hakumei is a tomboyish, energetic carpenter, while the more feminine, reserved, responsible Mikochi is a tailor and cook who sells her work to nearby establishments. The two are pretty different, but they get along well and spend every day together in harmony. They work, go on sightseeing adventures, take shopping trips, and interact with the various people and animals in their hometown Makinata. Basically, it's a low key fantasy slice-of-life story about two women who live together, and if you're confused as to how old Hakumei and Mikochi are, the series makes it pretty clear that, even though their character designs are deliberately chibi-esque and child-like, they're fully grown adults.One thing Hakumei and Mikochi really excels at is making use of its setting. Since the main characters, and other tiny humanoids like them, are only a few inches tall, smaller than most animals even, the series takes great pains to show how much bigger the world would seem to their perspective. A mouse would be small to us, but bigger than our two main characters. In fact, the series really has an incredible sense of detail. Both Hakumei and Mikochi are shown doing tasks that most other shows would take for granted, like acquiring food, cooking, sewing clothes, using different types of dye and what conditions create certain colors, sharpening their tools, and so on. Most anime would only show just one or two scenes like this, but for Hakumei and Mikochi, it's part of their daily life, as it would be for other people in real life. They're always doing something meaningful that, even if it may not impact the story, brings a lot of life to both them as characters and the world they live in. Granted, there are other shows that have done this better, but since most anime tend to take a lot of these things for granted, I'm giving Hakumei and Mikochi an A+ for this one.This extends to the characters as well, namely our main duo. The show also takes great pains to show what these two girls are like, their hobbies, their personalities, and just how they manage to live together in spite of their differences. Hakumei is an energetic tomboy who eats a lot, but she's also a hard worker and takes her jobs very seriously, something one wouldn't expect out of characters that follow that archetype. Mikochi is more feminine and often keeps her in life, but the series treats her as very proactive, and her hobbies and talents are treated with just as much respect as Hakumei's. Both have their strengths, weaknesses, and talents and compliment each other perfectly. It helps that the side characters are pretty good as well, even if I wish more had been done with them. The only character I admittedly don't like is Conju, mainly because she's kind of a stuck-up brat who frequently causes trouble, though even she's fairly mild compared to other, far worse and more mean-spirited characters in other anime I've seen.The artwork and animation was done by a newer studio called Lerche, who previously animated shows like Astra: Lost In Space, Toilet-Bound Hanako-kun, Monster Musume, and Radiant. While the characters don't display much in terms of movement and motion (Though Hanako-kun is a lot worse about this), the series makes up for it with lush backgrounds and a subdued, low key artstyle that perfectly conveys the sheer beauty of the world around our two leads. I've heard that some people took issue with Lerche's usage of manga-style panels for certain parts, but I personally wasn't bothered by them. I thought that they worked just fine for the scenes they were used for, and weren't overused. The soundtrack is also a joy to listen to, with every piece fitting the feel and atmosphere of the series, from loud, energetic cowboy fiddles to soft, soothing piano music for the quieter parts. Honestly, the only thing I can see people take issue with is that it's deliberately slow paced and lacking in action. This isn't a series for people who want to see blood-pumping fights or guys screaming at each other constantly. Hakumei and Mikochi is a slice-of-life through and through and knows what its supposed to be. That being said, I'm admittedly not a fan of episode 8, because its whole tone and premise felt jarring and out of place for a series like this. It's not a bad episode or anything, but it just seemed to come out of nowhere and really clashed with the rest of the series. But it's just one episode out of twelve, so I think I can let it slide.In terms of iyashikei series, Hakumei and Mikochi is one of the best the genre has to offer. It's a sweet, charming little time-killer that's perfect for when you want to wrap yourself in a blanket, sit by the fireplace, drink hot chocolate, and relax on a snowy winter day. It's sweet, its wholesome, and definitely worth your time if you're willing to give it a chance. too many titles that had elements that turned me off, job hunting with no success, cyberbullying in one particular fandom, having seen too many shows, and so on. Anime always brought me joy, and I honestly tried to get back into it, but I couldn't muster up the motivation to go back to what I did before. I just couldn't get myself in the frame of mind to watch anything anymore, even the shows I really loved. Then the crapshow that was 2020 happened and one day, I watched an episode of an anime. And another. And another. Slowly but surely, I found myself going back to the old routine that sustained me throughout my school years. I think I finally managed to claw myself out of it. Not completely, but I'm feeling a lot better and more motivated than I was before. To think it actually took a pandemic for me to get back into the medium that brought me so much joy throughout my life. In that regard, I finally managed to watch and finish shows I was interested in watching, with Hakumei and Mikochi being one of them. God, this series is so cute and sweet and deserves way more love than it gets!But what is Hakumei and Mikochi about, anyway? In an unnamed fantasy land, talking animals and people reaching only a few inches tall co-exist in peace. Two such tiny people, Hakumei and Mikochi, live together in a house built into a tree. Hakumei is a tomboyish, energetic carpenter, while the more feminine, reserved, responsible Mikochi is a tailor and cook who sells her work to nearby establishments. The two are pretty different, but they get along well and spend every day together in harmony. They work, go on sightseeing adventures, take shopping trips, and interact with the various people and animals in their hometown Makinata.

Hanasakeru Seishounen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5835/Hanasakeru_Seishounen,"['Story (9 out of 10):Personally, I tend to like reverse-harem animes that have good character development. To appreciate this story, one needs give it more than a few episodes. The series spends a good 10 episodes setting up the storyline and getting a feel for the roles of the characters. From here on, the story is filled with plot twists, one (sometimes 2-) dimensional political strategy and good fun that makes you want to watch the next episode....this is especially true around episode 20 when things really start getting complicated. Every episode is adds a new dimension and piece to the storyline, exploring different...types of love and the varying criteria of functional companionship for different types of relationships.Art (7 out of 10):The art itself isn\'t too bad but sometimes the movement of characters is a little stiff. For the most part, the color scheme, contrasts, and proportions are good. I like the style and delicacy of the lines, the eye animation is especially good in exhibiting more ""serious"" emotions such as ""determination"" or ""pain.""Sound (7 out of 10):The ending theme and opening theme (so far) has been the same for the whole series. I ike the opening theme and it does a nice job of setting up the tone of the show. However, I think the ending theme song is gorgeous.Character (9 out of 10):The characters are wonderful. Kajika is a little ridiculous....she isn\'t stupid just pretty reckless and willful (but you don\'t really see these qualities until later in the story where it is tested). She is really weird but that\'s what I liked about her. You really get swept into ""her"" way of thinking even if it may be a little naive at times. The guys are wonderful...I think the author pretty much just listed the sexy archetypes of male anime characters than made a character for each characterization. Then, beyond that, developed back stories that would explain why there were the way there and what characteristics would be necessary in an emotional partner for each. That may sound boring but it is actually really well done and entertaining in the storyline....it later is put more together (in relation to each other) as the story progresses.Enjoyment  (10 out of 10):If you like stories with well-developed romance, not too intense political intrigue, interesting character interplay, and amusing philosophical one-liners, then you will like Hanasakeru Seishounen. I thought this show was pretty addictive and great for more mature audiences who can appreciate the idiosyncrasies of the characters.Overall (10 out of 10):JUST TRY IT!!

XD', ""It's definitely one of the underrated animes out there.Not your average reverse harem. Kajika, the main character is a strong heroine and you can't help but love her. Also, the characteristics of the guys surrounding her are very intimidating but you will come to love their uniqueness. Although it does not have the comedic ingredient that i usually go for, it's very heartwarming.It's a 9/10 for me! "", '-STORY- 10/10""I love the happiness and the suffering. Because the only emotions I feel... are the ones you grant me.""At first, Hanasakeru Seishounen appears to be a rather typical reverse harem story. Young girl surrounded by several beautiful men, nothing new for the given genre. But don\'t let this throw you off. Soon enough, our protagonists, along with the three marriage candidates, get involved in a complicated political conspiracy of a small Middle Eastern country. They face great dangers as they travel across the world, learn to trust and support each other, discover new emotions within themselves, and mature in order to survive and reach...their goals.The story was nicely paced and very intriguing, with numerous plot twists -- I could not bring myself to stop watching it or to let any other anime interrupt it. I loved that although the story set off with romance in mind, it was not the main focus. I will even say that if the whole husband-choosing piece was not present, this anime would still be just as good.At the end of the series, there was a certain sense of completeness, all questions were answered, all characters found their place in the world; it was a perfect spot to drop the curtain. I did feel a little sad, however, that such a great series came to a finale.-CHARACTERS- 10/10Kajika is not your typical damsel in distress constantly being saved by her male harem. She is strong and confident, is able to stand up for herself and to speak her mind when she has to. She is, however, rather slow when it comes to love and realizing her own feelings; but that is also understandable, considering that she grew up away from society and did not get a chance to experience romance until the husband game began. But even despite that, she treats each man with equal respect and consideration, which is very admirable.To me, however, the most interesting characters are the men surrounding Kajika. Needless to say that they are also not your typical male stereotypes found in a reverse harem. What grabbed me the most is how each one of potential candidates represented a different kind of love. Li Ren\'s love is strong and deep, to the point of becoming possessive of Kajika, yet his pride as a head of his clan stops him from being honest. Eugene\'s love is noble and selfless; he is willing to spend an eternity just watching over Kajika, whether she chooses him or not. Lumati, a young heir of Raginei, is blunt and straightforward about his love, but is also ready to admit defeat if his rival is worthy. And lastly, Carl is rather reserved and indecisive, but is equally sincere with his love and respectful toward his rivals. I really loved that these characters are not at each other\'s throats all the time, despite ""fighting"" against each other and feeling jealous, and instead act like mature adults and take both Kajika and each other seriously. Li Ren and Eugene may be an exception to that, but I don\'t believe they were ever serious during their quarrels.One character whose purpose I am still not sure about is Yui, Kajika\'s first female friend. She does not seem to do anything aside from exchanging letters with Kajika and fangirling over the male cast. She definitely belongs in a more typical shoujo setting, but thankfully her occurance was not frequent enough to cause a distraction.-ART/ANIMATION- 8/10Somewhere around episode 10 I found out that starting from episode 24 the series will have a different director. I was not worried about that. In fact, I was sure the series would become even better, considering that the second director is more experienced with shoujo anime and is famous for series like Fushigi Yuugi and Ayashi no Ceres. But unfortunately, as I later discovered, that change was not the best idea. It was obvious how the series became more ""shoujo"", with more diverse and less realistic facial expressions, and a couple super-deformed scenes here and there. However, Hanasakeru Seishounen is a dramatic story that had no need for comedy elements; if anything, they were a distraction. Kajika, who was now blushing and showing her ""girly"" side more often, almost started to look like a typical shoujo heroine. Semi-chibi elements seemed completely out of place in such a serious setting. The character designs also went through a slight change, and although it was not major, some general inaccuracies emerged; for example, Kajika described Eugene\'s eye color as ""topaz"" in the beginning, but with the direction change, his eyes became a mix of light green and yellow instead of a golden brown from the first twenty-three episodes.The animation quality itself seemed to have improved in the second half and toward the end, and the opening animation also became more appealing, but I would still prefer that it did not undergo such a drastic change in the middle. Also, all the CG vehicles stood out too much and were a pain to look at; especially considering that cars, planes, and helicopters appeared on the screen very often because the characters moved around a lot between cities and countries.-SOUND- 6/10The background music was pretty good; it did not really grab my attention though, so there isn\'t much to discuss. I was not too impressed by the opening and ending songs either -- they were too ""pop"" for my tastes. their goals.The story was nicely paced and very intriguing, with numerous plot twists -- I could not bring myself to stop watching it or to let any other anime interrupt it.

I was not too impressed by the opening and ending songs either -- they were too ""pop"" for my tastes.', ""I typically have a four episode rule when I watch an anime: After four consecutive episodes, if it has descended to such depths of frustrations and stupidity as to make watching it painful for me, I stop.This series failed my four episode test on the first four episodes.The Pros: The art style is nothing original, and several other bishonen series have very similar styles. The quality is not terribly bad, with the possible exception of the very first scene in the very first episode, where child kajika's head is disproportionately large. The characters are well voice acted, even if the rest of the sound...is absolutely run of the mill. The characterization is actually well done, for the most part, and is the most successful aspect of the anime, in my opinion. I find myself able to empathize with Li-ren and Barnesworth, and even Kajika, though her stubbornness is based squarely in stupidity and naivety, and her inability to consider the consequences of her actions is incredibly frustrating.The Cons: As I mentioned at the end of the Pros, Kajika is frustratingly stupid, and the series world just goes along with it, trying to portray her idiocy and self centered naivety as heroic behavior.The plot starts off alright, and has great possibility, but quickly descends into absurdity, with a nonsensical dilemma based on a convoluted family history. This is made worse by kajika's part in it, which seems to be limited to A) her insistence that Eugene is her dead pet cat because their (Eugene's and the cat's) eyes look the same, and B) her shooting a gun at a mirror, which manages to cause Eugene to spontaneously abandon his planned suicide and change his worldview entirely.I guess all the people at the suicide hot line need to do is have someone on hand to drive out and shoot a mirror, and that will instantly cause the suicider to abandon their self destructive course and see the world differently. Sounds like a plan; let me go tell them.In addition to this, the series is thematically barren, and consistently seems to shout that good looking people are somehow worth more than average looking people, and that it's okay to drive people to suicide as long as you're a selfish noble with a 'dark' past. Personally, I blame the schools.Bottom Line: Well, this is what I have to say to you, creaters of this anime: As one of those average looking people, I object, and rate your crappy anime a 3 overall, based on it's crappy, poorly constructed plot, frustratingly idiotic main character (that everyone pretends is saintly), and inability to say anything worthwhile. So, no need to make any more, you should all just go die.Now, you might think that harsh, but if I was a silver haired, greened eyed pretty boy, you'd want to have my babies, wouldn't you?Caveat: I may be a little harsh, as I'm writing this write after finished episode four and the frustration and annoyance is still fresh, but it's a good estimation of how you will likely feel too. Unless, that is, you are a reincarnated cat.Update: I'd like to apologize to all those who read this before now. It took me a while to come back and proof read, but I did. I'm fairly certain I discovered all the offending passages and corrected them. Please enjoy. is absolutely run of the mill.

Please enjoy."", ""Based on the 10 episodes that have aired so far, at first, the show might seem silly, and the story very average. The first few episodes were really not awe-inspiring at all. However, since the introduction of the character, Lumati, his storyline has breathed new life into this show.I just recently started watching anime, so I am no authority. But, I really like the story that has cropped up since episode 5. Let's hope they keep up the good work! "", 'This is my 1st anime review, so sorry if it\'s not that well-stated.  Also, sorry if it\'s too long (it\'s hard to NOT type more when there are so much in this series). Feel free to just skim through it, and maybe skip to the ""OVERALL"" part if you don\'t want much details.STORY-  8The story is rather interesting + unique to me. The thought of a ""marriage game"" may seem kinda cheezy, but the story goes WAY more deeper than that. For a reverse harem, it actually satisfies me somewhat. It has romance, drama, mysteries, political strategies, action (Oh. NOT hardcore stuff,...like fighting ghosts and whatnot, but just fighting + guns, basically), and hey.... eventually, you might even find the tiniest bit of comedy towards the end (they are more like ""inside""-kind of jokes, though, because you literally have to watch through the series, and know the characters to be able to understand the very little humor in this).ART-  7The art is standard to me, and sometimes, I have noticed that the characters appear kinda ""stiff."" Not the typical sparkly-pretty. The artwork looks rather old-fashioned, and frankly, I didn\'t like it very must at first.  Of course, I can\'t blame it because the manga was actually published somewhere in the late 1980\'s (which I just recently looked it up online). Why would they have an anime broadcast all of a sudden?  Beats me. ----The thing that stands out to me are the EYES.  It\'s like the moods are pretty much portrayed in them.  The backgrounds are also very nice with a ""classic""- feel to it. And.... Oh. Yes. THERE ARE BISHOUNENS.   :DSOUND-  7I think the voice actors/actresses have done their jobs well.  I could feel the strength in their voice during those serious, dramatic moments. (NOTE: There are only 1 op + ed  songs through-out the ENTIRE series) The opening is.... well~ nice, and I think what has won me over is the ending theme.  Although, maybe it\'s just because I\'m easily taken by those kind of sappy songs.CHARACTER-  9This is the high-point of the series for me.  The characters are absolutely BEAUTIFULLY portrayed, especially the main ones.  Their backgrounds, and how they interact with each other really bring out the GOOD-NESS in their personalities.  They have.... ONE WORD:  depth.  Kajika is strong-willed, brave, reckless, and inexperience, but what I find weird is how.... understanding she could be at times. She\'s unique in that way. (I will not be going over all of the boys\' personalities, but I do suggest of you to find that out yourself ) At first, some characters are rather dull, but I think it just takes time for them to come through.  ~I\'m sure you\'ll love all of them (or most). They are likable.ENJOYMENT-  9I really enjoyed watching this 39 episodes- series. It have put me like at the edge of my seat more times than I can remember!! They sure do know how to build-up suspense. I, literally, looked forward to watching this every week (maybe above all of the other on-going anime). The length of it was not too short where it made you crave for more, nor was it too long and dragged out everything.  I may be just a sucker for reverse harems and shoujo with romance.. and bishounens and whatnot, but everything put together in this anime was what made it memorable for me.OVERALL-  9I\'ll say it flat-out:  HANASAKERU SEISHOUNEN is a wonderful series. It\'s original in pretty much every aspects, and inspirational/sweet. It may even be one of my favorite. However, I do (regretingly) not recommend it if you don\'t like mysteries, romance, serious drama, etc.. Well~ Even for someone like me, who knows like nothing about political stuff, I find it to be extremely entertaining.

Not the typical sparkly-pretty. The artwork looks rather old-fashioned, and frankly, I didn\'t like it very must at first.  Of course, I can\'t blame it because the manga was actually published somewhere in the late 1980\'s (which I just recently looked it up online). Why would they have an anime broadcast all of a sudden?  Beats me. ----The thing that stands out to me are the EYES.  It\'s like the moods are pretty much portrayed in them.  The backgrounds are also very nice with a ""classic""- feel to it. And.... Oh. Yes. THERE ARE BISHOUNENS.   :DSOUND-  7I think the voice actors/actresses have done their jobs well.  I could feel the strength in their voice during those serious, dramatic moments. (NOTE: There are only 1 op + ed  songs through-out the ENTIRE series) The opening is.... well~ nice, and I think what has won me over is the ending theme.  Although, maybe it\'s just because I\'m easily taken by those kind of sappy songs.CHARACTER-  9This is the high-point of the series for me.

There are some nice plot twists along the way but it\'s not all that surprising if you put your mind to it. Also, this is not really an ""interesting"" plotline but as far as these type of animes go, it\'s alright.Art: Nothing really special here, it\'s average.Sound: Also nothing special.Character: When I first started watching the show, Kajika seemed annoying and unrealistic, but it might be because of her living on a remote island for most of her life. The only other thing I...dislike about Kajika is that her foolish and naive acts are regarded as heroic ones. The other characters, like Li-ren, Ramty, Eugene, etc., are alright but seem rather bland and majorly cliched, some having the ""dark past"" scenario and such.Another thing that disturbs me about this show is about appearances. So you\'re beautiful and have a ""rare"" eye color, does that mean you\'re better than everyone else? That\'s how the show puts it, e.g. because Eugene has a dark past and is beautiful, so to speak, he\'s allowed to kill innocent people without having to deal with consequences (saying that he didn\'t kill them, he gave them a choice but they chose themselves to die instead of him), but instead it makes his soul ""more beautiful"".Enjoyment: I must say that I *did* enjoy it even if I dislike many things about this show, realism for example, I mean really, how could you stop a suicidal man from jumping out of a window by just shooting his reflection on a mirror? Sure, it sounds very nice and poetic-like but it\'s not very real at all. I will watch the rest of the episodes but I don\'t think my opinion will change much.Overall: It\'s an overall good show, nothing to call the best or the worst show ever.

It was a really interesting plot which I really enjoyed. The romance was great and I couldn't stop watching! The atmosphere of each episode was very mature, and usually beautiful (apart from the action scenes). I didn't like the heavy politics, which is my only complaint.Art:I think that type of art in anime is for the 'beautiful boys'. It makes...the women look less cute, but more beautiful and mature. I wasn't used to it at first and didn't like it, but I found myself growing to like it more and more with each episode. It certainly suited the male characters, they all looked so mature and handsome, which is never really a bad thing when you're a teenage girl.Sound:I loved the music, which is surprising as I'm not usually one for the music in anime. With each mood there was a perfect song to match the atmosphere, which made the overall enjoyment of the romance/action scenes even better. The music was mature and beautiful, and it fitted perfectly with the story line.Characters:I loved the fact that each of the characters grew older and developed new personality traits towards the end of the anime, even small things like the length of their hair, and their height. It made the anime seem more realistic. Each character has their own story and unique personality, and each one of them interested and fascinated me (especially Eugene/Mustafa). At times the men could seem a little bit dramatic, but I think that made them seem more realistic and relatable. Kajika was a female lead unlike any other, she was mature and passionate, and she never once annoyed me like most female anime leads do. They're the most interesting characters I have ever seen in an anime, each of them very admirable and beautiful in their own way.Enjoyment:I really enjoyed most episodes, but there were the odd episode or two were I was desperate to fast forward through to ignore all the political talks. I'm not really interested in politics, but I did at times enjoy the talks. That's really the only bad thing I can think of which would mark my rating down from a 10 to a 9. It's quite hard for me to cram all that information about the different places, people and conspiracies, but when you do understand and take it all in, it becomes very interesting. I think  Hanasakeru Seishounen is probably one of those animes which you need to watch twice to fully appreciate. The romance was great for me, especially the romantic gestures and the beautiful words exchanged between the four men and Kajika. It really moved me when they would talk about finding love, it inspired me too. The whole series is really mature and enjoyable, I've never watched an anime like it before. The best part for me was the fact that it had a good amount of action, which would always leave my heart racing.Don't be put off if you think it sounds too mature, I'm usually into the cute, happy anime which isn't hard to follow, so this was a different direction for me.

I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I did :)"", '>The anime that proves reverse harems can be more than just romance <I’ll start this by stating that I am aware that Hanasakeru Seishonen is ultimately a “romance anime”, however it doesn’t stop it from having quite a few interesting sub-genres that just don’t usually happen to turn into the focus of the story for a very long time like it did in this anime.StoryMost synopses for Hanasakeru Seishonen can never actually prepare you for what the story is actually about, and, sincerely, I think that it’s better without being aware. I dived in, believing that it was a “game of match-making” between rich...people: one girl and 4 candidates. Who will impress her more? Sounded pretty average, a setting that I’ve already seen many times before in k-drama, but that it can always become quite enjoyable if kept to its utmost simplicity… Well, I must take that back.Hanasakeru Seishonen does a reverse harem how a reverse harem should be, which is not limited to simply “main girl falls in love with lots of cute bishies”, but expands its world with a good share of character development and topics. By half of the show, I was questioning whether it was going to keep being a romance-focused anime…Which it partly, didn’t. And I praise that to no end.The story is  very progressive and while it did have some moments that simply apply the famous “anime reverse harem logic” to them, I never really felt like condemning it. Not always at least. One of the moments when I did feel like rolling my eyes, if I had to mention one of them, would be when the characters had an unjustified “feeling” that something is going to go in a certain way, despite them not having a reason to have those sorts of thoughts. It was also implied that a person can feel strongly for something if it’s in their blood to care for that something, which is just a romantic view and not even by far rational.I must say that, at one point, I really felt like the story resembled a Korean drama, which for me, is not exactly the best. Don’t take me wrong, I have nothing against them, nor do I dislike them in any way; it’s just that most of my past experiences with them has scarred my expectations of the genre sometimes (If there are any Korean drama fans reading this, I am aware that not everything is bad and I’m not trying to do a hefty generalization).  What do I mean by that? It tended to be overly-dramatical and overly-angsty, but sometimes it was for good reason. Some other times, mostly during the end of it, it felt like it was just there for the characters to feel miserable for a while, only to move on right after, and I couldn’t really feel anything but annoyed at them in those moments.The ending was also kind of anticlimactic for me, seeing how I really grew tired of that particular trope (which I’ll obviously not mention) and it was a kind of innocent “Love always wins”, which I don’t dislike, but as a generally unromantic person, I hardly fall for that, at least executed the way that it was in Hanasakeru Seishonen. Maybe if it were a bit less obvious, I would have enjoyed it more. I really felt like some of the heroine’s values really contrasted with the rest of the story (which I think was sometimes on purpose) and because of that contrast, I didn’t feel that “Love always wins” would work so well in such a straightforwardly executed way.CharactersIt’s hard to not start with the heroine at this point. She’s definitely not what I’m used to when we speak of reverse harems. Kajika manages to maintain her innocence and sometimes naivety, but she doesn’t let that drag her down. Because she’s naïve, it doesn’t mean that she’s stupid and I’m very glad that the author managed to differentiate the two things. She uses her good natured personality in order to help those in need and her confidence in being able to help actually helped not only others, but even herself towards her personal growth as a person. She also has a very unique belief in life and even if it was weird for the people around her, she never gave up in believing what she wanted to believe is right. But…she starts of the story as a 14 years old.I really can’t understand how a 14 years old girl can act like such a grown-up. Not that it’s impossible, but it’s hard for other people older than her to take her as seriously as they would take somebody their age. This included the guys, which, with the exception of Rumaty, are all over 20 years of age.About the guys, let’s face it. They start off like the most generic archetypes: the childhood friend, the flirty guy, the rebellious shota, the gay-…Wait, what?They definitely can’t just be defined by one word.Fang Li Ren (or Hwang Lee-Leng?…I kept questioning the subs since that name sounds more Korean than it does Chinese so I am sticking with Fang Li Ren) the charismatic childhood friend that can in no way allow himself to be selfish.Eugene de Volkan, a gorgeous-looking playboy that has lost trust in the people around him, yet his reasons go a bit more serious than just the “they use me because I’m handsome” trope.Rumaty Ivan di Raginei, an open-minded prince that is forced to grow up in order to become a king.And lastly, Carl Rosenthal, son of a revenge-driven businessman, who tries to find his own identity and place in the world.It was a nice surprise to see such a diverse cast in this anime and I genuinely can claim that I didn’t care as much for a story and its characters like I did in this case, in a very long time (excepting Noragami, but I’m not counting it, seeing how it’s a second season and a series that already established its place in my heart a long time ago).Animation&OSTOverall typical, but animation doesn’t completely make the story, it just adds to it, and in this case, it did add quite well.OST though, I must recognize that I spammed the opening and ending for this anime continuously from when i started the anime a few months ago to today. They are both sung by k-pop singer, J-Min and she really did a great job at performing.ConclusionI really recommend this to all otome game/reverse harem stories lovers.

If you are the least bit aware of current events, it is clear that the names and places...have been changed to protect the guilty.

Yes those are the man characters but the story is so much more. It starts with a game that leads to a realization of love, sounds simple enough right? Wrong, the story is really something special, like most its a fictional story and must be taken that way so as long as your not a picking it over with a fine tooth comb and trying to find flaws you'll enjoy it if this genre is one you like.  The show does...start out slow and I must say I had to press on through the first 5 or 6. But once you know who's who the story picks up tempo. This is a more mature audiences (not because of adult content but because it is deeper and more refined than your usual happy go lucky anime) romance/minor drama/minor action/minor political. Except the drama doesn't make you want to scream and the political isn't a bore to pay attention too, and the action gets the point across and is more realistic and not stupid. I didn't expect what I got and I was very pleased with what I received in the end.Outline of story: (no spoilers other than outline of events so stop here if don't want to see what's coming)This story begins with a young woman named Kajika Burnsworth. Now if you read the description of the show it will tell you a very small yet crucial aspect. Yes kajika is playing a game of sorts to find a husband, but the story in the story is where this anime becomes great. She meets these 3 different men and changes each of their lives, sounds like an anime theme done to death right, well as it progresses this becomes an issue of a nation and its involves several of the worlds largest corporations in its problems all leading back to oil distribution and a secret past that started it all. The Royalty of this nation changes hands and its is now a race to right the wrongs and bring back balance. Yes this is a vague overview but why should I spoil it for you, go watch it. start out slow and I must say I had to press on through the first 5 or 6.

I didn't expect what I got and I was very pleased with what I received in the end.Outline of story: (no spoilers other than outline of events so stop here if don't want to see what's coming)This story begins with a young woman named Kajika Burnsworth. Now if you read the description of the show it will tell you a very small yet crucial aspect. Yes kajika is playing a game of sorts to find a husband, but the story in the story is where this anime becomes great. She meets these 3 different men and changes each of their lives, sounds like an anime theme done to death right, well as it progresses this becomes an issue of a nation and its involves several of the worlds largest corporations in its problems all leading back to oil distribution and a secret past that started it all. The Royalty of this nation changes hands and its is now a race to right the wrongs and bring back balance. Yes this is a vague overview but why should I spoil it for you, go watch it."", ""I don't normally write reviews but after looking over some of the ratings other lesser anime get, I guess I felt a little obligated to write about why this anime deserves more recognition.story: so the entire story line to this anime was brilliant and tied together very nicely unlike anime we so often see that has characters all shoved into one series with the sole purpose of having a reverse harem and nothing deeper. Every character in this had a purpose and the plot line left no plot holes or things left to be explained. Everything tied together nicely, and I loved that the...main heroine defied the stereotypical norms of a female lead leaving out ALOT of frustration and agony along the way.characters: like I said, a brilliant cast. Every character had a story and a unique personality that more importantly, served a greater purpose. They were relatable characters and I liked that everyone of them had character depth and not just the main ones. the main girl in particular proved to be strong and unique shattering the annoying stereotype Japan typically places on the main female leads.art: the artwork is some of the best i've seen in an anime which fully emphasizes the uniqueness of the entire series.music: the music was pretty lit too I will admit. Everything about this drama was perfect.I would definitely put this under the severely underrated drama category. I don't even remember how I stumbled across this gem but I'm very glad I did. Definitely one of the best anime I've seen in my anime watching career. main heroine defied the stereotypical norms of a female lead leaving out ALOT of frustration and agony along the way.characters: like I said, a brilliant cast.

Definitely one of the best anime I've seen in my anime watching career."", ""When i first came across this anime i thought it would be just another romance, and that's why i watched it because i was in the mood for romance.~Story~At the beginning, the anime stuck to the romance and developing the characters, if you weren't a romance fan the first ten or so episodes would seem just not action packed enough for your liking. After you meet all the suitors you actually leave the path of just a romance and head into the path of political, drama and of course action. There is still romance for the fan girls but not too...much to where it becomes just another fairy tale. The plot was actually very unique, at first it didn't seem so but it really is a very amazing plot. Towards the beginning of the story i think everyone was just expecting a normal romance anime with cute boys, naive girls and far too much fantasy but it became a very intresting and well thought out plot. It goes something like this.The heir to the Burnsworth company, Kajika is asked by her father to play a game in which she will have to choose a husband out of three men whom will not know her and she will not know them. Her father sets up the meetings without telling her anything about the men, only giving her the hint that she will know when she finds them. As she slowly meets the three men and learns about their pasts and possible futures she is thrown into a political nightmare. A small country in the middle east is having problems with their royal family (cant give too much away) And kajika is mixed up in it.~Art~The art and graphics were amazing, one of the best i have seen in anime and im not just saying that so you want to watch it, i truly loved the art. Everything was clear and drawn so well it was like you were transported into a whole new world (Aladin LoL)~Sounds~I don't know why but with a lot of anime they really only have three or four songs throughout the anime like for instance during mecha fight scenes you always hear the same music play, and honestly it gets repetitive and annoying. However that does not apply exactly, yes they don't have a wide variety of songs in this anime but unlike others they place them in a way that makes it so its not as repetitive and it actually doesn't annoy you which was a breath of fresh air.~Characters~Usually the female rolls to me seem either rude,stupid, overly dramatic or too naive but for Kajika this doesn't seem to apply. She is innocent yes but not so innocent where you just want to slap some sense into her. She is also mature for as young as she is, she acts more mature than half the twenty year olds i know and shes only fourteen. Apparently they insinuate that she had to grow up fast due to her being isolated on an island after her mother was killed during a kidnap attempt (Not a spoiler they tell you that in the first or second episode it doesn't effect the story its just background) They don't really touch on the subject of why she had to grow up fast other than that but apparently she just did which is fine.The three (Four) Possible matches for Kajika are all very different in both looks and personality. Theres one that's cold, one that is just terribly sad and lonely, a trouble making one and of course the business like and shy one. They all also are a breath of fresh air from the usual male leads because they aren't as shallow and undeveloped. I liked them a lot for different reasons.In the first episode and two more later on in the series you are introduced to a girl named Yuuie, shes not a main character and i don't know why im bringing her up. She is the only character that annoyed me and only for two reasons. One is because she had some serious lesbian thoughts about Kajika and that's not a bad thing but she takes it too far to when she doesn't get a letter very often she starts questioning their friendship blah blah. Its annoying honestly but you warm up to her eventually she grows on you.All other characters are alright, they dont all need to be brought up.~Enjoyment~Well i have watched this series more than ten times due to the fact that the enjoyment level is very high and ill tell you why! (Ha i rhymed)The characters weren't annoying, the graphics were amazing and obviously took some time, the sound was good because it didn't repeat itself until you wanted to just turn your sound off and the story was amazing.~Overall/Recommend?~Overall i think the anime is one of my favorites for the reasons stated above but also because not only was it good but it was also unique which you don't see a lot in a time where its all about sparkling vampires and werewolves or in anime's case harems and mechas.The biggest question is do i recommend it and to who. Well i recommend this greatly to EVERY type of anime lover because it has a little bit of everything for everyone. Of course there arent any giant robots crashing buildings or anything for the mecha fans but there are quite a lot of guns it that helps. Anyways i give it 10/10 much to where it becomes just another fairy tale. The plot was actually very unique, at first it didn't seem so but it really is a very amazing plot.

Mine is romance, the cheesier the better (shhhhhh, don't look at me!) However, reverse harems have never been a big favorite of mine. My main issue with them is that they make the lead female as dull as a dried up dog turd. I understand why they do this; they want her to be a blank slate so that the viewers can easily see themselves as her (think Bella from Twilight). The lead in the anime actually had a personality! That is what convinced me to watch past the first episode, and i'm glad I did.The lead character really...brings it all together for me, she is kind, and strong willed, and intelligent. Her fault might be she is too perfect and everyone falls for her but thats what to expect from reverse harem. I didn't mind too much because her personality made up for it.The male characters are also nice, there are 4 potential love interests and they are all unique. I was rooting for all them because they were all kind hearted guys,The story is the best i've seen done in a reverse harem anime; there were moments I forgot I was even watching a reverse harem. There is lots of political power struggles and a nice twist (i'm fooled a lot easier than other people so some might figure out the twist early on) The plot was great because it connected all the characters together. Each male suitor played an important role in bringing the meat of the story together, I thought it was really creative.The art and character design we very nice to look at. It wasn't awe inspiring animation, but it was still pretty to look at.I don't really remember the soundtrack, so it wasn't that great but it didn't distract me from what was going on.Overall, if you like romance stories with good plots then i'd give this one a try. I'd say if you've never seen a reverse harem before than this would be a good one to start with. brings it all together for me, she is kind, and strong willed, and intelligent.

It was an interesting story and the plot was the main reason I persisted in watching this to the end. It starts out as the typical reverse harem plot, but ends up branching into so much more, which works in this anime\'s favour because it has little else going for it.Art & Sound: 5/10It was average. It didn\'t wow me, but it didn\'t necessarily disappoint either.Character: 4/10Man, where do I start? Let\'s start with the main character. At some point I started calling her Mary Sue because she\'s off her rocker and everyone around her just goes...with it because they\'re all in love with her. She\'s selfish, entitled, and has no concept of reality or common sense at all. She\'s literally the star of the show and everyone else is just an accessory to her 85% of the time. Most of the time I was thinking, ""You know this is anime because she\'s always getting her way and nobody does anything about it.""Some of the characters were genuinely likeable, and it was every other character, through group effort, that dragged this score up from the ground. Their motivations were more believable and predictable to a degree, if not necessarily more human.Enjoyment: 4/10I hated this for the first like 15 episodes, but I was promised it would get better so I stuck with it. The plot was interesting enough to keep me going, but the characters, most notably the main one, just bogged everything down with what a special little snowflake she was.Overall: 4/10Would not watch again. with it because they\'re all in love with her.

But after the 10th episode, the plot got interesting. A few side character's back stories were compelling enough for you to stick around with the series (e.g. the story of King Mahaty of Raginie)  and it helped hone the story more which lead to some plot twists.If you have the patience to sit a few boring episodes in the beginning, you'll find that the plot is actually quite good in the mid episodes where the events unfold from your typical reverse harem romance to a...more politically involved story line.What annoyed me was the main character Kajika, she was a stuck up spoiled brat snowflake and acts like one which was really aggravating to watch. Although I understand why they portrayed her to be like that since she IS a spoiled daughter to one of  the  richest billionaires in the world so there was really no need for an explanation why she acts that way (shrug). Still, some of her actions were a little over the top reckless and dumb, like acting out without any form of thinking just for the heck of it. It was straight up selfish in a whole new level. Other than that, other characters / side characters were okay. My fav character was prob Li Ren, since he was the only main character that can fight.Music was meh, the opening sounded like the opening for Winx. Eugene's theme was nice though!Overall, It's a great reverse harem anime, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be at first.

This anime has class and sophistication that a lot of anime lacks.The storyline was original and easy to follow along with and it wasn't hard to fall in love with all of the characters. I was meant to be studying for my uni exams... but this series kept me captivated and is a must to watch!!! "", 'HANASAKERU SEISHOUNEN ANIME REVIEWWARNING: SPOILER ALERTOVERALL: 9PLOT: 10/10I\'m trying to find a reverse harem anime when I\'ve come to find this one. I love this kind of genre so I tried watching it. At first, I thought that this was a typical one, which all the guys battle for the girl\'s attention. The story starts when Kajika made a deal to find the candidates picked by his father to be his husband. Though I think it is one of the cliche way of reverse harem, the story goes on a different way. Since the narration takes place on the business industry, it avoids any inappropriate...or common scenario you ought to see in any reverse harem. The twist is somewhat predictable, but still, it made me goosebumps. It still made me cry. It not only tackles the love side, it also show how the business world acts and do the work. It also show friendship and compassion a person can give to someone.  One last thing, the series show how people disagree in something eventhough they have same belief. The way they execute something will be totally different eventhough they want the same outcome. I think, that is the biggest key on why this series became interesting.CHARACTER: 9/10The main protagonist ""Kajika"" is too persistent. I don\'t know if there is a true person out there who is like her. She is too carefree of her surrounding. She decides immediately without thinking. She follows his heart and most often, she lacks awareness. Well, yeah. She\'s a 14-16 years old. She was born an elite. She don\'t know the struggle one average person must bear. But she is also caring, thoughful and a kind one. Though Kajika reflects immatureness, I think it was intended in order for the other characters to show their mature side. In order for them to show the humanness in the series. Each of the character has their own unique traits and beliefs. Each of them successfully show and express their love to Kajika in different ways. They have their weakness and that\'s what make them humane. They change since they met Kajika and they change for the better.SOUND AND ANIMATION: 8/10The animation is quite old. There are times that the faces or the expression of the character is somewhat not attractive to watch. But when it does, it is really good that I almost have 100 screenshots of this series. It slightly reminds me of the anime Akatsuki No Yona. The voices of the character, most of it are fine. While the other characters, you will feel like it is too stoic. In line with the songs of the series, I really love the opening song. The feeling of it is it was the best song for this anime. Something like that. It is not OA. It is too relaxing to listen to.ENJOYMENT: 8/10Yes, the story is great. The character is amazing. And I really did enjoy watching it. Maybe for me, the 39 episodes of this series is just slightly too much? I think it is too long for a romance series and if they want, they can lower it down to 20 plus episodes or exactly 30. Apart from that, it is a great watch.ENDING: 10/10What will you expect in a love story anime?  Of course, that the protagonists and that someone will end up together. And they did. After all the struggles, they did. All the characters went on their rightful places, happy with their life and blessed that they are still living. That\'s the most common ending on this kind of genre. But hey, I think most of us wanted it, really. I also want a happy ending. Thus, I\'m satisfied with how this one ends. or common scenario you ought to see in any reverse harem. The twist is somewhat predictable, but still, it made me goosebumps. It still made me cry.

She has to meet and choose a possible husband from the 3 men his father had handpicked. However, he did not provide any details of the men involved.Story:The series has a pretty clever plot. It has a warm and nice romance and sad drama aspects. At first you will just contemplate that the story is just about the father sought to find a fitting husband for his daughter. But there’s a great secret behind it. As the story progresses, the turn of events...will caught you by surprise. It will leave you with so much anticipation as to the connection of the Burnsworth to the Ragenie Kingdom. However, I was not satisfied with the ending. Kajika’s plan was unpredictable but Lee Leng decision was obvious. Maybe I was just expecting too much.ArtThe animation is fairly decent. I like the environment especially at the opening when kajika was at the island. The flashbacks are ideally executed as well. Also, the character designs are great! This anime is packed with bishoujo and bishounen. Kajika’s facial features are really striking so as Eugene de Volkan, Lee Leng and Rumaty.SoundThe voice acting sounds pleasant and the music is brilliant.

I mean, a father tasks his 14 year old daughter with picking a husband from the men he has chosen for her?! Not exactly realistic. I rolled my eyes the first episode or two, but it got such good reviews I decided to finish. I'm so glad I did!Without giving anything away, I'll say that there's a deeper reason why the heroine of the series is tasked with picking a husband. Also, with every...episode you watch (especially after episode 10 or so) the plot gets more epic. The characters are deep too, and I really enjoyed all of their back stories. Well worth my time watching 39 episodes! episode you watch (especially after episode 10 or so) the plot gets more epic. The characters are deep too, and I really enjoyed all of their back stories. Well worth my time watching 39 episodes!"", ""As an opening statement, I would like to declare that reverse harem has become one of my least favorite genres over my many years of experience watching anime. With my growing age and less tolerance for bad anime, I'd recently given up on even trying to watch any type of reverse harem for the sole reason of saving my time for better things. Despite this, something was compelling me to give Hanasakeru Seishounen, and anime that had been sitting in my PTW for years, a chance. Was it the good rating? The good reviews? The fact that I wanted to watch a romance after seeing...so much action/thriller anime? Who knows. But once I started watching Hanasakeru Seishounen, my god, I could not stop.Story | 10/10The main plotline of Hanasakeru Seishonen tells the story of Kajika Burnsworth, the daughter of a very well-respected and wealthy man, who is told by her father that she will be participating in a husband-hunting game. During this game, Kajika must find and get to know three men that her father randomly appointed as potential husbands, then choose one to marry. I actually really liked the uniqueness of this idea! It's very different from other reverse harem regarding the fact that the female MC is the one who approaches the love interests rather than the other way around. Moreover, she doesn't meet the three men in only a single episode, but gradually over time, meaning that Kajika gets to spend a good bit of one-on-one time with each love interest before the next one is introduced. This allows time for a natural bond to be formed between Kajika and the men, and because of the kindness Kajika shows to them, she becomes an important person in each of their lives. It didn't feel like any of these relationships were forced or poorly paced at all, so when it came time for these men to start realizing that they loved Kajika, I thought it to be perfectly timed out.Before going too deep into the anime, I was a bit concerned on how the story would stretch over a 39-episode time frame considering Kajika had already met two of the three potential husbands by the 10th episode. I was initially worried that the plot would end up revolving around a jealous battle between the men to see who could get Kajika to fall in love with them first, since that's usually what reverse harem turn into once all the love interests are introduced. However, my assumptions about the direction of the story were instantly nullified once something stepped in that made me adore the story even more: the subplot.The problem that seems to plague most reverse harem is that the romantic focus of the MC's relationship with the love interests almost always overpowers the focus of the plot that the anime tries to go for. Hanasakeru Seishounen is very different from this. It has a subplot that revolves around the kingdom of Raginei, which runs for almost the entirety of the second half of the anime. This part of the anime adds in politics, drama, danger, and suspense alongside the romantic aspect, which forms the purpose of the story into something more than just a husband-hunting game. It shifts the anime's focus from finding love to helping friends, and I feel like these friendship elements have always been crucial to the anime due to Kajika's supportive and empathetic personality. Not a single time did I feel like this subplot was irrelevant to the main plot, because even though Kajika becomes involved with bigger events, the fact that she has to choose someone to marry is never forgotten.Once all conflict dies down and it's time for the story to near its end, Kajika finally makes her decision on who she wants to marry. This isn't an anime where the choice is left up to speculation, or even one where Kajika decides that she doesn't want to marry at all. The fact that she follows through with what she was instructed to do in the very first episode brings satisfying closure to the story, and as someone who had been eagerly awaiting for the results of this decision since the beginning, I was overjoyed when I saw that the person of her choosing was exactly who I wanted it to be!Character | 10/10Character depth and development is an attribute that consistently remains strong and well-paced during the entirety of the anime. Hanasakeru Seishounen takes place over a 3 year period, so as the characters grow older, the development works perfectly in transforming them into more mature and well-mannered people over time. Along with that, all five of the main characters were each given very respectable personalities that I quickly fell in love with.Kajika is a phenomenal female lead. She's strong, assertive, and willing to do whatever she can to help those in need. The most attractive part of her personality is her kindness to everyone, even to those who weren't particularly fond of her, and her ability to forgive those who wronged her. Kajika is a genuine role model character who wishes happiness for all, and who will tackle conflict head on to find a solution. Her independent problem-solving skills were probably some of the best I had ever seen come from a female main character in a reverse harem story, and for that Kajika has become one of my absolute favorite strong female leads. It was so fun watching her character in action.I won't cover all the men specifically - them being Eugene, Rumaty, Carl, and Li Ren - but I want to cover them as a group. Throughout the anime, all of these men fall deeply in love with Kajika. For them, the kindness Kajika has shown to them has shaped them into the people they are by the end of the anime, so she's a very valued and important person to them. Despite their love for her, and their wishes for her to feel the same way toward them, not a single one of them EVER try to force themselves on her. This!! This is a HUGE thing for me! Though it is so obvious these men want so badly to embrace Kajika, they don't because they respect her boundaries and don't want to put her in an awkward or uncomfortable situation. Not only that, but they also don't wine, complain, or even try to give her reasons why she should choose them instead when Kajika finally decides on who she wants to marry. Hell, the guys she ended up turning down even HELP her reunite with the one she chose when a problem had them separated. Though Kajika's feelings for them were only platonic, they didn't let their love for her stop her from being with the person that SHE loved. That's respect, and I loved this part of these men!Art | 9/10I truly can't deny the fact that I love me some bishounens! The style of this anime DEFINITELY caters toward a female demographic with its abundance of pretty boys, but honestly I expected no less. Romance stories are told best when the characters are attractive, in my opinion, and Hanasakeru Seishounen excelled in presenting a beautiful cast of both male and female characters (Li Ren especially, lol).In all seriousness though, I try not to judge an anime based on its art, but when the art and animation are attractive, that's definitely a plus. Complimenting the gorgeous art style is animation that is without mistakes and smooth. The animators also did a great job making younger characters like Kajika and Rumaty appear older after the one year time jump as well as keeping this slight change consistent throughout the rest of the anime.One thing that put me off though - and it's more hilarious to me than anything - was that you could tell the difference between a main/heavy supporting character and a mere background character just by the shape of their noses. The main characters had pointed noses, which is a feature that somewhat adds to the attractiveness of an anime character, while the background characters had round noses, thus making them less attractive. There's nothing more to it than that, I just thought it was a funny little detail.Sound | 9/10Despite being an anime with 39 episodes, Hanasakeru Seishounen only features one opening and ending theme, both of which I found to be super cute, catchy, and hard to skip. If the previous episode had ended on a cliffhanger that left me impatient regarding what was to come, I may have been guilty of fast-forwarding through the themes. On the other hand, if I wasn't totally dying to know where the story would go, I happily let the themes play all the way through.Instrumental soundtracks in anime usually aren't memorable for me. However, I can definitely say that the music within this anime did an amazing job capturing the mood of each scene. Whenever the emotions of a character changed, there was an orchestra right behind it, enhancing those feelings so they could reach the watcher. This made the atmosphere of character emotions feel more realistic to me, which created a watching experience that was all the more entertaining.Enjoyment | 10/10I'm so happy that I caved in to the urges and decided to give this anime a chance! Unlike most other reverse harem I've seen, Hanasakeru Seishounen delivered a beautiful and charming start-to-finish story that I absolutely adored. There was never a dull moment in the plotline, which constantly gave me a desperate feeling of eagerness to find out what would happen next, and I fell in love with each and every character. The ending was also extremely satisfying and was a great closing to a remarkable story. Nothing about what was delivered made me sense that things could be improved if something else was done. Overall, Hanasakeru Seishounen left a very warm place in my heart. I truly wish other reverse harem were as ambitious as this one. so much action/thriller anime? Who knows.

For a while into this series it was just 'good'. Watching it I just thought 'oh its a typical reverse harem just more serious'. Boy was I wrong. In so many ways and I'm so glad I was. The story starts off with the base line of Harry setting up this game for Kajika but grows into things so much more. The story flows beautifully and there are many moments when dots connect.Art - Gorgeous. The art is amazing. The eyes especially. I was blown away by how expressive the eyes were. Eyes are key factors...in this story and the artists did a good job taking their time to make them gorgeous. When you look into the characters eyes it feels like they are talking to you. You feel their emotion and meaning. All of it makes your heart ache in a good way.Sound - I have never been so moved than by the ending song. Wow. Its so beautiful it at one point moved me to almost tears. The intro is good and the sound effects are good. They dont distract at all but go with the story.Character - Highest of High. The amount of development is amazing. Most reverse harems it's obvious who the main character will choose. That and there is a lack of depth for the rest of the characters, clear evidence they aren't the chosen one. But in this story each character has a strong back story leading up to who they are. Every single character is fully created. It's one of those stories, at least for me, where I cant find the villain. No matter how much one may seem 'bad' they still give reasons that make me feel only pity and love for them. I fell in love with each character for different ways. Making all the characters likable and still have a solid story is hard but they did an outstanding job on it.Enjoyment - Get through the first like 10 episodes and it'll start to all make sense and become far more enjoyable. The beginning is very slow its one of those 'its boring but ill watch it anyways...' so bare with it through the first slow moving  episodes and it picks up fast.overall - if you asked me at the beginning of the anime my opinion would be different but this is hands down one of my favorite animes.It's so meaningful and deep and really inspires me. I love that about anime. For whatever reason, anime reaches out to me more than most stories. Reading stories or watching the 'normal' channels doesn't reach out and inspire me even close to how anime can reach out to me.Maybe I'm watching the wrong stuff but Anime is beautiful and this show captures the beauty and how inspirational it is. It really makes you reevaluate yourself, others, and life.I sincerly hope you enjoy this series as much as I did and get as much from it as you can. It has a lot to offer besides a fun pass time and guy candy.

She indeed is beautiful but not naive, and you can see the character development during the progress of the story,...that\'s why I loved this anime so much and I really appreciated Kajika.The guys are all beautiful and they have particular stories behind, they don\'t fall in love at first sight with her but it took time and she gained their heart with her generosity.The art is indeed beautiful and flawless, the characters have their own characteristics and are not ""all the same with different hair/eye colours"" so i have to take this into consideration.The opening is nice, I liked it, I can\'t say the same for the ending.The japanese voices fit the characters.If you are looking for a reverse harem who goes out the normal plot, watch this one!

I love a lot of old anime, because they have this charm that is absent from a lot of productions nowadays, and this one is no exception. A very charming piece that might seem to carry the normal associations of any fluffy shoujo anime, but is surprisingly full of twists!Story (10)Ah~ I\'m not sure if I can say much without spoiling stuff along the way, so I\'ll keep it brief. Go into this expecting the ""typical shoujo anime"" and you will be shocked. The story has so much...more going on for it, and there is rarely a dull moment. I love how the anime steps out of the stereotype of typical ""love"", and introduces many kinds of love throughout. The only thing to look out for is the time-line, because they tend to jump a month or even a year in just a few episodes, so don\'t be surprised if you suddenly realize that a year has passed since (insert event here) has happened :)Conclusion: Story-wise, you will not be disappointed.Art (8)Hmm not much to say here. The art can be a bit awkward at times, but even if one is used to the all new gorgeous animation, one will eventually get used to it.

It shows how the japanese thinks middle easterners are.The idea for the story was great. An industrialist father having his daughter choose a husband. But past that I don't feel that this story was all that great. The first episode was slow but it picked up momentum. I liked the first 10 episodes, but then it just became too centered around the political aspects of a foreign country with ties to the lead female and her father. I now wish I would have watched the first 12 or so episodes and then the last 5 episodes. It...was ok. I really loved Hana Yori Dango and was hoping for this to be more like that. was ok.

The story is a little slow to start up. But as a lot of the really good ones are slow to open, the storyline becomes intense, interesting, plot twists and you become very attatched to the characters. I'd recomend it to anyone who likes Fushigi Yuugi, Saiunkoku Monogatari, Inu Yasha and those type of intense plot lines.With out spoiling the story this is as much as I can say. I'd definatly recomend giving it ago. You can't say you hate it till you've seen...it. it."", 'i love this show so far; mahati is pretty good im actually liking the fact that theres going to be 36 eps total!! yay. ', 'Plot:We have Kajika, a girl who has grown up on the island of Givori with Maria, her adoptive mother (and visits of Liren, her actual bodyguard). And we have her father Harry who, one day, with Kajika at the age of 14, asked her to come back to America, because of an important subject he wanted to talk about with her. The important topic? “Your future is going to be harsh, but I won’t tell you anything until your husband sits in that chair” “I prepared a game for you to find your husband. I have been searching for the three perfect candidates for...the past 12 years. However, you don’t know them, and they don’t know you. The only thing I will do is prepare your encounters.” And that marks the start of this crazy inverse harem game, which, against all odds, will grasp you and throw you into a political conflict in the Kingdom of Raginei for 24 of the 39 episodes.The first five ones are quite slow, being the focal point Eugene, his backstory, and his “salvation” by Kajika. However, the story gets rolling PLENTY after this, since you are dragged without you being aware, to the Raginei’s crown heir battle. The moment Rumaty enters the anime, this one changes 180º: We are presented the backstory of Mahaty, Rumaty’s grandfather and last king of Raginei; the king of Raginei dies while Rumaty is in U.E in Kajika mansion and he’s accused of treason and murder; etc, etc… As you can read, a lot of things going on, and that is not even 1% of the plot. 39 episodes give a lot of space for the development of conflicts and a great outcome, and fortunately, this anime didn’t waste any of the capacity they had. Even the harem inverse game gets a good-paced, closed ending. The only complaint I could have is that the final couple for a moment feels a little forced (There’s like one episode gap from the moment Kajika understands and is conscious of the fact that she loves X, to the moment she declared her love).Another complaint: The ages. It’s really surrealistic, to the point me, myself, was correcting the ages in my mind because Kajika looked and acted like a 17 years old girl. (And so goes on with Rumaty and all the characters).Leaving that aside, great pacing, marvelous political conflict development, and great characters backstories and reasons of why is Harry, or the Fang family rich people (you know, not like in Fifty shadows of Grey when Grey is rich because he is a big C.E.O and that is).The art:It is kinda “old shoujo and a little bit of josei” style. The character’s designs look way more mature than their real ages (one of the reasons I rectified the ages in my mind). Nevertheless, the design per se is attractive, and I loved the male MC’s models (Specially Rumaty’s). The weapons drawings and the concept of the kingdom of Raginei, as well as the clothes, are enjoyable to watch, making you feel more immersed at the same time.The opening sequence, along with the ending, does have not impressive artwork but is entertaining and pleasant to view.The soundtrack:Definitely, there are a couple of tracks that you can hear at any moment after finishing the anime, and immediately you will connect it to Hanasakeru. Some of them are iconic, played in the most important scenes, and oh boy, they offer a lot of ambiances and are perfect for the vibes and feeling the creators wanted to give to the scene.Also, the opening and the ending are *chef kiss* absolute perfection. J-min’s voice is wonderful and the English-Japanese mix is truly sticky.Characters (spoilers ahead)!:Again in the most extensive part of my reviews. I will try to keep this short (I even made a rest so I could write this part in the greatest way).Let’s start with Kajika, our MC, a rich girl, heir of the Burnsworth fortune and industry. She’s a woman strong-hearted, extremely sympathetic, and brave. Her mother died when she was two years old in order to protect her, being that the reason why she grew up on an island without external contact until she was 14 years old. Even with this kinda catastrophic background, Kajika never complained or never showed sadness toward her past (I want to think it was because she is a truly shiny and happy person, and not because the writers forget to take into account all the trauma she could have got with those events).She cries for others because she understands others’ feelings way more than the average person (to the point Eugene’s father saw an angel in her). Also, she fights for the things she wants and is based on her own sense of justice, not satisfied with being just the stereotypical “Harem inverse MC”. NEVERTHELESS, there are quite an amount of decisions she makes that are sold to us as heroic when, if you think about them with a cold head, you will be aware that she is actually quite selfish and ignorant and most of the time ends up being saved by others (there are obviously exceptions for both extremes).Leaving that, the main core of Kajika’s personality, there is nothing more to say. There’s not much development in her, except the fact that she learns to understand what type of love she has for every one of the boys. She doesn’t even flinch when she is told that she is the first one in the line of throne, so… Quite a bland character, but better than average. At least she is direct and quite resolved, not “OMG, I lack decision-making abilities, I’m just dumb.”I can’t really extend myself that much, so let’s shortly talk about the boys, notably Rumaty and Eugene.On the other hand, Liren, for me at least, feels a little bit cliché: a boy with great pressure since the moment he was only a child, and obliged to mimic the adults in order to fulfill his role as the next leader of the Fang family. Ends up leaving the family because of his true love for Kajika, but before that, he has conflicts between choosing her over his own family and all his own reason of being.And Carl didn’t have so much screentime (though I truly liked his character development. Having less time than the others three, he had defined objectives and personality, in addition to a well-defined claustrophobia with a greatly explained reason. A deep look in his family and relationship with his father. I think the author accomplished a lot more with him than with Liren, taking into account he was the last boy to appear.Rumaty is the character that got the majority of the spotlight, in addition to the fact that he is the best developed of all. He goes from a boy quite arrogant and inconsiderate to a whole leader, worthy of the crown of Raginei, patient, thoughtful of his people, good strategist, and determined to save his country. Everything was shaped because of the political events of his Kingdom, as well as the fact that his own brother tried to kill him through indirect people. From the first time he gets into the scene, to the episode climax (34-35), the spectator can see the evolution. What is more, you end up feeling genuinely proud of him, since you actually saw him grow. There’s waaaay too much to say about him, so I propose you watch the anime if you are interested. For him, it is worth it.Gotta end this with a short opinion about Eugene as a character. “I prefer to live with eternal pain, before living only an instant of pure love, if, with that, I can be connected to you for eternity”, that says a lot about him, don’t you think?Eugene is a boy who didn’t see value in his own existence. From an early age, he found out that he was the by-product of the revenge his “father” wanted to give to his grandmother. His mother, found also for this revenge, killed herself when she was nineteen. She thought that Eugene was a cursed child of a dead man. These events pushed Eugene to be how he was, having in mind the plan of also killing himself before getting to his twenties. However, on the appointed day, Kajika was there, and with a gun, she “killed” the old Eugene by shooting his reflection in the mirror. The quote I wrote before means that the love Eugene has for Kajika is pure love. He sees her as his savior, one to be respected, not touched, protected, like an angel or goodness. He wants to be attached to her forever and never forget about her, nor change his ideals regarding Kajika.He also changes and grows through the episodes, visible particularly In his relationship with Liren.(Spoilers end!!!)Enjoyment:For me, extremely enjoyable overall because of the political conflicts, I got really hooked up. I wasn’t a big fan of the final couple though, but they are cute.This anime is definitely worth watching if you like well-written and a little bit more complex inverse harem genres. And don’t be scared of it being 39 episodes, it disappears really fast.Thanks for reading, hope it was useful <3. the past 12 years. However, you don’t know them, and they don’t know you.

He wants to be attached to her forever and never forget about her, nor change his ideals regarding Kajika.He also changes and grows through the episodes, visible particularly In his relationship with Liren.(Spoilers end!!!)Enjoyment:For me, extremely enjoyable overall because of the political conflicts, I got really hooked up. I wasn’t a big fan of the final couple though, but they are cute.This anime is definitely worth watching if you like well-written and a little bit more complex inverse harem genres. And don’t be scared of it being 39 episodes, it disappears really fast.Thanks for reading, hope it was useful <3.', 'Personally, I like this anime very much, the art work is beautiful, sound is alright but its not that great and the story was indeed good :).Although, the whole point of this anime was for Kajika to chose a ""husband"",and I do think that the story is a little slow. But, like I said, its really nice.I would recommend this to anyone who likes Bokuro No Gita, or any kind of harems/love triangles etc.Overall, I would give this a 8/10 (= ', 'My first review..I feel I need to write this though it may differ from others\' point of view. The overall of this show is a pain for me. I took almost three (3) years to finish this anime cause it was not able to keep me interested. Knowing it is reverse harem, i so thought its going have some quality of Saiunkoku Monogatari. How wrong of me...The characters of the show are too 2D especially Kajika who lack lots of ""personal character development"" over the run of episodes. The other characters are too typical in a shoujo that you can guess their next movement. Furthermore,...the culture  portrayed on each character was haywire and lack details.For example, an American with a name Kajika (why it sounds too Japanese??)...Singapore looking too oriental you might mix it with HK (SG was entirely wrong in this show except for the buildings and trees drawn) and Raginei...I laugh when seeing Kajika wearing hot pants in Raginei (would anyone be wearing hot pants when everyone is covering up from head to feet)The plot is interesting but only for awhile till it becomes too draggy. Watching the script laid for each character, one after another..it keep on pushing my limit button that I just want the show to be done and over with.I was tempted to give this show an overall 3 but i took into consideration that the art + sound was fair even though other areas lack greatly. My best part of this show is its OP and ED songs. With these songs in mine, i settle for a 4/10.Unless you really like character that does not have development and typical shoujo boys flaunting good looks and simple non mind blowing script..I do not recommend this show the culture  portrayed on each character was haywire and lack details.For example, an American with a name Kajika (why it sounds too Japanese??)...Singapore looking too oriental you might mix it with HK (SG was entirely wrong in this show except for the buildings and trees drawn) and Raginei...I laugh when seeing Kajika wearing hot pants in Raginei (would anyone be wearing hot pants when everyone is covering up from head to feet)The plot is interesting but only for awhile till it becomes too draggy.

While trying to sort out whom she loves among her potential husbands, Kajika and her suitors find themselves caught up in an international conflict that our heroine has closer ties to than she realizes.At a glance, Hanasakeru Seishounen may have you assume that it may be a typical romance shoujo series with several attractive men taking interest in the title’s lead heroine. But...the series has a bit more depth to its storytelling than what you would see on the surface. The major characters wind up getting caught up in a civil war within the Middle Eastern country of Raginei, a situation that personally affects  Kajika and a few other major characters through later episodes of the series. While I won’t spoil how deep things get with this element of the series, I will say that this has its fair share of revelations and developments that make it perhaps the most engaging plot element of the series.In addition, characterization for the series offers solid development for many of its major and supporting characters. Kajika is a strong-willed heroine who undergoes a good deal of development in not only getting involved with the conflict in Raginei, but also coming to understand more about what it truly means to love through the marriage game. The young men within said marriage game are fleshed out with each having their personal issues that need to be sorted out, which Kajika plays a role in helping them out with to drive along their character developments. The series also introduces a number of supporting characters within Raginei who get their fair share of fleshing out to explore how they are affected by the issues within their country.While having a solid foundation for story and characters, Hanasakeru Seishounen isn’t without its imperfections. The visuals for the series do feel like a product of its manga source material’s time period with the artwork and rather stiff looking animation. It also doesn’t shy away from some common cliches of shoujo titles that hinder the storytelling to a degree with many female characters outside of Kajika largely being relegated to antagonistic or irrelevant roles and some points in the series that felt added in just for some needless drama. Plus, the premise itself of 14-year old Kajika tasked with choosing among several young men in their late teens to early 20s may be an issue with some Western audiences considering our heroine’s young age.In short, the romance and political intrigue of Hanasakeru Seishounen’s story gives it some intriguing story and character developments that I’ll admit kept me engaged to the series for the most part throughout its 39-episode run. It has some storytelling issues typical of titles aimed for the shoujo demographic and the premise may not be everyone’s cup of tea.

Hanasakeru Seishounen is what it promises to be - but it gives more on top of that.  The story, albeit fantastical at times is actually very interesting - and will make complete sense in the second season.  Thought has gone into to all of these characters, in particular, the backstory of the female lead, her parents and even her grandparents is wonderfully explored.The art style is fitting although I would love to see it redone today in a more...2019 fruits basket style, especially for the eyes of the characters.  There is a lot of character development too, from what I remember, particularly the protagonist actually comes of age in her coming of age story - which a surprisingly rare feat for an anime.You really will not be disappointed in this show, and on that note, go watch it! 2019 fruits basket style, especially for the eyes of the characters.

Fruits Basket,https://myanimelist.net/anime/120/Fruits_Basket,"[""Story &amp; Characters10/10At first glance Furuba is just another Shoujo manga with nothing different to it; the average, beautiful, kind girl getting all the pretty boys. Okay so it really is that, however there's a special touch to the way the series develops itself and how you watch each character grow and interact with each other as the story progresses.The story starts with Tohru Honda, your as average-as-you-can-get japanese girl who has lost her mother in an accident and was living alone in a tent in the Sohma's property. Of course she wasn't aware of that until they told her, to her surpirse they...take her in in exchange for her doing all the housework (it was her who suggested not staying in the house 'for free'). It's when she's there that she discovers the family's biggest secret... The family has been cursed by the vengeful spirits of the Chinese Zodiac animals and when they are hugged by a member of the opposite sex they transform into the animal they were cursed by. When Tohru comes in their life they all learn to open up their heart more and realize that not all the people in the worlds are bad; this girl affects each one of them in a unique way.It's a beautiful Anime with heart-touching subjects, there is much you can learn from it and definitely worth buying if the chance should present. There is just about everything in this series:bishonen, angst, drama,comedy, romance, shounen-ai hints and a light-hearted, kind bishojo showing us the way.Art8/10The character designs are beautiful and would characterize everyone in the series a bishonen and bishojo. The colors of the hairs and eyes of the Sohma Family match with the animal they were cursed by and it gives each one of them a unique touch.Tohru's design is supposed to be as average as possible since she represents a normal japanese girl.There's is also a 'big abuse' of Super-Deformed characters (Ex. Chibi form) but it just serves to highlight the emotion they are expressing and make the show even more funny.Sound9/10The music is simply beautiful, although the 26-episode long series only has one opening(For Fruits Basket) and one ending (Chiisana Inori) (both performed by Ritsuko Okazaki) it serves it's purpose leaving you with a serene calm sensation!The soundtrack used as background music is delicate and simpleHowever if you haven't watched the series and just purchase the soundtrack for the sheer pleasure of it you will be disappointed since it is nothing special by itself, you must see the anime first so you can relate each short song to a scene.As far as the seiyuu's gone they all seemed to fir their character perfectly. Tohru's voice was Yui Horie who also voiced for Love Hina's Narusegawa Naru. Her sweet, sharp voice goes in tune with Tohru's personality perfectly.Enjoyment10/10You won't find a boring episode in this series. Each one develops and focuses's on a character's situation. Although the series was cut short abruptly and much ends were left untied (the manga is still running) seeing by itself will leave you satisfied (if not with a small crave for the continuity of it).As mentioned before there's much you can learn from this anime since it deals with how we must see our own beauty and not be jealous of other's (among other important themes). take her in in exchange for her doing all the housework (it was her who suggested not staying in the house 'for free').

People turning into the Chinese zodiac animals, dark and mysterious secrets surrounding them, cute, clueless main heroine – isn\'t that a great premise for a shoujo series? But only as long as it\'s executed accordingly.I decided to watch Fruits Basket after seeing how high it is rated. I wouldn\'t normally watch a  shoujo series, since I find most of them exaggerated and unrealistic – that\'s why, I expected Furuba to really change my opinion regarding them. Instead, I found Furuba to be exactly what I mostly disliked...and avoided in this genre – with a really more unnatural and forced tone. Do not get me wrong; I do not hate Fruits Basket; yet I really couldn\'t feel anything else besides disappointment the moment I completed it, and this review explains why.STORYFuruba\'s story is surrounded by a dramatical and emo[tional] darkness upon which Tohru shines like a ray of redemptive hope. Because of that, 50% of the story is actually made up of Tohru\'s (and sometimes other characters\' too) internal struggling monologues that pretty much unfold along the lines of ""Is is right? Isn\'t it right? Is it wrong? Isn\'t it wrong?"". The other 50% of the story might actually trick the viewer into believing that something happens - when it\'s usually just a repetition of the same overly used gags. There\'s no beginning, no development, no ending. It doesn\'t get anywhere.To put it simply, Fruits Basket doesn\'t have a plot. Its entire \'story\' could be summed up through the following sequence of (randomly ordered) events: Tohru acts dumb yet unbelievably nice which, in turn, causes other characters to also act this way, even though it isn\'t part of their personality, repeat; Kyo and Yuki fight, repeat; cliché and unfunny member of the Sohma family appears, repeat; Kyo and Yuki fight again, repeat; irrelevant episodic character that barely says a line throughout the whole series has an entire episode dedicated to themselves, repeat; Kyo and Yuki fight yet again, this time in a more dramatic light. Repeat.Another bad aspect of the story is that it\'s ridiculously sweet, to the point that it loses all the bits of realism it could have had. It\'s clear that the creators wanted to have a mixed show, that doesn\'t only focus on the dramatical solving of tragic events, but also contains its funny moments. This in turn causes Furuba to have serious flaws, both in terms of execution  and logic. Many times, the scenes change too quickly from overly-serious to (attempted) pink surrounded, humorous gags that pop up out of nowhere. Other times the events just don\'t add up. A clear example of this is Tohru living in a tent at the beginning of the series because she doesn\'t want to \'bother\' anyone [thing which the viewer should find utterly amusing]. Apparently, she has a lot of people that care about her (grandfather, friends) yet they never check upon how she\'s doing. Yet somehow, the rest of her relatives actually go through the trouble of hiring a detective to find out where she lives when they could have simply followed her from school or asked her.And lastly, in terms of storyline, Furuba is really stretched out for the amount of events it has to offer. Perhaps, had Furuba been a 13 episodes series and not a 26 one, with the same amount of story, it would have actually been entertaining. It\'s not just the slow pace that pretty much puts you to sleep; there\'s also the fact that sceneries, lights, wind are constantly emphasized just so that there\'ll be something to fill the gap and make an entire episode of something that could have been summed up in 5-10 mins.CHARACTERSFruits Basket\'s characters are clear examples of shoujo genre gone wrong. Not only are they cliché, predictable and pretty much one-dimensional; they give off the feeling of being unnatural. There\'s something forced into them, whether it\'s the personality, the way they interact or their role. They seem to just be there for the sake of existing; therefore they don\'t have any apparent purpose or impact upon the viewer.Tohru:Tohru is a girl who\'s gone through a lot in her life, as it is clearly shown since the very beginning of the anime. Considering the amount of bad events she experienced, you\'d expect her to be really introverted and (perhaps) pessimistic. Yet Tohru completely overthrows that, by not only being happy-go-lucky all the time, but also exaggeratedly clueless and nice to everybody, no matter the circumstances. There\'s a thin line between being inhumanly selfless and being ridiculously dumb, and Tohru seems to be stepping on it quite often. Because of that, most of the other characters seem to half divinize her. There\'s also another particular thing about Tohru. She doesn\'t seem to have any ambition for herself whatsoever, so she never asks for help – which brings up the question, is she really weak or is she really strong? Perhaps both, but she certainly isn\'t realistic or enjoyable.Yuki:Yuki is the least enjoyable out of the entire cast. Now, traps are one thing, effeminate characters other – but when some random character in the shows says: “Oh my, there\'s an interesting young person out there, but I can\'t tell whether it\'s a guy or a girl – isn\'t it exciting?”, that\'s a totally different thing. According to most of the other characters throughout the show and even himself, Yuki is a guy, though his personality, voice and appearance certainly don\'t show that. Why he was built that way is uncertain – there are a few attempts of making fun of this, but the humor fails, as usual.Apart from when he\'s annoyingly correct by being the right person in the right place, Yuki is barely noticeable. However, his existence does seem to serve two purposes. First one is a Fruits Basket must: have a tragic, unexplainable and never actually detailed past that makes him dark and gloomy, which in turn asks for one of Tohru\'s miraculous healing techniques. Second is to serve as an opponent for Kyo – which is one of the most reused and unfunny gags throughout the show.Kyo:Kyo is probably the only character that actually suffers some sort of development. In the beginning, he\'s presented as a violent, leek-hating, anti-social idiot. In the end he\'s still violent and idiotic (though to a smaller scale), but at least he isn\'t lonely anymore and he\'s eaten leeks. Despite the fact that Kyo is also a cliché character, he\'s at least enjoyable, because he\'s a bit more realistic. Kyo has a lot of personality flaws, but there\'s one thing that compensates them: he at least sees Tohru as being weird and unhealthy for herself (which all the other characters seem to be blind to). Unfortunately, Kyo is never actually allowed to speak for himself since he\'s an outcast. It\'s clearly stated throughout the anime that the other Sohma members can\'t stand him; yet, as usual, it\'s never quite explained why. Despite this, Kyo could have had a lot of development and story going on around him. Unfortunately, the ending spoiled everything.Sohma members+ Tohru\'s friends:The rest of the Sohma family members and Tohru\'s friends were created so they would be as weird and different as possible, yet they all share the same characteristics. Their past is dark and tumultuous so they anchor around Tohru; on top of that, they are all one-dimensional commonly encountered types of characters. Shigure is the pervert, Kagura is the good-willed yet always screwing up girl, Momiji is the cute shouta boy, Risa is the sweet innocent girl and so on. But that\'s the end to it. There\'s nothing more to them; yet countless of repetitive unfunny gags are made of their only side. In the end, they are all too many and too similar to remember or enjoy.ART AND SOUNDFuruba\'s art and sound are certainly nothing exceptional – yet they\'re not bad either. They all add up to the unrealistic, sweet and pink impression the show is trying to leave. There seems to be specific effort put into backgrounds and into the (often really big) eyes. The voice actors capture the personalities of the characters they portray really well (maybe sometimes too well, but it\'s in the series\' nature to be exaggerated), especially during monologues or conflicts. The OP and ED were some of the very few generics that I constantly skipped – they were too slow-paced and fluffy for my taste. The background music also didn\'t really stand out – but is wasn\'t unpleasant.ENJOYMENTFuruba really isn\'t enjoyable, unless you\'re a fan of slow-paced, warmth and fuzzy feelings inducing series that stretch too much and don\'t get anywhere. I expected something funny like Ouran or Yamato Nadeshiko before watching this; yet I was thoroughly disappointed. The whole anime seemed to be a mixture of randomly thrown in characters trying to act dramatic and special, but not leaving any particular positive impression. They were predictable, boring and irrelevant. Also, I really couldn\'t get over the few logic flaws (like Japan leaving its orphans to suffer in tents, Tohru being able to magically teleport herself from the forest to the cemetery and back to the forest [during the last episode] or the too sudden mood changes from tragic to overly happy).OVERALLEven though Fruits Basket had a pretty good premise to start from and quite the numerous cast of characters, it really couldn\'t get past the “Everything is so sad, oh! Let\'s bring Tohru in so it\'ll be nice and shiny” feeling. Furuba is a series that doesn\'t leave any positive feelings while watching and certainly not after being completed. The viewer is basically left where it all started from – no plot or character development whatsoever, nothing explained, nothing major accomplished. Therefore, it really doesn\'t get past the state of being a mediocre series with nothing special. and avoided in this genre – with a really more unnatural and forced tone.

Let\'s bring Tohru in so it\'ll be nice and shiny” feeling. Furuba is a series that doesn\'t leave any positive feelings while watching and certainly not after being completed. The viewer is basically left where it all started from – no plot or character development whatsoever, nothing explained, nothing major accomplished. Therefore, it really doesn\'t get past the state of being a mediocre series with nothing special.', ""Fruits Basket is a wonderful and moving story which I consider myself fortunate enough to have been shown by a very close friend.

I admit it, I was originally a fan! But recently I went back to rewatch what I had once found so brilliant, and I noticed something... I found it 'dreadful'.It's a shoujo anime. Yes, it has a twist (or perhaps twists?), and a calming sort of mood to it, but almost everything is predictable, and there is certainly nothing appealing (to me) about most of the characters....Actually, the only I found tolerable (upon second viewing) was Haru, even then he wasn't exactly unique. Even Tohru's best friends were overused in the world of anime. An ex gang member, and a paranormal/psychic girl? Overused in shoujo, it seems... Though weren't be heart warmed when we discover how loyal they are to their friend Tohru who accepted them regardless of their quirks? Sure... If this is your first anime, maybe.However, as far as entertainment goes, the series is very appealing to types who can stand the mary-sue infested reverse harem, such as this. In fact, for those types, this could very well be their favourite anime, and I can see why. It just isn't for me, and I'm sure anyone with any longing for character originality or story would agree.

A few weeks later, I insisted my mother buy a DVD from the anime series, sadly I only watched the last six episodes, and then a few months ago Hakoot let me borrow the series from her, and how happy I was.Anyway, Fruits Basket is about the orphan Torhu Honda who starts the story out by living in a tent in the woods.

It's not that the story was at all bad, it just wasn't very good.  But the story and writing was fluff, not just a little fluff, I mean so fluffy that it's like falling into a vat of cotton candy with rose petals.  This show is that fluffy.  Then again I'm a guy so I may not get the whole point since this show is the physical...manifestation of GIRLINESS, the ultimate shoujo.  I felt very awkward but oddly I liked it more as I watched, which I still wonder whether that is a good thing or not.The last two episodes change the mood of the series, drastically.  They were both slower than the rest of the series with long still shots.  Though as a rule the series is slow, but I think it was the perfect pace for a storyline of this type.  But the final episodes were the strong point of the plot of the show (even though it doesn't happen the same way in the manga).  The ending was not satisfactory, but it did get me dying to read the manga, so was that their goal?The friendship speeches could have been very annoying, but they weren't (shounens could take some lessons from this series).  In fact they were well spoken and argued the fact fairly logically, but incredibly fluffy.  The moral of the episode format was admittedly heartwarming and not predigested like so many other shows (especially when it comes to most things made by westerners).Art: 6The art was nothing spectacular, I didn't see it as particularly well done.  The backgrounds were good but the animation was simplistic and not overly smoothe. Though the simplistic style helped when it came to punchlines.  The character designs were good, but still didn't overly impress me.Sound: 8Music, not that great.  Just listen to the intro.  Nothing in the series popped out and I think more dynamic music could have helped.  The voice acting in the dub on the otherhand was perfection.  Everyone was cast wonderfully, though at times I found Kyo a bit annoying, but it was probably the personality of the character more than anything.  Yuki had a soothing and calming voice, actually the majority of the cast was soothing and relaxing on the ears, save three characters, but they're meant to be that way.  This is a good series to watch before bed, so you can have a night of nice voices and fluffy happy dreams.Character: 9The characters in this series are probably some of the best made and most memorable of all anime.  They are very deep and more than meets the eye.  I paricularly loved Shigure with all his exasperation and pervy comments (which he said purely for reaction and a smack on the head).  Tohru may seem a bit too good to be true, but I can find her believeable since I have a sister EXACTLY like her, so much so it was creepy and I'm so glad she lives in a protective family.The secondary cast was surprisingly good, I can't say that any of the supporting characters had any notable flaws.  The villain of the series remains mysterious and intimidating and to this day I have no idea what to make of him (again I must read the manga).Overall: 7A bucket of fluff and warm fuzzies that gives some good life lessons.

It really took me back...one of those really old school super mangas that I used to read.  The anime tells the story of Tohru Honda after the death of her mom.

"", '[Disclaimer: I am Reviewing the English Dub. Also, there may be some spoilers along the way. You have been warned!!!]“I don’t think anyone is born knowing the reason why they’re here it’s just something you have to find as you go along”- Honda Tohru (Fruits Basket)At first glance, Fruits Basket may appear to be an anime catered specifically to girls, but when looked closely, it is obvious that it can be enjoyed by a much wider audience. Since Fruits Basket is a reverse-harem series with elements of fantasy thrown in, it is only natural to bracket it in the realm of Shoujo anime. However, that...is not the case because Fruits Basket adds depth and originality to the generic world of reverse-harems.Story 9/10The Story is about an orphan girl named Tohru Honda whose life changes after encountering two members of the Sohma family: Shigure and Yuki. Ooh and guess what else? Similar to other fantasy shows, there is a curse upon the Sohma family, which turns them into their designated horoscope animals when hugged by the opposite sex. Fruits Basket is a loveable anime that essentially centralizes around Tohru Honda as she gets deeply involved with the Sohma family.One of the good parts of the story is the fact, that they introduced a character in each episode, many times for comedic value while also efficiently advancing the story. The fact that the story had like no plot at points really made this worth watching and when it did have plot or story telling was spot on.The subtle Romance that is seen here and there can be hard to notice if you have not seen an romance anime before if you have then it will be easy to notice, The romance parts of the show are not “lovey dovey” like in most romance anime it’s just enough there to make you go, “awwwwwww that’s cute”.There is a love triangle between Yuki, Kyo, and Tohru, and then there are side characters who just loves “Prince Yuki” as he is so lovingly named.The one flaw I had for the story was that at times the emotions were lacking in terms of the situation. For example, instances where there should have been seriousness, there wasn’t, and vice-versa.  Some things were just simplified or brushed over.Pros:  Unlike most anime of the Shoujo genre tend to do with the over dramatic scenes (that can often make you hate the characters because you often cannot relate to them in these situations) these were very few and far between.Art/Animation 10/10The animation compliments the story beautifully. It complements the mood of the Anime very well. It is pretty light-hearted water color art (I think). Personally, I love anime done with water colors but it’s not for everyone and I realize it can be a turn off to some folks. Yet, when it needed to be dark, the dark art style/animation was done beautifuly and captured the mood accordingly.Something to point out is that the people doing the background added a lot detail which was wonderful to see.  The characters moved in the background scenes furthering the story even more, such as continued fight scene’s occurring as if you were really there.Sound/Music 9/10The accompanying music/dialog of the show is great. The soundtracks played in this anime fit with ongoing situation while also enhancing the viewer’s the mood accordingly. There is no soundtrack in this anime that is misplaced or out-of-place and the opening is very fitting for it tells the story abstractly for what is happening throughout the entirety of the shows.  As the show wraps up it does tend to feels a little out-of-place towards the end of the show but at a very minimal level.The voice cast they have for doing the show is marvelous.  Everyone played their roles successfully and they were enjoyable to listen to. Two of the primary characters, Yuki and Kyo were a perfect fit for the characters they played, whereas Yuki’s brother was over the top in such a successful way that only anime can do.  It was obvious that the voice cast team was carefully considered.Characters 9/10Characters are always one of three things likeable or unlikable or worse--indifferent. Personally, Fruits Basket had mostly all likable characters to some extent.  Each character has a different personality and if feels like they gave each character individuality.One character that was thoroughly enjoyable and even a role-model to some point is, Tohru Honda. The Shoujo genre is filled with the “simpleton” archetype. However, Tohru (although not the brightest) is an incredibly kind-hearted soul who holds this show up. She is the epitome of a kindred soul who actively helps out everyone that enters her life and impacts them in a positive way. Even though her life has been filled with hardships after she became an orphan, she always has a smile on her face. That is rarely seen in Characters who have not had a good life.Kyo Sohma is the typical Guy who gets teased and picked on a lot by the other cast members.  Kyo is the a person who has a hard time expressing emotions and is more kept to himself.  He also has an outrageous rivalry with the other primary male character, Yuki. Eventually he opens up as the story progresses and he becomes more of a normal Human (although that is not quite right). He becomes the fan favorite as the show progresses and later on we learn that his life was not all rainbows and butterfly It is darker than we thought.Yuki Sohma is a stereo typical dude in many ways.  He is smart and hot and everyone wants to be his girlfriend, and he is the kind of person the males inspire to be. Unlike many shows he is extremely protective of Tohru throughout the whole show (surprisingly so is Kyo). To the credit of the show all the characters are flawed by their curse but with the help of Tohru they find all begin to find their way.Shigure is the typical pervert comedy relief character done right almost to a “T”. The one flaw I had with his character is that his perverseness is played at some really strange times in the show, but he can be very serious and very manipulative.The anime does a good job in creating a realistic and appealing characters, they are not two dimensional.This show introduces characters like Kyo, Momji, and Hatori early on, and they too are very good characters that Tohru of course helps. Most of the characters are blessed with good development.  Few shows have the ability to juggle this many characters this effectively. There are even character that have episodes entitled to them that help to flush that character out and give you a greater look into the Sohma family.  I have to admit that some of the characters, after they were introduced, soon had me in tears.  I felt sorry for them.  The writers made one care about each character and in a different way.Admittedly, some characters like Yuki Sohma’s character development were very subtle and discreet.  The changes crept up on you, much like real life.  Most of his changes were psychological. Out of the main cast he is the one that is done subtle and not at all normal for the Shoujo genre.As for the extra “kawaii stuff”, you will have to decide for yourself.The Yuki Fan-Club Girls, love ‘em or hate ‘em, this is something that only you can decide.  Personally I liked them at the end for they also helped with character development.  They made you stop and actually look at all the changes that had occurred in Yuki.Enjoyment 9/10Over all, the enjoyment level for me was a 9/10. I had an amazing time watching this show during both its good and bad times. I gave this show a “9” because of its witty comedy, awesome characters, and a story that was overall intertwined.  It is must see show.  The whole time I watched it, I was entranced, with that being said, I hope all of you will take the take time and watch this surprisingly brilliant anime and enjoy it as much as is not the case because Fruits Basket adds depth and originality to the generic world of reverse-harems.Story 9/10The Story is about an orphan girl named Tohru Honda whose life changes after encountering two members of the Sohma family: Shigure and Yuki.

The fact that the story had like no plot at points really made this worth watching and when it did have plot or story telling was spot on.The subtle Romance that is seen here and there can be hard to notice if you have not seen an romance anime before if you have then it will be easy to notice, The romance parts of the show are not “lovey dovey” like in most romance anime it’s just enough there to make you go, “awwwwwww that’s cute”.There is a love triangle between Yuki, Kyo, and Tohru, and then there are side characters who just loves “Prince Yuki” as he is so lovingly named.The one flaw I had for the story was that at times the emotions were lacking in terms of the situation. For example, instances where there should have been seriousness, there wasn’t, and vice-versa.  Some things were just simplified or brushed over.Pros:  Unlike most anime of the Shoujo genre tend to do with the over dramatic scenes (that can often make you hate the characters because you often cannot relate to them in these situations) these were very few and far between.Art/Animation 10/10The animation compliments the story beautifully. It complements the mood of the Anime very well. It is pretty light-hearted water color art (I think). Personally, I love anime done with water colors but it’s not for everyone and I realize it can be a turn off to some folks. Yet, when it needed to be dark, the dark art style/animation was done beautifuly and captured the mood accordingly.Something to point out is that the people doing the background added a lot detail which was wonderful to see.  The characters moved in the background scenes furthering the story even more, such as continued fight scene’s occurring as if you were really there.Sound/Music 9/10The accompanying music/dialog of the show is great. The soundtracks played in this anime fit with ongoing situation while also enhancing the viewer’s the mood accordingly. There is no soundtrack in this anime that is misplaced or out-of-place and the opening is very fitting for it tells the story abstractly for what is happening throughout the entirety of the shows.  As the show wraps up it does tend to feels a little out-of-place towards the end of the show but at a very minimal level.The voice cast they have for doing the show is marvelous.  Everyone played their roles successfully and they were enjoyable to listen to. Two of the primary characters, Yuki and Kyo were a perfect fit for the characters they played, whereas Yuki’s brother was over the top in such a successful way that only anime can do.  It was obvious that the voice cast team was carefully considered.Characters 9/10Characters are always one of three things likeable or unlikable or worse--indifferent. Personally, Fruits Basket had mostly all likable characters to some extent.  Each character has a different personality and if feels like they gave each character individuality.One character that was thoroughly enjoyable and even a role-model to some point is, Tohru Honda. The Shoujo genre is filled with the “simpleton” archetype. However, Tohru (although not the brightest) is an incredibly kind-hearted soul who holds this show up. She is the epitome of a kindred soul who actively helps out everyone that enters her life and impacts them in a positive way. Even though her life has been filled with hardships after she became an orphan, she always has a smile on her face. That is rarely seen in Characters who have not had a good life.Kyo Sohma is the typical Guy who gets teased and picked on a lot by the other cast members.  Kyo is the a person who has a hard time expressing emotions and is more kept to himself.  He also has an outrageous rivalry with the other primary male character, Yuki. Eventually he opens up as the story progresses and he becomes more of a normal Human (although that is not quite right). He becomes the fan favorite as the show progresses and later on we learn that his life was not all rainbows and butterfly It is darker than we thought.Yuki Sohma is a stereo typical dude in many ways.  He is smart and hot and everyone wants to be his girlfriend, and he is the kind of person the males inspire to be. Unlike many shows he is extremely protective of Tohru throughout the whole show (surprisingly so is Kyo). To the credit of the show all the characters are flawed by their curse but with the help of Tohru they find all begin to find their way.Shigure is the typical pervert comedy relief character done right almost to a “T”. The one flaw I had with his character is that his perverseness is played at some really strange times in the show, but he can be very serious and very manipulative.The anime does a good job in creating a realistic and appealing characters, they are not two dimensional.This show introduces characters like Kyo, Momji, and Hatori early on, and they too are very good characters that Tohru of course helps. Most of the characters are blessed with good development.  Few shows have the ability to juggle this many characters this effectively. There are even character that have episodes entitled to them that help to flush that character out and give you a greater look into the Sohma family.  I have to admit that some of the characters, after they were introduced, soon had me in tears.  I felt sorry for them.  The writers made one care about each character and in a different way.Admittedly, some characters like Yuki Sohma’s character development were very subtle and discreet.  The changes crept up on you, much like real life.  Most of his changes were psychological. Out of the main cast he is the one that is done subtle and not at all normal for the Shoujo genre.As for the extra “kawaii stuff”, you will have to decide for yourself.The Yuki Fan-Club Girls, love ‘em or hate ‘em, this is something that only you can decide.  Personally I liked them at the end for they also helped with character development.  They made you stop and actually look at all the changes that had occurred in Yuki.Enjoyment 9/10Over all, the enjoyment level for me was a 9/10. I had an amazing time watching this show during both its good and bad times. I gave this show a “9” because of its witty comedy, awesome characters, and a story that was overall intertwined.  It is must see show.  The whole time I watched it, I was entranced, with that being said, I hope all of you will take the take time and watch this surprisingly brilliant anime and enjoy it as much as', ""In this day and age anime fans were presented with anime remakes, alternative settings and squeals to popular and less known animes from the past decade or two.Despite getting new entries/remakes of classic titles that we all know and love the overall quality for these shows have been all over the place. For every good remake/squeal of old anime like Full Metal Panic IV, Cardcaptor Sakura Clear Card Hen and Dororo theses a mediocre to god awful ones like Boogiepop Phantom 2019, Kino’s Journey 2017, A Certain Magical Index Season 3.Around the final months of 2018, the 24th issue of Hakusensha's Hana to Yume magazine...announced that there will be a new Fruits Basket Anime for 2019.This announcement certainly caught people especially fans of the manga/original anime off guard because we all never saw it coming. Being a fan of the original series by Studio Deen I was extremely excited to see a show I loved to get remade.Thanks to my excitement I decided to go to my anime DVD/Blu-Ray collection, pick up my Fruits Basket DVD copy by MVM Entertainment UK and re-watch in one weekend and after re-watching it for the fourth time since my first watch of it around 2014 I can defiantly say that original Fruits Basket anime still holds very well for the most part.The story follows a young girl named Tohru Honda who recently lost her mother on a car accident.Choosing not to stay with her Grandpa or friends, thinking she’ll be a burden, Tohru decides to secretly live near a forest in a tent, on her own. However, she is soon found by two Sohma family members named Yuki and Shigure. She is invited to live with them if she agrees to be their housekeeper, which she accepts, though at this point she doesn’t know the curse placed upon the Sohma family.After encountering an another Sohma family member Kyo Sohma, she finds out what that curse is.The Sohma Family are cursed by the Chinese Zodiac and turn into their respective zodiacs when hugged by someone of the opposite gender.After knowing about the Souma family curse Tohru must now promise to keep the family curse as secret as she dives into the mysterious world of the Sohma's.There's a lot of things to love about Fruits Basket.For starters does a great job at establishing its characters to the viewer thanks to great character interactions, smooth pacing and nice directing.The core story itself, well it is very good. It starts off as typical meet and greets story where Tohru goes around meeting other Sohma members however it becomes much than that to a becomes completely different show by the end which was sadly cut off it overtaking the manga and creative differences. More on this later.The one thing that Fruits Basket does very well is how it uses it's Zodiac gimmick. It was first presented as a hilarious gimmick at first that has no impact to the plot however as the series progresses you will start to think about it more to a point and by the time you get near the second half the hilarious gimmick becomes a tragic curse for the Sohma family. Due to the curse, a Sohma family member has a restricted lifestyle where they cannot hug a loved one in their arms, having a normal social life in fear of having their secret revealed in the progress etc.Because of all this, the Sohma family members have to wear an invisible mask in order for them to live a normal life even though they are sad behind the mask.All of the things that I mentioned so far also synergies with the shows core themes and topics. Its deals of the themes of family, acceptance, abuse, memory loss, child abandonment and forgiveness and the show manage to execute these themes very well. The same thing can be said for the show's core messages such as being yourself, not running away from your problems, being confident, how to learn to be vulnerable and I could go on and on.Not only that but it takes many of these themes and messages that I just mentioned and takes them to a much darker direction to a point I was truly shocked of how dark Fruits Basket can be especially the last three episodes.I’m sure it will only get darker in the reboot but that’s for another time.As for the comedy, it's very good as the series does a nice job at making the viewer laugh with its great comedy direction and charming chararter interactions.If there's was one thing that was missing from Fruits Basket that prevents it from being a masterpiece is the lack of conclusion.Creative differences stuff aside where the author of the series Natsuki\xa0Takaya was not so pleased of how Akitarou Daichi directed the anime, the show ended on a rough note with no signs of continuation.Oh well least we got the reboot coming up soon that would give the series a proper conclusion to Tohru and the Sohma family.Obviously, a show like this is nothing without its characters and I got to say that the characters in Fruits Basket are some of the most intriguing bunch I have seen in anime. On first glance, they may appear as typical Shoujo archetypes but at as the series progresses they move past those typical archetypes and they become much more than generic shoujo archetypes and by the end the become full fleshed chararters.First, up we have Tohru Honda who is a cheerful, and over-optimistic girl who holds her friends and family on high regard. Thoru is one of the better female\xa0protagonists I have seen in a long while. She's a likeable character who just wants to see the best of everyone that she meets. I also really liked her interactions towards the other chararters wherever it's for comedy or drama. On top of that, she does get some strong character development.Not as strong as Kyo, Momoji and Yuki but still good enough to make her a great character.Now before I talk about other characters I want to talk about people's controversial opinions about Thoru that she is a Mary Sue. I understand why people would call her a Mary Sue due to her been too nice however she's far for a Mary Sue. Despite being nice she's deep issues that broke her as a person due to the death of her mother.To counteract grief she decided to feel her mothers wishes but not only get's a diploma but to live as best as she possibly can.Because of everything I said her Thoru is a likeable and fascinating chararter that I hold in high regards.Next, we have Yuki who is cursed by\xa0the spirit of the rat of the\xa0Chinese Zodiac. I really like Yuki a lot. On first glance, he appears to be your typical quiet, nice and reserved person however as the series progresses he becomes so much more to a point where he becomes the most complex character in the series.This is all thanks to his mysterious persona as well he's fantastic character arc and dark backstory which I sadly can't talk about due to major spoilers. Because of these reasons, Yuki is the most complex character out of the bunch and I like it that way.Now we have Kyo who is cursed by the spirit of the cat of the Chinese Zodiac.\xa0 Kyo is a great character and an intriguing character. He starts off as the loud male tsundere who fights a lot but as the series progresses especially when the shows dives into his backstory and ideas he becomes more of a relatable and likeable chararter that is filled with chararter development.Finally, we have Shigure who is basically the comic relief of the series as well being cursed by the spirit of a dog. Not gonna lie I liked Shigure. Yes, he may lack depth compared to most of the other characters in the series however he makes it up by being the funniest characters in the series. His characters interactions were pure gold as he tries to soften the serious moments in the series.The rest of the characters from the Sohma's family are all interesting and enjoyable in their own right. I could easily explain why I like each of them (Minus Akito who meh at best due to him being underdeveloped in the anime) but I won't because of spoilers however I will mention my favourite character in Fruits Basket Momiji.Cute appearance aside he's the most fun and intriguing character out of all bunch.Unfortunately once again I cannot say much about him due to spoilers but I can say that he has a very intriguing and well-written backstory that would may you cry.Overall with the exception of Akito the characters in Fruits Basket where the heart of this anime. If it wasn't for the strong and interesting chararter cast then the show would have bombed.For a show to come from the early 2000s I thought the visuals were good. It may be a bit outdated nowadays I still believe it's still one of the better-looking Shoujo anime I have seen.The characters designs are nicely drawn as they are all nicely distinctive from each otherThe same unfortunately can't be said for the background scenery as it pretty generic looking thanks to the use of basic colour palettes.It's serviceable for what it is but at the same time, not visually pleasing.As for the animation, it's pretty solid for what it is as the series uses a lot of basic animation for actual character movement.It may had obvious use of animation shorts and still frames but fear no worry the series doesn't abuse it compared to some other shoujo animes before and after.The soundtrack for Fruits Basket is sweet and relaxing.The tracks range from subtle and soft tracks to upbeat, silly, and serious tracks that perfectly blends in with the show's tone.Many people will disagree with this but I really liked the opening theme For Fruits Basket by Ritsuko Okazaki. It is a slow relaxing piece of that, for the most part, fits the tone well of the series.The same thing can be said for the ending theme Chiisana Inori by Ritsuko Okazaki however I prefer the ending theme over the opening theme.I only have seen a couple of episodes with the original Japanese audio and it thought it was okay.The English Dub done by Funimation is fantastic. Not only was it was well acted that is filled with talented voice actors but the dub, in general, suited this show better.My favourite performances in the dub were Laura Bailey as Thoru and Jerry Jewell as Kyo. They completely nailed the roles as these two have absolutely perfect voice chemistry with each other. On an interesting note I that I want to point out that they both have voiced the main characters of another series called Kodocha where Laura Bailey voiced Sana and Jerry Jewell as Akito.Fruits Basket is a fascinating Fairy Tail for the broken.It's a smooth and comfortable ride that will make you happy, cry, and laugh with it's well written and charming characters, well-composed soundtrack, intriguing story-lines and hilarious comedy that will make anyone laugh for days.The only thing that holds this show back from truly blooming is the weak ending.Other than that Fruits Basket is a great shoujo tale that shouldn't miss.I hope the Fruits Basket remake will satisfy for both manga and the original anime fans and I hope it will be the anime that would finally put the end to this inconsistent remake of older shows saga. announced that there will be a new Fruits Basket Anime for 2019.This announcement certainly caught people especially fans of the manga/original anime off guard because we all never saw it coming.

Well here it is. Fruits basket is a great anime to watch if you are into romance/comedy/drama. Not only does it have a nice storyline but it has great characters. I am sure that you will have a favorite character in this series because each one is special in there own way. Here are three main reasons Fruits basket is my favorite anime.1. The main character (Tohru Honda) is so likable. She is caring, puts others people's feelings before her own, works hard, and doesn't judge by appearances (you will...know what I am talking about if you watch it). Me and her can relate in a lot of ways.2.The romance in this anime is so cute. It's nothing over the top and is mostly expressed by feelings and actions (not the sexual actions). I couldn't even really call it romance but something special. Everyone sort of has this little bond or special feeling towards the Tohru. The one with Kyo and Yuki towards Tohru is my favorite because it's like this cute love triangle in its special way.3. The amount of emotions you get from this anime. I cried out of happiness on some scenes and I cried on some other scenes because it was so touching, not really sad but you can sympathize with the situation. And then you have the comedy where you can just laugh and be happy.Of course the story is also wonderful. I gave Fruits Basket a 10 for each category because it deserves it. The story was great and so was the ending. The art was beautiful. The music fit the anime. The characters were well thought out and likable and had there specialness in there own way. I surely enjoyed the anime all the way to the end and it rewatched it 3 times (not my last).It was just amazing and very likable. That's all I can say to finish this review. know what I am talking about if you watch it). Me and her can relate in a lot of ways.2.The romance in this anime is so cute.

Each character had a wonderful trait about them.There was so many characters and you just kept wanting to know who would be what animal. You follow Tohru as she stumbles upon them and from then on you enjoy discovering each new...secret and story with her.Falling so in love with each characters sub story.Bringing tears of sadness and tears of laughter. I couldnt ask for a better anime, it captured sweet romance, and sadness as well as a beautiful developing storyline between everyone as well as the secret of the Sohmas.I would recommend this to anyone who loves some sweet light hearted romance and a great laugh.I just wanted to care for each and everyone just how Tohru did. secret and story with her.Falling so in love with each characters sub story.Bringing tears of sadness and tears of laughter.

I'm really into action shows like Fullmetal Alchemist, Inuyasha, Naruto, Gundam Wing/Seed, etc. so I wasn't sure if I would like this series or not. However, when I watched it, I just couldn't stop. Tearing myself away from the TV was heart-wrenching! The plot is well written and you'll love the characters. The show is hilarious and very cute and it'll have you laughing and smiling during every episode. Even if your an action fan like me,  you should definitely give this anime a shot. "", ""Fruits Basket is not a good anime.Reasons I do not like it:First off, the characters are all Mary Sues. Tohru is inexplicably loved by all of the characters in the Fruits Basket universe. Yuki is also loved by almost every female (and some males) at his high school, even though he rejects them constantly. Kyo is hostile to everybody yet they love to be around him. Mary Sue characters are very annoying and hard to relate to. They are also unrealistic and insult the viewer. I also feel that it has too many characters to follow, too many to care about individually. It's almost...as if they added all of these characters to try and make this story emotional, but failed miserably.Second, the plot is faulty and uninteresting. It does not keep the viewer engaged, rather it barely strings them along with half-assed attempts to be mysterious. The plot points and the twists are very predictable and do not shock at all. There is immense foreshadowing to almost every climactic event, and this is both disappointing as well as damaging to the plot.Third, Tohru's naive personality and self narration is extremely annoying. This may seem like a petty thing to complain about, but it is very relevant. Tohru is very naive in all things and this is frustrating to the viewer. Things that are so painfully obvious fly right over her head, this takes away from the viewing experience. She self narrates constantly, which is infuriating. She is also just too good natured and innocent to be an interesting character, especially a protagonist. The protagonist of the story is supposed to be relatable and Tohru is not.Its moments:While overall I do rate Fruits Basket rather low, it does have its moments. There are a few characters that I enjoy overall. Kyo, Momiji, Hatsuharu and Shigure bring moments of humor to the show. If not for these characters Fruits Basket would be a complete failure. as if they added all of these characters to try and make this story emotional, but failed miserably.Second, the plot is faulty and uninteresting.

I had kinda high expectations of the anime because everyone seem to be praising it to Heaven and back. I enjoyed the manga (especially the later volumes) so I decided to give the anime a try too... I can say I was quite disappointed.Okay, I\'m a guy and not really a fan of shoujo manga but what originally got me to be interested in Fruits Basket was the zodiac...touch, it seemed different and promising so I gave it a try after one of my friends told me to read/watch it. I must say I\'m really happy I read the manga before watching the anime because if I had watched the anime first I\'m sure I would never have bothered to read the manga. The anime is bad in many ways when compared to the manga; the story is modified and some important characters are totally left out for example. But more about that later, now let\'s get on with the review.Story 4/10Basically Fruits Basket is about Tohru Honda, your average happy-go-lucky girl who is like a saint to everyone but thinks nothing about herself. She lives in a tent after her mother died in an accident and later gets to live in her classmate Yuki Sohma\'s house together with two other Sohma family members - Shigure and Kyo. What Tohru doesn\'t know at first is that these Sohma family members are cursed with the 12 zodiac animals.Okay, so the the way the story unfolds itself is rather slow-paced and repetitive. The core message/plot of the story could have been summed up in less episodes, it felt a bit like it was dragging on. Not like there was much of a plot anyway, more like a ""slice of life"" kind of show with occasional drama and comedy and what-have-you mixed in.We have Yuki and Kyo fighting all the time, Shigure with his random comedy moments (which failed to amuse me more often than not) and Tohru meeting a new zodiac member in every other episode, learning about their tragic past and then having a mega fluffy conversation with them which then made everything pink and happy unicorns and rainbows again.. rinse and repeat. It gets repetitive and dull really fast, especially when the characters are pretty clichéd. Oh, and actually most of the sad background stories are left half-way unexplained or just simplified and cut off so much that you can\'t even symphatize with them because there\'s so many holes left to fill and you basically don\'t get to know much about anyone; Yuki\'s and Kyo\'s pasts are just scraped a little on the surface. It\'s disappointing especially because Kyo\'s past and development turns out to be enjoyable in the manga. Speaking of the manga, most of the things that made the manga as good as it was don\'t even exist in the anime.. okay, I\'ve heard the anime was made before the manga was even finished so the inaccuracies and lack of depth are forgiven a bit. But I can say that the anime follows the manga up to the first 8 volumes rather faithfully, which is good I guess, with some slight extras/changes added. The end is quite different though and in a way left pretty open with a lot of questions still hanging in the air, not to mention that the climax has like 2 episodes devoted to it to build it up but is then so easily solved that it takes the magic out of it and just makes it.. well, \'meh\'.Art 5/10Not so much to say about the art. It didn\'t impress me but it didn\'t make my eyes bleed either. Nothing fancy.. just mediocre. Sometimes the animation felt... well.. lazy; the same frame would be on screen for like 5 seconds or something. I must also say that I found those sparkly-glitter-pink-lovey-dovey scenes to be overused to the point of being cheesy and annoying, heck they were even used during moments they totally did -not- fit to.Sound 4/10The opening and endings were too slow-paced for my taste so I skipped them most of the time. About the music in the anime I can\'t say too much.. nothing great but nothing terribly bad either. I noticed it was the same selected few songs that kept playing during the whole course of 26 episodes.I found most of the characters voices to be annoying and just not fitting for the characters. Yuki lost what little manliness he had built up in the manga thanks to his disturbingly feminine voice in the anime.. I imagined him sounding clearly masculine but in a sweet/innocent way, not like a total girl. Ugh. And let\'s not even talk about Momiji... just.. what the hell. Okay, sure he is a shota but he sounds like a goddamn 3-year-old spoiled whiny girl instead of a cute pre-puberty boy, not to mention that I was hoping for him to have a German accent seeing how he was half German in the manga. Son, I am disappoint.Only Kyo, Shigure, Hatori, Akito, Hanajima, ""Yankee girl"" and Kazuma sounded right to me. The rest gave me more or less painful mental earbleeds.Character 5/10As I mentioned earlier the characters are quite clichéd; we have the cute shota boy, the cool guy with a split personality, the troublemaker loner guy who actually is soft inside, the silent and overly idolized guy with social problems, the egotastic brat who makes you see red and not to mention the girl who is so desperately in love with a guy, who hates her more than cancer, and she punches him to death when he is being honest about not liking her.. yes, I mean Kagura and she must be the epitome of all the things I H.A.T.E in an anime character; I don\'t wonder one bit why Kyo doesn\'t want to get married with her.. who the heck would? lol Oh, and let\'s not forget about those Yuki Fan Club girls who had a whole episode devoted to them.. I wanted to punch each of them in the face so damn hard. That episode I was so tempted to skip, it awakened my puke reflexes.. especially how Yuki was totally oblivious to their behaviour and even treated that selfish bitch with kindness. Needless to say most of the characters I found annoying instead of likable because they were so plain, exaggerated, clichéd, had a lack of deep or unique personality. Only Kyo, Hatori and Kazuma I found likable all through the show, the rest were more or less a nuisance.6/10 EnjoymentI watched this anime in two days but I\'m not sure did I watch it that fast because I wanted it to end already or why. Honestly most of the episodes felt like repeats of each other with little new to add to the basket. I seriously wanted to like this anime more than I did (mostly because the manga left a good impression on me) but I just found it more mind-numbingly dull and lacking than exciting. Sometimes it felt like I was wasting my time but luckily a few episodes were actually good too, like the one with Hatori\'s past. Oh, and the scene when Ayame turns into a snake and gets lasso\'d by mistake into the sea made me crack up; that was one of the few times the attempted humour actually rubbed me the right way. Okay, occasionally Shigure was funny but he didn\'t save the (often badly placed) mass flooding of failed attempts at humour which were more embarrassing than entertaining due to trying too hard to be funny but falling flat on their face instead. The ""I AM SO SORRY OHMAIGAWD"" hot spring kimono lady was funny a few times too but that\'s about it.5/10 OverallThe anime was quite a letdown for me personally. I would not recommend watching it unless you haven\'t read the manga or are the sort of person who likes cotton candy fluffy shoujo with a girl who radiates light with her presence.. and magically heals all past scars of other half-strangers with just a few sentences. If you are interested in Fruits Basket, READ THE MANGA INSTEAD. I promise, it is much better! It makes more sense, actually is enjoyable (especially when the story gets going for real) and it also fills in the many things left unexplained properly in the anime. The anime is quite the disgrace in my eyes, I don\'t understand why it has so high scores.. but oh well, whatever floats your boat I guess. People are free to like and enjoy what they want but Fruits Basket anime sure wasn\'t my piece of cake. touch, it seemed different and promising so I gave it a try after one of my friends told me to read/watch it. I must say I\'m really happy I read the manga before watching the anime because if I had watched the anime first I\'m sure I would never have bothered to read the manga.

The anime is quite the disgrace in my eyes, I don\'t understand why it has so high scores.. but oh well, whatever floats your boat I guess. People are free to like and enjoy what they want but Fruits Basket anime sure wasn\'t my piece of cake.', 'There comes a time for every generation of Otaku or general anime viewer, when they are done taking their baby steps into anime i.e. when they’ve stopped/watched enough of the most popular Shōnen or Mecha show/s and they become confident enough walking on their own that they start to go off and explore what’s around that big bad internet to see what other animes are out there, that, they stumble, or rather are introduced to (like myself) their first Shōjo/Harem/Moé/Yaoi show; You know, the K-On!’s, the Ouran’s, the Clannad’s, the Chobits, the Free!’s (for all you newbies) or hell, even Sailor Moon from back in...the day. A show that compared to what you have been watching up until now is the absolute sort of thing you DON’T want to watch. Something that screams, “IT’S SO GIRLY!” or in my case, “IT LOOKS TOO SILLY, I WANT SOMETHING A BIT MORE SERIOUS!”. Although issues like these are nowadays, for the most part (in Scotland), non-existent, but back in say 2004 when I was a tender 12 years old, watching these kinds of shows was a whole different story. But for those brave & bold enough to watch shows like these and for those who were able to get past the insecurities they had, whether it was about how the show would make us feel, or if the art would be a problem or we just couldn’t get into the story, were introduced (depending on the show of course) fantastical worlds (and sometimes incredibly realistic worlds) chock full of charm, humour, compassion, friendship, family, love and also heartache, loss, despair, loneliness and emptiness with the latter emotions being the reason why some of these shows are some of our all-time cherished favourites.Now (finally) the anime I’ll be talking about today, my first Shōjo, I’m glad to say, is such a show, whose manga I just finished not two nights ago and is firmly cemented into my heart as something I will cherish for the rest of my current life. Otaku’s, Otakette’s and the young’uns – I present my written review of, Fruits Basket, CUE THE MUSIC!!!Now to start off with, the boring history stuff:Fruits Basket began, and ended, life as a semi-monthly manga series written and drawn by Miss Natsuki Takaya (an interesting woman who both is left-handed and loves Final Fantasy much like myself) from 1999 to 2006 spanning 136 chapters and was then adapted into a 26 episode anime series. The anime was made by Studio DEEN - also responsible for things like, Initial D Third Stage, Rave Master, Getbackers, the Beyblade movie & Fate/Stay Night, so, not too shabby - and was directed by Mr. Akitaro Daichi, who has also directed Kamisama Kiss (a show I’m real interested in watching) and a show called We Were There (which also sounds right up my street).StoryNow, Fruits Basket’s story may end up how all the other Shōjo tales do, one male or female “main” main character is surround by many numbers of the opposite sex (Fruits Basket does have females too but the results the same) who all each get their own episode and in turn they all fall in love with said “main” main character. But how it presents this worn-out formulaic type of story-telling is far for the status quo (which I will get to soon, so remember this part okay?). So, as we begin our journey through a Basket of Fruits, we have our “main” main character, Torhu Honda, a optimistic, kind-hearted, warm, selfless, oblivious and at time ignorant, but most lovely and genuine sweetheart, girl who at the beginning of our tale is living in a tent in the woods all by herself, through her own doing, as she was staying with her grandfather after her mother and father died, but decided to move out when her poor old grandpappy also had to let his kids and their families stay in his small house to which Tohru (being Tohru) felt she was being a burden. Then one day as Tohru is on her way to school, she stumbles upon a random house, which she obviously never noticed before, and these cute-sy little figures shaped into each animal the 12 zodiacs – now be aware that Tohru favours the Cat spirit of the zodiac and has a wish to become friends with the Cat as he is shunned and left-out by the rest of the zodiac. As Tohru observes the figures we are then introduced to the Sohma relatives, Shigure Yuki and Kyo who all decide to let Torhu stay after her tent is washed away in a landslide, so she can have somewhere solid to stay and may be a little bit because their house is dirty and nobody knows how to cook.Now remember WAAAY back when I mentioned that although this show does eventually follow traditional Shōjo but presents it to us in a way that is more acceptable?No!? Shame on you!Yes? Fantastic, well done!Well, anyways, the show’s unique spin to the boring Shōjo format is that it is revealed to Torhu that Shigure, Yuki, Kyo and ten others in the Sohma family are all possessed by the spirits of the zodiac and thus such are all related and bonded (spiritually) together because of it. Also in a very strange, and very Shōjo way, the Sohma’s turn into their animal forms when hugged by a member of the opposite sex, which, (ah, I hate to admit this) was kind of funny on more than one occasion. Shigure is the dog, Yuki is the rat & Kyo is the cat coincidently, which should paint a massive red target in him labelled, “OBVIOUS LOVE INTEREST IS OBVIOUS”. But the show does a great job of leading us astray at all times, “One episode it’s Yuki, the other it’s Kyo”, sort of thing.And THUS, my friends, we have passed the Genesis of FruBa. From here on it’s par for the course really: Tohru, episode by episode, meets each of the Sohma’s possessed by the animals, they all fall in love with her & we don’t find out until the last episode who Tohru really wants to be with and thus presents us with no real conclusion other than the, “The road is long, our journey has just begun, I hope all days are like this forever” BULLSHIT that these sort of shows can give you. And yes, it is an anime-only ending which further cements the show’s disappointing end. Which is a real crying shame to be honest because the show does have bags of charm and character and when more than one Sohma is on the screen is does create some great watching as, because there are so many Sohma’s, it seems that a single emotion/trait has been attributed to the one character and no-one else and that one emotion all the only one they confidently portray, for example, Shigure is mischievous, Yuki is charming & Kyo is short-tempered and that IS ALL these three portray, obviously they smile, frown, laugh and get upset but they do it based off these emotions/traits.CharactersFor characters, I’ll just skin over the main four, Tohru, Kyo, Yuki & Shigure as they have the most screen time between them.Tohru HondaAs mentioned before Tohru is probably the nicest person you’ll ever meet, but she’ll also be the most oblivious one as well. But that’s great for Tohru as she has this childlike way of doing these things that no matter what, you can’t help but hug the girl. The more you learn about Tohru, the more time you spend with her, the more familiar you become with her way of life, you cannot help but fall in love with Tohru. Try as you might, it’s impossible not to, unless you have no soul of course. But behind all the goofballness (I’m coining that) and just a plain nice person, is that serious side to Tohru’s life which like most of the other characters is quite heart-breaking and lonely. You get to understand that she has been through so much and most of the time she hides it through her innocence and optimism. She’s a true gem of a character and one I personally resonate with. I consider her a good friend of mine, and if you get to know her, she’ll be yours too.Kyo SohmaNow for my favourite character, Kyo, the Cat. Now where there are those parts of Torhu that I mentioned that are within me, there are also those “other” parts of me, which are within Kyo, more so than with Tohru. Kyo is very easily frustrated and angered, most of the time because he is incredibly defensive or has had his words taken in the wrong context and that sometimes upsets people which is the one thing Kyo doesn’t want to do, but his frustration gets the better of him, but he does make it up to people in the best way he can – niceness. This defining thing about Kyo is why I love him to death because it’s so like me, because  we’ll both get frustrated over the littlest things and then when we calm down we’ll be like, “That was pointless, why did I get so upset with (insert name), better go apologise”. Kyo likes to do things his own way, much like myself, and likes to take themselves out of the group picture is he feels it will ease things, much like myself. Although Kyo may be hot-tempered, people can still tell he has a kind heart, he just doesn’t know how to express it without getting embarrassed which them gets him frustrated which then leads to him blowing up. Which is why having Tohru around is the best thing for him as slowly but surely, he finally loosens up and learns to just go with the flow. He’s a really great character and person who just wants to be accepted and has a big heart.Yuki SohmaNow Yuki is easier to get past as for me, like Kyo, I don’t really care for Yuki too much. He’s a nice guy and all, and he treats Tohru with nothing but respect. But he’s the “prince of the school”, the most popular kid, the “best looking”, the prodigy child, he can’t do nothing wrong, does everything right and never seems to have any problems. Me & Kyo HATE “perfect” people. But then, I started to get to know Yuki, and I started to look deeper into what made Yuki, Yuki and found out, like Kyo does, that he hates being perfect, he hates being the centre of attention all the time. Yuki actually wants what Kyo has: solitude. So in learning that, Yuki (who still don’t really care that much for), becomes a whole different person to me. Someone with more admirable qualities than I care to imagine and honour made of steel.But I still don’t care for him, stupid Rat.Shigure SohmaAh, Shigure. Shigure isn’t everyone’s absolute favourite character, but he’s the close second though. He would love that though, being all mischievous and such – every little slip-up the first favourite would make, there would be Shigure, laughing, teasing, and making the first sweat. I love that about Shigure though is that he loves to tease, not because he’s evil, but because he knows he’ll get a kick out of it and it’ll be real funny. He’s LOVES embarrassing Yuki and Kyo in front of Tohru. He is a real creature of comfort (very akin to the dog funny enough) and very rarely ever wears anything other than his dressing gown. If he was a real guy, he’d be your drinking buddy, let’s put it that way.ArtArt wise, it’s very simply drawn and animated. It does contain many many MANY Moé moments where there are super cute animals on screen or when Ayame is on the scene of when Tohru is, well, being Tohru. It never impresses, but it never disgusts either. It’s as standard as standard gets, although it is very faithful to the manga.SoundThe soundtrack is standard fare really, nothing you haven’t heard before. The opening and closing themes are decent enough that fans will download them. The only real star, music wise, isn’t even a proper song, it’s a made up verse sung by Momiji – but it is great though. Voice acting in the dub does have some saving graces (on paper) by the way of Eric Vale (Trunks in DBZ) as Yuki, Jerry Jewell (Claire Stanfield in Baccano!) & Laura Bailey (Amber in Darker Than Black) as Tohru, with only the latter putting in an above average performance.EnjoymentDespite having flaws in the art and sound departments (with the problems in sound just being about enthusiasm), Fruits Basket is rife with entertainment, but only if you want to find it, as it’s till after a few episodes (or really after Momiji is introduced) that the series really shifts gear into full “HAHA” mode. It also has some tender moments when Tohru is alone with either Yuki or Kyo that are lovely to watch - the plum on the back speech in episode 7 is the best example of this. And even though the ending is piss poor, you still cheer and want Tohru to succeed, so I guess, that’s enjoyment.So, in summary, I’ve decided that Fruits Basket (as an anime) is the most special, un-special thing you’ll ever see, which is good in a way because when I look back on the anime now and how it ends; it’s really just a stepping stone to get you to the manga. The anime hardly covers anything the manga has to offer. So while the anime is nothing special and has a terrible ending, it’s supposed to be the platform to get you ready for the manga, which you should definitely read after watching the anime first. As the anime is just but a taste of what’s to come, as the manga, especially in the later half is an acquired taste to say the least. But it does have a satisfying ending. See, when I first watched Fruits Basket, it was just a simple enjoyable pass-time that I wished there was more of; and since there was and I’ve finished the story, I now look back on this anime and smile with nostalgic glee at all the memories contained within. So although this anime is not that special, if you read the manga after it, then come back, it soon will be. It’ll become one of your favourite shows, that you’ll eventually show your kids when your older and pass it down the generations with love, which is something that the manga is big on later on in the series.Thus ends my very first review on MAL and my review of Fruits Basket, the anime. If people like this enough, I may do a short review on the manga. I hope I kept this spoiler-free and y’all enjoy it.Thank you very much if you read this and I certainly hope it convinces people to pick up the series.Thanks guys, see ya later!JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM!!!! the day.

Also in a very strange, and very Shōjo way, the Sohma’s turn into their animal forms when hugged by a member of the opposite sex, which, (ah, I hate to admit this) was kind of funny on more than one occasion. Shigure is the dog, Yuki is the rat & Kyo is the cat coincidently, which should paint a massive red target in him labelled, “OBVIOUS LOVE INTEREST IS OBVIOUS”. But the show does a great job of leading us astray at all times, “One episode it’s Yuki, the other it’s Kyo”, sort of thing.And THUS, my friends, we have passed the Genesis of FruBa. From here on it’s par for the course really: Tohru, episode by episode, meets each of the Sohma’s possessed by the animals, they all fall in love with her & we don’t find out until the last episode who Tohru really wants to be with and thus presents us with no real conclusion other than the, “The road is long, our journey has just begun, I hope all days are like this forever” BULLSHIT that these sort of shows can give you. And yes, it is an anime-only ending which further cements the show’s disappointing end. Which is a real crying shame to be honest because the show does have bags of charm and character and when more than one Sohma is on the screen is does create some great watching as, because there are so many Sohma’s, it seems that a single emotion/trait has been attributed to the one character and no-one else and that one emotion all the only one they confidently portray, for example, Shigure is mischievous, Yuki is charming & Kyo is short-tempered and that IS ALL these three portray, obviously they smile, frown, laugh and get upset but they do it based off these emotions/traits.CharactersFor characters, I’ll just skin over the main four, Tohru, Kyo, Yuki & Shigure as they have the most screen time between them.Tohru HondaAs mentioned before Tohru is probably the nicest person you’ll ever meet, but she’ll also be the most oblivious one as well. But that’s great for Tohru as she has this childlike way of doing these things that no matter what, you can’t help but hug the girl. The more you learn about Tohru, the more time you spend with her, the more familiar you become with her way of life, you cannot help but fall in love with Tohru. Try as you might, it’s impossible not to, unless you have no soul of course. But behind all the goofballness (I’m coining that) and just a plain nice person, is that serious side to Tohru’s life which like most of the other characters is quite heart-breaking and lonely. You get to understand that she has been through so much and most of the time she hides it through her innocence and optimism. She’s a true gem of a character and one I personally resonate with. I consider her a good friend of mine, and if you get to know her, she’ll be yours too.Kyo SohmaNow for my favourite character, Kyo, the Cat. Now where there are those parts of Torhu that I mentioned that are within me, there are also those “other” parts of me, which are within Kyo, more so than with Tohru. Kyo is very easily frustrated and angered, most of the time because he is incredibly defensive or has had his words taken in the wrong context and that sometimes upsets people which is the one thing Kyo doesn’t want to do, but his frustration gets the better of him, but he does make it up to people in the best way he can – niceness. This defining thing about Kyo is why I love him to death because it’s so like me, because  we’ll both get frustrated over the littlest things and then when we calm down we’ll be like, “That was pointless, why did I get so upset with (insert name), better go apologise”. Kyo likes to do things his own way, much like myself, and likes to take themselves out of the group picture is he feels it will ease things, much like myself. Although Kyo may be hot-tempered, people can still tell he has a kind heart, he just doesn’t know how to express it without getting embarrassed which them gets him frustrated which then leads to him blowing up. Which is why having Tohru around is the best thing for him as slowly but surely, he finally loosens up and learns to just go with the flow. He’s a really great character and person who just wants to be accepted and has a big heart.Yuki SohmaNow Yuki is easier to get past as for me, like Kyo, I don’t really care for Yuki too much. He’s a nice guy and all, and he treats Tohru with nothing but respect. But he’s the “prince of the school”, the most popular kid, the “best looking”, the prodigy child, he can’t do nothing wrong, does everything right and never seems to have any problems. Me & Kyo HATE “perfect” people. But then, I started to get to know Yuki, and I started to look deeper into what made Yuki, Yuki and found out, like Kyo does, that he hates being perfect, he hates being the centre of attention all the time. Yuki actually wants what Kyo has: solitude. So in learning that, Yuki (who still don’t really care that much for), becomes a whole different person to me. Someone with more admirable qualities than I care to imagine and honour made of steel.But I still don’t care for him, stupid Rat.Shigure SohmaAh, Shigure. Shigure isn’t everyone’s absolute favourite character, but he’s the close second though. He would love that though, being all mischievous and such – every little slip-up the first favourite would make, there would be Shigure, laughing, teasing, and making the first sweat. I love that about Shigure though is that he loves to tease, not because he’s evil, but because he knows he’ll get a kick out of it and it’ll be real funny. He’s LOVES embarrassing Yuki and Kyo in front of Tohru. He is a real creature of comfort (very akin to the dog funny enough) and very rarely ever wears anything other than his dressing gown. If he was a real guy, he’d be your drinking buddy, let’s put it that way.ArtArt wise, it’s very simply drawn and animated. It does contain many many MANY Moé moments where there are super cute animals on screen or when Ayame is on the scene of when Tohru is, well, being Tohru. It never impresses, but it never disgusts either. It’s as standard as standard gets, although it is very faithful to the manga.SoundThe soundtrack is standard fare really, nothing you haven’t heard before. The opening and closing themes are decent enough that fans will download them. The only real star, music wise, isn’t even a proper song, it’s a made up verse sung by Momiji – but it is great though. Voice acting in the dub does have some saving graces (on paper) by the way of Eric Vale (Trunks in DBZ) as Yuki, Jerry Jewell (Claire Stanfield in Baccano!) & Laura Bailey (Amber in Darker Than Black) as Tohru, with only the latter putting in an above average performance.EnjoymentDespite having flaws in the art and sound departments (with the problems in sound just being about enthusiasm), Fruits Basket is rife with entertainment, but only if you want to find it, as it’s till after a few episodes (or really after Momiji is introduced) that the series really shifts gear into full “HAHA” mode. It also has some tender moments when Tohru is alone with either Yuki or Kyo that are lovely to watch - the plum on the back speech in episode 7 is the best example of this. And even though the ending is piss poor, you still cheer and want Tohru to succeed, so I guess, that’s enjoyment.So, in summary, I’ve decided that Fruits Basket (as an anime) is the most special, un-special thing you’ll ever see, which is good in a way because when I look back on the anime now and how it ends; it’s really just a stepping stone to get you to the manga. The anime hardly covers anything the manga has to offer. So while the anime is nothing special and has a terrible ending, it’s supposed to be the platform to get you ready for the manga, which you should definitely read after watching the anime first. As the anime is just but a taste of what’s to come, as the manga, especially in the later half is an acquired taste to say the least. But it does have a satisfying ending. See, when I first watched Fruits Basket, it was just a simple enjoyable pass-time that I wished there was more of; and since there was and I’ve finished the story, I now look back on this anime and smile with nostalgic glee at all the memories contained within. So although this anime is not that special, if you read the manga after it, then come back, it soon will be. It’ll become one of your favourite shows, that you’ll eventually show your kids when your older and pass it down the generations with love, which is something that the manga is big on later on in the series.Thus ends my very first review on MAL and my review of Fruits Basket, the anime. If people like this enough, I may do a short review on the manga. I hope I kept this spoiler-free and y’all enjoy it.Thank you very much if you read this and I certainly hope it convinces people to pick up the series.Thanks guys, see ya later!JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM!!!!', 'What do you get when you combine the Chinese zodiac with a cute idea for an anime? Fruits Basket. And trust me; it’s not as good as you think.Story: 3/10Sure you got your cute animals and cute characters, but let’s look at the bigger picture here. Yes…the idea of how bloody slow….this….anime….is……. I was very close to dropping it if it wasn’t for the humour hidden in each episode. But what the heck is with the creators making such a big fuss about a part in the plot then brush it off as…nothing. NOTHING HAPPENS UNTIL THE END! Annoying? You got it. The pace...was slow going, unnecessary, and characters that should’ve and could’ve done so much more…just didn’t. There was nothing special about this plot. It was overused like every other high school romance story. The only difference is they put characters as zodiac members. The theme was cheesy, the atmosphere was dull and boring; it wasn’t a good story. It gave no purpose or message. It was just plain boring.Art: 5/10Not bad, but still kind of strange. I wasn’t a fan of how they designed the characters. I’m not the biggest fan of big eyed anime characters to begin with but there is a limit on how big the eyes can be. If there was a contest for what anime character had the biggest eyes, Tooru Honda would win hands down! The male characters were perfect example on how they should’ve been in this anime, and Tooru just…no. Just no.And the zodiac characters….okay, they aren’t fuzzy little plush toys you can cuddle. I think the dog and cat was the only normal design. The dragon is not….BLAHHH! A dragon is a dragon! And I was so disappointed on how they designed the dragon as so….soft! What ever happened to the old days when the zodiac animals weren’t…a cartoon?Sound: 3/10Word of advice…watch this in subbed. I feel like I probably would’ve enjoyed it….you know what…it wouldn’t have changed either way for me. But I watched it in dubbed, meaning I had to live through the squeaky and high voice of Tooru Honda. I love Laura Baily, but this character wasn’t for her. Every time I heard that Tooru speak made my head hurt. I’m disappointed in the dub cast of this anime. I regret not watching this in subbed.The opening song was a good choice! Until the episode started. When you watch an anime, the opening is a crucial element to the whole story. It’s what sets the watcher up, prepares them for an epic journey, gets them pumped and makes them feel what the anime is all about. The opening song gave a clear message: This anime has a tragic/ angst type story. The slow beats and the melancholy feeling it gave me was promising, but it didn’t tie into the genre, style, or atmosphere of the story. I mean sure it might’ve in the ending episodes, but through the first twenty, when they showed happy scenes with happy characters, it just made me shake my head. I skipped the opening since I had no interest in it.Character: 2/10One character: Tooru Honda. I think from reading the last part of my review will tell you all how I feel about this character. She’s whiny. She’s annoying. She’s someone who pretends that nothing is wrong.  Okay…the world is not all sunshine and rainbows and this girl tries way too much to try and make it so. Can I please shake her to her senses? Does she not have an angry bone in her body? I don’t think she shows more emotion than just joy until the climax. She’s probably one of my least favourite characters.Through the zodiac members, the only one I really liked was Shigure Souma and Kyou Souma. They should the humour in the anime and made me keep watching. Perhaps it was Kyou’s past that made me want to know more about him. These two characters were the only interesting part of the anime. End of story.Enjoyment/Overall: 3/10In short, or to summarize what I just said, this anime was a basket full of rotten fruit. And when your fruit gets rotten, you throw it out. I just didn’t throw it out in time. This anime may be well known, but don’t waste your time. If you do want to watch it…watch in subbed.I give this a 32% on the Rotten Fruits Basket scale. was slow going, unnecessary, and characters that should’ve and could’ve done so much more…just didn’t.

It's so gentle, touching and sweet. It's from 2001 and is 26 episodes long and is extra sweet.Story 9-10It's about a girl named Tohru Honda who lives in a tent. But she goes to live with the Sohma family that transform into animals when they are hugged by people of the opposite gender or when they are stressed. Then she makes there lives better. Fruit Basket is so very good to watch when you are not very well or are upset because it will make you feel happier. And It's funny,...It's so very funny. Also this show makes you feel all warm and fuzzy.Characters 10-10Tohru Honda is the most nicest, kindest, gentlest and most caring person in the universe. I so want Tohru Honda to be my older sister because she never gets angry ever. Nobodies perfect and everybody is different (that's what makes us special) but Tohru Honda is perfect at being nice to others. I think. On one episode she punishes a boy by giving him a hug and he stole from her, that's how nice she is. I wish I could be as nice as her. Also Tohru Honda will melt your heart and make you feel all warm and fuzzy. She'll even make mean and evil people feel all warm and fuzzy. It's so horrible she's not my older sister because Tohru Honda is the most caring and gentlest character ever. Also not once in the series did she get angry. Tohru Honda is also very helpful and sweet. Tohru Honda also teaches people that the most important thing to do is to love and care for others.Yuki Sohma and Kyo Sohma are both so very amazing. Yuki is so very kind. Yuki turns to a mouse and Kyo turns into a cat and they both don't like each other that much, so they fight a lot and it's so very funny. Kyo is mean and he gets angry easy but I know he is nice deep down. I so want to throw a water balloon at Kyo then I'll run behind Tohru Honda and hug her. Also Kyo is quite a angry person and Kyo and Yuki do fight a lot.Kagura Sohma is so very wild. She loves Kyo and attacks him and it's so funny. I so like her very much.Kisa Sohma is so very sweet. She does not talk because she does not want to. I actually know somebody just like that also Kisa follows Tohru and it's so very cute.The other characters are all very amazing and funny and they are all very different.Animation 9-10This so is so very colourful and it looks so gorgeous. I so love there eyes and the animation is smooth and fluid.Sound 9-10The music is so very good. It fits so goodly with this anime. The opening is not as good through. The opening is boring but the ending theme is so very extra sweet because Tohru Honda sings it. The voices are all amazing but I've only seen this anime in english (sorry) but the voices are amazing. I love Kyo's voice when he is angry and being mean to people and I so love Tohru Honda's voice when she is being the nicest person ever.Enjoyment 10-10I so love this show because it'll make you feel happy and it teaches you to be nice to people even if they are not nice to you. There is some fighting as well. Also if you are sick or got a cold or are upset if you watch this anime it'll make you feel all warm and cozy and happy. I love it.

It wasn\'t until almost four months later that I finally watched the first episode, on a recommendation from a friend. At first I was unsatisfied, and I did enjoy the show, but not as thoroughly as I have enjoyed many others.Story (6)- the story is perhaps the weakest part of the anime, starting out with a strong emotional beginning, only to let that pathos base disintegrate under the weight of the increasingly quirky Sohma family....While Tohru\'s pain and loneliness are a constant theme, they never are treated as completely as they should be, and the viewer is left with an uncomfortable feeling of problems left hanging by themselves, metaphorically duct-taped but never actually solved.Art (9)- While not necessarily perfect in animation (there are many shows that outdo it in basic artistry) this show\'s vibrant, calming backgrounds create a soothing atmosphere, which compliment the themes of unity and happiness within a family. Whenever I considered abandoning this anime in favor of something else, I was suddenly grasped by a beautiful and tranquil scene, reminiscent of old Chinese painting styles that quickly changed my mind.Character (7)- If the show featured only Shigure, then the characters would have been much more engaging. Sadly, it doesn\'t, and many of the characters grow boring very quickly. The ""I\'m the cat and I hate the rat!"" device can only go so far...Sound (6)- Music does contribute to the mood of the show, but it is not especially extraordinary or gripping.This show was enjoyable, but more so for me on the artistic level. If you are looking for a plot-driven, deeply philosophical series, this anime will scratch your back for a while but leave an irritating itch in the end. If you want to see an anime with a unique, and nice look (that\'s the best word to describe the look to this show, just completely and entirely nice), then this show will be much more engaging. All in all, not a bad show in any respect, but could still be forgone for a more captivating series.

Here\'s a list of things the two share in common:1)I think both are hugely overrated;2)they are both shoujo (duh!);3)They are both the heart-warming type of anime;4)They both have female leads that are so INHUMANELY nice that they can get a bit annoying.5)They both try (rather unsuccessfully, in my opinion) to be funny. Though ""Fruits Basket"" tries a lot harder than FMwS.And here\'s a list of things that the two anime differ in:1)FMwS\'s music kinda sucked a lot of the time despite the show being about music, whilst the...music in ""Fruits Basket"" is almost impeccable, with the soft instrumentals never failing to inject emotion into the more moving scenes. I loved almost all the background music apart from the ""drum roll comedy mode"" it sometimes goes into. In fact, the amazing opening track is possibly one of the reasons why I didn\'t hate this anime the way I hated FMwS - how could I bring myself to hate an anime with such an amazing opening theme? :D2)Whilst FMwS has loads of blatant filler episodes disguised under the excuse of ""character development"" (pretty poor excuse to be honest, since I didn\'t find most of the episodes character developing at all), I found the story in ""Fruits Basket"" has a nice flow that is developing constantly.Which is better? Well, I\'d have to say FMwS. Though plagued with fillers, FMwS nevertheless manages it to redeem itself a lot from its incredible last 10 episodes. ""Fruit Basket"", unfortunately, is full of ""filler comedy"" instead, and had no long lasting periods of awesomeness. The comedy used in ""Fruits Basket"" is the slap stick kind and not very witty for the most part. There\'s horrific overuse of super deformity to try and force a comedy moment when there simply isn\'t one. It\'s interesting to note that they went as far as completely immersing the comedy elements within the serious elements. But, I\'m afraid it\'s not something that I can appreciate because in general, I simply...  hate... this... kind... of... comedy. Besides, people rarely use comedy this way because you run the risk of diminishing the effectiveness of the serious moments with the comedy, which is often the case with this anime.Story and characters are the main strengths of this anime. I liked the way the story is developed in such a natural way. It\'s good that it chose not to do anything like the artificial ""zodiac animal of the week"" format that would have been so easy to fall into in this kind of anime. Instead, the characters gets introduced in a much more natural, unpredictable fashion. In fact, by the end, we don\'t even get to meet all of the zodiac animals... which may disappoint some people, but again, I think it just makes the whole thing seem less like an artificial character introduction process.Essentially, the theme of ""Fruits Basket"" is about being different, about the people who don\'t fit in with normal society. The focus of this anime all deals with these ""different"" people. In fact the title ""Fruits Basket"" itself is related to the backstory of the main character Toru being ""different"". It\'s a very moralistic story, and throughout the anime, I find myself sympathising with the characters as they tell their story such as the one told by Mimiji. Everyone seems to have a story to tell, and some were so moving they almost brought tears to my eyes - I particularly liked the story of the idiot traveller. These mini stories that are dotted across the whole series are mostly very captivating, but not all of them manage to hit the soft spot. I couldn\'t remember for the life of me the backstory to the ""Yankee"" (can\'t remember her name) cos it made such a light impression on me, and there were a few others that didn\'t quite work out. I got the feeling they were trying too hard to make a sad story for every character so some inevitably ended up feeling contrived, and I didn\'t really feel much at all for those characters. There are times where the voices sound like they\'re trying too hard to be emotionally crippled or something, and ended up sounding overly flat and apathetic instead, as though they are slowly learning how to read from a script. Speaking of flat voices... what a crap character that ""Yankee"" girl is. Another one of those deadpan emotionless characters - can she get any more cliched? For some reason this kind of character *really* gets on my nerves.Most of the characters are likeable, if a little annoying during the ""comedy"" moments. The only character who I find to be consistently funny is Shigure, probably because he doesn\'t rely so heavy on the super deformity humour, and is genuinely funny because of what he does and say in that sneaky way of his. I think that he is one of the most interesting characters in the cast - even though he acts like an idiot all the time, he is probably wisest of all. He sees through everything that goes on, but says very little of the things he sees.The main character Toru, with her pure, innocent personality, subtly changes so many of the characters over time. But the main problem, as I mentioned already, is that she is just too nice. The only time her infinite niceness is truly put to the test was during the last few episodes (again, just like FMwS). The last few episodes succeeds so well as a climax I had to watch them all in one sitting. They were undeniably exciting, but the motivation behind it is weak. It\'s painfully transparent that those events basically unfold just to give Toru a ""final test"", tougher than any she faced before, like a final boss in a game. But the main problem is that it makes no sense with respect to the plot - why, out of all animals, does the curse fall on that particular one? I can\'t really think of any reason why that animal would be special in that way, and the anime doesn\'t really provide any answers either. The result of Toru\'s confrontation with another character turns out to be boringly predictive too, and comes off as a bit of an anti climax - it feels like it\'s just all too easily resolved.Whilst I feel the cancer aspect in FMwS is played down too much and is very forgettable, the tragedy that happened to Toru\'s mother in this anime is given its deserved attention. Throughout the anime, Toru turns to the photo of her dead mother for guidance and strength. In fact, I think they may have overplayed it - it\'s all very convincing that Toru seeks to draw strength and comfort from the portrait of her mother, but to go as far as what she did in the bathhouse episode?! I think not. However much someone is devoted to their mother, I don\'t think anyone would do what she did in that episode... unless maybe they\'re too young to know better or not quite right in the head. Considering Toru\'s extreme niceness, I guess an argument can be made for the latterIn summary, Fruits Basket is for those who like an anime with lots of over the top comedy, and a story full of morals. But be warned, it contain characters that are so nice in a fairy tale kind of way that they\'ll annoy the hell out of people who don\'t quite appreciate niceness taken to those extremes. Some may even go as far as calling it ""puke inducing"". I wouldn\'t go that far personally, but the sweetness of the show is all a little bit too much. On a rating scale of Yes No or Maybe, I\'d give this a Maybe. music in ""Fruits Basket"" is almost impeccable, with the soft instrumentals never failing to inject emotion into the more moving scenes. I loved almost all the background music apart from the ""drum roll comedy mode"" it sometimes goes into. In fact, the amazing opening track is possibly one of the reasons why I didn\'t hate this anime the way I hated FMwS - how could I bring myself to hate an anime with such an amazing opening theme? :D2)Whilst FMwS has loads of blatant filler episodes disguised under the excuse of ""character development"" (pretty poor excuse to be honest, since I didn\'t find most of the episodes character developing at all), I found the story in ""Fruits Basket"" has a nice flow that is developing constantly.Which is better? Well, I\'d have to say FMwS. Though plagued with fillers, FMwS nevertheless manages it to redeem itself a lot from its incredible last 10 episodes. ""Fruit Basket"", unfortunately, is full of ""filler comedy"" instead, and had no long lasting periods of awesomeness. The comedy used in ""Fruits Basket"" is the slap stick kind and not very witty for the most part. There\'s horrific overuse of super deformity to try and force a comedy moment when there simply isn\'t one. It\'s interesting to note that they went as far as completely immersing the comedy elements within the serious elements. But, I\'m afraid it\'s not something that I can appreciate because in general, I simply...  hate... this... kind... of... comedy. Besides, people rarely use comedy this way because you run the risk of diminishing the effectiveness of the serious moments with the comedy, which is often the case with this anime.Story and characters are the main strengths of this anime. I liked the way the story is developed in such a natural way. It\'s good that it chose not to do anything like the artificial ""zodiac animal of the week"" format that would have been so easy to fall into in this kind of anime. Instead, the characters gets introduced in a much more natural, unpredictable fashion. In fact, by the end, we don\'t even get to meet all of the zodiac animals... which may disappoint some people, but again, I think it just makes the whole thing seem less like an artificial character introduction process.Essentially, the theme of ""Fruits Basket"" is about being different, about the people who don\'t fit in with normal society. The focus of this anime all deals with these ""different"" people. In fact the title ""Fruits Basket"" itself is related to the backstory of the main character Toru being ""different"". It\'s a very moralistic story, and throughout the anime, I find myself sympathising with the characters as they tell their story such as the one told by Mimiji. Everyone seems to have a story to tell, and some were so moving they almost brought tears to my eyes - I particularly liked the story of the idiot traveller. These mini stories that are dotted across the whole series are mostly very captivating, but not all of them manage to hit the soft spot. I couldn\'t remember for the life of me the backstory to the ""Yankee"" (can\'t remember her name) cos it made such a light impression on me, and there were a few others that didn\'t quite work out. I got the feeling they were trying too hard to make a sad story for every character so some inevitably ended up feeling contrived, and I didn\'t really feel much at all for those characters. There are times where the voices sound like they\'re trying too hard to be emotionally crippled or something, and ended up sounding overly flat and apathetic instead, as though they are slowly learning how to read from a script. Speaking of flat voices... what a crap character that ""Yankee"" girl is. Another one of those deadpan emotionless characters - can she get any more cliched? For some reason this kind of character *really* gets on my nerves.Most of the characters are likeable, if a little annoying during the ""comedy"" moments. The only character who I find to be consistently funny is Shigure, probably because he doesn\'t rely so heavy on the super deformity humour, and is genuinely funny because of what he does and say in that sneaky way of his. I think that he is one of the most interesting characters in the cast - even though he acts like an idiot all the time, he is probably wisest of all. He sees through everything that goes on, but says very little of the things he sees.The main character Toru, with her pure, innocent personality, subtly changes so many of the characters over time. But the main problem, as I mentioned already, is that she is just too nice. The only time her infinite niceness is truly put to the test was during the last few episodes (again, just like FMwS). The last few episodes succeeds so well as a climax I had to watch them all in one sitting. They were undeniably exciting, but the motivation behind it is weak. It\'s painfully transparent that those events basically unfold just to give Toru a ""final test"", tougher than any she faced before, like a final boss in a game. But the main problem is that it makes no sense with respect to the plot - why, out of all animals, does the curse fall on that particular one? I can\'t really think of any reason why that animal would be special in that way, and the anime doesn\'t really provide any answers either. The result of Toru\'s confrontation with another character turns out to be boringly predictive too, and comes off as a bit of an anti climax - it feels like it\'s just all too easily resolved.Whilst I feel the cancer aspect in FMwS is played down too much and is very forgettable, the tragedy that happened to Toru\'s mother in this anime is given its deserved attention.

She was only two episodes in, so I didn't expect anything but. It got me to thinking about when I first watched Fruits Basket two or so years ago when I first started watching anime. I didn't know what to watch once I was finished Special A, and so many people online recommended Fruits Basket, so I gave it a try.At first I thought that Fruits Basket was interesting, and had potential to be good, but they spent so long introducing new characters and not really giving...them that much of a story that it just fell flat. Maybe if I read the manga I'd have a different conclusion, but I felt like everything was left hanging, especially the ending. It was an interesting enough story, although I thought it left for little romance with them pretty much not being able to touch.Let me get onto Tohru (I'm actually suprised I still remember her name). She was clearly inhuman. She's got the least depth I've ever seen in an anime character. She's WAY to nice. No one on planet earth is that kind and modest. After a while it was just annoying. And she was way too innocent that it annoyed me. Yeah, I understand seeing guys naked is obviously going to get a reaction, but I swear she freaked out unnecessarily every time. I think the other characters are generic too. Her friends are generic weirdos, and the guys and girls of the zodiac are pretty much neatly tucked into a box. The anime tries to make it seem as though they have depth, but no. The character building was way too scarce for me to ever believe that.The art was nice.Overall, I think this anime is HIGHLY overrated. Which is strange, because apparently I like overrated things. (Death Note, Lovely Complex, etc). I don't know why everyone had so much praise for an anime that was discontinued. Maybe if you read the manga then I would understand. But if you didn't, why the hell watch it? It's not complete, nothing really goes on, it spends the whole anime building up a story that is inevitably not going to get solved within the anime. Torhu (God bless her heart) is the most annoying character in life. You never even know what she's thinking throughout the anime because she's too stupid to realize that these guys like her. THAT BEING SAID, this anime was good enough to finish... a lot of the time I just drop them. So... if that says anything to you?I think I just needed to pass the time.

I would have to say Hatsuharu Sohmais my personal favorite because of his black and white personality.  I think it's pretty cool, that when hugged by the opposite gender, the characters turn into an animal of the Zodiac.  It adds a nice twist to the show.  The whole story line is pretty good, and the episodes pretty much follow one after the other.This is definitely a peice of work.  Fruits...Basket shows a whole new meaning to trust and friendship.

Also, I really, really hate Tohru, and no, I'm not particularly interested in the manga, nor am I interested in considering the plot of the anime within the wider context of the manga. I'm also assuming that you know the basics of the plot.*So, here it is. One of the most successful, popular, and enduring shojo anime series of all time... Let's start with the good first.1. The character designs. I'm not necessarily a big fan of the huge-eyed ultra-cute style myself, but at least all the characters look distinct from one another, and are even given more than just one unique identifying...trait. On the flip-side, nearly every male character actually looks female--while this is played for laughs throughout, it's not long before we've caught onto the fact that the primary artist here simply does not like drawing men, and probably should have just stuck with a mostly all-female cast instead of beating this dead horse. Still, on the whole, there's not much to argue with here.2. Variety of animation style. Fruits Basket may shift through even more styles than FLCL, and that's saying something. Granted, it's got considerably more time to do so, but the team here display an accomplished sense of staging hyperactive animation sequences in such a way so as to not exhaust its audience. (The antics of two characters aside.)3. Background art. Clean and pretty--detailed when it needs to be and pleasantly understated otherwise. No, it's not gorgeous scenery porn, but at least it's never treated like it is, so that the focus stays on the characters, instead.As for the bad, well, most (and for the purposes of this review, pretty much all) of my complaints come down to the main character, Tohru Honda. She is the queen of doormats, of vapid moe-ism, of Mary Sues. She is so pure, lovable, innocent, idealistic, kind, caring, non-judgmental, helpful, and selfless that it's almost sickening. She's not a person. She's not even a character. She's an ideal masquerading as a character. There is no brain perched behind those wide eyes. No conflict deters her from her straight and narrow path to love everyone and make them feel better about themselves. She gets only one real moment of weakness, late in the series, but it feels so forced, and is over with so quickly, that you wonder why it was even bothered with at all. She is such a one-note character that once the 'big twist' of the series is revealed you know immediately how it's going to end, as it's far too late in the game to introduce another note now.Perhaps this would be somewhat forgivable if she was more of an observer than an active participant in the story--but nope, everything revolves around her. She sits squarely at the middle of a complex dysfunction junction that various depressed, tragic characters meander about. She meets these characters one by one, listens to their tragedy earnestly, learns of their true nature (not infrequently due to her clumsiness), then cutely monologues about why their life is better than they think it is. Her monologues are so insipid that I could not recall even a slender portion of them by the time the closing credits of each episode rolled around--yet they have such powerful effect on the other characters that even the Big Bad succumbs to her without her even going at him in full-force--she merely threatens to play psychiatrist for him.On the sliding scale of idealism vs. cynicism, this series obliterates said scale by just hammering relentlessly against the side of idealism. I suppose if you're looking for just consistent, pure heart-warming redemption, then this is the series for you. There is no challenge here--just slapstick comedy (admittedly occasionally funny) punctuated by saccharine, misty-eyed 'power of love and friendship' moralizing. I realize, of course, that sometimes all hurt people need is someone to love them and to listen to them. There is immense value in that. Fruits Basket, however, does not explore this need in any meaningful way. It exists on the same intellectual and emotional level that most romantic comedies do, and doesn't ultimately accomplish much more. (It arguably accomplishes less, since she doesn't even concretely wind up with anyone in the end.) I know that it's hard for people to not love something this cute and this well-intentioned, but its sweetness was too overpowering for my tastes. Not that I don't enjoy occasional fluff, but Fruits Basket fluff is so fine and loose that I could feel it clinging in my airways as I inhaled its fragrance. I'll require a powerful, burning tonic to wash it down, and therapy of a distinctly different sort than that which the smiling Tohru so readily and cheaply supplies. trait.

With a mildly unrealistic female main character, helping a slew of male characters to overcome problems based on social interaction, the material seems almost redundant by the time you finish the show. True the message delivered is quite potent and subtly monumental, but the presentation and delivery of it would have been much better if it were more raw (less overworked)....Don't look for action here, nor knee-slapping comedy, but expect to be slightly heart-warmed. I wouldn't recommend watching it all in one sitting as the pace can be slow, spacing it out will make it a much more enjoyable watch.Art - 7Certainly not the shows strong point, every character having the same sharp pointy nose, the same big eyes and the same shaped face. Eye color, and hair are the only defining features really, with no heavy people, no exceptionally short or tall people (save adults versus children), and little if any varied skin color. The environments were well done with great forest shots. A very pastel springlike feel to most of the artwork.Sound - 8The sounds of Fruits Basket have a pleasant feel to them, not very loud, or distracting, harmoniously catching your emotions and delivering them to wherever the show intends for you to be. The sounds work perfectly in performing their function, but on their own I think they would merely be acceptable, not being strong enough to be a focus.Character - 7Pretty standard character forms but most of them do well. The main character is unrealistically upbeat, and Yuki (her classmate) is a little weak in development only performing a story role, but the rest of the characters are pretty solid. I especially liked the trio of Yuki fans, and their interactions with Tohru's friend Hanajima. Mitsuru and her strange family are pretty unique as well.Enjoyment - 7I didn't feel like there was enough material to Fruits Basket, it felt a little too fluffy like cotton candy but not as sweet. There was the same feel to almost every episode, with little or no change of pace, and several redundancies. Overall it had a pleasant and fuzzy atmosphere with a few dark moments to add some flavor. A good watch for anyone who wants to see something with a strong heartwarming feel to it. Otherwise it might be kind of slow.Overall - 7 Don't look for action here, nor knee-slapping comedy, but expect to be slightly heart-warmed.

It's pretty much about a yong girl named Tohru, who lives in the woods in a tent after her mother's death. One day while walking to school, she finds a house and she decides to check it out. Apparently, a boy, Yuki Sohma, is known by Tohru, and walks to school with her and back. Yuki and his other family member that lives with him, Shigure, walk through the woods and find Tohru by the tent. She tells them that she's been living by herself in the tnt because of...her mother's death, and Shigure and yuki take Tohru into their house t live with them for awhile. The next morning, another family member, Kyo, go's into their home going to challenge Yuki to a duel, when Tohru accidently hugs him, Kyo turns into a cat. Yuki and Shigure go to Tohru, but she hugs them, too. Yuki turns into a mouse and Shigure urns into a dog. 13 poeple in their famil apparently are part of the Chinese Zodiac. Okay, Im taking too long. The story is very well done.Art: The art is very colorful, and very beautiful as well. The way how they make the eyes are very beautiful. If yo look at pictures of Fruits Basket, you can tell what I'm trying to say.Sound: The sound is very good. They try to make the voice overs sound as good as loud as the background. It's close, but not quite. And Laura Bailey as Tohru is great!Character: I liked all the characters in Fruits Basket with the exception of Akito. Tohru is a delight and will always put a smile on your face. Same with Yuki. Kyo and Shigure might not put smiles on your face, but they are great characters nonetheless. I don't like Akito because he's bossy and mean. That's why I put characters at a nine.Enjoyment: From watching all the Fruits Basket episodes, I've never seen a Fruits Basket episode that I haven't liked. The dub by Funimation was great. One of their best dubs. I'm a fan of comedy and slice-of-life shows, so that's a big reason I liked this show.Overall Fruits Basket is one of my favorite anime series and one of my favorite animes all together.

But the Souma family is not as it seems. Some of them are cursed: They turn into Jyuunishi animals when they are hugged by a member of the opposite sex.Okay this part is fine, but it brings to question how did it get its name? Well from a game Touru played when she was younger. If you happen to miss the episode where she was getting all emotional till the end you do not have any idea what fruits in basket have to do with...this series.Story 4: The story is the most repetitive story I think I have ever seen. Even competition animes have a bit more story. Here a new member of the Jyuunishi appears. The animal he/she is, is found, her/his issues are miraculously solved by Touru talking some mumble jumble and then everyone becomes happy and friends. Shot me. And this goes on till the end of the anime.Character 5: All the Souma family seem to collectively feel scared and neglected because of the curse. Then they also have another one dimensional characteristic like hot tempered and the show no other behaviour except this one. Now to Touru she is also one dimensional she only knows how to be happy and accept everyone with their entire flaw while in the middle giving long unnecessary speeches on acceptance. I will commit suicide.Sound 2: I never completely listened to the OP or ED which was just slow and boring. There was only one other sound in the whole thing. It was nauseating and played for too long in each episode making me want to kill myself. It usually just went on and on during Touru or some other persons speech.Art 6: All the characters are the same drawing with different eyes and hair really. From old to young people. The background art was not too bad but the characters were not giving enough time.I find this one of the most disappointing animes ever made. The beginning when the story, and sound seem new is fine but on approaching episode 20 it starts to get to you. And make you ill. So many people seem to think this is great, it is not. If I met Touru in real life I could kill her.The anime as opposed to growing on you grows off you, sad. There are so many better animes try them out and leave this far away from you.Overall: 4 Enjoyment:3 this series.Story 4: The story is the most repetitive story I think I have ever seen.

There are so many better animes try them out and leave this far away from you.Overall: 4 Enjoyment:3', ""I have never read the manga so I don't know if it has the same story but the ending in the anime ruined the whole series for me. I pretty much enjoyed the whole story until I got to the ending and there was no resolution at all.The main problem as I saw it in the story is that this family has a curse on them and they become an animal if you hug them. So this made it pretty much impossible for the main character to get together with this guy in the family that she liked. But at the end the curse wasn't...lifted and nothing really changed at all. I was unaware it was even the last episode because nothing really happened.But if you don't mind an anti-climatic ending then there really is nothing else wrong with this anime lifted and nothing really changed at all. I was unaware it was even the last episode because nothing really happened.But if you don't mind an anti-climatic ending then there really is nothing else wrong with this anime"", ""The idea of people turning into zodiac animals is really interesting and was a great way to hook my attention. I can also relate to Tohru in that her family is her friends. However, everything else was pure garbage—from the romanticism of homelessness to the emotional abuse. They try to pack in a ton of angst but it's always the same thing—a character is rejected by a loved one, they fall into an endless pit of depression, they lash out in unhealthy and destructive ways, Tohru monologues about how they need to suck it up and get happy followed by personal anecdotes, and everything is...suddenly peachy and everyone loves Tohru.The only conclusion this series seems to beat into their audience's head is that women can only be caretakers and are incapable or not allowed self-care. The women in this series would sooner risk their lives for others than be smart and ask for help when they also need it—which they never do. If there happens to be a woman capable of holding her own, she's either dead or she's the sidekick who shows up when it's convenient. The men are abusive and/or emotionally stunted and the world revolves around them. I don't recall a single interesting male character other than the bunny one but even he got annoying with the way he kept poking and prodding Tohru. Most of the boys have irritatingly large and fragile egos.This anime is only better than the manga because it's shorter. And it's especially odd because it's like it tries to be a slice of life-romcom but it just ends up being an edgy, unrealistic take on how high school kids should behave. It's also worse in the manga because almost every character is destructive in some way and the author suggests terrible couples like an adult/child relationship (pedophilia). There are tons of anime out there if audiences need a slice of life-romcom or a brooding boy who isn't irritating and abusive. Fruits Basket is not one of them. suddenly peachy and everyone loves Tohru.The only conclusion this series seems to beat into their audience's head is that women can only be caretakers and are incapable or not allowed self-care.

However, unlike much anime, this one does not depend on the characters emphatic exclamations of ‘I will do my best’ and willful hearts to solve everything.  The characters experience realistic problems and misunderstandings.  They struggle with their emotions and are often unable to overcome them in the face of their own logic.  The main character is kind and giving, but the reason others love her is NOT because she sacrifices herself to others petty impositions.  She...is important in the story because she can see past what people say and do, to what is really wrong underneath.  She also bears up under her own past admirably, but is not flawless and is as healed by her friends as they are by her.I did not give the series a 10 because the animation was not particularly amazing, there were a few wasted episodes that dragged on and were unrelated to the main arc, and in the end they never solved the original question of what the curse of the zodiac is.

This review will be talking about my first ever anime series: FRUITS BASKET! Because I thought it would be appropriate for a first review. I haven\'t watched it in some time so i might get some facts wrong, also if you think the review was helpful/not helpful, then i want you to explain why so that i can get some constructive criticism.Story: 7/10Alrighty, so the story is pretty new and refreshing, its pretty different from any other anime that i have seen but I guess its nothing really...special and exciting, but its still good. Long story short, it\'s about a girl named Tohru Honda who lives with 3 guys (No, its not what you think it is...damn pervert) who are cursed, this curse involves them turning into an animal of the Chinese zodiac every time they are hugged by a person of the opposite sex. You might think this Chinese zodiac thing is just an excuse to make funny moments and stuff, but I\'ll tell you this: things get pretty sad and tear-jerking down the road. Mark. My. Words.Art: 10/10OH MY GAWD! THE COLORS! For an anime that is 13 years old, it has some of the most beautiful scenery I\'ve seen, don\'t forget the colors as well! I\'ve seen over 50 anime series and this series\' art is in my top 10.Sound: 8/10This series OP and ED is probably something you\'ll never forget because its just so memorable. The OP will have you slowly swaying your head sideways and will make you try and sing along because it\'s just so fucking soothing. The ED is pretty goddamn relaxing, you could just listen to this outside when it\'s all sunny and just fall asleep like a baby.Character: 9/10Yep, every single character is different and I love it. Tohru Honda is the kindest and sweetest girl you will ever lay your eyes on, you thought you knew who the kindest anime girl was? Well i guess it\'s time to bring up a damn dictionary and look for the word ""kind"" or ""sweet"", Tohru Honda will has all of that and more! Yuki Sohma is maybe an exception to the whole ""different characters"" thing. I guess he\'s just your typical popular boy who could get a girlfriend faster than you can say ""Forever Alone"" but yet, he only has eyes for that one girl who doesn\'t really see him as a love interest and that makes every other girl mad. The only new thing with Yuki is that he turns into a dog every time a girl hugs him, oh and he sounds like a girl. Kyo Sohma is a guy with anger issues and a desire to be the strongest in the world. He hates Yuki more than anything and will do anything to beat him ever once. He\'s quite a mixed guy, he\'ll try to surprise you with a present and then he\'ll destroy the present because he thinks the present sucked, and then he\'ll take his rage out on Yuki. One little misstep and he\'ll be flying all over the room. These three are just the tip of the iceberg, I\'d love to tell you about all of them but then this review will just be too long and stupid.Enjoyment: 9/10I\'ve mentioned that this was my first anime series ever, so it definitely left a sweet taste inside my mouth. It\'s such a heart-warming story as it goes along and there are some pretty funny moments that had me laughing out loud like a psychopath at a hospital.Overall: 9/10If you want some good ol\' slice of life with a glass of comedy and a side dish of drama, then Fruits Basket is for you: the reader! Thank you so much for following me through my first review ever and remember to say your thoughts about my review, whether i kept rambling on about Yuki or how my jokes aren\'t funny, let me know! special and exciting, but its still good.

Thank you so much for following me through my first review ever and remember to say your thoughts about my review, whether i kept rambling on about Yuki or how my jokes aren\'t funny, let me know!', 'I\'ll try to make sure not to give any plot spoilers nor will I compare it with the manga (as I have yet to read the manga). With that, I\'ll begin my review with the hope it makes sense.1. Story (8/10)""Fruits Basket"" had a great plot. I loved the idea of the animals from the Chinese zodiac being incorporated into the characters. For this reason, I had very high expectations when going into this anime. Sadly, for as great as a concept as the story was, I simply couldn\'t relate to it or find myself engaged in the episodes. More than once I kept...looking to see if the episode was going to be over soon so I could go ahead and watch the next one and finish the series. So while it was a great concept, it didn\'t live up to the standards I had for it when I started watching it.Now it had pretty good pacing and the overall story in this anime was well done. Just because I didn\'t really enjoy the anime, doesn\'t mean that I can\'t appreciate that the plot was good. I just didn\'t think it was done as well as it could have been and it left me disappointed. Really disappointed. So, pushing personal bias aside, I will give the story an 8 out of 10. While I didn\'t think it that great, I do understand what the anime tried to do and it mostly did that.2. Characters (4/10)The characters were, in my opinion, the worst part of the show, which became the main reason I didn\'t enjoy this as much as I could have.Tohru: I found Tohru to be the most annoying. The more optimistic and happy she appeared, the more I came to dislike her. While I know it was her genuine personality, it didn\'t appeal to me in any way. I\'ve never been overly fond of happy, ever-optimistic characters that never seem to grow or have more complex human emotions, and that\'s exactly the type of character she was to me. While other people may be able to connect to Tohru, I simply couldn\'t do that. In my eyes she was nothing more than the proper, polite, obedient, great-at-cooking homemaker that everyone adores while having no real personality or depth. I know this is a harsh assessment that many others may very well disagree with, but that\'s how she came across to me.Kyou: If not for Kyou, I may have been more likely to drop the anime. While his character isn\'t the best character I\'ve seen, I do consider him one of the best in this series. I can understand his internal conflicts and he has, I think, the most problems. Maybe it was for this reason I enjoyed his character the most and I really wish the anime would have developed his character more (actually, I wish all of the characters were developed more).Yuki: He was easier to like than Tohru, but not nearly as interesting to me as Kyou. While he had his shining moments, and I did enjoy his character as well as I could for this anime, he still came out as just okay. Decent, but not definitely not exceptional. I think he was a great opposite to Kyou and I liked the dynamic of his character, but the anime fell short in developing him like I think he deserved to be developed.Others: The other characters weren\'t particularly memorable, but they weren\'t horrible to watch either. Some even came off as annoying at times. With that being said, I will admit that some of the other characters did have pretty good moments that made you really feel for them, but the overall of the characters still left a lot to be desired (including the leads).I really wanted to like these characters, and while I liked them enough, it wasn\'t enough to give this part a high score, so this part earns 4 out of 10 from me.3. Sound (7/10)Now, I will admit that I watched the dubbed version, and the voice acting in it wasn\'t that great in my opinion. Sadly, that\'s the version I ended up with since I foolishly forgot to check the audio track on the one I got and didn\'t feel like getting another version with the Japanese audio. Perhaps I would have liked this much better if I\'d watched the subbed version. So, because of this, I\'m only judging the music, and not the voice acting.The music was decent. I really enjoyed the opening song and didn\'t mind sitting through it every episode. The ending song wasn\'t as impactful, though it did fit with the feel of the anime. So while I didn\'t personally care for it, it did work, as did the music throughout the show earning a 7 out of 10 from me.4. Art (6/10)I don\'t have much to say about the art one way or the other. It was not impressive or awe-inspiring. It was not horrible or bad to look at either. Overall, it was good and I really can\'t find anything to complaint about or praise, so I\'ll give this a 6 out of 10.5. Enjoyment (5/10)I think my main problem with this anime is that I expected too much going into it. After reading a bunch of great reviews (both here and youtube video suggestions), I had great hopes for this anime. If I had gone into this without the high hopes, I may have enjoyed it much more.I found the same themes being repeated (fighting, arguing, unbelievable optimism, etc...) and it kind of annoyed me, but at the same time I get why the same things kept happening and I can\'t really fault the anime for this, even if I didn\'t really enjoy it much.You may think that I felt that ""Fruits Basket"" is a bad anime, but it\'s not. The plot is good, and some may even find the characters to be endearing. It just so happens that I didn\'t. There is a lot to like about it, and there were many heartwarming and (very) funny parts. To be fair this anime did make me laugh fairly often, and it because of this that I give it a 5 out of 10 when it comes to enjoyment.5. Overall (7/10)Regardless of my bias against it based on numerous personal annoyances with this anime, I can still admit that the ""Fruits Basket"" anime was good. It wasn\'t bad nor was it even just average. It also wasn\'t a masterpiece nor was it great. It was just good. If you like slice of life, comedy, with heartwarming stories of friendship and moral support, then this is an anime that would probably appeal to you. If you\'re looking for a deep story involving the Chinese zodiac or a romance for the ages, then it has the potential to disappoint you. looking to see if the episode was going to be over soon so I could go ahead and watch the next one and finish the series.

I was having an argument with one of my online MAL buddies and we were debating whether Fruits Basket was a good show. I personally loved Fruits Basket from the characters to the shoujo-esque plot, but my friend told me that it was the worst show he\'s watched. Wow. Most terrible? That\'s harsh, but whatever opinions are opinions and I\'m willing to share mine.A girl named Tohru loses her mother in a car accident and with no money or family relatives, she decides to live on her own. She finds a house in...the woods, and discovers that a family is living there. (Yuki, Kyo, and Shigure) But each member of this family has a curse that when they are hugged by the opposite gender they would turn into an animal based on the chinese zodiac. Unrealistic? Most likely, but hey anime is a form of entertainment and as long as it entertains then the anime is doing its job right. While the animal transformation thing might be the only thing that strikes this shoujo anime different from the rest, it\'s the execution, the characters, and the relationships of the characters that bring this show out to differentiate itself from the rest.The show is quite funny and cute with some plot elements that are usually to shoujo animes and mangas. The slapstick comedy was either a hit or a miss and seeing how I saw Fruits Basket a longggg time ago I remember finding it funny, not outrageously funny, but enough to crack a smile on my face. Though I consider the drama parts to be the most redeeming parts of the show. Seriously, I cried at the ending of Fruits Basket and episode nine or so. And let me tell you that\'s it hard for an anime to make me cry.Personally, I found the characters to be the best part of this show. Even the side character are enjoyable and help move the plot along, while having background stories of their own. But since there are so many characters. I\'m only going to describe the three main ones shortly. Tohru, the female lead character. A bit too nice and cheerful, but that\'s what makes people like her. She helps all the main characters get over their troubles. A goody-two-shoes you can say. Yuki, the popular boy at school. He is friends with Tohru and there is even a Yuki fan club running around the school. His chinese zodiac sign is the mouse. Kyo, the quick tempered boy who always jumps to conclusions. Starts off as a rouge character, but begins to develop feeling for Tohru as the series goes on. Sure, the characters might be so simple that they can be described in one sentence phrases, but it\'s the way they interact with one another that brings each person\'s charms out. Like the way Kyo interacts with Yuki is amusing and the way Kyo interacts with Tohru is heartwarming and touching.You might say the characters are cliched. Well, I find characters to be a very open topic, since one person could really like a character and another person could find them horribly awful. I found Fruits Basket to have amazing characters. Probably the most debated character is Tohru, since people complain how can she be so sunshine and rainbows after losing her home and her parents. But hey, I liked Tohru. I know she\'s not for everyone, but I found her cheerful attitude really likeable. I know it\'s not realistic and such, but I found Tohru to be a fine main character that brings her positive attitude to everyone else in the cast. And boy oh boy it feels like the majority of this cast need someone like her. No, most anime characters need a character like her. Tohru just has that aspect of her that makes her so friendly and positive. Quoting my friend\'s review on Fruits Basket... (pakxenon\'s anime review for Fruits Basket on animenfo.com)""With a mother lost to an accident and forced out of her home due to unwanted disturbance during renovations, she found her way into the Sohma family, and thus her wacky adventures begin! Going to school, janitoring for a job, and doing most of the housework for the Sohma\'s is just the few things that she does out of her good will. I will caution, however, that SOME people might find her too goody-two-shoes or whatever. If you don\'t like those kinds of characters, I don\'t recommend this :P.""Hmmm. People might complain how the atmosphere of the show is ruined by the characters trying to be ""seemingly happy but actually loldeep."" I thought the atmosphere was fine and I particularly prefer shows to have this kind of atmosphere. I think the creators were trying to manage the show to be a light hearted comedy with some hints of loldeepplot. Like if it was all deep I probably wouldn\'t have liked it as much, but with what I think engaging characters to draw me in. Which, characters are again widely debatable. I think Fruits Basket does a wonderful job at doing. And plus having a comic silly side of the show builds connection and like for the characters.Okay, so the characters in Fruits Basket have like enormous eyes that cover like 70% of their face. But I didn\'t find this distracting at all and some people might actually enjoy this style, just like how some people enjoy Clamp\'s noodly bodies. The drawings are typical 90s shoujo style. The manga started in 1999, so I\'m assuming the anime wanted to keep it this style. I find animations the least important thing in a show, but one of the most important aspects for people to start a show. Like I remember not watching TTGL, because I thought the art was wanky. Until my friend suggested it to me years later and then I found TTGL to be on my top ten animes of all time. Again, the show is totally aimed towards people with double X chromosome, but I strangely enjoyed it and would admit that Fruits Basket was/still is one of my favorite shows. It could be my nostalgia kicking in, since it was one of my first animes, and everytime I watch an episode again I find myself bringing up all the memories of what got me into anime.The OP and ED were perfect for this anime and fit the mood quite well. Well, of course the OP song is called, ""For Fruits Basket."" The background music was minimal, but very fitting, especially the music for all the dark scenes and keeping the atmosphere right. Yui Horie\'s voice for Tohru was very fitting. ilu Yui Horie. I thought Yuki sounded too feminine, but eh whatever.Anyway, if you really didn\'t like Fruits Basket. You can always write a review for it. I find the best writings are the ones to point out flaws or are satirical in nature. That\'s why I like reading anime reviews that point out flaws than reviews that shower the show with praise, since it\'s so much easier and personally more fun to read those reviews and disagree or laugh. Since to me I find it boring to read a review that goes, ""good animations, good characters, good blah blah."" I actually pay more attention to the ones that have low scores.Just a random sidenote: for example I really like Special A. (And if you like Fruits Basket you might like this show as well) I know it\'s not for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. And seeing someone review Special A and give it a low score is surprising for me. But it\'s not like I\'m going to thumbs down the score, because of that. If it\'s a good piece of writing and points the flaws out and backs them up, then I\'ll actually thumb up the review, since this person is trying to prove his/her point and well the message got through to me. I\'m not blindly gonna thumb up and thumb down reviews based on the score, which I feel like 70% of people do here on MAL. But instead reviews should be thumbed up and thumbed down based on the writing and the points.Anyway, Fruits Basket is still one of my favorite animes of all time. The characters, in my opinion, are the best part of this show and if you watch the first few episodes and already hate like 80% of the cast, then this show is not for you. Which, isn\'t a bad thing, but it\'s just that you have different tastes than other people. I wish Studio Deen would make a second season or start making their recent animes this good again. the woods, and discovers that a family is living there. (Yuki, Kyo, and Shigure) But each member of this family has a curse that when they are hugged by the opposite gender they would turn into an animal based on the chinese zodiac. Unrealistic? Most likely, but hey anime is a form of entertainment and as long as it entertains then the anime is doing its job right. While the animal transformation thing might be the only thing that strikes this shoujo anime different from the rest, it\'s the execution, the characters, and the relationships of the characters that bring this show out to differentiate itself from the rest.The show is quite funny and cute with some plot elements that are usually to shoujo animes and mangas. The slapstick comedy was either a hit or a miss and seeing how I saw Fruits Basket a longggg time ago I remember finding it funny, not outrageously funny, but enough to crack a smile on my face. Though I consider the drama parts to be the most redeeming parts of the show. Seriously, I cried at the ending of Fruits Basket and episode nine or so. And let me tell you that\'s it hard for an anime to make me cry.Personally, I found the characters to be the best part of this show. Even the side character are enjoyable and help move the plot along, while having background stories of their own. But since there are so many characters. I\'m only going to describe the three main ones shortly. Tohru, the female lead character. A bit too nice and cheerful, but that\'s what makes people like her. She helps all the main characters get over their troubles. A goody-two-shoes you can say. Yuki, the popular boy at school.

Everything about this series is stellar - ESPECIALLY the character development. Typically very deep character dev doesn't happen for girls or side characters so it is so refreshing to experience this series. There is a lot of emotional growth and reflection on personalities accompanied by funny moments, a supernatural-esque twist, and...a slight amount of action.Fingers crossed that the next season comes out soon! a slight amount of action.Fingers crossed that the next season comes out soon!"", ""This was one of the first animes I ever watched, and I was hooked.

But with nothing to do, and a lot of friends who greatly admired it, I downloaded the shoujo to buy it no more than two weeks later. The story is good, though not the best. A pretty young girl gets wrapped up in a science fiction/fantasy scenario involving a lot of beautiful young men. But while a synopsis may come off as dull and repelling to some, as it was for me, the elements of the show grip themselves together and create a truly unforgettable...experience.So we\'ve now all read what I thought of the story when I read about the show online. It sounded weak and amateur. But the way the story is executed went far beyond my shallow expectations. ""The curse"" I read in every blurb plays a very small part in the anime, I believe, at least in the sense that it doesn\'t seem to be the driving force through most of the storyline. What the show took to heart and really projected was the interactions of our beloved heroine, Tohru Honda, and the people she meets along the way.This brings me to the characters. These people may not be found in every corner of the Earth, but they are real enough to believe and connect with. The characters have carefully selected individualized emotions that they keep to themselves, and we viewers have to watch them be masterfully uncovered, in order to better appreciate the show ourselves. Even if the plot doesn\'t appeal to you, I would suggest you put your time towards Fruits Basket for the genius cast of characters created.The sound and the music was designed flawlessly for the art. While I don\'t appreciate all of the images and sequences (particularly when facing a more dramatic moment), I do enjoy the upbeat and lively look and sound of the anime. The music will, I repeat will, get caught in your head, and makes the pictures in front of you into an even cuter scene than what was already, silently, there. I hate to compare for a review, but I will here anyway (may it be the only time I do!): the anime\'s sound and art better projects the ""love life"" feel of Fruits Basket than the manga is able to do. I would suggest putting the anime before the manga. Then go back for the completed story.Even animes I hold in the highest regard often go untouched on my shelf after I\'ve finished them, but as for Fruits Basket, each DVD is incredibly worn down.

It\'s within my top five.-shoujokiss7', 'Short review:I found this anime to be very enjoyable and well executed. The characters were great, the story was simple yet effective, and the English dub is better than the original voice acting. However, the artwork and animation quality is extremely average, and the music, while unique, was not a highlight of this anime.Loooooooong review:Story: Fruits Basket takes a very slice-of-life approach to telling its story, with each episode being rather self contained. Often times, an episode is spent getting to know one of the members of the Sohma family (most often a guy, you know, because of the whole Tohru-hugging-them-thing to reveal...what animal they are.) There are your standard slice-of-life episodes, including a hot springs, school festival, and Valentine\'s Day episodes that we\'ve all probably seen many times before. But this isn\'t a bad thing, as characters are developed and moral lessons are taught basically every episode of Fruits Basket. This wasn\'t just a tack-on, because it never felt forced or dumb. Instead, I found myself smiling uncontrollably at times while watching this anime, and other times in a state of awe or loss. I\'ve mentioned before in my reviews that I don\'t really like episodic shows. But I think part of the reason Fruits Basket worked for me is because I went into this anime with barely any expectations. It\'s because of this method of storytelling that I don\'t consider this anime AS MUCH of a shojo as others would say, to be honest. The comedy is actually fairly innocent, with only a sprinkling of sexuality here and there. It\'s rather light, without it being the focus of the story, and it\'s primary niche is its quirkiness. There\'s also plenty of drama and depressing, thought-provoking moments in Fruits Basket, so not everything is bishis, rice balls, and comedy routines. I thought the drama was handled really well, and was entirely believable, instead of it all feeling superficial. Overall, because of how Fruits Basket handled its\' story, I would actually recommend this to be the first shojo anime anyone watches. But a bit of advice here: skip episode 22. It was such a pain to watch, personally, and I don\'t think it added to the story that much. The ending I found to be interesting, actually, in that is followed the manga instead of diverging off, like what Ouran did.Characters:As usual for slice-of-life and shojo anime, Fruits Basket is a very character-driven show. Every character is unique, has their own quirks, and a different problem in their life. The cast of Fruits Basket is actually rather large, but to me, it didn\'t feel like the characters were based too much on common archetypes of shojo anime. All these beastly boys and girls revolve around our protagonist Tohru Honda, who\'s sweeter and kinder than a teddy bear decked out in pink ribbons holding a basket of Mars Bars. Her desire to improve the lives of everyone around her is matched only by her desire to not be a burden to anyone. This may make her come off as a cookie-cutter or annoying character. I didn\'t think so, because she\'s not perfect; she has her own problems. There\'a a certain joy I got out of these characters simply by seeing a character come back after their respective spotlight episode. It\'s the feeling of character relationships growing and changing that often brought each episode to a close, and very often made me feel extremely satisfied, just by seeing these characters interact. What Fruits Basket tries to emphasize with its characters is that no one is perfect. Characters still have flaws, even after Tohru manages to change their hearts. One thing I noticed about the characters in Fruits Basket is how a lot of them can pull a 180 character flip rather quickly and frequently. Yuki? Check. Kyo? Check. Kagura? Check. Hatsuharu? Oh yeah. This is mostly for comedic effect, but is occasionally used for drama and character development, like with Momiji or Kisa. And when the show does this, it\'s GOOD. I found myself holding my hands to my mouth from the shock of back-stories and thoughtful words that came from these characters\' mouths. But I can almost guarantee to anyone that there will be a character you will love, and one that is absolutely annoying. I\'ve heard from the haters of this show complain about all the characters being annoying, and to be honest, sometimes I can see where they\'re coming from. The only reason I can understand this is because of the character that was annoying for me, Hiro Sohma. Even though he did change a little for the better, this kid is almost as much of a brat as Aloise Trancy. (And he even looks like him)Art:It pains me to say this, but there isn\'t anything that great about the art in Fruits Basket. But this is probably due to the fact that this anime was made back in 2001. From what I\'ve seen, Studio Deen has only recently made anime with decent artwork, such as Hetalia and Is This A Zombie. All the character designs are very simple, but at the same time, classic shojo. The distinguishing feature of the characters is almost always the hair. The art is a bit different than the manga (which I am reading, actually), which must have come as a bit of a shock to those that watched Fruits Basket when it first aired. The color pallet is very muted and pastel, with probably the brightest thing being Kyo\'s hair. The use of exaggerated backgrounds during comedic scenes added to the effectiveness and appeal to the comedy. The set pieces have a hand painted look to them, but not so much that it is blatantly obvious, a la 1994 Sailor Moon. Overall, the art is a bit dated, but at the same time has aged surprisingly well. The simple sweetness of the art perfectly compliments the nature and tone of Fruits Basket.Animation:As I\'ve said before, animation is not usually the highlight of a shojo anime. Fruits Basket is one of Studio Deen\'s classic titles, and as I said above, they still aren\'t the best when it comes to animation. Animation is usually kept to a minimum, and sometimes small motions are repeated or go through loops. However, this isn\'t necessarily a bad thing this time and is a bit understandable, as I believe Fruits Basket was animated at least partially with traditional cels. There are your typical anime shortcuts for emotion or action (anger veins, speed lines, the river of tears, many arms and legs while running, etc.) But the exaggerations are a good part of what made the comedy funny, and I just can\'t imagine Fruits Basket without them, really.Voice:Like I often do, I\'m recommending watching this anime dubbed, partially because Yuki sounds nothing like a guy in Japanese. Yes, you have Laura Bailey, Eric Vale, and Jerry Jewell (common Funimation leads) as Tohru, Yuki, and Kyo, respectively, but I didn\'t really recognize anyone else on the cast list. Which is good if you often associate English voice actors with their other roles in anime. Many old dubs are associated with being cheesy, but Fruits Basket is a bit of a different case. Either I didn\'t mind the cheesiness, or the anime was very often cheesy so the script went well with the anime. Probably a mix of both. Chris Sabat pulled off a flawlessly flamboyant Ayame, Kent Williams a cold-but-kind Hatori, and John Burgmeier was outstanding as the perverted, but fatherly Shigure. I think everyone pulled off their roles well, though some of the actors or actresses fell a bit short when it came to the drama moments. But I think this dub worked very effectively with the comedy, and that is enough for me to call this a good dub. There isn\'t much about this dub that can be called ""outstanding,"" but there\'s nothing wrong with it, either, so if the sub and dub are equal, I always choose dub.Music:The opening and ending themes are both quiet, simple, sweet, but overall unremarkable. They\'re easily skippable, unless you like that sort of thing. A lot of the OST is as quirky or fun as the characters. Other times, the tracks were just ""little sounds"", simple melodies, or just piano pieces. Now, none of these tracks are bad, it just sometimes feels like the OST isn\'t there, really. It seemed to me that the only purpose for most of the OST was to make the slice-of-life sound very cute and fun. However, I give the OST points for being unique.Execution:I can\'t judge execution for Fruits Basket as much as I can with other anime, simply because of my lack of expectations when I started. If you\'re looking for a full-on shojo romance anime, you may be a bit disappointed with Fruits Basket. Thankfully, I did not have this mindset or expectation while watching this anime, so I thought the slice-of-life was handled and worked really well. And it wasn\'t just about the pretty boys, I also thought the balance between the comedy and the drama/character development was really great as well, giving Fruits Basket a lot more substance than if it was just a plain slice-of-life. This anime works perfectly fine as a shojo, but I consider this anime the kind that will cheer you up and put a big smile on your face. Fruits Basket is the kind of anime where you just watch one or two episodes after a long day, instead of marathoning it on the weekend.My Enjoyment:There were plenty of times in Fruits Basket where I could not stop smiling. And when the show did get serious, I felt myself really sympathizing with the characters. Sure, there were a few annoying characters, but thankfully, I can count them on one hand, and they didn\'t show up often in the anime. Fruits Basket is my second favorite shojo anime of all time, but I think that\'s because I\'ve seen more bad ones than good. It\'s mainly because of this anime that I don\'t consider myself a slice-of-life hater, a sort of beacon of past glory, in the sea of moe girl slice-of-life that occupies much of anichart every season. So, other than a few hiccups,and this was all due to personal taste, really, my enjoyment of Fruits Basket was very consistent. what animal they are.) There are your standard slice-of-life episodes, including a hot springs, school festival, and Valentine\'s Day episodes that we\'ve all probably seen many times before. But this isn\'t a bad thing, as characters are developed and moral lessons are taught basically every episode of Fruits Basket. This wasn\'t just a tack-on, because it never felt forced or dumb. Instead, I found myself smiling uncontrollably at times while watching this anime, and other times in a state of awe or loss. I\'ve mentioned before in my reviews that I don\'t really like episodic shows. But I think part of the reason Fruits Basket worked for me is because I went into this anime with barely any expectations. It\'s because of this method of storytelling that I don\'t consider this anime AS MUCH of a shojo as others would say, to be honest. The comedy is actually fairly innocent, with only a sprinkling of sexuality here and there. It\'s rather light, without it being the focus of the story, and it\'s primary niche is its quirkiness. There\'s also plenty of drama and depressing, thought-provoking moments in Fruits Basket, so not everything is bishis, rice balls, and comedy routines. I thought the drama was handled really well, and was entirely believable, instead of it all feeling superficial. Overall, because of how Fruits Basket handled its\' story, I would actually recommend this to be the first shojo anime anyone watches. But a bit of advice here: skip episode 22. It was such a pain to watch, personally, and I don\'t think it added to the story that much. The ending I found to be interesting, actually, in that is followed the manga instead of diverging off, like what Ouran did.Characters:As usual for slice-of-life and shojo anime, Fruits Basket is a very character-driven show. Every character is unique, has their own quirks, and a different problem in their life. The cast of Fruits Basket is actually rather large, but to me, it didn\'t feel like the characters were based too much on common archetypes of shojo anime. All these beastly boys and girls revolve around our protagonist Tohru Honda, who\'s sweeter and kinder than a teddy bear decked out in pink ribbons holding a basket of Mars Bars. Her desire to improve the lives of everyone around her is matched only by her desire to not be a burden to anyone. This may make her come off as a cookie-cutter or annoying character. I didn\'t think so, because she\'s not perfect; she has her own problems. There\'a a certain joy I got out of these characters simply by seeing a character come back after their respective spotlight episode. It\'s the feeling of character relationships growing and changing that often brought each episode to a close, and very often made me feel extremely satisfied, just by seeing these characters interact. What Fruits Basket tries to emphasize with its characters is that no one is perfect. Characters still have flaws, even after Tohru manages to change their hearts. One thing I noticed about the characters in Fruits Basket is how a lot of them can pull a 180 character flip rather quickly and frequently. Yuki? Check. Kyo? Check. Kagura? Check. Hatsuharu? Oh yeah. This is mostly for comedic effect, but is occasionally used for drama and character development, like with Momiji or Kisa. And when the show does this, it\'s GOOD. I found myself holding my hands to my mouth from the shock of back-stories and thoughtful words that came from these characters\' mouths. But I can almost guarantee to anyone that there will be a character you will love, and one that is absolutely annoying. I\'ve heard from the haters of this show complain about all the characters being annoying, and to be honest, sometimes I can see where they\'re coming from. The only reason I can understand this is because of the character that was annoying for me, Hiro Sohma. Even though he did change a little for the better, this kid is almost as much of a brat as Aloise Trancy. (And he even looks like him)Art:It pains me to say this, but there isn\'t anything that great about the art in Fruits Basket. But this is probably due to the fact that this anime was made back in 2001. From what I\'ve seen, Studio Deen has only recently made anime with decent artwork, such as Hetalia and Is This A Zombie.

Many of you will cry in despair cause you'll have to search and find another equally disgusting anime to soothe your burdened heart or you'll cheer it's journey to oblivion and crack open a champagne.. I take it you've gathered in which camp i'm in, but if your brain has flatlined and you cannot comprehend ratings then here are the headlines.And let's start with the story which is part what it says in the synopsis and part emotional manipulation to cover up for the fact that it's devoid of any actual substance and soul...And...here comes the most ridiculous story i have come across in some time..But then again my brain-despite the abuse-still works just fine.Honda Tohru is our main vict...What's wrong with me lately, i meant character..Who after her mother's death has been living in a tent cause she didn't want to be a burden to anyone...Now as to why she didn't off herself that's still a mystery and i do believe that the only solution at times like these is to hang yourself.. BUT one day, her hot as fuck classmate Souma Yuki comes to learn about her living in the dark slams and invites her to live at his house along with his weird cousins Shigure and Kyou...Now i'm not a teenager, let alone a girl, cause i have 2 things hanging and causing me terrifying pain when they hit each other, but i would assume that if a semi-stranger invited me to live in his house with other 2 men then i'd really have something to think about..It's a terrible world we live in you know.But our resident idiot accepted the hottie's offer and she soon found out that the Souma family is anything but ordinary. In fact she learned that certain members of the family are transexuals and no that's not it,wait a minute.. WINDOWS ARE NOW LOADING.........Ok what i'm about to write is even more preposterous than the trans thingy i was imagining..They turn into the animals of the Chinese Zodiac when hugged by someone of the opposite sex...And as if that wasn't enough our lab rat decided that she's Dr. Phil and that she would fix them with heavenly love.Now...I've been in situations where one could say i was in love or something like that cause as i've said time and time again i'm dead inside and incapable of human emotions..And i can safely say that the last chick to perform psychoanalysis to me is now a permanent member of the deep sea club and rightly so. I mean who wants to be fixed anyways? I like ol' broken me cause my faults-which are many i admit-are what makes me ME...So fuck off little bitch i like my emotions like my Jack Daniel's...Bottled.Back to the anime itself the whole 26 eps marathon is the exact same formula:“Tohru meets a new member of the Souma family–wonders if he/she is a member of the Zodiac–inevitably causes said person to transform–learns about the person’s troubled past–says some profound shit-rinse and repeat until your skin dies and falls off.26 eps that are formulaic and in those 26 eps not all of the family members are introduced and as for the relationships... Well they don't work at all and those that do work to some extent they don't cover much distance in the run of 26 eps.. And in these 26 eps there's not enough time to run through every member of the cast extensively so what we are dealing in the very least are 26 eps that feel and indeed are filler eps so in these 26 eps there's not even a hint of plot advancement...So in case your brainwaves are still a perfect dead line that means that these 26 eps are nothing but an endless intro to the manga which i've been told is way more interesting in terms of storytelling.That doesn't mean that FB is a total waste of time..Maybe it's 90% waste of time cause in this 10% that's left there are some genuinely good moments of laughter and moments where you can certainly feel that shit is about to get real.As for the animation..Well as was the trend back in the day the animation is a mix of weird shaped faces, huge eyes and a background taken from the drawings of people with no hands and feet...Or perception of animation..Well as long as it has heartfelt scenes in it animation is deemed an afterthought.Now i feel i should talk about the relative success this anime had and how it's considered a classic?! And i think it comes down to the fact that people will get suckered in the melodrama aspect of it and wil go blind to everything else that matters and the fact that they're having trouble separating the anime from the manga. On that last front and from what i've been told so far about the manga it sounded interesting and if they didn't make a hass of it in the way they did and followed the manga to the end then i have the feeling i too, would be singing praises..Granted the anime covers 6 or so chapters of the manga but then again who the hell told them not to wait and cover it in its' entirety?The conclusion is that they wanted to cash in on the emotionally unstable reactions people have when anything has fluff and caramelized tears in it hits the screens and that it's a very very long advert for the manga..26 eps worth of advert.. here comes the most ridiculous story i have come across in some time..But then again my brain-despite the abuse-still works just fine.Honda Tohru is our main vict...What's wrong with me lately, i meant character..Who after her mother's death has been living in a tent cause she didn't want to be a burden to anyone...Now as to why she didn't off herself that's still a mystery and i do believe that the only solution at times like these is to hang yourself..

So she continues to live with 3 members of Souma family in their house, Souma Yuki, Souma Shigure and Souma Kyou. She soon found out about their family secret but she swore that she will keep...it and no one will hear about secret ( that they can transform intro zodiac animals ) but it\'s curse.And then journey begins with her sad past and with their curse. I must say that story keeps me warm around hearth and it\'s phenomenal. 10/10Art: So art for 2001 year is beautifull.Character design you could say it\'s over the average.Colors of their faces, how their eyes match with hair color, things that they wear and everything is pretty much awesome.Sound: This show had beautifull opening and that\'s what first caught my eyes.I never skipped opening while watching 26 episodes in a marathon, and it\'s awesome cause u know when it will end so you don\'t have to guess where to start watching.I especially liked part when Momiji ( support character ) started singing song, emotions at that scene were pretty much hard and i learned to sing whole song in like 5 minutes.Character: This is one of the animes where you don\'t even have to look hard for character development.The way story was going is the way they were changing. They were opening more and more.Honda is beautifull girl that loves to smile everytime but she is in deep pain and her laugh is priceless.She can make friends easily but she is kinda shy.I liked everything about her so much.Kyou is kinda agressive character that can\'t control his feeling and he can get mad pretty easy.His relation with Yuki is intense and i love it.I love everything about Kyou,hes like tsundere.Yuki Yuki "" Prince "" is character that is Mr.Perfect, all girls want him. Hes inteligent,knows how to talk to everyone.Hes extrovert type with sligtly slap of introvert.Shigure is like their support, he\'s writter with kinda pervert character.Hes the guy that would be funny at party\'s.Enjoyment: Well i didn\'t enjoy shows like this for a long time.You will get hit with feels so much, and  you will die of laught.I noticed its like first half of episode is to make you laugh and other half is to put you down on the floor with hard feels and thats what i really liked in this show.You will never guess about anything that is about to happen so that makes you want more and more.Overall: Outstanding show, every aspect of this show is perfect, story/art/sound/character/enjoyment everything is right on the spot.You will remember scenes from this anime for a long time and when u hear some after long time you will feel like someone strangles your hearth and than warmness. Definetly one of the greatest i watched ( my opinion of course ). Watch it you won\'t regret if you want sad/happy show. it and no one will hear about secret ( that they can transform intro zodiac animals ) but it\'s curse.And then journey begins with her sad past and with their curse.

Hes inteligent,knows how to talk to everyone.Hes extrovert type with sligtly slap of introvert.Shigure is like their support, he\'s writter with kinda pervert character.Hes the guy that would be funny at party\'s.Enjoyment: Well i didn\'t enjoy shows like this for a long time.You will get hit with feels so much, and  you will die of laught.I noticed its like first half of episode is to make you laugh and other half is to put you down on the floor with hard feels and thats what i really liked in this show.You will never guess about anything that is about to happen so that makes you want more and more.Overall: Outstanding show, every aspect of this show is perfect, story/art/sound/character/enjoyment everything is right on the spot.You will remember scenes from this anime for a long time and when u hear some after long time you will feel like someone strangles your hearth and than warmness. Definetly one of the greatest i watched ( my opinion of course ). Watch it you won\'t regret if you want sad/happy show.', 'Well I will start at the Beginning. Tora a highschool girl forced to live in a tent after her mother a ex-bike gang member dies. But shortly she is discovered by the Sumo Family and come to live with them. But they are cursed to turn into one of the zodiac animals. Join them and watch as the story unfolds and adventures they come across. Mostly Comedy with a mix of Drama and some action. ', ""Story:  (8) It took forever for me to actually give Fruits Basket a try.  Every review talked about how great it was but the description always made me hesitate, a cursed family that changes into animals of the chinese zodiac when they're hugged by members of the opposite sex...  Hmmm.   Maybe not.  But finding myself in a desperate anime rut I decided to give it a try and it was very, very good.  The thing that keeps this anime from being great or even outstanding is that it is only 26 episodes long and the way it's paced...makes it obvious that everyone involved thought that the anime was going to last longer than it did.  I started the manga and the anime for Fruits Basket at the same time and aside from minor changes they run parallel for quite awhile but they do diverge towards the end and the last episode was an incredibly clumsy way of tying off the series.Art:  (7) The art is good or at least there didn't seem to be anything bad about it.  It did what it needed to do for the romance/comedy/drama that Fruits Basket is.Sound:  (7) Again it seemed fine, the opening music grows on you and the music played during the Kyo and Yuki fights adds to the scene.  Not sure that it actually belongs in this part of the review but I highly recommend watching this one in japanese.Character:  (10) The best, it's what will draw you in.   As light as the description of the Sohma family curse sounds the consequences can be  surprisingly dark and tragic, all the characters reflect that.  The anime did a great job filling out the characters from the manga but keeping them completely consistent...except for in that last episode.Overall:  (9)  As much as I've complained about it's failings I really do love this anime, it's worth watching even if you don't plan on reading the manga. makes it obvious that everyone involved thought that the anime was going to last longer than it did.

If I could rate Enjoyment  in my own way, it'd be past 100, just saying :)Onto the review!!Fruits Basket is a story of an orphaned girl, Tohru Honda, who lives in a tent because she doesn't want to be a burden to her remaining family. Then she gets found by by Yuki Sohma, a classmate of hers. She comes to live with him Shigure and Kyo Sohma. She also finds out that their family is cursed. Rest of the info should be found...in the general area above because I can't be bothered explaining the rest.The story is sweet. It's a slice of life/shoujo/comedy/mystery-drama sort of anime, though the mystery/drama doesn't show in the anime as much as it does in the manga. Fruits Basket takes genres that arn't exactly gripping and makes it awesome. You're not hanging off the edge of your seat or anything in this anime, no. You just watch it, feel warm inside and watch the next episode simply to feel warm all over again. It works here. A lot of anime/manga that fall under the above categories don't exactly work out but Fruits Basket does.Not the most gripping of stories (anime-wise) and it will leave you wanting to watch more.The art was actually pretty good. A bit iffy at times but it was still good.The sound really suited this anime though there wasn't anything catchy to add onto your ipod or mp3 player. It brought out the best of scenes. Like in a serious scene, you would hear the heavy rain and nothing else. Thinking about it now, the BGM reflects on what Tohru feels. Most it is happy and light but when she's at loss for words, then it does show in the music. The BGM did bring out the best of scenes :) The OP and ED were also fitting, but like I said, nothing that catchy. It was just another OP/ED that I skipped to get to the episode.Characters was really what stood out. Everyone's an individual. Everyone has their own reason for things, their own way of reacting, it's not your typical anime where you can predict the characters' actions. Well, it is somewhat predictable but the characters really do shine out. Tohru brings out the best of everyone. Like, you find characters that you simply want to punch their faces in, but if Tohru had effected you, then you would think to forget their faults and learn that each character is not a bad person themself, just individual.Is it weird to say that I admire Tohru? After watching this, I told myself that I would be a nicer person and try to understand everyone. I may not be the nicest person but I'm not as judgmental as I was before. The characters really are moving and I loved the entire cast, cept for the odd one of two.I really did enjoy Fruits Basket. Recently I've been seeing reviews about how people loved Fruits Basket the first time, but realised it wasn't that good the second time round. Sure, it wasn't as good but I find it a classic anime. I can watch it again and again and I could probably still laugh at everyone's antics or tear up when I relate to something or one of the characters' past were sad. This anime kind of changed me as a person. Call me biased but I love Fruits Basket to bits, the anime and manga.Fruits Basket, all in all, is an easy slice of life to watch. Depending on your character, you could love this or simply find it a bit boring. Though it's a SoL, its gets really deep and meaningful a lot of times. It touches on themes of depression, bullying and a whole lot more. I think that anyone can find something to relate with this anime. I recommend this series to absolutely everyone. It's just one of those anime you have to watch, even if you're iffy about it.Like Tohru's mother said, always give the benefit of the doubt :) in the general area above because I can't be bothered explaining the rest.The story is sweet.

The story surrounds a girl named Tohru Honda, who, in the aftermath of her mother's death, finds herself living with Shigure Sohma, and his two younger cousins Yuki Sohma and Kyo Sohma, all members of the enigmatic Sohma family who, upon being hugged by a member of the opposite sex, transform into animals of the Chinese Zodiac. At first,...Tohru enjoys her time with the Sohmas, only learning as the days pass that there is a dark, tragic secret behind the Sohma's curse.Although only a part of the beautiful manga series, as the anime ended prematurely, the part that is translated into motion is beautiful. The story is done in a tactful, gentle progression that, although filled with humor, gradually shows you that the world you are looking into is really filled with angst and suffering, almost to an Evangelion-esque level. Although I wish they could have proceeded to later story arcs in the series, they do manage to pull off a convincing story almost independent of the manga.Although somewhat aged by today's standards, the artwork is still stunningly beautiful. It has a whimsical feel to it, much like Ouran Host Club, but still can pull off some surprisingly dark images, like later on in the series. The characters are all beautiful looking, which is important in a shojo series like this.The voice acting is astounding in both English and Japanese. I have rarely seen a dub of this caliber before, except maybe Cowboy Bebop. In particular, Tohru and Kyo's voices are extremely good, maybe even superior to the original cast!I overall loved the series, and, although I wished they could make a few more seasons to cover the rest of the manga series, I am satisfied for now. ^_^ Tohru enjoys her time with the Sohmas, only learning as the days pass that there is a dark, tragic secret behind the Sohma's curse.Although only a part of the beautiful manga series, as the anime ended prematurely, the part that is translated into motion is beautiful.

The plot is well done and quite original, the dialog is funny and cute, and there are some dramatic moments that even brought tears to my eyes. Fruits Basket holds a perfect balance between comedy and drama, but there's much more to this show than just that: it has substance. Tohru's appreciation for the little things in life might even cause you to reflect on your own life and make some changes.Story-wise, the plot is manages to stay light while hinting at something darker. I have to say, it...comes to a pretty sudden end, and I personally feel that not too much was resolved. Once you finish the anime, it would be a good idea to pick up the manga, seeing as the story continues much farther in manga-format. It would have been nice if the show were longer, but I thoroughly enjoyed the 26 episodes and will certainly continue to re-watch them.Artistically, Fruits Basket is drawn in a very cute style (the Zodiac animals are absolutely adorable), which might cause some men to shy away from it... Still, I can definitely see that the show can be appreciated by both sexes.Sound-wise, the opening and ending are very cute and sweet. I even have the Fruits Basket soundtrack. The music, especially during Yuki and Kyo's fights and when Ayame pops up, really adds to the viewing experience. I recommend watching the English dubbed version. The voice actors did a great job of bringing out each character's distinct personality through their voices.The characters are very well created, and each one has a firm back-story that allows the viewer to understand and sympathize with them.

It’s sad that they didn’t stay true to the actual manga and in fact, they messed up a gender since the manga wasn’t finished before hand. I won’t spoil it but those who read the manga, you might be able to guess. Unfortunately, when they did this, they changed the reasoning behind how they act and it just messes up the story since it’s a pretty big roll in it. The story does keep the fact that it starts out...really fun and then to the later middle and ending, it gets a bit more down and depressing. Just a little bit of a warning.The characters are fun and lively with their personalities but each one seems to be a stereo typical to an anime standard. Tohru reminds me a lot like myself, her personality and how she takes care of anyone but she is a saint not to act like a crying little girl for what she had to go through. Now sometimes I do have a problem with just how she acts though. I want to yell at her ‘JUST CRY ALREADY!’ It’s a pain just how sweet and innocent she is.The Animation is pretty good though once in a while it seems to break a bit, but one thing that they didn’t get rid of was the way the actual artist draws the chibi ghost characters when something funny happens. I love that about the art in the manga and keep the two together even if the story is a bit different.The Music is really cute, though the opening is really two slow and annoying. I always wanted to skip it because it was both that and depressing. The English dub is a tiny bit better but not by much. The music in the background is good though some of the slice of life stuff is a little worse for wear in that it plays a little too often for my taste.The voice acting in both the Sub and Dub are good but I lean much more into the English voices since they are better then the Japanese (my own opinion) though I still don’t like it all the way.

I will give the show credit for the comedy because it was funny at times. Plus the characters were either hilarious (to some extent) or adorable or just plain awesome (still not as awesome in comparison to other anime’s though)....Other characters such as Yuki and Tohru (the main characters) were very annoying.

Now,...I\'m going to be honest it wasn\'t perfect and alot of times the story dragged on and was a bit boring and usless.But then BAMM. towards the end the show all of the sudden becomes REALLY REALLY GOOD. Seriously, I wish the first half was as amazing as the last half.So, the reason I gave it a 9 is cause the end was just so interesing.Art 7/10The art was moderate. It was nothing that really caught my attention. But I liked how a few scenes and character were drawn.Sound.Hmmm, The voice actors were okay. (Momiji was my favorite) And basically this part was moderate to.Characters. 7/10Okay let me explain the seven. Don\'t misunderstand. I LOVE ALOT OF THE CHARACTERS. Momiji and Kyo escpessically. I basically love all the characters, except forTohru... Yes, the main character annoyed me often. and since she\'s the main character I saw alot of moments that annoyed me.It\'s not like she constantly annoyed me, infact the last two episodes she didn\'t annoy me at all.But she was just to freakin perfect. Always selfless and poliet. I get that these aren\'t a bad thing, but like come on she really never has a bad side. And all hummans have there moments. I feel like they tried to make her sooo perfect. Which they kind of did because through out the whole series she knows exactly what to say, and how to fix the problem. But there is a point when a character is too perfect. They could have toned down the flawlessness in her character and made her get mad atleast once. I don\'t think she was even mad at the bad guy once.Ugh, I kind of needed to get that off my chest in this review. Moving on hahaEnjoyment. 8/10Honestly I enjoyed it. ecpessically the comedy. But again things got funnier towards the ending to.Overall 8/10My adivce for watching this is to stick with it. Because honestly it\'s a really great show.

I\'m re watching it now with my little brother (I\'m trying to get him addicted to anime) and realize that in comparison to other anime, it\'s okay.First off, I hate the main chracters! Tohru and Yuki get on my nerves so much! Tohru is too nice! Same with Yuki! I hate Tohru more than I can express in words. Without Kyo and Shigure in it, the show would suck. And some of you are probably like, ""You just hate Tohru because you\'re jealous that she gets...Kyo"" Hell yeah I\'m jealous! Tohru and Kyo just don\'t go together! So it\'s an okay anime. Nothing too special, but it\'s not terrible. Kyo"" Hell yeah I\'m jealous! Tohru and Kyo just don\'t go together! So it\'s an okay anime. Nothing too special, but it\'s not terrible.', 'I\'ll preface by saying I\'ve seen all 4 seasons of Fruits Basket from 2001 to 2019. Fruits Basket is the greatest shoujo anime show ever made. I will warn you that the 2001 show is not perfect and is incomplete, so I\'d suggest focusing your viewing efforts on the 2019 version. While I enjoyed the 2001 piece, the ending is very poorly done, and the 2001 show is more light-hearted than dramatic. That being said, it\'s still very good, because character development is fantastic. Childish characters begin to grow into truly profound individuals, in part thanks to a girl named Tohru Honda, who while subject...to a running joke as a plain girl a ""dummy,"" is the most pure and emotionally intelligent character of them all. Finally, the 2001 anime has an absolutely iconic opening song. It\'s a shame the song wasn\'t used in the 2019 version. If you skip the 2001 version, at least hear the opening song. to a running joke as a plain girl a ""dummy,"" is the most pure and emotionally intelligent character of them all.

I didn't really enjoy it and skipped it every time. Also, there wasn't much background music (if I remember correctly), so it didn't really put on a 'dramatic' scene much.[CHARACTER] - 9/10-----------The characters were all very well made and animated.

ROMANCE, but anyways, I find the art to actually be good considering this is from 2005-2006.  But I think what I love the most is the Characters, I mean they're characters are so unique and you'd never thought they would behave that way, this just proves that Looks fool the mind (IN a GOOD way, Sometimes.. Ish IDK) but I kind of think this is a Rom-Com anime is because, It almost seems like a Soft Romance Anime, and whenever it doesn't get Romantic it turns funny.But even thought the Characters and Art are a...hoot, I just don't find the story it self intriguing, because so far it's really confusing In the End because, I never even thought that, that was the goal of the anime, so I don't understand the story, but I do want more Episode of this.To sum it up, I still recommend this anime, it is a MUST WATCH.Overall Score:10/10 hoot, I just don't find the story it self intriguing, because so far it's really confusing In the End because, I never even thought that, that was the goal of the anime, so I don't understand the story, but I do want more Episode of this.To sum it up, I still recommend this anime, it is a MUST WATCH.Overall Score:10/10"", ""*This review contains very little to no spoilers:*I have always considered myself to be a fan of zodiac signs, both regular ones, and Chinese ones.And finding Fruits basket; an anime based on zodiac signs, that was a blessing, I knew I just had to watch it. And guess what?I did!And I ~loved it~Let me tell you 12 reasons why I loved this anime... (just like 12 zodiac signs, get the reference?)1- The story: Yeah sure, this is a typical cheesy shoujo anime with that typical cheesy love triangle. But the aspect of adding zodiac signs was very creative and made the plot...much more intriguing and fun!2- The art: Am I the only one who liked the art style? I found it extremely cute and simple and I loved how each character had their own unique design. It was just amazing!3- The characters: From sweet naive Tooru to arrogant but caring Kyo and mysterious-friendly Yuki. All the characters were so lovable (Of course you can't forget Shigure, Kisa, Kagura, Hatsaharu, Momiji, Hatori or the rest of the Soumas) Akito, however, can go rot in hell; where he belongs.4- The music: I found both the opening and the ending songs so catchy and calming- it was different from the other more energetic anime openings and yet, I could not help but love it.5-  Shigure: Yes, he deserves his own point- he is my freaking favorite character. The way he handles stressful situations was hilarious and how he always tries to interfere in other people business was just so ~Shigure~ (not to mention his hilarious bromance with Ayame!)6- The comedy: How is it that an anime about a girl who lives alone in a tent funny? Maybe because that's not the main point of the anime and it's because she lives with three guys who turn into animals. Yeah it's probably the latter (thank you Nigahiga.)7- The character development: I love how each of the characters were not who you first thought they would be and that the smile or the frown on their face had a deeper meaning. you get to explore each of the characters past and understand their feelings. I loved that so much and it makes the anime so much better.8- Zodiac signs: I mentioned this before, and I will mention it again- I love Zodiac signs and the role they played in this anime. It's not every day I find an anime about them, so as you can tell, I am very pleased!9- Tooru's -Mothers- quotes: Ok can we talk about that riceball quote? How could a quote about a riceball make my self-esteem higher? Tooru had such a way with words and I loved those random inspirational things she would say In the middle of episodes!10- Tooru's friends: I loved how supportive and protective Tooru's friends were, they stuck with her through thick and thin! and It was hilarious trying to keep the ~secret~ from them.11- The length: As you can tell- I am running out of ideas. Ok, so the length of the Anime was just the right amount of episodes to get into the story and although I wish it was longer, so we could have met the other two zodiac members and solve other plotholes, I don't think this show could handle another 20 episodes (Maybe they should have made a second season?)12-  The Zodiac animals: The cute drawings of the zodiac animals were so heartwarming- Not to mention I loved trying to put together which zodiac animal could the character be. It was a blast!And for Kyo's sake, I will conclude this  long review with number13- The whole emotional ride: From the hilarious and joyful beginning to the sad heartwarming ending this anime kept me hooked the whole time. I loved it! And I suggest you watch it as soon as possible. much more intriguing and fun!2- The art: Am I the only one who liked the art style?

Up until this point, I was an innocent teenager, having only seen cartoons and some adult TVs show, with nothing in between other than Once Upon A Time.TBH, It was amazing when I first saw it- I was in love.But As I've rewatched this since, I have quite a bit to say.To start off, the story line was pretty good- it was a completely original idea, and I loved the zodiac signs and the 'god' as Akito and all that good stuff- but looking at it in retrospect,...they left a lot of strings hanging and it was quit unfinished. I'm currently on chapter 76 of the manga, and looking back now, the loose ends are even more apparent- so if you're a person that is obsessed with a nearly perfect story line, you may not want to watch this and go insane. Because there is a BUTTLOAD of plot holes EVERYWHERE.Now to the art- the art was decent, but I didn't really like the style, which is probably the only reason why I gave it a 4- the colors were kind of dull (I seem to only remember Kyo's hair as a bright color, for whatever reason) and the drawing style was just okay.The sound was amazing though- great sound affects, the voicing was great, and they got most of it down right.Character though- I loved everyone's character EXCEPT Tohru's. I don't know why, but to me, she just seems like a Mary Sue. Everyone loves her, everyone falls in love with her, she's got the dead parents, and she's so nice that strangers took her in, and she's innocent and pretty and all the jazz. I mean, who wouldn't want to be all that? But I feel like they didn't give her enough character. Everyone else was pretty good though- even though I kind of didn't like Yuki all that much- he was slightly annoying in my opinion.But regardless of all that, it provided for great entertainment when I watched it, so I have to give it a 6- it's not all that bad, despite my rants. In my opinion, it's worth watching, but only if loose ends and poor main characters don't bother you. :D~Lea they left a lot of strings hanging and it was quit unfinished.

Most of the series revolves around getting to know various members of the Souma family who are afflicted with the curse. While this is all good in fine,  it does not do much to set up a conflict within the story, with the only other major plot point being Tooru’s dealing with living with the Souma family. The series also suffers from an uneven pacing with there being heavy development early and late in the show, while the middle sort of drags, due...again to the “meet and greet” nature. Lastly, the anime ends leaving the viewer unsatisfied as no matters revolving around the curse have been closed and the ending is very much open ended. While these flaws are rather obvious when watching, they do not detract from the enjoyment of the series as the plot is rather unique, and quite fun.Characters: 9/10Fruits Basket best quality is its characters, without a doubt. Most characters receive a strong dose of development, and the Souma family characters are perhaps the most interesting. Their personalities are highly reflective of the Zodiac animal they stand for, and no two are alike. This creates an interesting duality to look at in these characters as most have their Zodiac personality but also how their curse has afflicted their pasts and presents. One flaw is the limited development of Tooru, who while she has plenty of backstory, does not grow nearly as significantly as many other characters in the story do. This weakness is not especially noticeable, however, but is a bit of a let down since she is the primary protagonist. The only other complaint is the lack of introduction to a couple of the Zodiac characters, notably the Horse and the Rooster.Animation: 9/10As the animation is a bit old, some viewers may find it off putting or strange. Otherwise, the animation is pretty decent and clear, and does not detract quality wise from the show.Soundtrack: 9/10The soundtrack does a good job of setting moods for each scene, and for the most part is enjoyable. However, the opening does a poor job early on of setting the mood, as the series is generally more lighthearted early on and becomes more serious as one moves along. As such, the opening seems a bit out of place.Themes: 10/10The themes in Fruits Basket revolve around family and acceptance most often, as much of what the plot deals with is Tooru accepting the Souma family’s secret. One major recurring element within the series is the seeming lightheartedness of the curse actually hides a lot of tragedy. The series deals a lot with how one’s past determines a character present day personality, and how people mask how they are feeling. Overall, the anime carries very powerful themes that everyone should consider. These themes are never lost either, as the series does a good job of not straining from its serious undertones even during the more comedy oriented moments. The tension of the series builds the whole way through, but is unresolved at the end, again due to the plot being cut short.Final Score: 44/50https://rishraffreviews.wordpress.com again to the “meet and greet” nature.

Some fail to give enough depth to all the love interests, some have a weak hero/herione, or fail to have a decent plot. Not Fruits Basket.The plot had a nice underlying message, which is that everyone is deserving of kindness. Even the ""evil"" characters had something heavy resting on their shoulders. The humor was done well, nicely mixing with the darker undertones. The plot deviates from the manga quite a bit towards the end, which is a kind of confusing, but all in all the story is still just as good as the manga.One of my favorite...parts in both was when Tohru talked to Ritsu. Though Ritsu was treated has comic relief for the most part, the speech where Tohru talked about how everyone plays a part was nice and sweet.The story focused on the characters, yes, but that is one of its charms. Each person was treated with respect, and none were tossed aside in favor of the main love triangle. Even Tohru\'s mother was given just enough backstory to make you respect her.I am particularly fond of the art. The show is full of bright colors, just like a basket of fruit.Overall, while the manga is better, the anime should not be missed. It will leave you feeling happy, and maybe change your outlook on life. Just a little.""It\'s not always easy to see the good in people. In some people, you might even doubt that it\'s there at all. But if you can somehow, find a way to believe...sometimes that\'s all it takes to help someone, to give them the strength to find the good in themselves."" ~ Fruits Basket parts in both was when Tohru talked to Ritsu.

I initially thought that anime had a really weird art style and was very closed-minded to it, so I never really gave it a chance. But after watching the first episode or so, I was hooked!For one thing, the characters are really likable. Their separate personalities all have their own cool aspects and their interactions made the show really funny.Also, the show has a relatively cheerful atmosphere and has a lot...of humor. It's a really fun anime to watch and is uplifting.The concepts and the story are also very creative and outstanding. I had never seen anything like it and the fact that it is so unique is part of the reason why I love it so much.Overall, watching this anime is definitely a good thing to do if you enjoy comedic and joyful animes.

Into the review! SPOILERS AHEAD!Story 8/10: The story was very well laid out, strong mix of backstory along with a good story line to carry it all the way to the end.. What ruined it for me? The ending of course! Ending off on the love triangle still together! I had the manga endings (even though I don't read manga) kind of ruined for me and I knew that Kyo and Tohru were going to end up together.. although I thought! Knowing they...end up together in the manga completely ruined the ending for me.. But I'll get into that with characters! The backstories to the series was very well done! I really enjoyed Kyo's backstory the most out of everyone especially with the true form coming out at the end which made it almost 100% worth the wait! I mostly skipped over the boring episodes like the ones with the fan club and any other small characters that didn't make any sense to the plot at all! I give the story to much praise and I definitely need to stop! The plot was not bad but it could of been better as a whole.. It had so much potential to progress into something amazing but it felt like being dragged out for 26 episodes and they had no idea what to do with them!Art 8/10: The art/animation was nice and for almost every part seemed amazing.. But there was something about the eyes of the animation I didn't quite like and I can't put my finger on it! Something just threw me off of it..Sound 8/10: The sound was aswell really pleasing to listen to.. The dubbed version from Funimation was horrible for me at some points! The actors seemed like they were bored and gave it half arsed attempts at doing it and it made it sound shocking at most parts! The music thought is why it's so high.. For such an old anime it still sounded fairly decent! I'd listen to the music more than the actual anime at some points and it was really enjoyable!Character 8/10: The characters seemed completely different and I loved it! You had your enthusiastic girl who basically gets abused the entire time.. You have your tough hard guy who is really a soft kid inside who just wants to be accepted and then you have your quiet/popular/nice guy who is nice to everyone pretty much.. Overall I really enjoyed each character apart from Yuri.. Something about Yuri just threw me off! Maybe it was because of Kyo? Or maybe it was because I thought he was putting on a goody two shoes act.. although I hated Yuri! I really loved the Kyo character.. I'm a sucker for a backstory and his past and the things he had to go through made me love him even more! The way he was brought up inheriting a curse and being rejected by everyone he's ever known including his friends and family! Then the ending for Kyo with the true form made it so much more enjoyable! I'm glad they ended it with his true form and didn't carry on! The ending kind of pissed me off abit as it ended with the love triangle and not ending with her going with Kyo or Yuri! Even though I knew in the manga she was going to go with Kyo I really hoped she would to in the anime but at last it didn't happen..Overall 8/10: Would I recommend the anime? Probs not.. For my taste and what anime I like to watch I would not watch this again! If you're new to anime and want to ride a slow and long bus into the genre's for romance(Even though there was none), comedy(barely any of that two) and drama! Then come on through! Even though I've criticized the entire thing piratically I still really enjoyed it and I think you might enjoy it to if you are looking for what I just mentioned! end up together in the manga completely ruined the ending for me.. But I'll get into that with characters! The backstories to the series was very well done! I really enjoyed Kyo's backstory the most out of everyone especially with the true form coming out at the end which made it almost 100% worth the wait! I mostly skipped over the boring episodes like the ones with the fan club and any other small characters that didn't make any sense to the plot at all! I give the story to much praise and I definitely need to stop! The plot was not bad but it could of been better as a whole.. It had so much potential to progress into something amazing but it felt like being dragged out for 26 episodes and they had no idea what to do with them!Art 8/10: The art/animation was nice and for almost every part seemed amazing.. But there was something about the eyes of the animation I didn't quite like and I can't put my finger on it! Something just threw me off of it..Sound 8/10: The sound was aswell really pleasing to listen to.. The dubbed version from Funimation was horrible for me at some points! The actors seemed like they were bored and gave it half arsed attempts at doing it and it made it sound shocking at most parts! The music thought is why it's so high.. For such an old anime it still sounded fairly decent! I'd listen to the music more than the actual anime at some points and it was really enjoyable!Character 8/10: The characters seemed completely different and I loved it! You had your enthusiastic girl who basically gets abused the entire time.. You have your tough hard guy who is really a soft kid inside who just wants to be accepted and then you have your quiet/popular/nice guy who is nice to everyone pretty much.. Overall I really enjoyed each character apart from Yuri.. Something about Yuri just threw me off! Maybe it was because of Kyo? Or maybe it was because I thought he was putting on a goody two shoes act.. although I hated Yuri! I really loved the Kyo character.. I'm a sucker for a backstory and his past and the things he had to go through made me love him even more! The way he was brought up inheriting a curse and being rejected by everyone he's ever known including his friends and family! Then the ending for Kyo with the true form made it so much more enjoyable! I'm glad they ended it with his true form and didn't carry on! The ending kind of pissed me off abit as it ended with the love triangle and not ending with her going with Kyo or Yuri! Even though I knew in the manga she was going to go with Kyo I really hoped she would to in the anime but at last it didn't happen..Overall 8/10: Would I recommend the anime? Probs not.. For my taste and what anime I like to watch I would not watch this again! If you're new to anime and want to ride a slow and long bus into the genre's for romance(Even though there was none), comedy(barely any of that two) and drama! Then come on through! Even though I've criticized the entire thing piratically I still really enjoyed it and I think you might enjoy it to if you are looking for what I just mentioned!"", 'fruits basket was very enjoyable to watch and read.i am disappointed that it ended on the 1st season.overall i cannot say anything bad about it other than that they could not do the anime for all the books until the series ended.if you like romance anime then this would be a good anime to watch. ', ""What made this anime stand out above comedy/love anime is the circumstances I found using the Chinese zodiac was a clever plot to the series. When I first started watching this series I was expecting a comedy and love story with the constant introduction of characters and there multiple personalities put this series above your common love/comedy anime's.

Although the Sohmas' curse is deeper and darker than Tohru realized, her presence and her acceptance of them soon becomes a large, positive influence on those possessed by the zodiac.Filled...with many lovable character and many plot twists along the way, life at the Sohma house will never be the same again.My Thoughts:This anime is very heart-warming, filled with emotion and teenage angst and problems.  Tohru is a breath of fresh air to everyone.  She has a way of saying things that makes those around her feel better. She always shows kindness and tries to defuse tense situations. It's a very well dubbed anime with beautiful graphics, great characters that have their own little story surrounding their Zodiac and the storyline fills all the slots; love, humor, sadness, jealousy...I loved watching Fruits Basket and would recommend it for all ages. with many lovable character and many plot twists along the way, life at the Sohma house will never be the same again.My Thoughts:This anime is very heart-warming, filled with emotion and teenage angst and problems.

I watched the dubbed version of this show along time ago.....I think I made it all the way through, but I know for a fact that I've seen the subbed version of this series 2 times.Story - 9It's a heartwarming tale about rejection and acceptance. Tohru is so innocent, gullible, optimistic, and all sunshine and rainbows that it kinda becomes obnoxious, LOL! She's very deer-like; a sweet and beautiful presence. She sees the good in people and loves others easily and without fail. She does have a hard time with this part of her personality towards the end,...however. I was in tears while I watched the last 2 episodes or so, and I'm not a big crier. Yes, this show may be a bit cliche at times, and completely unrealistic, but there is a beautiful lesson to be learned behind this series. Everyone needs love. Nobody can survive completely alone.Art - 9Not the best drawings, but it was good. Really, the art is more so around an 8, but I'm admittedly being a little biased and am keeping it at a 9 :)Sound - 10I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the opener in both English and Japanese. Both versions of this smooth, heartwarming song really fit the show. The song has a subtle taste of nostalgia to it. Usually I skip straight past openers, and will listen to the best of them once or twice and that's it, but for this series, there were many times where I would actually sing along to the opener :) I actually like the voices in both versions I've watched. Even Tohru's weird voice, I felt fitted her quite well.Character - 10These are some of the most memorable characters out there. I LOVED the characters in this show.

I loved this show so much that I've rewatched this show 2 or 3 times, and I really don't like watching or reading things more than once, unless it was really, really, really good. Also, It wasn't super long, so it's easy to rewatch and get into as many times as needed. I think anyone will enjoy this show. Maybe not everyone would rate it a 10, however, almost everyone will finish this show with a satisfied smile on their face :)Overall - 10Once again, I must say.......I loved this show. This is one of my all time favs! :D Fruits Basket.....I'm so happy that I gave this show a chance, and I'm sure whoever you are that's feeling a bit skeptical would more than likely find this show quite a pleasant surprise ;D So just go on and give it a shot.Watch this show! :) however.

Boy, was I wrong.  The main character is actually a breadth of fresh air among all of the 'let me flutter my eyes' types you might see in anime from around the same year or two.  Also the premise itself is immediately engaging - half of the main characters turn into animals!  A lot of fun for the series comes in trying to figure out if someone will change and what they will change into....The anime doesn't have the greatest ending but it's a lot of fun getting there.

There are plenty of subplots and good mystery to be revealed gradually throughout the anime. I loved that it was multi-faceted and could be described as dramatic, romantic, or comedic. The romance wasn\'t annoyingly teasing like it usually is in most anime. It\'s not quite straightforward, either, but I believe that this anime was made to expose the benefits of friendship and whatnot. There is a romance factor, clearly, but it did not overwhelm the true plot. The ending was nicely climactic but it did leave a cliffhanger, which was sort of upsetting because where I live it is...very difficult to find the manga of certain anime to finish the actual story. If you do happen to know where the Fruits Basket manga is sold or even have copies of it ready, be prepared because although there is an alright ending to the show there are still loose ends that are tied up in the continuation of the manga. I haven\'t read the manga myself, however, so I suggest reading it from the beginning anyway since they sometimes vary from the anime\'s storyline.Art:I\'m not generally picky about the artwork of anime. But I know good art when I see it. The art for Fruits Basket was absolutely terrific. I don\'t know, maybe I am exaggerating a bit. But I loved the realistic features of it and the zodiac animals were adorable. The expressions were well done and the bodies looked proportional. The chibi faces made for great humor as well.Sound:If I\'m honest, the songs weren\'t too bad. But they were extremely repetitive and got kind of skeevy after a while. The solemn tunes creeped me out after about the tenth episode. They can be tolerated, but don\'t be surprised if you start humming them to yourself out of nowhere.Character:I loved the characters! They were all fantastically developed at an even pace. I feel that character development and growth is one of the hardest aspects in anime making, simply because it usually sucks. All the main characters started out as seemingly vague students with ordinary lives. Personalities stuck out nicely and I thought it was exceptional how even the side characters had 3-dimensional personalities. Of course, I do think that the producer of the anime kind of overdid Tohru\'s bottomless pit of kindness and selflessness. It was just surreal how much of a masochist/sadist she appeared to be. Also, in the English dubbed version, her voice irritated me often.Enjoyment:I definitely enjoyed watching this. I even rewatched it several times. I only wished they had finished out the actual story from the manga with more seasons instead of just cutting off at episode 26. I was disappointed by that, mainly because I\'m too lazy to pick up a book, but other than that it was a satisfying ride.Overall:Art and character were my favorites regarding Fruits Basket. I would have liked to hear less taunting music and have a more ""complete"" feel to the ending.

As one of the first animes I\'ve ever watched, Fruits Basket will always hold a special place within my heart. The overall story, art, character development and drama of this anime makes it a true Anime Classic on my shelves - and I feel no shame in saying that!So Fruits Basket revolves around Tohru Honda has been living in a tent since her mother dies in a car accident, but ends up living instead with Yuki Sohma, her school\'s ""prince"", along with his relatives Shigure and Kyo. But Tohru soon discovers that...the Sohma clan has a secret of it\'s own: certain members of the family are possessed by the animals of the Zodiac, so whenever they are hugged by a member of the opposite sex they turn into that animal. Tohru promises to keep their secret and vows to somehow break the curse, and she may just end up healing the Sohma clan members in other ways as well...At first glance the plot may seem ridiculous, but when you start watching it you realize it goes a lot deeper than that. Does Fruits Basket have its hilarious comedy scenes? Yes. But it also has its intense, dramatic moments that will leave you in tears. It is a Dramody, through in through - however it\'s more drama and comedy, focusing on the characters\' past and how the curse has effected their future and their life.Did I cry in Fruits Basket? Yes. In my opinion the manga is much more emotional than the anime, but the anime still stays true to the manga, so it\'s still something to great watch. I do recommend reading the manga first however. It will always be superior to the anime, even though the anime itself is truly amazing.Now I loved the Character Development in Fruits Basket. These cursed people have broken pasts, and I love how it emphasizes that without stripping away the personality. You feel a real connection to the characters, and when you feel a connection you end up feeling what they feel; that is good writing and directing, right there. The characters are damaged, and the anime isn\'t afraid to show that. Don\'t worry, I won\'t spoil anything for you. I\'ll just say that after what these people have been through, you\'ll look at your own troubles and, even for just a split second, be grateful for what you have.The art is pretty good too. I love the style, and the way the people are drawn. To me its like any typical anime-style - yet it\'s also very unique too.Is Fruits Basket a heavy, intense drama with some comedy thrown in? Yes. Is it a romance anime with a love-triangle? Yes, but the romance is only a side-story. It mainly focus on the characters and their growth.Overall, go watch it if you love intense dramas with developed characters. You won\'t be disappointed.~Sparrow the Sohma clan has a secret of it\'s own: certain members of the family are possessed by the animals of the Zodiac, so whenever they are hugged by a member of the opposite sex they turn into that animal.

My mom loved it too even. It's one of those Animes with a little bit of everything for everyone. Tohru was awesome! At first I thought I wouldn't like her. I usually don't like female lead characters anyway. But Tohru was a surprise. Everyone was. I liked the fact that it wasn't a in-your-face romance. In fact, I considered the story to be more a friendship type. A very good one at that! I think everyone should watch Fruits Basket. "", ""tl;dr: I get why Fruits Basket was popular back in the day, and it has important (almost profound) lessons to teach about family and friendship, but it didn't live up to my expectations. Both the humor and the sad parts of this show often feel forced. I felt that, seeing it in 2013, I was too late to the game to ever become a real fan of this show, and others only now deciding to watch it may think the same thing.---Fruits Basket is a very sweet anime with a dark tinge that makes it more compelling than if it were just a comedy...with characters that turned into animals at inconvenient times. It's easy to see why girls my age liked it when it first came out.While acceptance and kindness are the major themes of this show, what kept me watching was the way Furuba handled mother-child relationships. A lot of the mothers in the show, due to the Sohma curse, regard their children with a mixture of love, guilt, and repulsion, which serves as an interesting contrast to how Tohru sees her own mother - as her role model and the light of her life. The show really gave a heartfelt shout-out to the sacrifices people make for their children everyday, while at the same time showing how they are also capable of damaging them for life. Time and time again, the show implicitly brings up the question of what is more important - family or friends - only to teach you that all relationships are precious. Friendships and familial relations all take, and all are worth, extra effort.I also liked that this show wasn't fixated on romance, even though it very easily could have turned out that way. I've seen other reviewers call this show a reverse harem, but that doesn't seem very fair to Tohru. Sure, she calls Yuki attractive and princely, but as far as I can tell from watching the show, she genuinely cares about the other characters (especially Kyo) not as romantic interests, but as real people.That being said, watching this show often felt like a chore. Around episode 5, I realized that, even though the show is supposed to be a comedy, I had only genuinely laughed at maybe one joke. If it weren't for the show's popularity, I would have dropped it then. Even though the voice actors did a really good job of not getting carried away despite the campy nature of the show, the humor sometimes feels forced, and it's often awkward. This may just be because Furuba is an older anime, but the sad parts felt unnatural as well. There were a lot of events that, if delivered right, could have pulled at my heartstrings. Unfortunately, they came off as melodramatic because of the characters', again, forced reactions. All of this, plus the slow pace of the show, sort of killed Furuba for me.Overall, this anime didn't live up to my expectations. I grew up knowing people who adored it, and was disappointed when I finally finished the series. However, I am glad that I watched it. While it wasn't as funny or as enjoyable as I was expecting, Furuba's commentary on relationships and the way we treat the people we care about was worth experiencing. If you decide to pick up the show for the same reason as me, to see what all the fuss is about, I suggest that you don't binge-watch it or try to complete it in a given amount of time, but rather watch an episode here and there whenever you're in the mood for fluff. with characters that turned into animals at inconvenient times.

Everything about it was perfect and adorable and emotionally stirring and I love it love it. But...Well I can obviously not say the same for the anime adaptation.. I could not actually bring myself to finish it..or get even close to.. because its was..how can I put it..like an anime directed by M. Night Shyamalan..so it was very terrible. Not only that but for the very first time in my entire life I have preferred an anime on silent. I have never before heard such bad...Japanese dub EVER... Gosh I don't actually even know where to start with this.. Basically.. The voices were just bad in English and in Japanese and none of the voices suited the characters. The anime version of the originally quite visually appealing art style was poorly done and the drawing weren't good and to be honest they made most of the characters look very very unattractive. It just seemed overall lazily done. Most of the time the characters weren't moving and just had a very boring simple background of greys and blues or even just white. There was nothing eye catching at all and it just lacked the liveliness of the manga. The color pallet that was they chose was just sooo boring and again, lifeless. The way they did this anime basically made it completely not interesting and disappointing an an insult to the original story. Everything was just plain and it looked like the creators were putting as little effort in as they possibly could. Its just seemed like they quickly scribbled it out so they just didn't have to do it anymore!I know people who like this anime quite a bit...and I don't get it.. all in all..

My otaku friend recommended it to me so I decided to try it. I love the plot of Fruits Basket, the way that the Sohmas turn into Chinese zodiac animals when hugged by the opposite gender. I thought that the idea was sort of... dumb at first, but then I started to watch more and loved it. It's a funny anime and has made me laugh multiple times throughout it. My favorite character was Kyo Sohma. He's the cat, even though the cat is not exactly in the Chinese...Zodiac. Because of that, he is often left out of things and somewhat hated in the family. He has a lot of character development throughout the series, and you can see a lot of changes in the end, which, I also love. I was quite disappointed with the end of the anime though. I thought it ended quite sudden, and it could have definitely had more episodes to it. I heard that the manga added on to the anime, so I read that in hopes that it would be better. I wasn't disappointed in that. The manga added on to the anime a lot more, and I would recommend reading it instead of watching the anime. The manga ended beautifully and I highly recommend it.

Anyhow, this series is awesome with lots of details and a funny cast.-kemmec"", ""Fruits Basket has always been one of my favorite anime and I'd have to say that it's a lot better than the manga (which is good too.) While I haven't read the manga (only some of it...) so far, when you watch this anime, it looks JUST like the manga but the characters are a little different from each other as usual, but keeping it in connection with the manga was pretty good.Story: 10/10Even though some people dislike Fruits Basket, it is still clear that some kids with a sense of humor would enjoy the story. First it starts off funny, then it gets funnier...and then sad at the ending (you'll know), many anime have to have sad moments every once in a while. You might not like Tohru at first, but getting around the teens episodes, you might start liking her. And there's Kyo, funnier than ever. Yuki is somewhat bold sometimes in the manga, but he's really nice to Tohru in this anime. The ending just fits Fruits Basket perfectlly and I wish it just had made more episodes.Art: 9/10At some point the art looks a little bit like the manga, but it's style looks more like anime like Azumanga Daioh or something. You know, the very cutesy and plain style? Although, it's not boring to watch. it's just pretty good that it had to be copied from Azumanga Daioh and look funnier.Character: 10/10Fruits Basket is mainly an anime for comedy-drama so all the characters would probably get funny every once in a while. Tohru, even though she might be cocky is a little funny. She helps people out when she thinks they might cause trouble or anything. Kyo is hot-headed, but for Tohru's love for him, he gets nicer. Yuki is hot (to girls) and mainly the nicest person in the series and he's very kind to people, but the Yuki fan club girls might annoy you in the beginning all of because Yuki's personality. Shigaru is funny and a little mischevious and perverted, but he kind of acts like he shouldn't be there when you notice him, but he's not exactly one of my favorite characters.Enjoyment: 10/10Nervous that some people didn't like the anime, I decided to just eagerly pick it up from the library and try it out to see if I liked it. And I never thought I would enjoy a single anime that big, it was WONDERFUL! It's story, art and characters just really enthuse me. The anime's worth-watching, trust me. Gets happy and then sad and then happy again.Overall: 8/10I wouldn't think that Fruits Basket is the best anime ever made, but it's one of them.

In the end, I even ended up reading the manga as well, just to see how it ended.Story:I found Fruits Basket\'s story rather unique. Tohru, the female lead, is discovered living in a tent on Sohma property after her mother\'s death in a car crash. As it turns out, one of her classmates, Yuki Sohma, lives there as well, and invites her to stay. However, soon enough, Tohru discovers the Sohma family\'s curse of the chinese zodiac....The twelve Sohmas who are possessed by the spirit of the animal turns into his or hers other form whenever he/she is hugged by opposite sex or under a great deal of stress. As the story progresses, Tohru begins to learn about what the curse has really done to the Sohmas, and she promises the head of the family, Akito, that she will keep their secret. But little does she know that he has something else planned for her.Fruits Basket is an amazing story with a love triangle between Kyo, Tohru, and Yuki, but it doesn\'t develop that much in the anime. If you want to see that, then I recommend reading the manga.Art:I truly loved the art\'s style. The artist used the right illustrations for rather more serious characters and more easy-going ones.They also use the appropriate style for whenever there\'s a funny moment or a serious one. Fruits Basket\'s art style in my opinion, like the rest of the anime, is rather unique as well, and it\'s comfortable to look at.Sound:The directors of this anime perfectly incorborated the right sound effects and music for every single second from the song right down to the boiling water.Character:I felt the characters were absolutely perfect in Fruits Basket:Tohru: your average, clumsy, but sweet heroine who manages to bring a smile to everyone\'s faces.

On a typical day, Tohru is out for a walk and notices a small house. She decides...to investigate and learns that it is the home of the Sohmas, a family where each member actually represents an animal of the zodiac. Yuki, Kyo, and Shigure, the residents of the house, talk with Torhu for a time and think that a young girl should not be living outside in the wilderness and instead invite her to stay with them. While initially skeptical, she agrees to their offer.The rest of the anime moves along and becomes more or less a slice of life. I usually don’t care for that genre, but here, I was entertaining for various reasons. For one, whenever a member of the zodiac makes full-body contact with someone of the opposite sex, they temporarily transform into their respective animal. This makes for some amusing scenes when someone accidentally transforms in public, for example.While a lot of the anime stays on the lighthearted side of things, there are more than a handful of instances when the show turns much darker, mainly pertaining to the backstories of the characters, particularly that of Momiji. The last three episodes, though, are when the show completely drops its silliness, and becomes rather sad. These episodes were the best part of the show.Speaking of which, the characters themselves are easily the highlight of the show. Each of them have diverse personalities and interact with one another in interesting ways. My only real complaint is that there are way too many characters. To be fair, this anime is actually an adaptation of a manga (Which I have yet to read), so I’m sure that it worked a lot better there, but this is a review for the anime, and it was bothersome. But surprisingly, even the characters that get a measly one or two episodes of screen time will leave some kind of an impression on you.The overall story is hard to talk about without spoiling anything because it’s very simple. Not that there’s anything wrong with that inherently, mind you, but it’s something to keep in mind. If you’re looking for a thought-provoking story filled with twists and turns every which way, you’re going to be disappointed. However, the story is still charming, the characters are loveable, and that’s what matters.-Visuals & Sound-This is an old anime, coming out more than 10 years ago, so it’s hard to knock on its visuals too much. It hasn’t aged all that well, but it has a nice art style. I haven’t watched that many old animes, so I can’t really say much here.The show’s voice acting, however, is really great. Laura Bailey nails Tohru perfectly, and I wouldn’t have wanted anyone else to do her voice. I’ve never even heard of most of the other actors here, and they all performed extremely well. I highly recommend watching this anime dubbed.As for the music, nothing really stood out. It did its job, and never felt intrusive or out-of-place, but there was never that one good song. The show also features only one opening, and I found this opening to be extremely dull and boring. The song itself is serviceable at best, and the actual animation (Or lack thereof) is very underwhelming. Nothing exciting or interesting happens in the opening, and I found myself skipping the opening whenever I booted up an episode.-Conclusion-Overall, Fruits Basket is a very nice show. It’s not one that will blow you away, but it’s a very nice, warm, feel-good show that you can’t help but love. While the show is actually catered more towards females, there’s no reason why males can’t enjoy this. The show is mostly lighthearted and fun, but it’s also god a handful of dark moments to spice things up, and the last three episodes will definitely leave you teary eyed.Highly recommended.+Nice, fun, charming story+Some very dark moments+Loveable characters+The last three episodes are very powerful and emotional+Great dub-Hasn’t aged well visually-Nothing sticks out musically-Too many charactersFinal score:8/10 to investigate and learns that it is the home of the Sohmas, a family where each member actually represents an animal of the zodiac.

Through the entire series, one can not help but to try to relate to each and every character, while keeping in mind that they each have a distinct past because of the family curse that shaped them into who they have become.It's easy to become annoyed with the main character, Torhu Honda, as she helps each character through their inner struggle.  But...as the show goes on, you almost become one of the characters; finding it impossible to dislike such a girl. Watch it and you'll see what I'm talking about... as the show goes on, you almost become one of the characters; finding it impossible to dislike such a girl. Watch it and you'll see what I'm talking about..."", 'Fruits Basket is one of my favorite animes. I know alot of animes are meaningful but for some reason I loved this anime more than others. Maybe its because I know how all of the characters feel I can relate to them because I see myself in them all. This anime also has alot of life lessons and quotes that I keep to heart because they are true. I love everything about it the storyline, the characters,  the way it was drawn. Everything was perfect to me. I dont know if these are good reasons but they are to me. I feel like every...story deserves a happy ending and this anime had one. I also loved how it ended. It was as if the creators left it open for you to decide the overall ending by yourself as the viewer. It had a perfect balance of everything!

I was wary because the name didn't sound too appealing but as you watch it will make a bit more sense.I think the story is well written. It has humor, happiness, sadness, loneliness, and togetherness all in one.I think the style is definitely great for it's time. The characters are way too cute. I love the designs.The sound is good. Nothing too spectacular. It fits for the story itself.I think the characters were well rounded....You got a taste of everything.It is hard to top an anime like this for me. I enjoyed every second I have watched this anime. I highly recommend. You got a taste of everything.It is hard to top an anime like this for me. I enjoyed every second I have watched this anime. I highly recommend."", ""I saw the first episode for the first time a few days ago: All I knew prior was that there was a house full of magical(?) men and this one girl protagonist. I never really picked this anime up though it seemed very popular -I just never thought it would be anything special.Off the bat, I loved the opening song. It pulled some heartstrings for some reason, even without me knowing the story at all. I cried so hard when I heard Tohru talk about her mom's death. I especially started crying when I saw her mother tell her the bedtime story and Tohru...cried over a silly thing like feeling sad for the cat. It reminded me of my mom and aunt telling me stories or singing me to sleep and me silently crying because I felt so loved. This show truly gets me realizing how grateful and blessed I am. I think this episode totally caught me off guard; I was expecting something cutesy and silly. Instead, I got something so emotional and heart-warming! Tohru is such a beautiful soul. I look up to her so much! She's my favorite! The beauty of life and the strength + hope we can get even from suffering is so inspiring to me from this anime.In the beginning, I loved Yuki's strangeness and kindness. It was funny at first how weird he seemed. I really liked how much he cares for Tohru, and I could tell he was moved by her ways. It was so good to see! I was excited for the progression, and him falling for Tohru's beautiful heart. That scene when it was raining and they were in his garden, it took it to another level! Omg! When he turns into a mouse, and looks at her as she talks so sweetly, his eyes are so so so cute!!! I wanted to cry. Anyways, I met Kyo in the next few episodes but didn't really care much for him at first. He seemed very immature and fiery yet 2 dimensional. However: I really like him now. I think he is very cool! And I admire his strong considerations for Tohru! It is so much fun to see him slowly opening up and always becoming kinder(?) when it involves Tohru. There's something refreshing and true about him. I am unsure of whether it should be Kyo or Tohru as of now, since Yuki is so gentle and pleasant with Tohru, but Kyo is also whipped for Tohru in his own chaotic way. Yuki does seem a bit too self-pitying for my taste, however, and I like how Kyo is manlier and sort of the opposite of Tohru. I did not like how he was mean to her in the beginning. However, I feel I do not know enough about Kyo to say much about him as of yet. I look forward to seeing the relationships continue to develop. Kyo is somehow more of simple guy in a way (where I am at now at least) that's transparent and easy to read, and it's refreshing. At this point in time, I think both Yuki and Kyo are great with Tohru. I just love everyone!I love that I'm not looking much into it as romance (for once) which is so interesting to me. I am someone who is all about shipping. However, this anime feels very well made in that it is very emotionally intelligent. I'm so invested in the emotions and heartwarming aspect that I don't care for romance as much (FOR ONCE), I genuinely just love the relationships for the kindness and warmth produced from the characters. It feels so genuine. It is so universal too, the way Tohru sees the beauty in everybody, no matter WHO. Her empathy is so beautiful and honestly I'm taking notes with each episode. Tohru is always so thankful and telling herself how blessed she is, even for the little things. I relate to Tohru as I matured, I sympathize for her and want her to be happy. She deserves everything good!! It makes me so happy that the Sohma boys are there for her. I be crying so much... I never thought an anime called Fruits Basket would change my perspective on life, instantly grounding me and always helping me realize the beauty of everything in my life. The joy of existence itself. Wow. The way Tohru navigates through life is truly an inspiration. So much to learn from!!I'll probably rewatch this anime after I'm finished, honestly. And I'll probably write an essay about all of the things I've learned from Fruits Basket. I am going to read the manga after I finish this original season! I don't know if I'll watch the second adaptation yet, but I truly love this anime so far. It is actually pretty funny too at times. I'm not a fan of the loud fighting scenes because they get pretty repetitive and boring. Shigure was my favorite character off the bat. He's hot to me idc sorry and also he is SO FUNNY XD probably the funniest to me in the whole series. I also love Hatori so much, his story made me ball my eyes out!!!!! Sir.............The soundtrack makes everything 100x better btw! I am a very sound-sensitive person and even if something is sh!tty, if there is the right soundtrack to it, I'll see it in a beautiful way and feel it in a whole new mood! However, the content itself here is absolutely beautiful. Paired with a simple, yet genuine soundtrack makes it all the more beautiful. This OST is beautiful, dreamlike, sad yet hopeful, and just so pure and ethereal, yet down to earth. Can't explain it! I'm in love with the opening, the ending, and the various instrumentals. One of them reminds me of the night sky with shooting stars and it's slightly windy but you're wrapped in a blanket. I need to find that one.I am currently on episode 14. I will come back to edit this review once I complete it!UPDATE: Tonight I finished episode 26. It was an abrupt ending, very unexpected events took place. However, I think for the most part, it worked. It wasn't perfect, but this anime had all of the correct elements. I am so emotionally entranced by this anime, I've been listening to the soundtrack as I do my chores and stuff. It's making me cry randomly and see the world in such a beautiful light -just by listening to the soundtrack and reminiscing on some of the events in this anime.I had no idea Kyo was this tormented. And it was heartbreaking. I cried a lot in the last episode.I don't know why I was fully expecting Tohru to end up with one of them romantically, but I think I like that this anime didn't do that. The ending was just good enough, it had all of the elements that made it nice to end. It made me personally look forward to reading the manga to see what happens next, but this 1 season in itself was still a good close nonetheless for what it was. It was very clear with the life messages it wanted to present, and I really enjoyed the fact that this director focused on the messages and the emotions first and foremost. The choices for framing and pacing were quite smart.Contrary to seemingly popular beliefs, I really enjoy this 2001 version, way, way more than the reboot. I started it tonight and could NOT finish the first episode of the 2019 version. There was something very important missing, that I could not quite put my finger on. It was pretty, but I preferred the art in this original season 1000000x more. This version feels all the more real, down to earth somehow. I feel like the pacing was good too (at least before the abrupt ending). It kept me interested. It was sensible and exciting. Sure, it may have left out some details in the manga (I'm probably less affected by this fact because I haven't read it yet) but it worked really well by being cut to the point. I think the director did a great job with timing, framing, and the characters. It wasn't all spelled out for us, more room left for us to think.The soundtrack. The soundtrack. It is absolutely magical. The soundtrack truly made the anime for me. It made me fall in love with the story a lot more too. This is one reason why I prefer this version over the reboot as well.Overall, this was a phenomenal anime. I really was touched by it. It changed my perspective on life, and listening to the soundtrack is always instant serotonin. It makes me grateful for a lot of things and helps me see more beauty in everything. The story was so emotional and beautiful. It touched on many important themes about relationships, the importance of love and empathy, hope and strength, the joy of life, appreciation and gratitude, and much much more, all through this art of amazing storytelling. Now..... I read some people on here say that the themes are outdated and misogynistic, but I do not see it that way at all. But if I tried, I could see what those people are perceiving. But the thing is, these situations/relationships are not ideal in the first place, it is vastly far from it. However, I just choose not to see it, because it doesn't really hold much value to me to perceive it that way. There are still so many beautiful things to learn from it. I don't think gender roles was the point. This anime was so rich with lessons about warmth, human connection and empathy, and how having an all around beautiful soul brings good things. I feel like i'm rambling now but i just feel like i have so much to say about this anime.It was awesome 10/10 but make it 9 because the ending was a bit abrupt and sort of unfitting to the prior episodes (though it was still pivotal and lead to the necessary conclusion),,,, it left a lot sort of hanging. I was however impressed by how it somehow did touch on everything it needed to, like a bit of Akito's emotions in the last episode. Even though it was just a glimpse, it was somehow a glimmer of hope. Still, it was slightly unfulfilling for a huge fan like me who absolutely loved it. Well, the ending definitely made me hungry for more. So I am going to read the manga now for where it picks up. Not watching the reboot because it is everything I do not like in an anime, I'm just gonna read the manga for the story, while listening to the original 2001 soundtrack. cried over a silly thing like feeling sad for the cat.

If i remember correctly, this was quite different than manga and mangaka didn't like it, that is one of the reasons why they made remake. Story telling wasn't the best but it was good, opening and ost were good. I especially liked the opening of this adaption, i watched remake's first season and listened all of its openings but it is not the same as this adaption's opening, it does not give the exact peaceful and calm feeling. Overall i probably wouldn't watch it if remakes...were to exist when i watched it but since i already watched it first i'm pretty biased and i think it is good lol were to exist when i watched it but since i already watched it first i'm pretty biased and i think it is good lol"", ""I keep coming back to this series, because every time it makes me feel everything all over again. the situation is a little silly, but the meaningful connections between all the characters and the ways that they interact with each other is overwhelmingly deep. this is a real, interesting and relateable story of a family trying to heal old wounds and the individuals inside it trying to grow and develop enough to really change and really fix their own personal issues.although the art isn't really good, the characters and the story bring it to another level. Tooru is sad and sweet, and optimistic, and makes...you want to root for her. Kyou is hurt and quiet and mourning, and lashes out because of it. Yuki is scared and struggling, and even though his concerns as the prettyboy of the school aren't necessarily relateable, almost anyone could look at their personality and find times they're acting, and times they wish they didn't have to.even the small side characters have sweet inner lives and struggles, and even the questionable relationship between Tooru's mom and dad is only ever written as two people deeply in love with each other, who want to be together.I love this series, it's one of my absolute favorites. you want to root for her.

SHOW! IS! FANTASTIC!To make this review have some structure I will focus on the technical stuff first, and then the writing and story.Art 8/10 and Sound 7/10I thought that the art style was amazing. It seemed a bit older and a little janky at times, but it conveyed the story perfectly for what it needed. The sound was the same. It was a little old, but still got the point across. Maybe a remaster of this show could make it a whole lot better and I would not mind rewatching it since it is my new favorite show of all time. So PLEASE DO...A REMASTER OR SOMETHING!!!!!Enjoyment 10/10I highly recommend this show. At some of the important moments I truly felt immersed in this universe. This was mainly due to how relatable these characters were.Story 10/10I absolutely love this story. The romance elements could be felt through every frame of the show. The characters had amazing synergy and the whole script was written beautifully. From the drama club arc to at school shenanigans, you feel every emotion that the creators intended.Characters 9/10These Characters were AMAZING! Here is a quick bit about each.Shirubia - This character is the reason that I gave this anime a 9 instead of a 10. She pretty much ruined the show for me. Her lack of understanding when it comes to relationship made me cringe quite hard, especially when she influenced her boyfriend negatively. Although I hate this character a lot, I understand her inclusion since she caused a majority of the drama that took place. She  was slightly okay at the beginning because she is introduced as a new girl that is really nice. But she slowly just got annoying and probably ruined the school year for most of the characters.Joshu - Shirubia's boyfriend for most of the show. This guy is pretty likable, especially compared to his girlfriend. I really enjoyed seeing the troubles that this couple faced after starting a seemingly mundane relationship. I also loved seeing how Joshu was faced with choosing his friends or his girlfriend, which both ruined and strengthened relationships at times. But my all time favorite part was when justice was finally served and Joshu finally let himself free from her toxicity during the summer episodes. Good and essential character.Jeikobu - HANDS DOWN BEST CHARACTER!! From his charming attitude and HOT body, Jeikobu is perfect. He was always there to lower tensions and just make everyone happy. His HOT body did wonders on the eyes too. Jeikobu is the only reason this show is good.Maiku - This guy was a hobo. He came in clutch for some funny jokes during some of the dramatic scenes. I loved his Thunder Spleen reference in episode 14. Good character.Gyabin - This guy was pretty chill. He likes Weezer though so automatic 4/10 from me. I did however like his nonstop tension with Shirubia throughout the series. She really hated Gyabin for seemingly no reason. I'm fairly positive Season Two addresses this drama a bit more, but I'll post a review to that when I watch it.Overall 9/10This anime is almost a masterpiece but there were some scenes that I really didn't like. But overall, really good. I would definitely recommend this to my friends. To be honest they probably already saw this anime but whatever YAYAYAYAYAYYA A REMASTER OR SOMETHING!!!!!Enjoyment 10/10I highly recommend this show.

So seeing it come alive in this way was an absolutely amazing experience for me.Its a romance but its a nice slow burn so it dosnt feel rushed. I also like how the main character isnt just immediately loved by all the zodiacs.Plus you get to see some darker themes included as well, such as abuse or generational trauma. I like how its so accurate to the manga and it captures the feeling the original work did.if you ask me to recommend you a nice sweet romance that also has a...story and substance beyond that, i will always recommend this anime! story and substance beyond that, i will always recommend this anime!', ""Loved the manga, sad that it wasn't adapted as well as it could have been. The new adaptation was so much better, and absolutely stunning. For this ones time, the animation isn't too bad, but definitely doesn't hold out now. The biggest thing that made me not like this version was that they stopped the story when Kyo's secret came out, the fact that there wasn't a female voice actor for Akito. Those 2 things ruined this anime for me. Otherwise, it is a very interesting show from when it came out, but when I read it after it finished airing they just did not...adapt it well. adapt it well."", 'Ooo, I want to join in and heap some praise on Fruits Basket! Yay!Ok, so we all know that the people who write reviews are generally the ones who most passionately love a show and those who most passionately hate it. So in the interests of not just gushing about this show but actually making a case for why it\'s a truly great show, I\'ll address some of the points I\'ve seen in the negative reviews here and then add my own pluses.1. Tohru is a Mary Sue- Ok, I definitely understand why people think this, but I definitely DO NOT agree. If you see...the first episode and Tohru doesn\'t immediately captivate you, you\'re likely to think ""Oh great, another one of those perfect, never have a moment of doubt, God\'s gift to the universe shoujo girls."" If you start with this opinion, you might stop watching carefully and not catch on to Tohru\'s real character arc. However if you are actually paying attention, you\'ll quickly realize that there\'s a lot more to Tohru, not to mention all the other characters. In fact the complex and utterly full of heart characters are the top reason I love both the show and the manga. First off, Tohru is just a genuinely good and nice person. They actually do exist in real life, it doesn\'t automatically make her a Mary Sue, get over it. Second of all, Tohru has a lot of deep seated issues. And not just the kind that are supposed to be flaws but make the character look good anyway, actual relatable human flaws. She has unreasonable guilt over her mother\'s death and tries to assuage it by striving to fulfill the expectations her mother had for her. She also places a lot of her self worth on whether or not she can meet her own high standards for herself. She\'s lonely, but has a hard time relying on people, even the ones who are truly close to her. And a lot of her cheerful, helpful personality is actually built on self-doubt and selfishness. The manga goes a lot deeper into this in the arcs after the anime ends, but she pushed herself to act that way in order to be more like her father after he died. She felt rejected by both her father\'s family and her mother and so tried hard to be the person she thought they wanted. Really, like everybody ever, she just wants to be loved by others. This is both good and bad as it helps her empathize with others and prioritize their feelings, but it also causes her to hide what she perceives as her short comings and not be entirely genuine with the people she loves. I think everybody can relate to sincerely wanting to be a good person and trying your best, while never actually feeling good enough. That feeling of dreading that the people around you might find out how fake you actually are, even if in reality they would be more likely to understand exactly how we feel. Lastly, Tohru is just one of the most plain LIKABLE characters I\'ve ever seen. She feels like a real person to me, and even if we never got all the back story about her issues I think I would still like her. She reminds me of some of my best friends in real life, the ones that just put a smile on your face to be around!2. The story is predictable and repetitive- This one I don\'t agree with at all. FB simply has an episodic structure which gradually ties into an overarching story with a strong conclusion of both the conflicts and themes of the narrative at the end. The story does repeat in that Tohru meets each member of the zodiac, learns about their problem, becomes their friend, and then helps them solve their problem or at least gives them a new perspective. But with each new zodiac member the story progresses- we get new and interesting dynamics with our established characters and new insight into the Tohma family. Plus the two main romance threads provide nice through lines, which are indeed predictable, but still satisfying and natural.3. It has Shoujo cliches out the wazoo-There\'s a difference between HAVING tropes and USING tropes effectively. The most cliche and silly thing about FB is definitely the premise. The idea that the zodiac members transform when hugged by the opposite sex is quite obviously the kind of shoujo silliness which is only there to force interesting romantic conflicts between the characters. When I first saw the show, my reaction was ""Seriously?"" I mean, WHY would that be a stipulation of this kind of ancient curse? Just why? What exactly constitutes a ""hug"" anyway? A kiss seems more thematically appropriate, but obviously it would be much harder to get the characters to accidentally kiss each other all the time.... Anyway, just accept the premise. That\'s not the interesting part, the interesting part is what the author DOES with it. She uses this seemingly forced curse to explore themes of isolation, discrimination, alienation from society, identity, fear of intimacy, emotional abuse, feeling trapped by your circumstances, how young people struggle to find meaning and purpose as they grow up, co-dependent relationships vs healthy relationships... I could go on.  And that\'s just the main premise and themes. A lot of the characters fit into well-used stereotypes, but I understand exactly WHY they are that kind of person within the context of the story. Basically this show is indeed a classic shoujo story, but it knows how to deliver on and develop that kind of story better than any other shoujo I\'ve seen.Ok, final glowing remarks (LOL). This is one of the best manga adaptations around. It\'is a show I\'ve re-watched many times because the experience is just so enjoyable. The tone is light, heart-warming, hilarious, touching, with just a touch of the bizarre and a subtle unease from the darker underlying themes, especially near the end. It\'s just such a satisfying feeling to follow the story from beginning to end. The pacing is near perfect and the art, while dated, is clean, simple, and mostly lovely. I especially commend how well the story raps up in the anime even though the manga goes on for more than twice as long in terms of plot. It feels like a complete work that conveys the message it wants to, a message that is compatible with the manga even if the manga has much longer to explore it. This show is a perfect as a gateway anime- a relatively short but complete work that\'s easy to get drawn into. In case you couldn\'t tell, I LOVE THIS SHOW!!! Yay! Ok, the end XP the first episode and Tohru doesn\'t immediately captivate you, you\'re likely to think ""Oh great, another one of those perfect, never have a moment of doubt, God\'s gift to the universe shoujo girls."" If you start with this opinion, you might stop watching carefully and not catch on to Tohru\'s real character arc. However if you are actually paying attention, you\'ll quickly realize that there\'s a lot more to Tohru, not to mention all the other characters. In fact the complex and utterly full of heart characters are the top reason I love both the show and the manga. First off, Tohru is just a genuinely good and nice person. They actually do exist in real life, it doesn\'t automatically make her a Mary Sue, get over it. Second of all, Tohru has a lot of deep seated issues. And not just the kind that are supposed to be flaws but make the character look good anyway, actual relatable human flaws. She has unreasonable guilt over her mother\'s death and tries to assuage it by striving to fulfill the expectations her mother had for her. She also places a lot of her self worth on whether or not she can meet her own high standards for herself. She\'s lonely, but has a hard time relying on people, even the ones who are truly close to her. And a lot of her cheerful, helpful personality is actually built on self-doubt and selfishness. The manga goes a lot deeper into this in the arcs after the anime ends, but she pushed herself to act that way in order to be more like her father after he died. She felt rejected by both her father\'s family and her mother and so tried hard to be the person she thought they wanted. Really, like everybody ever, she just wants to be loved by others. This is both good and bad as it helps her empathize with others and prioritize their feelings, but it also causes her to hide what she perceives as her short comings and not be entirely genuine with the people she loves. I think everybody can relate to sincerely wanting to be a good person and trying your best, while never actually feeling good enough.

Ok, the end XP', ""This week I just finished watching all of the Fruits Basket episodes. My,  Overall rating is that it was very good, and I would give it 3 stars. I was disappointed that there was not a lot of romance in the anime, especially between Kyo, Yuki, and Tohru. I was hoping that Tohru would choose one of them as her love interest. This anime was very hilarious and had many sad parts as well, but I enjoyed it until the very end. It was not one of my favorite anime shows, but it satisfied me. For some reason Akito was my favorite character of...them all, even though it shows his harsh and cruel ways and his intentions on how he wanted to not allow love in the Soma family. There was a reason towards his behavior, and those who haven't seen the anime will know once they have watched. Akito comes to Torhu as a very cunning individual, he is indeed pictured as mysterious, and frightening to the bone. Every character in the show was unique and different in their own special way, especially being that they were animals. them all, even though it shows his harsh and cruel ways and his intentions on how he wanted to not allow love in the Soma family.

I first heard about it from searching what animes were similar to ouran high school host club. It  took me about 6 months,  a couple rewatches of ouran to finally give the anime a chance and watch the first episode. I was happy to say that my fears about me not liking it were proved invalid. After watching the first couple of episodes i found that i just kept on wanting to know more. My...general reaction of the ending was similar to the one i had with ouran. I didn't like the fact that tohru was left terrified of kyo and then accepted him because she still believes him to be a good person and later with akito abusing her not finding out exactly what went on in the house. It later influenced me to continue on with reading the manga. To this day my favorite arc will always be the first story with tohru trying to find her way in life meeting the different sohmas one by one. The reason is that I see a lot of myself in tohru. Staying with the subject of tohru, like her I try to see the best in everyone and always put on a smile even when im sad or angry. Like her I also am a clutz and a bit dumb and clueless but always try to do me best and work hard. In the end i relate to this character the most because the hardships she faces are similar to what i used to deal with when i went to high school. Like tohru i was constantly made fun of because i sometimes never think things through and always counted on my very few friends to stick up for me. This side of her is shown in the episode where tohru caught a fever because of the fact she was worrying about failing her midterms in high school. While I can relate to tohru the most what really made me keep watching this anime in the first place was kyo. Kyo in my opinion has one of the most tragic back stories in the anime itself. while it explains why he is ruff around the edges, like tohru i fell in love with him because I know he on the inside he has a good heart and is a good person. He is truly what I look for when thinking about finding a real guy for myself in the future. I love his comical reactions to fighting with yuki. I love how he tries to do the right thing and always speaks his mind when he has a problem. I also love the side of him that always seems to generally care about tohru the most like the time where she left the sohma house and the time where he comically faced his fear of leeks just to make soup so tohru can get better quickly. I could go on and on with talking about every character but in all this anime is truly wonderful and it is a must see if you are into a warm high school comedy with a bit of romance. It is truly one of the most beloved sohjo comedies of all time.\ufeff general reaction of the ending was similar to the one i had with ouran.

That is exactly the case with Fruits Basket. The anime is still beautifully done with cute designs for the characters.However, the anime left something short.

That's a lot left unsaid in the anime.The last scene in the anime does come from the corresponding chapter in the manga, however, the editor decided to end the anime there.

She finds a home with the Sohma family and soon learn their secret!There are definitely some interesting relationships that develop around the magical and mysterious Sohmas as well as some good humor but if you want a plot-driven anime, look elsewhere.Animation:This is the show in which I learned that shoujo was synonymous with huge eyes, even for an anime. Shoujo also means overly-attractive...male characters as well.The drawing quality is average stuff, in fact pretty plain by standards now. There were some pretty deep themes in this for a shoujo and I felt that having the cute and sparkly look didn\'t do the seriousness justice at times.Sound:Overall, the music was average. The OP was calming but I\'d typically fast forwards through it. Each character has their own music theme that represents their personality, one of which really annoyed me (Ayame\'s theme). In terms of voice acting, I think Yuki needs to get a deeper voice (Aya Hisakawa is awesome and all but Yuki IS a male). However, Yui Horie performed wonderfully as expected.Story:The story is quite interesting as you have a girl whose mother passed away, and yet refuses to be taken in by her remaining family. She then stumbles across the Sohma family, which essentially ""adopts"" her. The majority of the series shows Tohru meeting and getting to know the various Sohmas. Only in the last few episodes is the plot really advanced.Despite the long character expositions, you do get quite a bit of humor and an occasional rush of emotion. If the ending had been more conclusive, I would have given this a higher rating.Character:For me, this was what stood out about this anime. The entire show is about the development between the innocent, friendly, and always-helpful Tohru and the Sohmas. It really is a striking contrast as Tohru is as nice as they come and totally willing to help anyone in need, and the Sohmas are a completely secretive and mysterious family that shuns outsiders.Tohru is able to warm the Sohma family, helping them see past their curse and enjoy themselves for once.

Unbeknownst to her, the tent was on the property of a member of the Sohma family which has a curse upon them. This show is about how Tohru interacts with the various members of the Sohma family and how they slowly become a part of her family. It takes a Chinese tradition of the Zodiac but makes it fresh with an original idea which makes for a super fun but often...very sad scenario. This is an anime that will win you over quickly with it\'s quirkiness and its cuteness. But be warned for some super heavy moments too.Visuals: B- *Much like Evangelion, the characters have super pointy noses and really cute designs. Since the show seems to have been targeted more for females, the characters like Yuki or Ryo are almost drawn too cute to a fault. It\'s never enough to ruin an episode or anything, but I do roll my eyes when it happens. As for the rest of the art, it is typically not very detailed and is very simplistic but will change pending on the mood to make for greater comedic effect or to make the many feelz moments even more heartfelt. Still, the simplistic and at times lazy style could be a turn-off for many people that detracts from an excellent story.Voice Acting: A+ *Outside of the many anime cliche temper tantrums and the Yuki fanclub, the voices are super cute in this show and I want to place my hand over my heart and go ""Awwwww!!!"" every time Tohru\'s voice cracks. But honestly, what\'s even better than the voice acting is the dialogue itself. Most anime dubs (and subs especially) have some odd phrasing and a lot of cringey lines. Fruits Basket certainly is guilty of cringe, but I think it uses analogies, stories, and symbolism to form memorable dialogue better than any other anime that I\'ve seen which leads to a lot of powerful moments.""A rice ball doesn\'t belong in a fruit\'s basket."" (When the opening theme played as the little kid called out RICE BALL at the end while Tohru was crying tears of joy while she found her new family. You best believe my heart was feeling those feelz)*Side note, I really really wanted to eat a rice ball because of this anime and because of this discussion. I did and was not disappointed. Those are delicious!""So if somebody is jealous of somebody else, it\'s probably because it\'s easier to see the plumb on somebody else\'s back than it is on your own. Yep I can see it. I can see it very clearly Kyou. You don\'t know it, but you\'ve got a great big plumb on your back."" (If someone said this entire speech about me, I don\'t even know how I\'d react. But I do know I\'d have the urge to hug Toru so hard. Maybe that\'s why Kyou ends up snapping at Toru because he wants to hug her but knows he can\'t. So he lets out his frustration instead of giving his gratitude at first... Boy am I glad I don\'t have that curse, )When the snow melts, what does it become?... Spring (Paraphrased, but this clever exchange is what kick-started Hatori and girlfriend\'s relationship and what allowed Hatori and Tohru to really connect when Toru mirrored girlfriend\'s answer)Film Score/Soundtrack: A+ *This anime has a lot of emotional moments and a lot of witty humor and even more emotional moments and the music reflects that. It strikes the right cords at the right time and even as a standalone listen, it makes me want to relive moments from the show again and again. That\'s the making of a good film score.***My favorite track:Memory For You (I am cheating with two because ""Memory of You"" needs to be added to this list because it is used the most often within the show and it never ceases to not be the one of the most beautiful melodies that  I\'ve ever heard.)Serenade (The true GOAT of the OST. The Japanese version is the full and official song, but once again I prefer the vocals of the English one. But either way, the strings of the violin and the overall beat of the song and the chords are just so pretty and I will re-listen to this a million more times and never grow tired of it. And that\'s likely because it reminds me of the violins on Dream Theater\'s The Astonishing album.Characters: A+ *The strength of the show. I loved getting to meet the Sohma\'s, learning about their eccentricities and finding out how Tohru would accidentally turn them into their Zodiac animal lol! This is a world full of lots of heart because of the charm of this cursed misfit family. Here\'s how I rank the characters I find most memorable.1: Tohru- adorable personality, selfless to a fault, reminds me of myself with her mannerisms and how I overthink my every interaction with people. A very lovable protagonist and she has at least one put my hand over my heart and say ""Awwww"" speech per episode it seems.2: Shigure-his always happy, friendly, and dumb personality reminds me of Mr. Peanutbutter from BoJack Horseman which is fitting since they\'re both dogs. He has wisecracks for everything and he can turn any situation into a good one. I love how he messes with his editor and felt so bad for her haha3: Ayame-always extravagent, always over-the-top, and always so funny. He\'s only in a few episodes, but he steals the show in each one that he\'s in. And I love that his main goal was to win Yuki\'s love over but struggled to do so because his strong personality was too much for Yuki. It was a valuable lesson about friendship with people that are very different.4: Yuki-the calmest Sohma outside of when he deals with Kyo. He\'s the one that is the best fit for Tohru if they did force a relationship out of the show (which I\'m happy that they didn\'t). And he\'s a really good guy even though he\'s super popular and talented at pretty much everything. Also, his rat form is super cute!5: Hatori-he has a cold introduction to Tohru, but once she breaks the ice after finding out his tragic backstory, (honestly that might be the best episode in the series) we find out that Hatori is the wisest of the Sohma\'s and is a really good guy.6: Kyo-short-tempered, always trying to pick fights, and always finding ways to complain about something, but we grow to love him anyway. And I love how protective of Tohru he becomes. Especially when Tohru is too nice or timid to protect herself, Kyo is not afraid to be brash or rude on her behalf. And damn did he have a sad backstory.7: Momiji-the crossdressing little boy who cries ""waaaaahhh waaahh"" every time someone picks on him. Minus the crossdressing, he reminds me of my cousin when he was younger which irritated me. But like my cousin, he\'s actually a really sweet kid once you get to know him. Plus, his backstory episode damn near made me cry and Tohru hugging him after that is a top 5 moment in the entire series. The feelz!!!!8: Saki-electric signals girl doesn\'t ever have her powers explained but that\'s ok because we find her just as weird as everyone else and we love her because she loves Tohru. She uses her psychic abilities to help Tohru several times in the series including at a very powerful junction at the end of the series.9: Hatsuharu-I find it funny how he can be nicer than Yuki who is normally the calmest of the Sohma\'s and than go black in which he\'s even meaner and more obnoxious than Kyo. A really fun character that I would have enjoyed seeing more of.10: Kisa-OMG SHE IS THE CUTEST!!!! I am just like Tohru fawning over her adorableness. Besides the biting of course that was mean, but I can deal with a couple bites if I got to hug and squeeze Kisa like Tohru did.11: Kazuma-he only shows up in the last three episodes, but boy does he make his mark when they show Ryo\'s backstory.12: Arisa ""Blonde Friend""-the second of Tohru\'s friends who is always there for her. She doesn\'t get as much of a focus as Saki does, but she is a really good friend and is super aggressive and weird and it was easy to see why Tohru loved her.Cringeworthy Anime Moments: There is a lot in this series and it is what will prevent a lot of people from getting into this show like I did. For starters, this is a Shoujo which means it is designed for young females whereas a Shounen is designed for young males. That means they both have their sets of cringey quirks. Shoujo tend to have a lot of cutesy artwork whenever they focus on the male leads faces with their hair moving around in slow motion in the breeze. And much like Shonen, there is actually a lot of dumb fighting and over-the-top anime humor too. Kagura is one of those characters that\'s entire purpose is to get involved in scenes like that where she mercilessly beats up Kyo because she ""loves"" him and she is both verbally and physically abusive but because she\'s a girl it\'s meant to be seen as cute when she\'s really just pyschotic. Thankfully, most of the fighting is actually pretty funny or started in a reasonable way. But there are quite a few fights that you just need to roll your eyes an d accept are going to happen to get through with the rest of the super wholesome story. Oh, and you need to accept that Yuki has a fan club of super-obsessed girls in it too. Why Japanese high school anime tend to follow this annoying trope I will never understand.Titles:Opening: A+ *Super cute and catchy! By episode 5 I was singing along to the lyrics. One of my favorite openings to any anime.Closing: A+ *There\'s also this super pretty version that plays at the end of the 26th episode which is a bit more melancholy and serious in nature while the one that plays at the end of each episode is more playful in nature. Either way, I love both versions and listened to them both more times than I can count.Final Verdict: 8/10 *The type of humor that this anime employs is of the intentionally cutesy/cringey kind. But due to the use of percussion drums and the film score at appropriate times and good deliveries from the voice actors, the majority of the jokes land and the concept of humans turning into small animals after being hugged leads to all sorts of hilarious situations for Tohru to have to figure out how to fix. But what makes this show go from cute and quirky to memorable and heartwarming are the heavy moments that the curse on the ""Sohma"" family brings to the show. Even though this show was described to me by a guy friend as a ""girl\'s anime"", I think that this was more about friendship than anything else and I enjoyed every minute of this! very sad scenario. This is an anime that will win you over quickly with it\'s quirkiness and its cuteness. But be warned for some super heavy moments too.Visuals: B- *Much like Evangelion, the characters have super pointy noses and really cute designs. Since the show seems to have been targeted more for females, the characters like Yuki or Ryo are almost drawn too cute to a fault. It\'s never enough to ruin an episode or anything, but I do roll my eyes when it happens. As for the rest of the art, it is typically not very detailed and is very simplistic but will change pending on the mood to make for greater comedic effect or to make the many feelz moments even more heartfelt. Still, the simplistic and at times lazy style could be a turn-off for many people that detracts from an excellent story.Voice Acting: A+ *Outside of the many anime cliche temper tantrums and the Yuki fanclub, the voices are super cute in this show and I want to place my hand over my heart and go ""Awwwww!!!"" every time Tohru\'s voice cracks. But honestly, what\'s even better than the voice acting is the dialogue itself. Most anime dubs (and subs especially) have some odd phrasing and a lot of cringey lines. Fruits Basket certainly is guilty of cringe, but I think it uses analogies, stories, and symbolism to form memorable dialogue better than any other anime that I\'ve seen which leads to a lot of powerful moments.""A rice ball doesn\'t belong in a fruit\'s basket."" (When the opening theme played as the little kid called out RICE BALL at the end while Tohru was crying tears of joy while she found her new family. You best believe my heart was feeling those feelz)*Side note, I really really wanted to eat a rice ball because of this anime and because of this discussion. I did and was not disappointed. Those are delicious!""So if somebody is jealous of somebody else, it\'s probably because it\'s easier to see the plumb on somebody else\'s back than it is on your own. Yep I can see it. I can see it very clearly Kyou. You don\'t know it, but you\'ve got a great big plumb on your back."" (If someone said this entire speech about me, I don\'t even know how I\'d react. But I do know I\'d have the urge to hug Toru so hard. Maybe that\'s why Kyou ends up snapping at Toru because he wants to hug her but knows he can\'t. So he lets out his frustration instead of giving his gratitude at first... Boy am I glad I don\'t have that curse, )When the snow melts, what does it become?... Spring (Paraphrased, but this clever exchange is what kick-started Hatori and girlfriend\'s relationship and what allowed Hatori and Tohru to really connect when Toru mirrored girlfriend\'s answer)Film Score/Soundtrack: A+ *This anime has a lot of emotional moments and a lot of witty humor and even more emotional moments and the music reflects that. It strikes the right cords at the right time and even as a standalone listen, it makes me want to relive moments from the show again and again. That\'s the making of a good film score.***My favorite track:Memory For You (I am cheating with two because ""Memory of You"" needs to be added to this list because it is used the most often within the show and it never ceases to not be the one of the most beautiful melodies that  I\'ve ever heard.)Serenade (The true GOAT of the OST. The Japanese version is the full and official song, but once again I prefer the vocals of the English one. But either way, the strings of the violin and the overall beat of the song and the chords are just so pretty and I will re-listen to this a million more times and never grow tired of it. And that\'s likely because it reminds me of the violins on Dream Theater\'s The Astonishing album.Characters: A+ *The strength of the show. I loved getting to meet the Sohma\'s, learning about their eccentricities and finding out how Tohru would accidentally turn them into their Zodiac animal lol! This is a world full of lots of heart because of the charm of this cursed misfit family. Here\'s how I rank the characters I find most memorable.1: Tohru- adorable personality, selfless to a fault, reminds me of myself with her mannerisms and how I overthink my every interaction with people. A very lovable protagonist and she has at least one put my hand over my heart and say ""Awwww"" speech per episode it seems.2: Shigure-his always happy, friendly, and dumb personality reminds me of Mr. Peanutbutter from BoJack Horseman which is fitting since they\'re both dogs. He has wisecracks for everything and he can turn any situation into a good one. I love how he messes with his editor and felt so bad for her haha3: Ayame-always extravagent, always over-the-top, and always so funny. He\'s only in a few episodes, but he steals the show in each one that he\'s in. And I love that his main goal was to win Yuki\'s love over but struggled to do so because his strong personality was too much for Yuki. It was a valuable lesson about friendship with people that are very different.4: Yuki-the calmest Sohma outside of when he deals with Kyo. He\'s the one that is the best fit for Tohru if they did force a relationship out of the show (which I\'m happy that they didn\'t). And he\'s a really good guy even though he\'s super popular and talented at pretty much everything. Also, his rat form is super cute!5: Hatori-he has a cold introduction to Tohru, but once she breaks the ice after finding out his tragic backstory, (honestly that might be the best episode in the series) we find out that Hatori is the wisest of the Sohma\'s and is a really good guy.6: Kyo-short-tempered, always trying to pick fights, and always finding ways to complain about something, but we grow to love him anyway. And I love how protective of Tohru he becomes. Especially when Tohru is too nice or timid to protect herself, Kyo is not afraid to be brash or rude on her behalf. And damn did he have a sad backstory.7: Momiji-the crossdressing little boy who cries ""waaaaahhh waaahh"" every time someone picks on him. Minus the crossdressing, he reminds me of my cousin when he was younger which irritated me. But like my cousin, he\'s actually a really sweet kid once you get to know him. Plus, his backstory episode damn near made me cry and Tohru hugging him after that is a top 5 moment in the entire series. The feelz!!!!8: Saki-electric signals girl doesn\'t ever have her powers explained but that\'s ok because we find her just as weird as everyone else and we love her because she loves Tohru. She uses her psychic abilities to help Tohru several times in the series including at a very powerful junction at the end of the series.9: Hatsuharu-I find it funny how he can be nicer than Yuki who is normally the calmest of the Sohma\'s and than go black in which he\'s even meaner and more obnoxious than Kyo. A really fun character that I would have enjoyed seeing more of.10: Kisa-OMG SHE IS THE CUTEST!!!! I am just like Tohru fawning over her adorableness.

Also The Zodiac plotline is well thought out and ties into the traditional Chinese Zodiac story perfectly.(sorry if this was vague, I don't want to spoil anything.)Overall I say this is an incredible anime worth watching!Also this is purely my opinion, and if yours is different, Congrats!...we're different people. we're different people."", ""I am only on the 5th episode but I already feel like something is missing that the manga had. I feel like it doesn't capture the feelings as well as the manga did and comes out a little boring.At first I thought it was because I read the manga so nothing really intrigues me because I know the original source material. But I am watching the new adaptation and I feel exited every time I watch a new episode instead of being tolerable.Although on the flip side for an anime from 2001 it was kind of refreshing to see kind of a Moe...stile before it was big.

She also has 2 super entertaining friends.2. while 2 harem members seem like they could evolve into...a 3p the rest of the harem like the main character because of her non-judgmental attitude and the fact that she is super willing to cook and clean for the house.3. while the concept of turning into an animal when hugged by someone of another gender could have been used as plot in an infinite amount of ways it's role is purely fact and slapstick comedy.Next, I'm going to tell you what I got that I didn't expect.1. Every central character made me laugh out loud. at least once. I don't have a shoujo manga personality but these guys are each written in a beautiful moment of hilarity that earns them their spot in the anime.  and if you reflect on their zodiac animal after those laughs you laugh harder.2. I cried multiple times during this season. In happiness, sadness, understanding, I cried so many times.  I accepted when I turned 18 that I was going to be a grown-up who cries at certain types of things and this show hit every base. and the fact that I cried wasn't upsetting, it was just a gentle cry leading to a content feeling at the end of an episode.So I don't watch shoujo anime because the voices tend to annoy me but is this what they are like?

Spoilers ahead.With reboots becoming much more common these days, I\'ve subscribed to the ""watch reboot first and then watch original for nostalgia\'s sake"" club. I found this a satisfactory method when watching Fullmetal Alchemist and decided to do the same when watching Fruits Basket. I watched all 3 Fruits Basket (2019) seasons as they were airing and absolutely fell in love with the franchise. When it came to an end in June 2021, I decided to pick up the original because I wanted to consume every last bit of this franchise that I could.When I...watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist after watching Brotherhood, I enjoyed it somewhat but was mostly bored and upset at all the cut characters and plotlines. I expected a similar situation watching the original Fruits Basket. That was not the case.I see why this show was popular back in the 2000s. It was absolutely a joy to watch. The charm and humor that makes Fruits Basket so wonderful is still there, and while much of the drama that occurs later in the manga never made it into this series, the show still tackles serious themes well, and I think the last few episodes are testament to that. I laughed and cried and thoroughly enjoyed my time watching the original Fruits Basket. I think that if the manga had been completed and this series had chosen to tackle all of it, it might have done a pretty satisfactory job. Story-wise, nearly everything was the same compared to the reboot besides the ending and a few changes here and there.There were, of course, some issues I still had. Obviously a HUGE chunk of the story is missing (the better chunk I would argue too), which is why I couldn\'t really rank this higher than an 8 since most of the 10 quality plots occur in later seasons of the Fruits Basket reboot. This series also really emphasized humor more than the reboot, and while that was enjoyable, I found I cried much less at this series compared to the reboot. Don\'t get me wrong, I love to laugh, but that sense of beauty and sadness so prevalent in the reboot was lost in the original series. Yes, I still cried multiple times, so this series was still adapting the wonderful story elements of Fruits Basket well, but I cried much less than I did even watching Season 1 of the reboot.In terms of story elements, super strange having Akito being male, not a huge fan of Yuki\'s feminine voice, and yeah, the ending is as poor and vague as you would expect watching an anime trying to find an original ending when the manga is not yet complete. I have to give the anime credit for Tohru trying to reach out to and comfort Akito as it was very similar to what actually happens in the manga and reboot, but then afterwards everything is left extremely vague and there\'s no true closure (again, expected, but I would argue the vague ending of 2003\'s Fullmetal Alchemist tackled this same issue better). The animation really isn\'t great either considering this anime\'s older age and Studio Deen, but I was mostly here for the story, not the animation quality.That being said, I did really like watching this, and while I never could imagine myself watching the original Fullmetal Alchemist again, I could definitely see myself rewatching the original Fruits Basket when in the mood. Of course, I will always give priority to the reboot for its better, complete story, but I see now why so many people enjoyed the original.I\'d probably still recommend that if you\'re on the fence between watching this and the reboot first, definitely watch the reboot and just pop this on afterwards for some nostalgia\'s sake. Both are pretty equal I would argue in terms of sharing the first few arcs of Fruits Basket, but obviously the reboot is going to be the one that gives you a more satisfying and complete story. watched the original Fullmetal Alchemist after watching Brotherhood, I enjoyed it somewhat but was mostly bored and upset at all the cut characters and plotlines.

The characters are fairly likable, and there are a few moments of genuinely touching character development. Further, the overwhelming innocence it exudes makes it diffcult to hate, as demonstrated perfectly by the opening soundtrack.Cons: The story is painfully mediocre, frustratingly so, particularly since the premise is both intriguing and original. The Chinese Zodiac is used more for comedy than plot, and there is little more than meets...the eye, initally. If you want answers about the Zodiac, you're going to be disappointed. There isn't an overarching story, and more character development goes to the side characters, than the main, who are more or less the same, beginning and end. Tooru despite being the centre of Fruits Basket, doesn't have noticable change to her character in the entire series... she's nice at the start... and still nice at the end. Furuba promises originality, but there's there's nothing surprising or fantastic, instead it was often cliche and, frankly, boring.There's potential in Fruits Basket, but it's mostly squandered, it's no masterpiece, but it's passable. That's not to say there's nothing worth watching... pick your poison, it's the kind of saccharine slife of life you could watch with your Grandmother, but don't expect too much. the eye, initally.

It saddens me that the reviews are, mainly, positive.Why?This is not a faithful adaptation to the manga at all. It's really annoying to me that people watch this and like it, knowing that they're missing out on so much more.The anime makes the characters flat. It takes one aspect of their personalities (for example, Tohru's kindess or Kyou being angry) and exaggerates them to the extreme. There is no depth to anyone. They also change some characters entirely (though in fairness, one of the reveals about a certain character hadn't happened in...the manga yet) and cut out characters who are very important .Another thing that annoys me is that they didn't really keep the strong messages of love and friendship.

What if you could never hold the person you love without transforming into something not human? That is what this show is about. A girl tries to help the Sohma family through these pains, with some crazy characters and comedy mixed in.Far and away the thing that is going to grab you the most about this show is the characters. The whole show revolves around the idea that the Sohma family was given a curse that when they are hugged by the opposite...sex they turned into one of the 12 Zodiac animals. Well the 12 Zodiacs and a cat (long story watch the show). Tohru, Yuki and Kyo are the 3 main characters. Tohru is not cursed and is probably the only one outside the the Sohma family that knows of the curse, however Yuki and Kyo are cursed. At first I thought the show is going to be a big fight between Yuki and Kyo for Tohrus' affection, but as the show goes on this is not the case. There is a definite love that grows between the 3 of them but it is not of a romantic nature, more of a very deep friendship or maybe a brother sister relationship. As the show moves farther along more of the Zodiac characters are slowly introduced one by one. Although the show clearly keeps the focus on Tohru, Yuki and Kyo member of the Zodiac will get his or her chance to develop and tell their back story. Eventually it can be seen that ever character in the show is trying to deal with some kind of tragedy in their past, beyond their curse, and even characters that are not cursed like Tohru and her 2 friend have something to share as well. Half the fun of the show is seeing who the next Zodiac character is and what they are like. There is one issue in that it seemed to me like the writers all of the sudden realized that there was 6 episodes left and they still needed to introduce 4 Zodiac characters. Unfortunately this means these characters never get much past an introduction, and that put a little bit of a damper on the cast as a whole. Despite one or two bumps I fell in love with several characters in the cast and even I few I thought I was going to dislike based on their first impression.Majority of the comedy comes from characters personalities. Each character that is introduced along the way seems to add one more “interesting” element to the show. New characters are added all the time so new comical material is added all the time. How much comedy happens in an episode seems to very a lot. Some are very funny well others seem to not be very funny and even kind of serious. When the show starts I found myself thinking it was going to be a romantic comedy, but I found myself thinking it is closer to a slice of life with a little comedy thrown in from time to time.The show doesn't really have a strong plot. The show has enough to hold all the episodes together and the plot is focused on a little more right in the beginning and right at the end, but all in all it is nothing special. The show goes on to tell you that there is more to the curse then just turning into the animals of the Zodiac. However the show never really explains it any further then that. There are hints given and one or two things are found out, but for the most part we are left in the dark. Also the problems are not solved at the end of the show. There is a general consensus that things are better then when the show began but everyone still has the problems they started with. The story is not what the show does best, nor is it what the show tries to focus on.I have gone this long without use that word in this review but frankly I don't thing there is a way to write a review on this show without using that word. The show is cute(I can feel all my masculinity draining away). The characters are cute, the comedy is cute, the animals the people turn into are cute, the show is cute. That does lead to some cheese/lame “you are fine just the way you are” or “we will always be friends” speeches.

', 'If you read the manga and liked it, I would not recommend the anime. I watched the anime first, and at the time would have given it a 10/10, but after I read the manga, it dropped a bit.That being said, Fruits basked does stay pretty true to the story, however it leaves out 2-thirds of it. Many of the characters have interesting stories that are never told, and in the anime you don\'t even get to meet all of the zodiac members. Akito is also sold short in the anime, you never get to hear Akito\'s story. Instead, Akito is just given as...the bad guy, whose anger stems from his dying. This does not happen in the manga. In the manga, Akito\'s role in the zodiac is ""god"", rather than one who is meant to die for them.The anime has more situations where the Sohma\'s get transformed, but this adds more to the comedy, and I like it.The anime\'s ending happens much earlier in the manga, and is a key point to the development of Tohru and Kyo\'s relationship. (something I am very disappointed about not having in the anime!)It\'s also too bad that they leave out Rin and Kureno, as well as the student council characters, who help Yuki deal with many of his issues.So while the anime is very enjoyable, and also very well done, it\'s only a small part of what is actually a much deeper storyline. the bad guy, whose anger stems from his dying.

Sorry if it is not helpful.Fruits basket was one of the first Animes I ever watched and to be honest it is still my favorite.The story is centered around Tohru, a high school girl whose mother recently died in a car accident. We come across her while she is living in a tent due to certain circumstances. While on her way to school, she stumbles upon the house of her classmate Yuki Sohma. When Yuki finds out that she is living in a tent, he and his cousin Shigure invite her to live with them. After she moves in, another...relative Kyo moves in as well. But the Sohma's are not all they appear to be, when Tohru accidently hugs them, they turn into animals from the Zodiac. Throughout the story she meets more members of the Zodiac and gets to know and love them all. Lots of other things happen, good things, bad things, but I dont want to spoil anything.The characters in this anime are all very complex, they all have their own back story and turmoils. It makes them all rather relatable. During the course of this anime you get to know them all very well. Another thing I liked was that not one of the characters were alike, every one had different personality traits, different looks, and differerent tastes. It made the whole anime more diverse and allowed for even more character developement.Yet another Awesome point of this anime was the fact that there was never a clearly defined romance between the characters, it left things up to interpretation which was nice, because I know the thing that makes me angry with harem and reverse harem anime is when the lead doesn't end up with the person I think they should be with. So it's refreshing when an anime can have a high level of romance without making people angry.Basically the Anime if full of laughs and heartache. It makes you happy but it also makes you cry at times. Overall its very origional and the best anime I have seen so far. If you haven't watched it, then I suggest you do.

It also has some romance. I'm just saying a story just needs some drama to get you to watch more so every time I mean every time I finish watching a dramtic yet funny anime I get really pissed off by the ending I want more same thing happend with fruit basket.So watch this I recommend it, its funny, romantic, dramatic, slice of life and just awesome! "", 'on to the review...the show is about a 15 year old girl who lost her mother in a car accident.she was forced to live with her grandpa. when the house was getting a few ajustments the girl stayed inside a tent until the two young men found her and welcomes her to the house... later she soons discover that the people she was staying with was under a curse that makes them change into animals of the zodiac.fruits basket is hilarious and expectable in many ways. its not just an average shoujo you find on a tv everyday in japan... worth the hype in my...opinion.... but keep in mind people are diverse... opinion.... but keep in mind people are diverse...', 'Just this morning, I realised I call my favourite friends ""cute"" a lot, which can be really annoying after a while. But, the main protagonist, Tohru, from Fruits Basket made me realise that calling people ""cute"" means that I actually care about them. It\'s just these little feel-good moments and quotes from this anime that I think makes the simple story behind Fruits Basket a truly meaningful experience to watch.Story: 7/10To be honest, the story is pretty average. An orphaned girl named Tohru turns up at a house where people turn into animals from the Chinese zodiac when touched by the opposite gender because of...a curse. And literally the rest of the anime is about her trying to retain and understand the secret behind the Sohma family curse. Most of the episodes are about how she makes the family get along, particularly the other two boys Yuki and Kyo. Although the story may be simple, it does give a good backdrop within which the characters themselves can expose themselves and develop.Character: 10/10Let\'s start with Tohru. She\'s your average high school girl, but for some reason, she just knows what to say at the right time. She acts as the glue for the Sohma family (which is pretty much all made up of boys, hint hint nudge nudge, slight romance coming up...); and although sometimes I find her altruism frustrating, it offsets the rest of the characters. I actually learnt a lot from her words, she\'s almost like a mom, despite her having lost her mom. But really, I do see her as the ultimate model mother figure of the anime, she even cooks and cleans for the family! And most importantly, she cares about every single character, which is why everyone seems to love her.Then we have the two protagonist boys, Yuki and Kyo, who are almost opposites. For example, Yuki turns into a mouse whilst Kyo turns into a cat. Opposite enough? On top of that, Kyo is hot-tempered whilst Yuki is has a softer character, and both like to fight with each other. But, when Tohru enters the Sohma house as a result of the Sohma family secret, Tohru makes it her mission to make them understand each other better, which slowly starts to happen. The interesting thing we discover as the anime progresses is that deep inside, the Sohma family all share a longing to be accepted and loved, which is why sometimes I found myself realising that this anime has a lot to teach about people and their inner selves. I was constantly drawn in by the lesson learnt each episodes; and although Tohru can seem like she\'s preaching a little bit when she starts talking like a mom, she still delivers some very deep and insightful comment about people and their behaviour.Sound: 9/10I always felt like crying when I heard the opening theme music, it is so beautiful! And on top of that, the background music is generally quite gentle and suits the anime well.Art: 8/10The art is neither fantastic nor lacking, again, I think the colours and cute drawings suit this shouju style anime. And just putting it out there: Yuki is sooo adorable!Overall Enjoyment: 8/10Although the story itself didn\'t mean much to me at all, the things that the characters expressed really hit home. The characters\' emotions and Tohru\'s little ""life lessons"" are what make this anime so memorable to me. Once you\'ve watched this, sometimes you might find yourself wondering what your close friend was feeling yesterday and what you could do to make them feel better today.If you\'re looking for a little pick-me-up, I would suggest Fruits Basket, it really is adorable and positively memorable! a curse.

Once you\'ve watched this, sometimes you might find yourself wondering what your close friend was feeling yesterday and what you could do to make them feel better today.If you\'re looking for a little pick-me-up, I would suggest Fruits Basket, it really is adorable and positively memorable!', 'I believe the concept and the character development in Fruits Basket is top notch; however the Anime left a ton of stuff out that should have been implemented.  I understand that both were in production at the same time.  If you want the best ending read the manga. ', ""Story: If you want something with more struggles and less romance in the genre of realistic Anime, this one is for you.Art: Very beautiful. Soft and whimsical.Sound: Good.Character(s): Great character development. You can really get inside Yuki and Kyo's heads. Not much in Tohru's. But some.Enjoyment: There's a little bit of everything for everyone. I think kids as young as 7 years are able to watch it.Overall: A great story and treat. A rarity. "", 'Fruits Basket. Where to begin. Probably one of my favorite spending experiences when I begged my parents at 16 to get me the box set from Funimation. I have never seen it anywhere, since they released the Viridian Collection. It is a decision I have never regretted.My first real anime of this genre, Fruits Basket is a heartwarming story and coming of age experience.The Story:Gorgeous animation, and vivid colors make this tale seem justified on screen. Having read the manga up until a certain point, I can honestly say this anime is well done. If you are expecting to find a great story that...tells slice of life, comedy, and romance: Fruits Basket is your #1 choice.Jokes that were in the series that did not make me laugh at 16 make me laugh now at 24. The anime ages well, and well enough for me to re-watch it now.Tohru Honda fills my life, and makes me realize growing up can be full of experiences lush and challenging.Kyo Sohma is my anger when I am not aware of what is going on, or what is expected of me. Or when I feel I am expected to be more than I can.Yuki Sohma is my side that I wish to become, calm and collected.Akito Sohma is my hate for the world, in which I realize that the dreams and fantasy are shadowed by darkness of society. And self rationalization of how I have changed.The Art:The characters look realistic to young Japanese girls, but I feel the show does expect skinny girls. Maybe it is just appealing. But Uo-chan is the perfect example of the American in every anime. Every anime has a Yankee, and every character seems to lighten up the situation.Zodiac parts have Chinese art that look beautiful. Colors eye pop. Hair styles draw you in, and eyes seem intense. Love what has been done here.The Soundtrack:English voice actors are familiar faces, from Funimation. Subtitle tracks sound crisp, and are just as pleasant. On the box set episodes I have, there is a behind the scenes episodes that seems to be subtitled well.Opening theme is soothing, and at first you are expecting much more than a slow song, but soon I found it fit the series. Ending song is pretty fitting too.Songs fill scenes and fit emotions well. Nostalgia fills my mind as I hear these tracks again, years later.Fruits Basket does stand the test of time, and for that reason-- I rate it higher than I would at 16.The Verdict:Fruits Basket does deviate from the manga, but it ends at a conclusive 26 episodes. It has a great ending, and gives me reason to say that I would gladly watch any other anime made by this creator because it has consistency, and powerful emotions that can relate to any coming of age story that a young adult wishes to watch. tells slice of life, comedy, and romance: Fruits Basket is your #1 choice.Jokes that were in the series that did not make me laugh at 16 make me laugh now at 24.

NO ONE.You see, I watched the first 20 episodes of Furuba when I was a kid. I loved it a lot, and the only reason why I didn't watch the other 6 was that I had a hard time finding it (this was back when the internet wasn't the thing that it is now and if you wanted to find anime episodes you had to REALLY dig deep). So, you see... I didn't see the HORRIBLE ANIME ENDING.I understand that the anime ended because at the time it had caught up with all the available...chapters of the manga, but... that's still no excuse. There's plenty of anime out there with an alternative ending to the manga that is just as good or sometimes even BETTER than the original source.Instead, Furuba's ending takes the chapters 32~34 of the manga and STRETCHES IT OUT unnecessarily, along with creating a totally different (and confusing) ending. They could have just adapted these chapters and called it an ending just fine, but instead, they made a certain scene at Akito's house that adds NOTHING to the story, makes NO SENSE and gives it such a lazy, messy, open ending that I just... *SIGH*It's hard to talk about that garbage without giving any spoilers. SO.What I recommend for new people is: if you want to watch this anime, I suggest you ONLY watch episodes 1~23.

In the episodes without new introductions, there seemed to be some sort of revelation about one of the existing characters. So, you can expect to really become acquainted with each personality without heavy-handedness.Toward the ending, I found that animators becoming a bit more liberal with the random quirky humor thrown in, [mild spoiler] which made the dramatic ending slightly more awkward.

Fantasy shoujo stories surrounded by boys are not uncommon, however this show had a different aura. It wasn't actually a reverse-harem type of anime. While most of the characters were boys Tohru didn't have so many of this type of intimate/romantic scenes with them. Furthermore, what makes the story unique is not the fact that boys transform into animals when they are hugged by someone of the opposite sex but the pressure they receive from their clan and the problems...each one of them faces.

I find this quite sad since I enjoyed a lot of the series, but I can\'t forgive it for certain things that were presented upon the last few episodes.PROSThis anime follows in the footsteps of others, such as Clannad, with its fantastic soundtrack. It\'s actually used quite often throughout the series, but never gets annoying or overplayed. I love it so much that I\'ve actually listened to the soundtrack, multiple times, without the visuals of the anime. It...is extremely enjoyable to the ears.Humor in Fruits Basket is the shows main focus and it works tremendously. The facial expressions and movements of many of the characters will make you fall down laughing with tears at some parts. Perhaps this is thanks to the writer. I was impressed at the infinite number of ways the characters made me laugh.CONSAs much as I loved most of this series, it has downside to it. The show, while funny and joyful for the most part, takes a HUGE turn near the end of the series. All the cute, loveable, and charming episodes that filled most of the series are replaced with a few dark episodes near the end. Obviously, I can\'t say exactly why these episodes are dark, but it is something that should be warned to everyone. I, for one, didn\'t know about this dark turn and had a bit of a problem with it. Soon, though, I was able to accept this turn from a light comedy series to a very dark drama. I can imagine this unexpected dark turn might really throw some viewers off, so be aware of this.With the dark turn that comes in the series comes another dislike I have. Most of Fruits Basket, while having some fantasy elements, is usually taking place in a realistic work (for the most part). Unfortunately, this changes near the end of the series. Certain events happen that make the series go from ""pretty realistic"" to ""completely unrealistic."" Guys who transform into animals from the Chinese Zodiac? I can believe that. A girl who is pretty much a saint? I can believe that. But there\'s no way I am going to believe certain things that happen near the end of this series. I mean, come on! I was hoping that all of the series would stay in the realm of reality, but have some fantasy elements. This all changed as the episodes went on later. I accepted this, in the end, after thinking about it and accepting that the series doesn\'t take place in the real world. Still, I can imagine many viewers will be turned off by the unreal turn the series takes.OVERALLFruits Basket is a series that I loved, for the most part, although I had some problems with it near the end. I think the things that keep it from being bad or good is the phenomenal soundtrack and the great sense of humor used. These two elements are pretty important to me in all anime that I watch, and the fact that Fruits Basket got it right made me very happy. Again, please be aware of the dark turn near the end.

The way that the main character, Tohru, talks to the other characters, the way she helps them get off their feet.

"", ""this is my fav anime and has been since i watched it! it was the second anime show i ever watched and since then i have watched it again 2 more times! love it!story-10as i said loved it! lol i liked the plot about how tohru looses her home and then goes and lives with her class mate yuki who is like the most popular guy in school and then she meets his family and learns the family curse. i know its a bit clique but i just think its amazing!art-9i do like the art a lot but i think the noes's are just a...lil different from the other shows i have watched. other then that i love everything!sound-9i think its great!character-10i love all the characters, like each and every single one of them! even akito!my fav character is still kyo and always will be! in a way he kinda reminds me of my self. i have a terrible temper, accept i dont show it at school as much. and my nickname was always cat! lolenjoyment-10if u cant already see how much i enjoyed this anime, then ur nuts! lolover all-10LOVED IT!! :) lil different from the other shows i have watched. other then that i love everything!sound-9i think its great!character-10i love all the characters, like each and every single one of them! even akito!my fav character is still kyo and always will be! in a way he kinda reminds me of my self. i have a terrible temper, accept i dont show it at school as much. and my nickname was always cat! lolenjoyment-10if u cant already see how much i enjoyed this anime, then ur nuts! lolover all-10LOVED IT!! :)"", ""One of my favorite animes mostly because of the depth of the story. (MINOR SPOILER) ill be honest the ending confused me it was defiantly no the direction i expected and i felt it was almost unnecessary but still enjoyable. (END OF SPOILER) anyways I actually love each character and watching this how honestly inspired me to be a better person.Tohru's 'look on the bright side' attitude really inspires me and how she handles Kyo's anger streak and helps bring Yuki out of his shell. I can honestly say this show has inspired me most out of most any other show (anime and non anime)...that i have seen.Its a nice romantic comedy but it has its dark points too. There are reasons, explained in the story, why each character are the way they are and each are important. that i have seen.Its a nice romantic comedy but it has its dark points too.

It swaps between being a two guys like one girl romance to a slightly surreal family fued situation with dark backgrounding.Like many animes with two love interests though it doesn't finish! which pisses me off to no end.So if you want to see the end and probably a much longer story read...the manga. The anime is still great though. the manga. The anime is still great though."", ""This anime seemed like any other old anime to me.Then, I started watching it, feeling the same feelings the characters did... And even cried!This is a beautiful anime, that will connect with you.I'm so glad I started watching it... "", ""I am gonna write a short review. This is my first review.I don't usually write reviews but i felt compelled to write this one.Fruits Basket, I wanted to like this anime I really did.But it did not do it for me i guess. The art style and music were good but the plot was not executed properly and there was a lot of potential. I don't hate it, i am just disappointed. It felt like Naruto's Talk no Jutsu compressed in 26 episodes. I feel thet for me the ending of the series is crucial and Fruits Basket's ending was Mediocre at best, Nothing...special nothing above a 3 score. Hopefully the newer ones are better. special nothing above a 3 score. Hopefully the newer ones are better."", 'If ever an anime deserved a redo, it would be Fruits Basket. The anime was tragically produced well ahead of the manga being finished, and rather than try to fill some time and extend the series, they simply cut it short before any of what makes Fruits Basket (Manga) an amazing series.On its own, Fruits Basket the anime is just ok. The Animation is basic and the soundtrack is acceptable. Fruits Basket is a story full of rich characters all mixed up in a very complicated and damaged household but you never really get to anything really interesting because of how short the series is....The anime functions as a good introduction to the series proper as it is almost shot for shot a retelling of the first 5 issues.I would avoid the last 2 or 3 episodes of the anime and just jump into the Manga if you want the true potential of this story.

All the characters are lovable. Also, this is a good anime to watch with kids! And we all know how rare those are!I adore how the female lead Tooru (who is recently orphaned) is constantly striving to teach the Souma family the importance of relying on, loving, and caring for one another. The theme of 'the importance of family' is very heavily highlighted throughout the whole show.My only wish for this anime is that they would have made more episodes in order to complete the story within the manga. It leaves off in a...bit of an odd spot and nothing feels concluded.  But it's still good, so watch it! bit of an odd spot and nothing feels concluded.  But it's still good, so watch it!"", ""I want to start this review after finishing the show by saying I fully enjoyed my time. I think shows like Fruits Basket help us understand ourselves better and not quickly jump to judge people for their faults or their ways of life. It can help you grow and also make you understand the value of what you find in your own belonging.The show I do see has a vocal side of people that find it to not match up to the remake, and for this, I don't put too much stock or time in as fans who didn't enjoy this one can have...the remake, while people who enjoy this ride can have both. Honestly, I think it matches fine to the themes of the story in how acceptance and love are more effective than pretending and evading.Fruits Basket is a special show that for it's time I can feel why it cultivated such a positive effect on people, while during the time I was just dipping my toes into anime at the age of 10 with Inuyasha on Adult Swim, I always looked at titles like Fruits Basket being one to keep an eye on, even if the title itself sounded strange to me for an anime.Having now finally watched it, I can safely say I think this is a show that can help a lot of people when they're facing their own struggles. Some might find the story to be a little too easygoing or odd, but when you can become invested in the characters and the world, you find not just a story of easygoing themes, you find a sense of passion for everyday life that the show wants you to take in.Honestly, I can see how Fruits Basket for its time would've been like March Comes in Like a Lion of 2001. It's also a lovely comedy with lots of charm I can see the whole family enjoying it. the remake, while people who enjoy this ride can have both.
