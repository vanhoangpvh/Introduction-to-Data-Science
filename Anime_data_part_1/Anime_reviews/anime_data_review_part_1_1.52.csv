Manga de Wakaru! Fate/Grand Order,https://myanimelist.net/anime/38958/Manga_de_Wakaru_Fate_Grand_Order,"[""Wow. This is truly a masterpiece. I've never seen something so perfect come out of Nasu's work since Carnival Phantasm.Story: The story follows Gudako and friends, and her gacha filled journey through FGO. Following a 4koma format, there's absolutely no flow, but nobody seems to care. Later on, it follows Gudao and his gay adventures with Astolfo. Honestly, nothing could be better.Art: Look at the screenshots. You can see it's just the shitpost that is Learning with Manga, but animated.Sound: Gudako sounds like a demon, but everything else is just a nice performance from the VAs. Mashu ftw.Character: it's got Astolfo. Enough said.Enjoyment:...Only a monster wouldn't enjoy this.Overall: I couldn't understand a word but it was spicy.*It's actually just a normal rating.

This OVA is an animated version of some of the shorts. So that means that they actually did it. The MADMANS did it! They actually give a voice to Gudako!At long last she speaks! The Altera wriggle dance is also animated! THIS IS GOOD CIVILISATION!ok real info time:Story:It's just an compilations of shorts from Learning with Manga in animated form. So don't expect deep character or story.  One minute and you already are to the next short. There is little to no continuity between the shortsArt:The art is...the same you can find in the manga. Nothing out of the ordinary. The caricatural representation of the characters are approriate for a comedy serie. Some times we can have really well detailed shots especiall with the transition images, my favourite one being the one with Jeanne and Tamamo no Mae. I also like the one with Karna, Edison and Arjuna whose style contrast quite heavily with GudakoSound:  The music is good and fits well with the comedic tone of the serie and you can hear the fun the voice actors had portraying the charactersCharacters: Gudako,Gudao,Astolfo, Mash, Altera(just to name a few) and other characters of F/GO are present if their comedic version. Each character as a funny personality even though they are not that. They have funny interactions like Gudako and Mash crazy-senpai/poor little Kouhai the love relationship between Gudao and Astolfo and Gudako trying to convince the gullible Altera that the developpers of the game must be destroyed so she finally have the NP animations skips .Enjoyment: It's always nice to see the manga adapted and fans will be pleased to see their favourite characters given voice, especially the one and only Gudako. Learning with Manga is pretty much a Fate/Grand Order memes compilation. I had a dumb smile on my face all the way throughOverallJust a bunch of gags. If you are not familiar with Fate/Grand Order you will probably not enjoy this show as you will not get the jokes. You don't need other knowledge of the Nasu-verse to enjoy this show as the original goal of Learning with Manga was mostly to explain some game mechanics in a funny and more original way than what the ingame tutorials provides you.If you like F/GO memes checkout this one the same you can find in the manga.

Celebrating a brand new year, type-moon was ready to unleash hell for us Fate fans, and they truly did.Story: The story partakes the adventure of Gudako and her hellish adventures with her servants, now the story truly deserves a 10/10, having every ingredient you need for an amazing story, fan service, comedy, amazing fight scenes and most importantly the power of bonds, they teach us an amazing lesson of what a strong bond can do. Take for example the bond between Gudako and Mashu, in this special, they truly show us...what an amazing bond between servant and master can bring, it brings tears to my eyes.Art: Now the art of this show reminds me of a higher budget PopTeamEpic, I do very much like this art for what it is, I\'ve always been a fan of the Fate GO manga so it was very pleasant on my eyes to see it animated. I really love the quirkiness of the animation, like when Gudako tried ""Molesting"" Mashu while she was using the VR set, the way her head would move, snuggling onto Mashui, was an amazing example of what good animation can do. Truly a 10/10 animation.Sound: I love hearing my favorite servants talk a bring my down to a eargasm, and now with the addition of Gudako\'s voice, it really makes this special, very special to my heart. I always expected Gudako to have the demonic voice that we needed and this VA truly brought us what type of person Gudako is. A demon. 10/10Character: Now the characters are the most important things about Fate in general, it\'s very nice to see Mashu, Jeanne, Tamamo, etc, in this special, they\'re all waifus (including Gudako) and without their quirky personalities this just wouldn\'t be as amazing, so thank you Type-Moon, for bringing these characters to this special. 10/10Enjoyment: My new years truly wasn\'t the best one\'s I\'ve had, but watching this 14:39 minute long special really brought a smile to my face. I can feel every pain in my body melt away with every second I watched of this show, the last time I felt so blessed was when I was punching my hand to the beat of Precure, and the fact I didn\'t even have to injure myself to feel all the negatives be blown away, I truly love this. 10/10Overall: This is a great way to conclude 2018, and I truly recommend any fan of Fate to grab your cups of milk and watch this. what an amazing bond between servant and master can bring, it brings tears to my eyes.Art: Now the art of this show reminds me of a higher budget PopTeamEpic, I do very much like this art for what it is, I\'ve always been a fan of the Fate GO manga so it was very pleasant on my eyes to see it animated.

Fate Grand Order was probably the reason I question my homosexuality. Astolfo is hot but I don't think I'm gay.Story: 10/10 - absolutely amazing. I got to see Gudako have spasms and become delirious over gacha and my favorite trap basically being complimented on how cute he is.Art: 10/10 - it's the same thing as the manga version but that's what makes it amazing. Astolfo is adorable in any style.Sound: 10/10 - When Gudao moaned(?), I felt that.. It was as if I heard that noise in real life. Don't underestimate the power of traps everyone.Character: 10/10...- we got to see Astolfo and his gay relationship with gudao.. That's all the characters we need.Enjoyment: 12/10 - Everyday I look for more astolfo to refill my gay. This one small special helped me stop drinking a depresso and I really enjoyed it.Overall 10/10 - words cannot describe this masterpiece as a whole. - we got to see Astolfo and his gay relationship with gudao..

Osomatsu-san 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35067/Osomatsu-san_2nd_Season,"[""This season of Osomatsu has been, to say the least, really disappointing.As a fan of the first one, I was really excited to see what the sextuplets had in store for us, but it turns out that the spark of irreverent and acid humor that made the first season so good was completely gone.Instead, this season relies more on self referential humor, skits that drag for too long and some really poorly executed emotional moments. It feels like, instead of trying to make a funny show like they did before, they already knew no matter what they did, it was going to be...successful because of the die hard fujoshi fanbase, thus relaying to much on pandering to them giving us more of pointless skits to feed the shippers.I know some people will definitely enjoy that, and that's fine, but it is obvious that the current season hasn't reached the same level of success or audience that its predecessor. It seems that the die hard fanbase was not that big, and that it was a mistake trying to make this for them exclusively.So, in short. Osomatsu S2 is a unfunny, bland and boring version of the first season. Not really worth watching if you're trying to get more of what Osomasu San. successful because of the die hard fujoshi fanbase, thus relaying to much on pandering to them giving us more of pointless skits to feed the shippers.I know some people will definitely enjoy that, and that's fine, but it is obvious that the current season hasn't reached the same level of success or audience that its predecessor.

There are very few comedy anime out there that doesn't get old and always come with something new with very effective jokes, then there are those that gets old pretty fast. Osomatsu-San First season were crazy, stupid and very colorful. It had an unique essence on them while being a fun ride from start to finish. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for this second season.Act 1: You tell a great joke, people laugh, profitAct 2: You tell the same joke, some people laugh, some people don't, profitAct 3: You tell...the same joke again, very few laugh, the rest doesn'tAct 4: You still tell the same joke, No one laughs.There are many comedy anime that destroys itself by overusing jokes, and this second season is no exception.If you have watched the first season, then you might now what is this about, Sextuplets making comic gags while they suck at life (neets). While most of the comic gags on this second season are new, not all of them are funny, and those that are funny gets old pretty fast because it tends to be overused in the same episode. Story: 4/10Art and Sound are probably the best things of this show,Their Openings and Endings are pretty colorful and well done. There are some episodes that completely change the setting which leads to the very best episode of this second season: Episode 18. This episode features Iyami as a good for nothing bum who is hated by almost everyone on town, but one day he meets a little blind girl who is selling flowers on the street. This episode is beautiful in many ways, it starts out with a smooth monochrome palette. This feature alone holds a lot of meanings for this story, the soundtrack is a really great addition to the story, as it holds what this episode wants to express. Later on, the color palette comes in with a colorful world with a very emotional soundtrack that might end with a smile on your face as tears starts falling down. This were the point where I thought that this second season wasn't a mistake at all. Art: 7/10 | Sound: 8/10The cast is almost the same as the first season with the addition of odd fellows that are introduced later on, if the sketch demands it, the characters might not follow their usual behavior, but other than that, the characters end up being the same as how they were in season 1.

But with every new episode, it felt like something was lacking, like something from season one was lost.To start with, the move from two or more ""scenarios"" per episode to episode-length ""scenarios"" feels like a misstep. With season one, sketches never became too tedious (outside of fan-least-favorites like F6) because of the fact that they were not the length of the entire episode. When a sketch ended, it felt like it was because the premise has...been exhausted and the show can now move on to something else.By having entire episodes dedicated to one sketch, some flaws that were in the writing previously become much more evident, and things become a lot more tedious. It wasn\'t until season 2 that I realized that whenever a joke was made about one Matsuno, a similar joke had to be made about every other brother before the show could move on. If this happened before, it became very obvious now, and if I didn\'t think a joke was funny once, it certainly wouldn\'t become funny after hearing it five more times.Even episodes with more than one sketch had a similar feeling of tediousness, that the joke was simply going on way longer than it needed to go. The sketch involving Choromatsu and Ichimatsu had a promising premise, but at some point the one joke that the sketch, that they are uncomfortable being alone around each other, was just being repeated over and over again by the end. Maybe this aspect of the show has always been here, but if that\'s the case then it only got worst.Another complaint I have is that the show at times feels like it is resting on its laurels when it comes to episode scenarios compared to season one. It often relies on interaction between the brothers to be enough for a sketch, when season one offered a lot more than that. Season one utilized the side characters very well, especially Chibita, and in this season, while he still is a great character, side characters were relegated to being vehicles for more inter-Matsuno banter and one-liners. There was no ""Iyami\'s Counterattack"" this season, no ""The Karamatsu Incident"", no ""Jyushimatsu Festival"".If there\'s one thing the show does right, is that it actually manages to provide some good characterization for the sextuplets. For one thing, Karamatsu has actually become more self-assured in terms of not becoming the punching bag for the other five, often being allowed to get in his own insults and comments. But we also see his insecurity towards needing to do everything for his brothers in order to feel validation. Osomatsu is also given some much needed depth in the second to last episode, an aspect of his character that has been hinted at before but never completely explored until then, and the episode right after doesn\'t immediately erase all of it! These characters are very easy to turn into vapid stereotypes of their actual personalities, and there are instances where that does feel like the case, but more often than not they are consistently written with care, or at least as much care an irreverent sketch comedy show could have.That\'s what keeps the show watchable for me: it still cares. Episodes like ""Iyami in the Wind"" and the two final episodes show that despite how flippant, bitter, and absurd the show is at times, there is something very genuine at the center of it, keeping the tradition of the 1988 series alive (and perhaps the writing of the original manga as well, although I have not read any of it so I cannot say for sure). Maybe the writing quality has been worsening, but I can tell that no one has given up, which gives me hope that if there is a third season, perhaps the writing staff could fix their flaws and create something as good as what I remember season one being. been exhausted and the show can now move on to something else.By having entire episodes dedicated to one sketch, some flaws that were in the writing previously become much more evident, and things become a lot more tedious.

All of those dumb fangirls in episode 1...

It may still be considered stellar in Japan, but since I don't see it from a nostalgic point of view I just see how it is in comparison to season one.

This review was written at the conclusion of cour 1 and only accounts for the first 13 episodes.)TL;DR Review: If you\'re a fan of season one, you\'ll probably like it. It\'s like season one cour 2 but a bit more dull and toothless.This review largely focuses on the flaws with the show\'s structure, characterization and comedic style, so let me get a few of the other considerations out of the way: The art is extremely polished compared to most of season one. It has the same great ska and...jazz influenced soundtrack of season one with a charming, catchy OP and ED.Season two starts off strong with a meta episode that reflects the now banned original first episode of season one. It\'s approximately 12 minutes of relentlessly reaming its own fanbase followed by approximately 12 minutes of a funny, well-executed mashup skit.Despite the strong start, from that point onward, episodes are largely hit or miss. This is not to suggest that there aren\'t sketches that are \'misses\' in season one, only that there is a very distinct sense that there are more in season two. In my mind, the reasons are threefold:First, gags that are actually kind of funny in their own right are spoiled by being dragged out far too long. Ideas that would be better served as 2-3 minute sketches are given as much as an entire half episode and quickly become repetitive, stale and even annoying. ""Totoko\'s Challenge"", ""Sangokushi-san"", ""Synthesis"", ""Arcade Iyami"", ""New Employee Totoko"" and ""Give Them Back"" being among the worst offenders. When will Matsubara and co realize that literally nobody wants more Dekapan/Dayon skits, especially ones with little to no dialog?Second, characters are, for the most part, absolutely glued to their respective roles and almost flanderized by their own show. It\'s not so much that we\'re already familiar with them after season one, but it\'s that the characters rarely seem to step outside of their 2-3 assigned personality traits and surprise us. Jyushimatsu says \'boeh\' a lot and harps on about baseball even though his whole stick is that he\'s meant to be incomprehensible and unpredictable - even his ""trademark"" slapstick humor is mysteriously absent most of the time. Choromatsu and Todomatsu are there to be tsukkomi and deliver retorts and call other characters stupid. Osomatsu is there to be an oaf and a shithead. Karamatsu is there to be \'painful\' and raise Ichimatsu\'s ire, although he\'s much more assertive and funny compared to season one (but also has significantly less screen-time: the least of any Matsu in S2). Ichimatsu is there to say something pessimistic and occasionally be surprisingly moe, though he seems to have more going for him than just ""cats"" this season.Finally, the shameless recycling of season one jokes, one of the show\'s greatest sins in my view. Lightning doesn\'t strike twice. ""Fappymatsu"" was a funny and appropriate nickname in the episode it came from. It was funny when the brothers brought it back once or twice to tease him and reference continuity. It\'s not funny the hundredth time. Todomatsu\'s straining face from ""Todomatsu and the Five Demons"" (Tottyface) was hilarious in its original context, now it makes an appearance in almost every other episode (and countless official art and merchandise). Between this and the problem of gags wearing on too long, it\'s almost as if half of the show\'s comedic philosophy is ""if it\'s funny the first time, surely it\'s just as funny the twentieth time, right?"" (the other half being heavy reliance on the boke/tsukkomi routine, though I realize this is just a purely subjective criticism of Japanese-style humor as a whole).Here\'s to hoping that cour 2 steps up its game. jazz influenced soundtrack of season one with a charming, catchy OP and ED.Season two starts off strong with a meta episode that reflects the now banned original first episode of season one.

Karamatsu is there to be \'painful\' and raise Ichimatsu\'s ire, although he\'s much more assertive and funny compared to season one (but also has significantly less screen-time: the least of any Matsu in S2). Ichimatsu is there to say something pessimistic and occasionally be surprisingly moe, though he seems to have more going for him than just ""cats"" this season.Finally, the shameless recycling of season one jokes, one of the show\'s greatest sins in my view. Lightning doesn\'t strike twice. ""Fappymatsu"" was a funny and appropriate nickname in the episode it came from. It was funny when the brothers brought it back once or twice to tease him and reference continuity. It\'s not funny the hundredth time. Todomatsu\'s straining face from ""Todomatsu and the Five Demons"" (Tottyface) was hilarious in its original context, now it makes an appearance in almost every other episode (and countless official art and merchandise). Between this and the problem of gags wearing on too long, it\'s almost as if half of the show\'s comedic philosophy is ""if it\'s funny the first time, surely it\'s just as funny the twentieth time, right?"" (the other half being heavy reliance on the boke/tsukkomi routine, though I realize this is just a purely subjective criticism of Japanese-style humor as a whole).Here\'s to hoping that cour 2 steps up its game.', 'based from the other reviews i can really see why some have been disappointed (some of the spark did left). for me though the feeling was neutral. After all i really like the fact that other characters especially karamatsu gets more screen time and story revolving around him. I also get to know the characters more. Also, for some reason i liked this season more than the 1st one. Although i have to admit that a lot of fans prefer the 1st. Its just that this season gave more relevance to the characters imo. And the animation certainly upgraded. All in all im just thankful...that my favorite matsus are back with their professional voice actors that never ceases to amaze with how they deliver the comedy, Flaw and inferior as it is i just missed my babies and am glad theyre back with their shitty skits. Why would i ask for more, i just want to enjoy the show as it is.

After watching season 1 and doing a deep dive after neary 3 years it offers nothing new or fresh.From the first episode we can already tell writes no longer want to risk it for humor and just stick to the same comfortable corner so to say, comparing to the first season humor was fresh it wasnt afraid to showing supershort skits and doing incredibly weird funny stories. This one has unmemorable stories which are mostly weird and rarely super unfunny, i can count on my fingers how many funny stories there been in season 2, while season 1 was so incredibly good that...every episode was a huge rooler coaster of fun.I think this sums up everything from season 2.Being a fan of season 1 i will cherish with critizing in hoping it will still get aseason 3 but until then season 2 is bland as heck. every episode was a huge rooler coaster of fun.I think this sums up everything from season 2.Being a fan of season 1 i will cherish with critizing in hoping it will still get aseason 3 but until then season 2 is bland as heck.', ""I'll keep this brief, as I wrote a full review of Osomatsu-san - Season 1 which you can find on my profile.After watching Season 1 of Osomatsu-san one gains a level of familiarity with what the anime is all about, making it easier to enjoy the stories/gags of Season 2 because one knows what they are in for.This season of Osomatsu-san continues to provide richly creative stories/gags and a bit more insight into the minds/characters of each individual sextuplet.The stories/gags continue to be funny and somewhat insightful. While not always laugh-out-loud funny, they can be enjoyed simply for the creativity behind the writing and voice-acting.The...OP and ED continue to be wonderfully creative and enjoyable, too.Overall, I think this season deserves a consistent if not higher score than the previous season.

The general flow of the episodes were also similar, in a sense that it was boring.The only reason why I continued this season is because of my emotional attachment with...the characters, mainly due to the first season and to the godly fanarts that I see on Pinterest and Twitter.Therefore, those who don't have any sort of attachment to the characters would definitely find it boring and unappealing as I can't imagine anyone actually finding the jokes funny. the characters, mainly due to the first season and to the godly fanarts that I see on Pinterest and Twitter.Therefore, those who don't have any sort of attachment to the characters would definitely find it boring and unappealing as I can't imagine anyone actually finding the jokes funny."", 'Season 2 strikes a different chord than season 1. While the first season had a nice atmosphere and hilarious gags sprinkled throughout, it also knew how to retain itself and pull back for serious moments. Season 2 definitely does not disappoint in this regard, but it doesn\'t hit in quite the same way.My biggest gripe with this season is with the first third or so. Those episodes had the worst gags - and I mean the WORST - that I have seen in the show so far. I understand that part of the humor of the sextuplets is that they\'re NEETs and virgins, but I...really felt like some of the sex/scat/etc. jokes were just going too far. And this is coming from someone who can really appreciate a drag show or otherwise scandalous humor. It just was starting to become really obnoxious and frame some of the characters in such a negative way that I felt like they were becoming sexual predators. The episode with Todomatsu and Osomatsu on the double date comes to mind. Osomatsu was absolutely horrid and while I know that that was the point, it started to feel more ""actually creepy"" than ""socially awkward.""Despite this, this season also had some of the BEST episodes so far, which really gave me whiplash. Iyami really shined in the last half of the season and the season finale was miles better than season one\'s, which I was honestly pretty disappointed with. So overall, I think that the show ranks a 7 for me. Still really funny and some great characters (Totoko and Chibita also had some good episodes and gags with the other side chars) but season 2 was just so disgusting and bizarre with its back and forth in a way that the first season was a little more careful with.I really do hope that the maturity is retained and that I actually get to see some more growth from the characters. It does feel kind of annoying when they ""learn a lesson"" in an episode and then never actually continue with the morals past the one gag. really felt like some of the sex/scat/etc. jokes were just going too far.

With less focus on any kind of set up or punchline the humour almost entirely consists of gross-out humour, lol funny random humour or just downright tedious, drawn out jokes that quickly overstay their welcome. What should last 15 seconds at most can last up to 2 minutes at times and honestly some scenes feel like they're drawn out to half the episode length because they either ran out of ideas or just got lazy. This is not what I watched the show for. The first season...did have its moments of gross or dirty humour, but it was never done in such an over the top, obnoxious way. There's also all these weird skits with the brothers in different eras or fictional scenarios which I just can't stand. The joke is almost always ''haha look, the dumb Osomatsu brothers are in _____ era, isn't that funny guys?'' but there's no real joke behind any of it. Really disappointed as the first season was good enough to be one of my favourite anime seasons ever, and it really could get me laughing at times. Don't get me wrong, Season 1 was pretty dumb too but at least the jokes were funny. I think I chuckled, once, at this one.

Master Keaton,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1483/Master_Keaton,"['“The master of life always lives his destiny as he chooses...”Ex-SAS, Archeologist, part time lecturer, traveler, historian, Insurance agent; Taichi Hiragi Keaton is a Jack of all trades and a “master of life”. He is simple, intelligent, humble, and a moralistic goody-two shoes infused with the love of life and the possibilities it brings.The show itself is an exact mirror reflection of its main character; a “Jack-of-all-trades” in that it touches a wide variety of genres and themes, from slice-of-life, romance, mystery to historical, war drama, thriller. It dips into almost everything an anime of its premise possibly can. And the result is...a  flawed masterpiece packed with enough surprises to make it an easy recommend for old-school anime fans.For people who are on a lookout for episodic shows that are relaxing and can be watched slowly over time, Master Keaton could be a good choice. But the show can appear to be a bit too bland or simplistic for some, especially anime fans who prefer currently airing or recent anime; the reason for that is that Master Keaton is an old school “realistic” seinen, a genre that is largely ignored by a majority of anime viewers, and its animation is barely decent, even for an anime of its time. The show also lacks the bombast or extravagance of recent anime, which could be a good or a bad thing depending on what kind of a viewer you are.On a related point, some of the sensibilities the show displays are quite simple at times, such as the mostly black-and-white morality, or the importance of bonds or friendship (a favorite theme in anime), or the single dimensional personalities of some supporting characters, but these characteristics are more preference based rather than something that could be singled out as a flaw; indeed, these “sensibilities” are a part of the show’s personality and make thematic sense, despite the fact that they result in simplistic cliche\'s at times.On the flip side the anime is quite intelligent, in a sense that it is set in a real world setting, though stylized to suit the anime medium, and grapples with story concepts that haven’t been seen in any anime. Despite some episodes being predictable, and a few bearing clichés, most of the stories are very engaging. In fact, there are at least a handful of stories that I can safely say are among the most unique and well written in any medium of entertainment, and the show is well worth the watch for these few episodes alone.Its greatest strength, though, is its simple yet charming personality, and the staggering variety of stories that it tells. The writers have made excellent use of the standalone format to give some of the best variety in episodic anime/manga yet.For instance, in one episode we see Keaton in Burgandy as an insurance agent to investigate one of the most expensive wine bottles in the world, and in the next he is escorting a fugitive through swamps while his criminal buddies attempt to rescue their leader from his clutches. Another episode sees him deep in the mountains of Spain being hunted by a highly trained K9. And in yet another episode we see him spending summer vacations in Japan with his dysfunctional family.Any other show with such a variety would either fall from the burden of its own elephantine ambition, or succumb to acute schizophrenia. But not so Master Keaton. Its stories are never convoluted or over-ambitious, and it never forgets its identity. Diversity may be the key here, but the aesthetic values remain the same.In the sound department, the use of music is not always perfect but it’s quite fitting. The overall OST is among the more memorable ones I have heard yet and suits the series perfectly. The dub version does a good job of making the anime feel “global”, as different characters have accents that correspond to their backgrounds, which obviously could not have been done in Japanese. But the English VA direction falters at times, and the overall delivery is not always convincing. The Japanese voice acting, by contrast, is pretty solid.Lacking in budget, the animation is not as great as some anime from the same period, but it is very much passable. The basic art style is very similar to Monster, which is not the only solid proof of Naoki Urasawa’s involvement in the project. The anime has a strong European feel to it, as the stories take place all over the world, especially that particular part. The art style, music and writing suits this well, and helps create the right European feel, without sacrificing the anime-specific elements.Despite the flaws, ""Master Keaton"" delivers something unique that you will not find anywhere in the medium. Its niche oriented content might drive away some people, but its worth checking out for fans of 90s anime and episodic shows, and anime fans who are looking for stories that are more grounded in the world we actually live in. a  flawed masterpiece packed with enough surprises to make it an easy recommend for old-school anime fans.For people who are on a lookout for episodic shows that are relaxing and can be watched slowly over time, Master Keaton could be a good choice.

It is hard to say what genre the shows is because it is almost everything. But is variety by itself enough?Master Keaton's greatest asset is its variety. One episode it is a mystery, the next it is an action show, and the one after that it is a slice of life. The show really does end up getting it fingers in to almost every genre there is. To go along with the different genre, the show is in a different place every episode. In the rice patties of...Japan and then in the hills of Scotland. Walking into the beginning of every episode and not knowing exactly what to expect is probably my favorite part.Unfortunately as much as variety is the show's greatest strength it is also its greatest weakness. Any RPG player can tell you a jack of all trades is a master of none. The show ends up falling into that same problem. I wouldn't say that the show does anything down right poorly but it definitely doesn't do anything extremely well.Mr. Keaton himself is kind of a James Bond meets MacGyver except he is really dorky. He plays the buffoon and no one ever really expects him to be good at anything until he makes his move and it is too late. Keaton has basically had every job in existence. I really like how the show handled Keaton's past. The show gives you little bits of information here and there; in almost every episode there is something new introduced about Keaton. It could be something important and explored the whole episode, or it could just end up being a few lines where one more job is added to his already long resume. Most of the other characters are only one episode characters. There are a few recurring characters, like Yuriko his daughter and Daniel O'Connell a friend of his. But even these characters only get a few episodes. I think all the characters are likable and well done for the time given to them but not a whole lot is done with any of them.The animation is kind of interesting in that it looks older then what it is. The show came out in 1998 but I would have guess the early 90's to maybe even little earlier. I don't mean to saying the animation is poor, it just seems that art style is from a earlier era. Characters in the background tend not to be draw as well. It also has a more realistic looking than most anime but at the same time it is just cartoony enough to not look overly realistic either.The quality varies a little episode to episode and it false to do anything particularly well. On the other hand it has great variety and I really enjoyed the lead character. Master Keaton didn't exactly WOW me but I could see someone else falling it love with it.

Due to its episodic nature, it lacks a great plotline and significant character growth. But this does not make Keaton a dull anime, because of the fact that the original creator pours his vast knowledge of European history into the work and creates something interesting in every episode.The story feels like the creator really loved history and countries of Europe and wanted to make a story to share his knowledge. Because of that the story though not great is kind of encyclopedic. Some episodes can be easily incorporated into...the great anime Monster. Main characters of both anime wander mainly in different parts of Europe (although for different reasons).Characters are enjoyable. Majority of them appear in one or two episodes, and although they are not impressive, all secure their distinct places. Maybe more important, the story and characters excellently merge together, which in return guarantees better enjoyment. Moreover, the viewer learns something new in every episode. That is the main reason I enjoyed this anime. Each character's life is related to some real historic events, and they brilliantly fit together. The main character, Taichi Keaton, has impressive skills. He is an archeologist and war veteran. He travels solving mysteries all around the world. He is likable but not memorable. He is dull. Many times he plays the role of catalyst in bringing characters together and relating their history/story.Story and interesting facts are the main selling points of the anime. Animation and sound quality isn’t impressive. First of all, this is an old anime. But even in its own time there were a lot of anime with better animation than Master Keaton. Music is fine. You may not remember after finishing it, but while watching I listened opening and ending in every episode.Overall Master Keaton is a good anime.

This series accomplishes something that most of today\'s long running anime/tv series can\'t even accomplish, in only 20 minutes of screen-time i.e. making you care for the characters.I didn\'t care much about the plot in Master Keaton. I was too busy feeling for the characters. Most of the stories in the episodes were based on some historical events, myths or some classical like poisoning in Shakespeare\'s Hamlet.The...episodes are arbitrary like in one episode Keaton helps a German businessman to locate his long-lost daughter, in the next one we meet an old lady looking for her childhood love in some foreign land, and in another we get to see Keaton\'s past.I do have to say that some episodes are kinda predictable mostly in the second season. But who cares about the story when you have such great cast. Modern anime try really hard to be over-convoluted just to look cool but characters remain ""shallow"" as ever e.g. FMAB. On the other hand, Master Keaton is simple and therefore drama feels so realistic even in obviously predictable episodes.Keaton is ethical who even sometimes helps people outside of his job and seems unrealistically perfect at first glance but later we see that he has his family issues, he is not socially well-off, he has no stable job and he is quite indecisive of what he wants to do with his life as an archaeologist and is not satisfied. He is only professional as an SAS agent and ends up saving the day because of his qualifications. He learned history, served army, taken survival courses so no doubt he is perceptive, strong, dependable. But there a few ass-pulls here and there. But like I said before, our main character for every episode is different and we care about that character even more than Keaton at the end of the day.The animation and music are brilliant. Naoki Urasawa\'s art is undoubtedly one of the best. The character designs are so realistic and the art really fits the atmosphere like in Monster. I highly recommend you to watch it in dubbed as it takes place in Europe. English voice actors did a great job and they even used different european accents for different countries, really well done.Master Keaton is serious, mature and at the same time lighthearted and optimistic and has realistic characters full of depth which modern anime lack.

English voice actors did a great job and they even used different european accents for different countries, really well done.Master Keaton is serious, mature and at the same time lighthearted and optimistic and has realistic characters full of depth which modern anime lack. So underrated... it deserves so much more...', ""Master Keaton in my humble opinion is the best Episodic anime I've seen so far. Though I can admit it's not for everyone since this series requires you to have an understanding of contemporary history. The series touches subjects on the Cold War and many Geopolitical conflicts from the era.The story follows Taichi Keaton, who is a veteran of the Falkland's War and a former SAS officer in the British Army. His combat training and survival skills help him land a job as an insurance investigator from a prestigious agency known as Loyd's of London. This line of work takes him in some...of the most peculiar places and situations. Keaton travels to different cities in Europe, the middles east and even the desserts of China trying to solve insurance claims on inheritance, businesses and expensive items belonging to some of the elite members of society. These investigations often put his life at risk, where Keaton deals with Russian Mobsters and former KGB agents, deals with thieves and professional hitmen.Each episode brings a new story and new characters that are very interesting, I only wish some of those stories could have been a bit longer but other than that they are very enjoyable.Love how Keaton is a badass and yet very average, divorced middle aged man with a teenage daughter. the way he looks just screams average at best, yet in reality he is a professional in his line of work.The art in this anime is immaculate and can see the 90s era portrayed really well in this series. Keaton is a man full of class and the series shows appreciation to the finer things in life.Don't skip this hidden gem, you'll definitely love it. of the most peculiar places and situations.

Highly recommended for people who are searching for traveling series based in Europe with Slice of Life, Naoki Urasawa is a great writer. The exploration of the outside world in those 90s feels gives really good vibes.Animation was not extraordinary, but everything was moving in sync; the background was the most detailed and beautifully done; it wasn't looking flat like how some of today's anime looks; it really breathed life to the anime; there were some sakuga moments as in character animation; and lastly, there were no CGI cars, and they were animated perfectly.The thing I most loved was its sound...design. It was good that you could hear more natural sounds compared to today's sounds, like glass being put down on a wooden countertop, which sounds more realistic.I'll highly recommend it; it's a good watch, especially the dub, which sounds even better. design.

The titular Keaton is a half-Japanese, half-British investigator for the real-life Lloyd's of London, an unorthodox insurance company that works more like a betting house. Each chapter, which is largely self-contained, takes Keaton to various places (mostly in Western Europe) where he becomes entangled in criminal operations, suspicious murders, scholarly matters, and--sometimes--more lighthearted family affairs. The show's pacing and subject matter somewhat bring to mind American detective shows like Columbo: Keaton is intelligent, resourceful, and combat-proficient, though it's his deep well of knowledge which typically provides a solution to...the matter at hand.Urasawa's charming character designs and generally understated presentation are competently brought to life in this anime, though most scenes feel directly taken from manga panels, often lacking dramatic flair or inventiveness. Every episode directly or indirectly helps flesh out Keaton's character: as a failed husband, an absent father, an ex-military agent, an aspiring archaeologist, or just a man of the world. However, and despite the grim subject matter of most episodes, things are kept relatively light by Keaton's easygoing demeanor and an atmospheric, Celtic folk-inspired soundtrack.Ultimately, Keaton can sometimes feel like a crash course in European and 20th-century history, as every single episode provides interesting tidbits on everything from the War of the Roses to the paintings of Degas to the inner workings of a rifle. While the plotting of each episode--whether it deals with a murdered heiress or with Keaton's plucky teenage daughter--is solid, the writing is often trite and heavy-handed, feeling like an expository lesson on whatever academic subject is relevant to the episode. The best stretch of this show deals with Keaton's family life and past, which provides a respite from the somewhat repetitive cloak-and-dagger fare of other episodes. Don't expect any sort of conclusion to the story, as it simply trails off wherever it stopped adapting manga chapters. Nonetheless, in a landscape of harem shows and shounen spin-offs, Keaton can be an enjoyably adult-feeling series. the matter at hand.Urasawa's charming character designs and generally understated presentation are competently brought to life in this anime, though most scenes feel directly taken from manga panels, often lacking dramatic flair or inventiveness.

As a medium anime has a lot of genres and art styles. The plethora of opportunities also makes it that much harder to find something interesting that is not the popular Shonen battles series.Every season of anime brings with it a lot of shows to watch. With so much shit coming out every year it can be hard to go back to the endless backlog of anime. How can I know what anime is worth watching? What makes it good? And what should I prioritize?It can indeed be hard to find new stuff, so what I...am going to do is use my anime knowledge to highlight shows or Movies I feel have gone under the radar. Since anime have so many different elements and styles to them I am convinced I can recommend something to someone and they will end up liking it.Todays anime is called Master KeatonMaster Keaton is an anime made by Madhouse. The show is about Taichi Keaton, an insurance agent who solves a variety of different cases. While the initial premise might sound boring I can assure you that it's not.Master Keaton is an episodic series with a new story being told in every episode. There is no overarching plot and only a few characters return throughout.The manga was written by kkkkk the same guy who did 21st century boys and Monster. The style is the same with a focus on more “human” features rather than the classic big eyes and spiky hair anime usually use. This makes for a more serious show. There are no grant power-ups and while there sometimes are exciting action sequences and fights they tend to be more realistic and not so flashy.The anime is not as serious as Monster with a lot of jokes. Some episodes are more serious than others, but some are just a fun time. One of the strengths of an episodic narrative is that it makes for different feels and moods.The stories in the show vary greatly. One time Keaton is making his way through a snowstorm with an old man claiming to be immortal. The old man tells strange stories that seem fictional but just might have something more to them. In another episode Keaton is helping someone find a terrorist and in another, he negotiates a hostage situation. All the episodes have great variety and something new and interesting is bound to happen. I watched every episode with a sense of “I wonder what Keaton is up to now”.Anime has a problem where the protagonist is often the weakest link. Countless subreddits and forum posts have been used to recommend anime with a strong protagonist.Master Keaton's biggest strength is the main guy himself. Taichi Keaton is a wonderful protagonist and one of the best in anime history. A common problem with protagonists today is that they are way too stoic, overpowered, and humorless. Well, Keaton is none of those things.Taichi Keaton is extremely competent when it comes to his job. He has a wide-spanning knowledge, but it comes off as endearing and nerdy (in a good way). He is also very lighthearted and sees the good in everything and everyone. Other characters call him naive and make fun of him, but eventually, they fall for his charming personality. In today's world that seems so bleak and hopeless it would be great if more people were like Taichi. A little less cynicism and more optimism.Taichi Keaton also has the right amount of mystery to him. His background is extensive, he is both a former archaeologist and also former SAS special forces. His backstory is only shown in pieces leaving out a clear picture. This further enhances the intrigue and makes you want to see more episodes.When he fights he doesn't just beat people with sheer power, he outsmarts them and sometimes even loses. The invincible protagonist is a tedious trope IMO and Keaton avoids this trap by relying on his intuition and wid.ConclusionIf you are interested in a more serious and adult-led anime with a great variety of stories and an amazing protagonist then look no further.

Persona 3 the Movie 2: Midsummer Knight's Dream,https://myanimelist.net/anime/21473/Persona_3_the_Movie_2__Midsummer_Knights_Dream,"[""Memento Mori- Remember your mortality.Memento Mori is Persona 3's motto. (Which is a game I adored and replayed countless times) There's nothing special about it; we are all destined to die, some die earlier than others, some die more suddenly than others. In the end, we all die.The question is, what happens when we forget that we do die? What would happen to a person's sense of reality when they forget the fact that they will die?The answer which I learned by watching this movie: you begin to dream. You begin dreaming a nice pleasant oblivious dream. Your sense of reality would be distorted, not...abiding by the rules of the world and reality that revolves around you. And when you wake up, reality would be so far away that it would be impossible to catch up.(Just as heads up, I gave this movie a perfect 10/10 in everything. I know I might be exaggerating and overrating it, but please, take the time to read my reasons and I hope you agree along.)A quick summary about this movie; SEES has found a way to erase the Dark Hour for good. Unfortunately, a clear objective always have obstacles. Strega, a three-people group of persona-users opposes to SEES's objective, creating a clash between characters. That's not all, as the story progresses, the team begins to create their own problems. Yuki faces a predicament against himself and two members of the team conflict that completely changes the course of the story into a more dark, serious story. But the main summary points aren't the reason why the story in Persona 3- Midsummer Knight's Dream deserves a 10/10. The reason is simple. The story is flawless. Reason, logic, motivation, pace, balance, everything that creates a flawless story line was incorporated within this movie. The movie balanced the humor and leisure of summertime with the dark reality hidden behind the shadows. The motivation and reason behind specific characters are not only well presented through their actions and words but also perfectly understandable and for some of you, are able to sympathize alongside them. The pace was very smooth and felt just like a jog down the park. It gave us time to ponder thoughts  and opinions about the characters which I found to be very considerate since a lot of character development is displayed in this movie. For the reason Persona 3- Midsummer Knights Dream utilized comprehensible logic, reason, gentle pace, and perfect balance, I think the story deserves a 10/10, seeing how it has a flawless, clean story.Having played the Persona 3/FES personally and watched the poorly animated shows of Persona 4, I was surprised how much quality was applied to the first movie, Spring of Birth, but I completely dropped my jaw when I watched Misummer Knight's Dream. THE ART IS BEAUTIFUL. Everything is so polished, shiny, colorful, and the designs of Shadows, characters, location, and personas were so well drawn and animated. (Mitsuru's expression when she summons her persona in the first fight scene made me jizz my pants... So bloody epic.) I never saw a moment where the art felt odd or the animation didn't make any sense. If you watch the movie closely, you could see that even the background details are animated just as well as the front. The battle scenes are very well drawn and planned, especially considering how limited the Shadow's actions was in the game, what Midsummer Knight's Dream showed was really new and even breathtaking for those who played the game. (NOTE: Do not use Orgia mode during boss battles... Aigis doesn't go OP like in the movie. The overheat is long, and she doesn't have good attack stats and skills in the first place... ㅡ.ㅡ)  In any case, because the art is polished and innovative yet nostalgic to Persona 3 players, I gave the Art 10/10. (AIGIS IS SO CUTE AND BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!! GAHHHHH ASJDFLEALDKF~)Ahem.... Moving on to sound. I have a lot to talk about sound. First, I should let everyone know that the music composer is Shoji Meguro. If you do not know this name, I am sorry, but really... You're missing out... I have watched this man present music so fitting, so harmonizing along whatever is going on, be it a romantic first encounter or an intense, desperate situation, he freaking nails it every time and has never disappointed me in any of the games he worked as the music director. Long live Meguro-sensei! Fabulous music from the sexy rapper LJ aside, the voice acting in Midsummer Knight's Dream was far more expressive than it was in Spring of Birth. True, the situation has called for dramatic lines and tones, but even so, it was impressive to hear characters talk in an unavoidable tragedies, or shout during battles. I have noticed how Akihiko had a lot of lines and heart-moving tones compared to the first movie, and his voice actor, Hikaru Midorikawa was golden. The words Akihiko spat when angry, the wails he cried when he found the world to be so unfair, and the shouts he screamed was amazing and top notch. Great respect to the voice actors and actresses, they have done their part perfectly. Due to the harmonic music and impressive voice acting, I would be crazy not to give 10/10 in sound. (I love Aigis's voice actor, Maaya Sakamoto, the same VA for Shinobu in Monogatari, SO CUTTTEEE AHHHHHH!)Ah, yes. Character, perhaps the most important aspect in an anime. An anime without likable and hateful characters is no longer an anime. As I stated above, character development is constant and well paced through incidents and events that occur. There are also several clashes among them which contributes to a good story line. If you watched the teaser for the next movie, Falling Down, all the characters in Persona 3 cast have been revealed. (Of course, not counting Metis from Persona 3 FES or sadly... Tanaka from the TV show...) This means everything is in place for the final act to begin and end and Midsummer Knight's Dream had done such a good job of setting the stage for Falling Down. The antagonists have been introduced really obviously, Revolver Jesus (Takaya), Nerd (Jin), and Gothica (Chidori) have been shown early in the movie, clearly showing them to be evil and malicious. The end of the movie was the perfect touch for the finale to take place. Some characters have found their resolve which will be tested and proven in the next movie. Like I said before, Midsummer Knight's Dream have utilized its characters so well and perfectly that created the optimal atmosphere for Falling Down. At this point, there is no possible way for the movie to fail. For the reasons stated above, I will give character a 10/10.Enjoyment. I really have nothing much to talk about here... I really stated everything I wanted and expressed my honest feelings in the description I wrote. I really enjoyed the movie and the chocolate biscuits I devoured as I watched at 3 A.M. (Boy am I going to gain weight...) Biscuits aside, I genuinely enjoyed watching Midsummer Knight's Dream. Nothing more to explain. I loved Aigis, Akihiko, Shinji, and Aigis, and Aigis. I really love Aigis. :D No really... Aigis is my favorite character in the Persona franchise. But I digress...Overall, Midsummer Knight's Dream is an outstanding sequel and an amazing prequel to a another incredible movie in the future. It served as the perfect median, balancing bright elements shown in Spring of Birth, and the darkness which will be presented in Falling Down. I am very excited for it but I am very pleased by Midsummer Knight's Dream.Thank you for reading this review!

Thanks again!"", 'Persona 3 The Movie: No. 1, Spring of Birth was done by AIC A.S.T.A. studio which despite not being a good film I would have preferred if they continued making the films over A-1 Pictures studio. A-1 Pictures had their chance at the Persona franchise with Persona 4: The Golden Animation. Instead of refining Lerche’s earlier anime adaptation, titled Persona 4: The Animation, on the same game A-1 Picture created what is best described as a cash grab. Now they’re in charge of creating a sequel to an average video game movie adaptation. Like with Persona 4: The Golden Animation, A-1 Picture doesn’t seek out...to make improvements, and instead makes sure you know it’s an A-1 Pictures product. What I find funny is during the opening sequence, Makoto says “I don’t know why, but I feel really good” looking up into the sky revealing director Tomohisa Taguchi name. Almost as a way to reassure viewers this sequel is in good hands. It might seem unimportant, but this is the same director behind Persona 4: The Golden Animation. Persona fans, let that sink in as I delve into this bad sequel.Persona 3 The Movie: #2 Midsummer Knight’s Dream continues the story of Makoto Yuki from the first film leading a group of Persona users to eliminate “The Dark Hour”. This movie opens with a shower scene in a motel room. The film is gracious enough not to provide viewers with a recap of the previous film to pad the running time, but not smart enough to provide context as to why two teenagers are in a motel seemingly about to have sex. I know what happened since I played the game, but even with that said I’m watching a movie not playing it. External knowledge should not be required to understand the first scene of a movie. Once Yukari Takeba finishes showering, putting on a towel while Makoto takes off accessories around his neck. Yukari, and Makoto stare at each other in the middle of the room for a bit before Yukari blushed from embarrassment. The opening scene ends when Yukari slaps Makoto in the face then cue in title card. No scene, can better express what it felt like to see the film. It was, in every metaphorical sense, a slap to the face as a fan of the Person 3 video game.Now, I want to emphasize this is an A-1 Picture production because it takes 17 minutes before anything significant like story actually appears in the movie. Yes, it takes that long before anything story wise actually starts moving forward in a film that’s around an hour, and forty minutes long. The most important thing relating to story that happens within those first 17 minutes is introducing the passive villains Strega. Everything else is spend on fan service like a scene at a beach involving Junpei Iori describing the swimwear of the female characters as the camera shows them off. Granted, this also happened in the video game, but at least they (the female characters) received some characterization at that point in the video game. Since the last movie didn’t develop the cast into dynamic characters it’ll make you shake your head as this is most of the female characters’ biggest contribution in the film. Another aspect it failed to do within those 17 minutes was introduced anything meaningful to use later on in the film story. After an opening action scene, the characters are next seen on a boat heading to an island, then proceeds for around 10 minutes on the beach on non-story related activity.Pass those first 17 minutes the film finally provides explanations for questions that should have been answered in the first film. So now you’ll finally get an answer for why Gekkoukan High School transform into Tartarus in “The Dark Hour”, why the Shadows were released into the world, how to possibly eliminate “The Dark Hour”, and how many of the powerful Shadows that appear during a full moon need to be defeated. All of this information would have been useful in the first film! This is basically damage control for the insane decision for characters to withhold information for no good reason. Narratively it leaves the viewers with no exposure to Persona 3 wandering in the dark when information needed to understand how the film world function gets addressed in the sequel. Thankfully, the one good decision from the story was explaining the concept of artificial Personas. Explaining what makes them different from regular Personas, and the consequences they hold. It’s not a focal point in the film, but at least some attention is given to it.Out of all the material that could have been cut from the film it’s beyond comprehension why the one, and only scene in “The Velvet Room” was left in when all that was said in it was enjoy life to the fullest, and beware of Shadows. This added absolutely nothing of value to the story. The inhabitants of “The Velvet Room” don’t appear again the film besides this one scene. The film was also in need of direction, and main goal to accomplish in the story. There’s a moment in the film where Shinji cooks for a dog while wearing pink cooking apparels. Then, the camera turns around to show an expressionless Aegis staring at Shinji. This causes Shinji to sweat with hip hop music (Mass Destruction by Lotus Juice) playing in the background repeating “Baby, baby, baby”. I just described a pointless moment in the film that the creators of the film approved to animate in the film, even though the first 17 minutes does nothing to move the story forward. Choices like these are the reasons why these Persona 3 films fail to tell a story properly.While still discussing the first thirty minutes of the film I should get across this sequel ruined one of my favorite scene from the video game. It’s after Yukari sees footage of her father dying (plus a revelation discerning Shadows too), and Makoto goes to the beach at night attempting to make Yukari feel better. I very much like this scene allot in the video game besides being a tender moment gave Yukari more depth as a character. It also ended on a humorous note showing the group strong friendship in hard times. So, when I saw the altered scene play out it was for a different purpose. What should have been a character defining moment for Yukari ends up being the set up to an introductory action scene to show off Aegis capabilities as an Anti-Shadow Suppression Weapon killing a dozen or so shadows. I wouldn’t have mind the action scene if A.) Cell Phones were not shown working in the ""The Dark Hour"" even though the first film establishes technology doesn’t work during “The Dark Hour”, B.) The action scene happens after Yukari sees footage of her father dying which dramatically voids Yukari of a meaningful moment, and finally C.) If in the previous film a single character had no trouble fending off a powerful Shadow in his first time of combat in Tartarus what makes you think I’m going to believe two unarmed characters will be in danger from an encounter where they are surrounded by a dozen weak Shadows.Okay, with the first 1/3 of the film problems already written about there’s the rest of the film. With newly introduce Cyborg Girl Aegis now part of the main cast the film makes sure to tell audience she has an infatuation with protagonist Makoto Yuki. A love triangle would have benefited the story if done right. Makoto pays more attention towards Aegis in the film than Yukari even though they have known each other longer. Yukari is shown being jealous whenever Aegis says her purpose in life is to be next to Makoto Yuki side. If competently written this would be used to develop Yukari instead of just being used for humor. To add insult to injury Aegis proves to be more powerful, and useful in combat than Yukari who has been fighting Shadows for a far longer time. This romance aspect of the story doesn’t go far beyond Aegis stating she wants to be next to Makoto. Our protagonist shows no interest in either of them, but spends more time with Aegis in the film.Continuing what was the point of the first film if Makoto didn’t learn to be more open with his emotions! It’s like he reset as a character to learn the same thing in the sequel. However, this film ends on a tragic note which would have made sense for Makoto to be emotionless if that tragic event happened earlier, or if the film was longer to expand on his depress state of mind. It’s headache inducing attempting to figure out why the filmmakers thought this was a good direction to take Makoto character in.When it comes to characters instead of developing the already large cast this sequel decides to increase its number instead. With the exception of Makoto, all the characters from the previous film are delegated into the background. Including Yukari, and Junpei whom were important in the previous film don’t grow as characters in the sequel. Junpei for instance doesn’t know what he would do after “The Dark Hour” is dealt with, but there’s no exploration on it. Other characters who also pondered this same question in one scene. Beside Makoto Yuki, everyone else’s thoughts on the question feel unimportant. A negative that detracts from the whole group dynamic when its tries to get across SEES is made up of close friends. Any character that was in the sideline in the first film don’t receive better treatment except for Akihiko who receives some characterization. Unlike the first film where the climax allowed him to contribute to the story. In this entry, Akihiko ends up short as his connection with Shinjiro has to be rushed, nor is the idea that they (Shinjiro and Akihiko) are good friends is done convincingly.A total of seven characters get added to the cast. One of them is Ken Amada who turns out the best developed of the new characters. He has a simple backstory that eventually turns into a sub-plot of revenge. This leads to Ken being more developed as a character since the reasons behind his negative feelings on living are addressed. Koromaru is a dog that can use a Persona who has no backstory to him. Ken says a single line that Koromaru got left behind, but that could mean anything from an owner who forgot his dog to a street dog with no owner. A single line won’t make me care Koromaru, even if he’s a cute dog who can use a Cerberus like Persona. Finally, there is Shinjiro Aragaki who joins SEES fifty minute into the film. Anybody who has played the game (minus maxing out Shinjiro social link in Persona 3 Portable female route) knows Shinjiro fate in the story. His late addition to SEES makes Shinjiro character be rushed, and his impact on the story overall weak. Without much time spend with him, along with other characters, there’s no reason to be invested in their story. He’s also a plot convenience in the film when he goes to the rescue of SEES.If you complained about Makoto Yuki being overpowered in the first film; this film offers a solution by providing another overpowered character. This time in the form of Aegis who also just as powerful as Makoto. In this film, Aegis is responsible for doing most of the fighting while Makoto is given a handicapped depending on the context. The climatic fight in particular has Makoto pondering his purpose after eliminating “The Dark Hour” for most it. While on the climax, it does a disservice to Junpei, and Yukari characters as they get beaten quickly showing they had not grown stronger since the first film. As a character, Aegis is simply a robot that doesn’t blend well with other human with how she acts. Unfortunately, she doesn’t learn, or wants to seek out what it means to be human in the film. Though, given the archetype of Aegis it’s bound to happen. Her defining trait in this film is being overpowered, and being attached to Makoto Yuki allot.If you complained about Makoto Yuki being overpowered in the first film; this film offers a solution by providing another overpowered character.

Her defining trait in this film is being overpowered, and being attached to Makoto Yuki allot.Lastly for the characters there are the members of Strega. A group that only has one character who has anything to do in the story. His name is Takaya Sakaki who states his intentions, and make the heroes ponder the questions of their purpose without “The Dark Hour”. Takaya is only in this film to kill off a certain character whose death has not much impact because that specific character short screen time. The other members of Strega don’t do much beside exist. Finally, there’s the character of Pharos who also has little to do in the film. Much like the one scene in “The Velvet Room”, Pharos appearance could have been cut out since he basically states the obvious of something bad is about to happen.A-1 Pictures is in charge with the production, and thankfully at least that is carried over from previous film. A-1 Pictures doesn’t improve on the animation aspect, but there is not a decrease in quality either from film to film. There’s more variety in the settings. The majority of the movie takes place at night time with the presence of heavy shadows. Like in the previous film, it’s reliance on lighting to create an eerie atmosphere. When in “The Dark Hour” blacks into dark greens and the blues into reds. This carries in the film insistent on color saturation be it making day scenes intensely bright, or making night scenes really dark. Almost as if it’s unable to trust viewers with the time of day a scene takes place in. Particle effects are amped up in the battles from the previous film as members in SEES equals to more Persona on screen using magic attack, or the characters killing shadows. When Aegis is killing a group of Shadows in her first action scene the animation is fluid as she quickly moves around the environment, the framing of shot making it clear to see what’s going on, and the effects to add to the impact of an attack be it heavy flames, or bullet piercing. There is some bad 3D animation during a major action scene that doesn’t blend with 2D animation in the middle of the film. Besides this, the 3D in the film is not jarringly noticeable through its duration.Voice acting is satisfactory once again. With too many characters, and unequal screen time the majority of the main voice cast from the first film get sideline without being offered single a scene to display their talent. Giving more than half of its voice talent the equivalent of thankless roles. New addition Kazuya Nakai who plays Shinjirou Aragaki gets the most ranged in a rushed amount of time. His performance is noteworthy as despite the speed his character changes tone Kazyua Nakai always sound natural. He makes the swift change in his character easier to accept. Megumi Ogata plays Ken Amada has a steadier change in her performance. Going from uncertain scare kid, too optimistic, to gloomy is handle well through her performance. I might not like the character Ken Amada, but she makes the character convincing. Then there’s Maaya Sakamoto who plays Aegis who has plenty of screen time. Unfortunately, her character is a cyborg trying to learn emotion archetype. However, since Aegis hasn’t gotten philosophical of what it means to be human Maaya Sakamoto is monotone for the whole film. It goes with the character in this instance, but it ends up being a forgettable performance. Sakamoto monotone delivery of her lines does not provide hint of a complex character making Aegis seem hollow than she might actually be.What really bothers me the most about the performances is voice actor Akira Ishida doesn’t get to expand on his character Makoto Yuki. So he once again has to play the same emotionless, broken leading character from the first film. Ishida is not allowed to be more emotional, more expressive in his portrayal of Makoto Yuki. This film does the biggest disservice to him since by not allowing Akira Ishida to gradually transition his emotionless character to a more expressive one. The film rejects Akira Ishida the opportunity to expand Makoto Yuki beyond what was presented in the first film. It feels like a retread of his performance from the first film. While his retread performance is not bad it doesn’t quite the same effect the second time around.Persona 3 The Movie: #2 Midsummer Knight’s Dream is a bad film continuing being inaccessible for newcomers, and infuriating for Persona 3 fans for not making the appropriate changes for the material to function as a movie. None of the character are developed enough to care about, there’s no tension because of two overpowered characters, a large cast most of whom don’t contribute to the story, and is predictably boring for anyone who played Persona 3 as it does nothing to throw fans off guard. It looks, and sounds like Persona 3, but by the time the credits roll it won’t be the same emotional roller coaster the video game was. to make improvements, and instead makes sure you know it’s an A-1 Pictures product. What I find funny is during the opening sequence, Makoto says “I don’t know why, but I feel really good” looking up into the sky revealing director Tomohisa Taguchi name. Almost as a way to reassure viewers this sequel is in good hands. It might seem unimportant, but this is the same director behind Persona 4: The Golden Animation. Persona fans, let that sink in as I delve into this bad sequel.Persona 3 The Movie: #2 Midsummer Knight’s Dream continues the story of Makoto Yuki from the first film leading a group of Persona users to eliminate “The Dark Hour”.

First play the game than watch the movie."", ""Persona 3 the Movie 2: Midsummer Knight's Dream is the sequel to Spring of Rebirth. The problem is that it is not exactly clear when the movie takes place other than that it hints that it is something like the summer. The movie immediately begins in the middle of the Lovers' Shadow on a full moon with no context for how they got there. It immediately cuts to a beach episode before getting serious again. They flash some scenes of minor characters and social links, but unless you played the game, you would have no idea who they are. While there seems to be a...story between the past relationship of two characters, it is split up so far apart and not emphasized before it reaches the climax and you actually figure out the significance of the event. It felt like there was a lack of direction and they chose to just adapt what they felt would be popular with the fans rather than trying to make a coherent story.Like its predecessors, the art and the sound are great. The animation is excellent and makes great use of CGI to show how the Persona are foreign. The impressive shadow and lighting effects make their return and continues to contribute to the overall feeling of the story. There are a few scenes where the lighting does seem a little off because one character appears with shadows and then suddenly, another character in the same conversation does not. The sounds and music of the game make their return in high quality.The poor story ultimately hurts the character development and the overall enjoyment of the movie. While the first movie spent some time to develop the characters, Midsummer Knight's Dream felt like it constantly shifted between action scenes and suspense scenes, skipping large chunks of the story just so it could follow this formula. The few scenes that do not follow this do little to contribute further to the characters. This becomes an even bigger problem in the third movie, Falling Down, where one of the things they kind of glossed over becomes important towards the climax of the that movie. This movie felt like a movie that could only be enjoyed by people who had already played the game because then you could at least do things like fill in the missing information yourself. But if you are experiencing Persona 3 for the first time, all this does is leave you confused. story between the past relationship of two characters, it is split up so far apart and not emphasized before it reaches the climax and you actually figure out the significance of the event.

The pacing is solid, but brought down by the not-so-good pacing of the source material, meaning that entire months are often skipped for no apparent reason.Art:There isn't really much to...say about the art that I haven't already said in the first movie's review. outstanding use of colours and lighting which makes it easier for the audience to engage with the story.Sound:Again, not really much to say here.

New characters, more character development and world building, this is Persona 3 the Movie 2: Midsummer Knight's Dream.So Persona 3 the Movie 2: Midsummer Knight's Dream starts off with SEES in a beach vacation where they encounter Aegis voiced by Maaya Sakamoto, an android weapon meant to kill Shadows but also Shinji, Akihiko's older brother encounters another Persona user, Ken Amada voiced by Megumi Ogata and a dog that can move in the Dark Hour named Koromaru.With these revelations, also comes in Strega, a sorta polar opposite to SEES, where they are trying...to PROTECT the Shadows and keep the Dark Hour going and this indirectly gets at Makoto, as he somewhat sympathizes with Strega's motives yet it conflicts with his desires of protecting his friends but at the expense of giving Makoto a fulfilling life in the Dark Hour, well to be honest this character development of Makoto was something LA was wanting from the first movie and is a moral dilemma for Makoto that affects not only his character but the plot too as what happens once all 12 of the Greater Shadows and the Dark Hour disappears?, will he be a nobody and be an ordinary student again or maybe because if the Dark hour disappears, he'll lose his friends he's met up til now.Though Makoto's dilemma is somewhat plot crucial in this movie, Midsummer Knight's Dream focuses more on Shinji and Amada and how they are linked in a ways, in similar respects to fleshing out Fuuka but with Shinji and Amada's case much more detailed and with much worse consequences. From the first movie we got glimpses to Shinji as a character, just that he's a loner and is the older brother to Akihiko but in Midsummer Knight's Dream, we get more in depth with him and how his sins and dilemna's is linked to Amada in a ways and LA won't spoil but let's just say it reminds LA HEAVILY of Snow and Hope's relationship from Final Fantasy XIII, heck it's almost beat for beat...almost.Though Amada and Shinji's development takes centre stage, we do get more world building and where Yukari comes in with why she's in SEES in the first place and for being LA's favorite character this was welcomed to say the least and LA only grew to like Yukari even more giving her at least some limelight. (Now that LA thinks about it, LA likes Persona's tomboyish characters, Yukari, Chie from P4 and Makoto from P5) Anyways her backstory more or less brings in the world building of how Tartarus, the Dark Hour was formed and how to get rid of it.To say that Midsummer Knight's Dream is much more character-focused in an understatement and it's only helped with it's world building giving urgency and tying things together to the entire ordeal of Strega, the Dark Hour, Shinji, Amada and Makoto as it's core elements that was nicely no very well executed.If there were any flaws, LA wouldn't exactly call them flaws, more nitpicks but even then LA will defend those, now Persona 3 the Movie 2: Midsummer Knight's Dream does seem to rush to the major events but LA will defend this by saying that at least they brought in some cameo social links during the off peak moments of the game and really again LA made this argument many times but trying to cram in a 200 hours game content to the second part of a series of movies each with 100 minutes of screentime is highly doubtful, but the second movie at least tried to put some mention of it in. Lastly would be that some character development was halted to make way for the new characters and their development, the major victims being Yukari and Aegis who was only introduced in this movie and nothing much else but much like Fuuka taking the focus during the first movie, LA can give this flaw some grace as LA will guess the next movie will flesh it out and heck Mitsuru had probably the smallest screentime of the movie and we just know about her father and that her father's company helps the SEES.The production is the the same as the first movie however to be fair, the animation now done by A1-Pictures was as still consistent from the first movie with even better fights, background work, silkier character designs but most definitely from the atmospheric animation work was amazingly done. In the voice acting department, LA will give Akira Ishida as Makoto and Megumi Ogata as Amada and Kazuya Nakai as Shinji some props in their voice acting.Persona 3 the Movie 2: Midsummer Knight's Dream shows that it isn't playing around and this isn't a game (well it is, LA is saying in-universe) of playing hero and nothing echoes it than the finale of this movie and it's incredibly heartbreaking to say the least what happens and the moral dilemma it's going to cause to Makoto of either wanting to get rid of the Dark Hour to protect his friends but his want to be something with the Dark Hour present. Midsummer Knight's Dream is an obvious step up to the first movie but LA won't give the first movie any slack and it was build up to this revelation. Well executed character development from both new and old characters, moral quandaries questioned, world building fleshing out the supernatural and villains and a bitter yet well deserved ending.Summer slowly but surely moves to Falling Down... to PROTECT the Shadows and keep the Dark Hour going and this indirectly gets at Makoto, as he somewhat sympathizes with Strega's motives yet it conflicts with his desires of protecting his friends but at the expense of giving Makoto a fulfilling life in the Dark Hour, well to be honest this character development of Makoto was something LA was wanting from the first movie and is a moral dilemma for Makoto that affects not only his character but the plot too as what happens once all 12 of the Greater Shadows and the Dark Hour disappears?, will he be a nobody and be an ordinary student again or maybe because if the Dark hour disappears, he'll lose his friends he's met up til now.Though Makoto's dilemma is somewhat plot crucial in this movie, Midsummer Knight's Dream focuses more on Shinji and Amada and how they are linked in a ways, in similar respects to fleshing out Fuuka but with Shinji and Amada's case much more detailed and with much worse consequences.

We get more development in this one, though, which is nice, but I still feel like some parts are too rushed. Ken and Shinjiro's relationship gets a bit more development here, which is nice to see, but it's also at the cost of any development with Makoto. Not a fan of the way they've been doing Makoto, still very stiff and unimportant so far. Aigis is about the same, and I'm hoping they hit the landing in pulling off those characters in the rest of the movies. Despite these concerns, there are promising aspects to the series,...and I'm eager to see if the subsequent movies can deliver a more balanced and satisfying portrayal of these beloved characters. and I'm eager to see if the subsequent movies can deliver a more balanced and satisfying portrayal of these beloved characters.""]"
Nurarihyon no Mago,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7592/Nurarihyon_no_Mago,"['Edited this review by the way :)Grammar Nazis? GTFO lol. This review is not for you. Why not create your own then? :PGlad that my friend let me watch this great stuff.Okay now let’s start.What will you do if you will become a powerful commander?Story: 9/10The story revolves around Nura Clan. A Clan of “youkai” that controls 10,000 demons. Amongst them is what they called “supreme commander” a very powerful “youkai”.Now for the protagonist story so far. Nurarhiyon no Mago didn’t lack story backgrounds at all. They explained what happened in the past with the right execution. Except for the flashbacks that his...season lacked. The jabs also were at the right timing and in the right scene.The first antagonist didn’t lack also the background which is a factor plus because you know why he did that and those. Over all pacing are great. There is no filler. None at all. Some scenes from manga are cut here and placed at the second season instead.Art: 8/10IMO the sword/katana fighting are the main stream of this, the animation was great. Also the opening credits were great it’s well drawn. The ending credits weren’t that good compare to the opening.  The chibi or the miniture forms of the characters didn’t fit. The genre of this was supposed to be ""Monster"" not a ""Cute"" or ""Moe"" one.The youkai are well drawn, Animations are really great.Sound: 8/10Opening song was great. Fast Forward by Money Majik. Every time I’m listening to the full version I also sang.The BGM when Nurarhiyon attacks a youkai has a good execution. The back ground tracks fit every scene Nurarhiyon no Mago has to offer.  What destroyed the good sounds is the ending song. It didn’t fit what genre nurarhiyon has. The 2nd one didn\'t make it for me either.Characters: 8/10The characters fit what personalities they have.  Adding characters while the story progress with their background is also a plus factor, at the same time Rukio is “growing” every episode. They also didn’t lack time executing who is going to “grow” with the explanation.The character development is great. Overall the adaption from the manga onto an anime didn\'t lacked anything except less than 10 chapters form the start but not that huge character back story. Try to read the manga first rather knowing it here (at the review)Enjoyment: 9/10I really did enjoy this.  Various scenes will be enjoyable while watching this.  You will be caught in suspense, laugh at the jabs and get excited on the katana fights. And this anime already leave a huge impression to me and still continued for the 2nd season!Final Score: 9/10It’s up to you to decide whether you gonna watch this or ditch it, but imo this anime is great. The jokes are in the right time. Great Music and the BGM is really mixed on the scenes. Great Art and Character development. season lacked.

Great Art and Character development.', 'If there\'s one word I could describe Nurarihyon no Mago, it would have to be BORING.Having read the adaptation I really had high hopes for this series as the formula to which Mago is about, is seldom used in shonén anime and if done right, would have definitely been one of the better series for 2010....but like I said, BORING. Here\'s why:Story - 8Nurarihyon no Mago is a tale of the supernatural. It\'s a tale of demons and spirits and the co-existence between their kind and ours. It\'s also a tale of Rikuo Nura and how he takes over his grandfathers clan known as...the Hyakki Yakō, a clan made up of yōkai(demons) and other familiar spirits of Japanese folklore. Nurarihyon no Mago is about the trials and tribulations Rikuo goes through to achieve being the head of that clan(to which at first he has no interest in) while knowing that he is only a quarter yōkai himself.What makes the story even more interesting is how the Nura yōkai clan portray chivalry, similar to those you\'d find in yakuza(Japanese gangster) movies, and how this series uses fear to gauge their strength.Nurarihyon no Mago is Rikuo\'s story, as he struggles to find his place between both worlds, and it\'s a tale of superiority between other yōkai clans as you\'ll find in the second half of the series.So far so good right? So what went wrong?Art & Animation - 6This is where it was a miss for me. While I was happy the art stayed true to Hiroshi Shiibashi\'s manga, giving you a richly detailed account to Japan\'s yōkai like you\'d find in an old Japanese tapestry, I was really disappointed in its animation. For a shonén title, the series really lacked \'fluidity\' for a better word making each scene seem like your watching still-frame art from the 90\'s. The execution and pacing was lacking and for a series made late 2010, the choreography was non-existent.While there are times when you think animation might improve(like watching the intricacies of a Sakura tree blossom at night), you are let down the next moment when characters clash....very...slowly. Even anime such as Hikaru no Go, which is a series about an Asian \'bored\' game provided better excitement. I usually have a benchmark when it comes to shonén anime(specially ones released in the last few years) and Mago simply did not cut it for me.If I had to make a comparison to Mago\'s animation, it would probably come close to Samurai Deeper Kyo(which aired back in 2002), another anime that had all the right premises but didn\'t deliver.Yes, Nurarihyon no Mago may have picked up after 20 episodes into the series, but that\'s 20+ episodes too late! For some people, an anime is good if it entices you through the first few episodes. NOT at the very end where people have already dropped it or have put it on hold waiting for someone to tell them to pick it up again. It\'s not fine wine which you to mature(unless you\'re one who don\'t drop anime regardless)Sound - 5While I have no complaints about the voice actors chosen for Mago(besides the obvious of some being miscasted), where I really felt the series was also lacking was a \'strong\' musical score. Shonén anime can be gripping when a running score is played in the background. The series I mentioned earlier, Hikaru no Go is a very good example to this in that it has such a moving soundtrack, that regardless how boring the game is played in Hikaru it still keeps you riveted, and at times even on edge. Whilst Nurarihyon no Mago does have BGM running(softly), none felt suited to the tempo of each scene making it seem like I was watching an 80\'s series due to just hearing dialogue.I will commend that the OP\'s for both arcs in the series were consistent( with both titles performed by Monkey Majik) giving you that feeling for what the show is going to be, but I\'ll be honest and admit that the ED\'s(performed by Katate☆Size) just did not feel appropriate for each ending episode. Instead of thinking I was watching a series about demons and the supernatural, the upbeat tempo at the end of each episode made it sound like it was done by a backyard DJ adding music to his favorite home video.Characters - 6The series as a whole only really shines through its characters. For one, you have Rikuo who is a quarter yōkai which means like any shonén anime, there is a part of the main character that would make any fan who\'s into transformations go: ""Wow! Sick! I want to see more of this!"" And I admit, when I had first read the adaptation, I was pretty much all over it the moment Rikuo turned into the \'Master of the Night\'.Just seeing his transformation made me feel like a little boy again watching Goku turn into Super-Saiyijinn 3.Nurarihyon no Mago also features a huge cast of characters which at most \'can\' be likable, but I wouldn\'t start saying that they\'d be memorable like other well known shonén supporting characters and the only one I\'d take real note of is Kiyotsugu(of the Kiyo Paranormal Squad) who happens to probably be the most annoying side character in all of anime history.Enjoyment and Overall - 5In all honesty, I have mixed feelings for this series as a part of me wants to grow to like it thanks to having known how the manga continues, while the other half is screaming ""Bloody Murder!"" at the anime director.Overall I am clearly disappointed with Mago as an anime due to the segments I had mentioned earlier and I\'m surprised that it\'s even getting a second season when there are clearly far better anime out there who hasn\'t seen the light of day since they first aired(Berserk & Kenichi to name a few). I can only hope that they find a better director(or another studio take it up) for season 2 as there is no way I\'d be buying the first once its licensed.Nurarihyon no Mago is more \'superficial\' then it is supernatural and at best may pass time for people with nothing to do, but it definitely isn\'t praiseworthy let alone top-shelf when it comes to action anime. the Hyakki Yakō, a clan made up of yōkai(demons) and other familiar spirits of Japanese folklore.

An interesting anime indeed.Before I start reviewing, I have to admit, I\'m a big sucker for Jun Fukuyama voicing characters with alter egos (e.g. Lelouch/Zero in Code Geass, Ryner/Ryner with Alpha Stigma activated in Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu and of course, Rikuo Day/Rikuo Night in Nurarihyon no Mago), so excuse me if I sound a bit biased here.Now, on to the actual review:Story (7/10): You have your classic reluctant hero, Nura Rikuo, heir to the Nura Clan. 3/4 human and 1/4 youkai, he lives a normal school life by day and controls an army of youkai by night. The story details...the challenges Rikuo face as a part human in a youkai household and as a part youkai in human society. Sounds cliched, right? I agree. Even so, the story isn\'t all that bad. Although the development of the plot is painfully slow, it also allows the viewer to gain a greater insight into the characters.Art (8/10): Studio Deen has never really done a bad job with their animations, so there\'s nothing much I can critique here. I really liked the colour contrast between the human and youkai societies. You can see that anything relating to humans generally has warmer colours, whereas anything relating to youkai generally has cooler colours.Sound (7/10): The OSTs in this anime are brilliant. Then again, I shouldn\'t say OSTs, because it\'s more like just one OST with many variations, but it still sounds good nonetheless. Seiyuus were well casted for the most part, though I really don\'t think Akira Ishida sounds good in any part except Arthrun Zala from Gundam Seed, no offense. Again, I\'m a sucker for Jun Fukuyama voicing characters with ""double"" lives, so I have no complaints there. Openings were...decent. Endings were...not so decent. Not the best OPs or ENDs I\'ve seen recently.Character (9/10): Like I mentioned earlier, I think the characters were well developed because of the slow movement of the plot. There were some crucial flashblacks that I really enjoyed because they cleared up character motivations brilliantly (e.g. Gyuki\'s flashback regarding his relationship with the Nurarihyon and Kana\'s flashback regarding her relationship with Night Rikuo). However, because of the large cast of youkai, not many of them are examined in detail, so many of the characters are just kind of there...you don\'t really know much about them other than little insignificant hints dropped here and there.Enjoyment (7/10): I must say, I enjoyed this anime, mostly because of  its subtle comedy. The names of the youkai are hilarious first of all. Kubinashi (literally meaning ""no neck"") has no neck. I found that funny. Kana\'s misunderstanding about Rikuo. I totally saw it coming, but I laughed anyways. Everytime Rikuo transformed, I also laughed, mostly because it reminded me of the cliched: weak character becomes strong through wicked transformation. The worst thing about the anime by far is the slow plot development. And when I say slow, I mean slow. The Shikoku arc was like 12 episodes, when it really should\'ve been something like 6 because half of it was about Rikuo hesitating.Overall (7/10): It was good, but hey, if you have as much time on your hands as I do, go do something productive instead.

Cheers!', ""I was looking forwad to this show, as i had heard a lot of good things about its source. After the first episode i felt euphoric; a shounen that would provide bad ass fights, but has a dark background, and looks like it will avoid the pitfalls of the others. A plot based on the complexity of a nation of youkai but the simplicity of a shounen. A mix of the happy day rikou and the dark mysterious commander at night.Expectation: 8-9Episode Scores: -,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-, 5, 5, 3, 2, 6, 7, 6, 5Actual: 4 (Bad)However while everything could have been promising every episode i cried about...the pace. There was not really anything horribly wrong with the story, and it was really good to tell the truth. Yet, the story crawls at a snails pace that it just ruins the whole experience. Through the start i was just thinking of how the build up was great, but then it hit me. The climax could never reach those expecations it builds up for a whole season. I had my hopes up since it was only 26 episodes, but it felt like i was watching reborn, naruto, bleach. It felt like i was watching filler!The fights were not impressive. They were good in that Nura kicks ass with nothing more than his brain and a sword, but the animation is poor and honesty the expectation issue comes back again. They did not make up for the wait either. Another complaint is how there was also no real challenge for Nura throughout the season either.The youkai characters did not get a lot of air time or development at all but they seemed interesting. The majority of the characters are intelligent, respectable, and most of all extremely useful by nature. They follow Nura because his is an indeed admirable character; he is not our typical useless lead, but smart and knows how to put on a good show for us. I was cheering at him at multiple points in the show for his impressive displays. That said his school friends play little part. In fact they are total weights on the story; they don't do anything yet get just as much air time as the youkai. Another issue is how they can all stay in the headquarters for youkai over a weekend and not even meet one. Essentially if i said that the girls go help his mom cook dinner you can infer the level of depth and intelligence given to them.As soon as i wrote down these initial thoughts i went and started the manga. Decide ending on such a depressing note i read the large quantity of chapters to the most recent one in a few days. I will leave it on a note, seeing the anime first, that the manga is many times superior. If you don't want to read it, then you will be watching a pretty bad adaption. the pace.

That was my opinion of the first episode.

It’s like a combination of Katekyo Hitman Reborn with an Inuyasha infused yokai theme and more. The story is great, even though it’s quite normal being an heir (involuntarily) and fighting of others that want to get your position, too much proving (with regards to your worth as an heir) and those entire allegiances thing with the other characters (value of friendship and trust) and a pretty obvious love interest since the girl the...protagonist likes looks like her mom with an addition of slightly harem effect with regards to girls liking the protagonist Rikuo, despite all of that I still dig the story. I can’t seem to think of a wow twist in the story YET but like I said it’s still a great animé.  It’s refreshing and a sort of stress relief everyday animé, the kind of animé you would love to watch after a heavy day that would make you feel normal again, also when you don’t like those awesome yet problematic and complicate animés that will give you another headache. Another thing is that even if sometimes you know that there’s nothing that much exciting on the next episode you would still want to watch more of it.The opening themes by monkey majik are AWESOME and the fight scenes too are great. The ending songs are cute because of the chibi version of the three main female lead, Yuki Onna, Kana and Yura singing and dancing to the ending songs. The character designs have those HUGE eyes; I know most animés do have big eyes but theirs are way too big at first you would be like whoa! But after a while you’ll get used to it and some characters still look pretty and some boys (yokai boys since there aren’t much “normal” boys to begin with) are HOT like the male lead,  night rikuo himself\uf04a the yokais (which aren’t on human form) ranges from ugly weird to cute weird but not too scary at all.

I wasn't looking to watch a new anime, but I saw a picture and was immediately drawn to the image of Rikuo in his demon form and thought I'd give it a shot.

I have to admit, when I first started watching the show I immediately thought: ""Oh great, it\'s a yokai version of Katekyou Hitman Reborn.""But Nurarihyon no Mago isn\'t as naive, and it keeps surprising you in little ways.The story starts with a 12 year old boy, Nura Rikuo, who lives in a house full of yokai, and is a quarter yokai himself, and thus his true demon form can only be released for a quarter of a day, under cover of darkness. He is the grandson of Nurarihyon,...the Supreme Commander of Yokai, and is next in line for succession. But he doesn\'t want to be a Supreme Commander of all the Yokai, he wants to live as a human. However circumstances do not allow him to remain detached, and the manner in which he embraces his inheritance, with fully formed resolve and responsibility is a treat in comparison to other shonen heroes.The art throughout the show is amazing, and if nothing else I\'d watch the show just for the quality of animation.However, I feel the characters are rather half-baked, especially the demon-form of Rikuo, which leaves a lot of questions unanswered and didn\'t have much depth for me. He strikes me as just a generic \'Hero\' character, which is sort of off-putting.Otherwise the show is awesome.

The first few episodes were really good in my opinion. However my liking for this show started to slacken as I went on. When I first read about this show it seemed like it was going to be areally great show with a lot of battles and action. I was disapointed greatly. Although there are some good parts in the show. I watched the whole seiries because it wasen't areally long anime show that had some hundreds of episodes. So I rated this a 6. "", ""how come you say its only 24 episodes...i watched it and its 26 episodes, i can't even change it.the story wasn't like so catchy but i liked it and I'm watching it to the end. "", ""Nurarihyon no Mago is neither inspired nor terrible.  It's rather mediocre actually, which comes as a disappointment especially since it has a decent MAL score.  I like the premise and I tried to be as open-minded as I could.  It pleasantly surprised me in some areas; for example, the plot elements suggest some strategic thinking on the part of protagonists and antagonists alike.  However, the outrageously bad action in the fight scenes is unforgivable in a shonen anime.  Neither the character development nor the dialogue are sufficient to redeem this glaring weakness for this sub-genre.So let's get that out of...the way first.  I have come to expect bad action in shonen anime, especially older anime, but this anime tries to push the lower bounds of that expectation.  Characters stand around spouting long monologues, just begging opponents to skewer them with a surprise attack (if only to shut them up).  Martial arts are flashy, unrealistic, and lack any sort of kinetic weight.  Expressions are grossly exaggerated, moves are telegraphed, and characters cover distances at inconsistent rates.  Damage has varying effects on characters, inversely proportionate to their importance to the story I suppose.  Nothing resembles highly skilled fighting which is ugly, abrupt, and brutally efficient.  Only small children would be entertained, but given the other subject matter small children are not the target audience.The worst are the sword duels.  Obviously, I don't expect anything approaching realism in an anime.  I would, however, appreciate things that LOOK cool, as is the case in some more modern anime.  But here, sword fights are mostly blade locks that give the combatants a chance to whisper sweet nothings to each other for long stretches while we yawn.  It gets old quickly and makes us wonder if perhaps their animators were on a strict budget or simply lacked imagination.Other visual elements are also lacking.  I suppose the anime was made during that awkward time when CG started gaining traction in anime, and it is mixed in poorly enough with hand-drawn elements to stick out.  The art itself hails back to an earlier anime art style that I rather dislike.  Monsters look silly and cartoonish rather than terrifying and intimidating.  Facial features are mushy and indistinct, and nobody in the cast really stand out as having superior character design.Why did I score it so highly given these obvious flaws?  Well, I was expecting absolutely terrible storytelling to go along with the poor visuals, but some of it seemed well-constructed.  At one point an opposing faction invades Nura family territory and instead of a direct assault (which probably would have failed), they do strategically sound things like attacking scouts, making feints, and eroding power base through indirect attacks.I cannot say ALL the story elements were sound, however.  Rikuo, the main character, has the most annoying classmates and they get a huge amount of screen time.  They do improbable things that human beings of sound mind would never do.  Despite almost dying several times due to youkai activity, they repeatedly put themselves into compromising and dangerous situations.  They visit abandoned, remote areas without adult supervision.  Somehow they gain permission from their parents to sleep away from home despite the obvious spate of violence and property damage that recurs in town (and very publicly on the news).There seems to be a cliched love triangle brewing between Rikuo, the childhood friend, and the snow woman bodyguard.  There is a tiny amount of character development, mostly in Rikuo who goes from being an annoying, whiny kid to being a slightly less annoying, whiny kid.  Beyond that, don't watch this for the character interactions.Overall, I enjoyed this more than it deserved given the quality of its individual elements.  I just happened to like this kind of anime and its sense of style.  But it's executed quite poorly and you'll find better examples of the genre elsewhere.  Oh, and regarding the music, although most OP and ED are bad in this anime, the worse is the terrible OP during the second half of the season.  Is that some kind of country-western R&B hybrid?

I just happened to like this kind of anime and its sense of style.  But it's executed quite poorly and you'll find better examples of the genre elsewhere.  Oh, and regarding the music, although most OP and ED are bad in this anime, the worse is the terrible OP during the second half of the season.  Is that some kind of country-western R&B hybrid?  I don't know, but feels like they went out of their way to offend my ears."", 'Let me start off by saying that Nurarihyon is one sexy Yokai!*ehem*err* Alright, now I have gotten that out of the way...Story: 7 - For me it\'s just the typical Human/Yokai story... it has an \'Inuyasha\' feel to it... the plot is not boring, it\'s actually fast paced, but maybe I was looking for something more... the characters were developed quite nicely and the fight scenes aren\'t bad either... since Nurarihyon was strong, i wanted the antagonist to be a bada**... Also, the human by day and yokai by night is okay... not that Rikuo is not cute, but i wanted more Nurarihyon... waiting for...the transformation kinda gets old...Overall/Enjoyment: 8 - Nura and his clan are so fun to watch... Nurarihyon is the leader of a bunch of Yokai - most of them appear harmless and they\'ll be the mischievous spirits at best... his most loyal subjects are Yuki Onna, Aotabo, Kurotabo and Kubinashi (Headless)... they provide comic relief to a seemigly serious story... We also have a ""love angle"" but being 12 yr olds, they are a little bit too young to be excited about... and i like Yura better than Kana, btw...Ending had a nice feel to it and was not too mushy... though it did make me go \'Aaawww - that\'s cute...\' -What I also liked best here is the Sakura tree... it was mesmerizing... i am still waiting if it has some kind of significance in the story or maybe i missed it... :PNow watching the 2nd season and by the looks of it, the 2nd part is much more promising... can\'t wait... :) the transformation kinda gets old...Overall/Enjoyment: 8 - Nura and his clan are so fun to watch...

A young kid who is half human,half demon takes control of the strongest demon clan(the clan he belongs to) and proves to be much more different than the previous rulers. Thanks to his human side. And so not to give anything away, the story develops from there and deals with the tasks of uniting humans and demons. The anime is well animated, has a easy simple plot to follow and entertaining as hell. Pretty good character development as well if you like that kind of stuff from your anime. It is well worth a watch and i recommend...it to anyone. it to anyone.', 'This show has little going for it.The show is about the protagonist having a demon form at night, and a human form at day. He struggles/comes to a conclusion about his position as the inheritor of a large demon clan.Seems quite good, but the show is just flawed in all aspects. The plot isn\'t intriguing at all. You can tell that the plot is just being used to have character development. Well, that\'s fine, if the characters end up being good, I guess. But, it really doesn\'t. It\'s sort of a coming of age story for the protagonist, but it\'s done terribly. Rushed...even. It\'s a fighting anime, but fights are short, boring, and have no purpose. Everything works out for the protagonist, and everyone in the clan basically loves him for no reason. No politics, no backstabbing, no plots, nothing.Characters other than the protagonist are one dimensional. They all build off the protagonist, so there is no individuality or purpose to them other than to how they can impact the protagonist. The fact that so much of the plot is spent characterizing them is crazy for how boring they really are.After a few arcs of ""characterization"" of the cast of characters which I don\'t care about at all, since they\'re all boring, comes the big ""fight/story progression arc."" Woohoo. It\'s going to be fun, finally seeing what unfolds when the entire clan is faced with a crisis. Well actually, this big arc definitely was the deciding factor. The anime could have been half decent if the big story arc was well made. But it definitely did not work out. The pacing is terrible, the focus on certain characters are weird, and the villains are just ""evil people"" that want to kill the nura clan. Yeesh. No other characters can fight other than the protagonist or something, and despite the extremely snail\'s pace that the plot is moving at, it still isn\'t well thought out or have any depth because the pacing and focus is nonexistent. Logic does not exist within the show. Actions are made that just don\'t make any sense, and you really what the hell the author was thinking.You\'d really wish that characters would act on their own, independent from the Main character\'s wishes, and that the enemy plot made any sense at all. Strategy, tactics, etc don\'t get used at all. I really wish that the story / show spent a lot more time on the entire clan, and other characters\' actions, so that this story would be more fleshed out and thoughtful.

They drop names and nouns as if we are supposed to care. What makes it worse is the over sexual tones throughout, the characters are 12 and 13, is there really a need to have bath scenes? Come on Japan, what are you like... The protagonist does a yugioh and gets a lot older when it's night time and they hint at the conflict being that his 12/13 year old love interest is more interested in his adult version, yikes. I did like the once off...episode where the yokai slayer girl sees the protagonist and the other demon chick bending down and thinks they are kissing and is openly confused about the plot, thinking that the love interest and protagonist are going out already, I related to this because I also had trouble paying attention to this snore fest of a show. The main villains are introduced towards the last few episodes and the build up is rather weak, they all have basic uninteresting attacks with no real flair on both sides. The villains are posing as school boys, and they set up obvious traps and talk a big game, never felt any bit of tension once. It's a very average show that has some fleeting cute  moments, but they are few and far between, all and all a very average and forgettable show, most annoying part is that the demon girl is seen by the humans throughout the show both as a demon and a human and it is never questioned. Also the characters will really cheesely slip up and say something obvious that makes them seem suspicious and it's never questioned either. Weak. Also he's the Lord of pandemonium, the guy is extremely quiet, reserved and well behaved even in his adult form, seems like he really doesn't fit the role at all, the bad guys are kinda right he's a bad leader. episode where the yokai slayer girl sees the protagonist and the other demon chick bending down and thinks they are kissing and is openly confused about the plot, thinking that the love interest and protagonist are going out already, I related to this because I also had trouble paying attention to this snore fest of a show.

However caught between his demon blood and his human blood he faces the struggle of what he truly is and in season 1 of Nurarihyon no Mago we see Nura Rikuo battle this struggle and all other obstacles he may face.Season 1 of Nurarihyon no Mago did have a lot of...potential up until episode 12-13 where it starts to clearly go downhill.Ending: 8The ending of Nurarihyon no Mago is really split into two parts, the first being action packed with some more character development from Nura Rikuo and the second being nice, happy and ‘smooth’. The ending for Nurarihyon no Mago overall was quite enjoyable even more so that we know we are getting a season 2; which gives us something to look forward too.Solid Plot: 7With 24 episodes to the first season they did do well to maintain a plot that could be said as being somewhat solid. Whilst watching season 1 I did tend to find a lot that there were times where some scenes seemed unnecessary and even going to the point where even a few episodes seemed as if they were just thrown in there. However with that said 75% of season 1 was enjoyable and maintained a good enough plot to be able to follow without becoming too confusing.Moral: 8.5The moral can really be seen as analogy more than anything; with Nura Rikuo constantly preaching for equality between demons and humans and that he will treat both their crimes and achievements equally. This can be compared to both Equality throughout the human race, addressing factors such as racism, and equality throughout genders, i.e male and female. Even though humans and demons differ, Nura Rikuo still wishes to treat them both with an equal amount of respect and fairness; which can be compared to the fact that even though there are a lot of differences amongst humanity we should still treat each other with the same amount of respect and fairness.Sense: 6Really the one main thing that pissed me off the most when it came to this anime making sense was the simple fact that they always, and I mean always, let their opponents/enemies get away. Just because your enemy turned a corner doesn’t mean you stop pursuing them, some of the instances where they let this happen really just leave me baffled as to what exactly they were thinking.Another reason why it got a 6 is because wounds are also completely unrealistic to the point where it seems as if some of the characters really have incredibly iron like skin or just insane regenerative powers, ‘like that sword clearly took your arm off so why is it still attached to your body?’Music: 6.5Unfortunately another low point for Nurarihyon no Mago, as I has hoped the music would actually be better. The music doesn’t really have any presence in Nurarihyon no Mago so it’s quite hard to judge, yet the times when I did notice their being background music I did find it enjoyable and somewhat enhanced the mood of the scene.In essence though what I mean when I say presence is that it doesn’t have that type of background music that will keep you remembering it and humming it after you’ve finished the anime.Art: 8.5I must say that I did really like the art and art style of Nurarihyon no Mago, both the way the scenery and characters where drawn where amazing. I could not find any noticeable similarities between characters which is a great upside to any Anime, even more so in the case of Nurarihyon no Mago.Characters: 7The only real downside for the character aspect of Nurarihyon no Mago is that there is very little to no character background story to the actual characters, this makes it very hard for the audience to relate to the characters and takes away a sense of presence from the characters as well. Another downside is that there doesn’t seem to be any character development to any other character apart from Nura Rikuo, with that said though there still is a little bit of character development to the other characters just not as much as Nura Rikuo.All in all the character art was done superbly though they could’ve added some background story to them.Boredom/Captivation Scale: 7.5Even though there were some done points to Nurarihyon no Mago there were also a lot of good points which do in the end balance it out a bit, due to this I did end up finding Nurarihyon no Mago an enjoyable watch though not the greatest watch.If they fixed up on a few things with character and plot then it would have been a much, much better watch and Anime.Personal Score: 7So the main question being would I recommend this anime, does the high points of Nurarihyon no Mago make up for all it low points, well no it doesn’t. However with that said at the ending of season 1, does show a lot of promise to what could happen in season 2, for starters the fact that eventually Nura Rikuo will become the 3rd Supreme Commander of all demons and he will use his influence to grow his ‘night horde’/allies and increase the reputation of the Nura Family which was stated to be at an all-time low. All these things and more I can see happening within season 2 and will quite frankly be disappointed if they don’t happen.So then yes, for anyone who can see potential in the season 2 of this anime if done correctly, I do recommend this Anime.Also with all the above said I have heard that season 2 does in fact blow season 1 out of the water.GenresAction: 7Even though the actions scenes where quite few and mostly short when they came, they were also packed with ability users usually using their ability to its utmost potential. The action scenes were short but epic.Abilities/Powers/Techniques: 8Nurarihyon no Mago is jam packed with all 3 abilities, powers and techniques. With things like martial arts to water bending and super strength Nurarihyon no Mago fills these criteria well.Supernatural: 6.5One of the main downsides I found to the supernatural factor of this Anime even though it was packed with demons, is that is does not address the other side of the coin which is angels and heaven. The whole Anime makes it seem that the only beings that can be considered as supernatural elements are demons, however understandable as it is an Anime heavily focused on demons, though it would have been nice to at least hear of angels or heaven.Demons: 9The demon factor for Nurarihyon no Mago was done incredibly well as most demons tend not to look alike and there is an incredibly large array of demons. potential up until episode 12-13 where it starts to clearly go downhill.Ending: 8The ending of Nurarihyon no Mago is really split into two parts, the first being action packed with some more character development from Nura Rikuo and the second being nice, happy and ‘smooth’.

Well in this young case it isn\'t....The Nura clan is the most respected demon clan in Japan at this moment in time; due to strong powers, strong numbers and the strongest willed family as the leaders this clan will forever be the best. The clan is unknown to humans all they know is that a Young boy named Nura lives there and...attends a school close by, but besides that no one elses is ever seen leaving this house. But when a human does approach all of the real inhabitants inside the demonic japanese mansion than all od the demons inside can magically turn into a plain looking human who seem to look like servants; we even see evidence of this in the first 2 episodes of their magically transformation powers which ""all"" demons seem to posses.All of the demons in this anime aren\'t actually named demons; in this they are called Yokai, hence why in english translation this anime is actually named Nura: Rise Of The Yokia clan. The family in this clan is kind of unusual. out of all of the animes i\'ve seen and read all of the way through this has to have the most strangest acting and most strangest appearing demons. The behaviour of these demons is controlled only by the element or the actual power that they posses; because of this some will be kind and gentle and some will be madly aggresive and hard hearted towards other members of the clan. But the biggest change of all for all of them is how they change around humans and their appearance change; just this can make a huge difference as soon as they turn themselves into their human form their behaviours immediately change to the most kindest and loyal person you would of ever met in your entire life.The main story line is about a young boy who i\'ve already mentioned; his full name is Rikuo Nura. In the anime and manga all he wants is to become a human for life and all he really acres about is looking after his friends and doing what ever is possible to avoid becoming the next leader of the clan. Because of this the story is mainly based around his life and those who are closest to him. The main aim in this story is for the nura clan itself to become a bit more protected by having a leader who won\'t let them down; to have more members who aren\'t just family and are even more loyal to them as they where to other clans and finally to become the best clan and even beat all of the rival clans in japan so they will be finally known as Japans most known demonic clan. Apart from all of this there are little side stories and a few filler episodes but some of them do actually serve a purpose in the series and will have some meaning; thats if you can actually understand what is supposed to be going in the episode and you can actually link it into the other episodes; if you can\'t do any of this then you may want to skip these episodes and have a quick guess at whats going on in the other episodes...... Make sense yet??There aren\'t that many main characters therefore i will only do one character profile.Rikuo Nura: Since a child he has always joked around about becoming a Yokai and playing stupid petty pranks on the other members of the clan and also joking about becoming thenext head of the clan. Later on at school a discussion arrises about the Yokais and what those demons are really like, this changed his mind about his whole life. Even though he lives the Yokai he decided to set his life strictly on becoming a human and by acheiving this goal he finishes good deeds for humans and attends school with them. Even though he joked around about everything he is supposed to do when he was younger, he actually rebels against the current head of the clan and does nothing that he\'s supposed to do. There is a twist though on this character and a few others, but mainly this one, as he isn\'t fully Yokai he is a human during the day so he is able to attendt school but can still sense, see and hear the demons. At night he can suddenly turn into the leader of the Yokai clan with strangely black and white long sticking out hair and a purple kimono to finish it off; even though he\'s a young boy in the human version at night he becomes a fully grown demonised man. There aren\'t actually many demons in the Nura clan who have actually seen him in this form but when one of them does she actually doesn\'t seem overly surprised about any of it (probably due to the calm element she is currently mastering).All in all this anime is amazing; up to date graphics, a story line that makes sense, not to many filler episodes and side stories, brilliant fighting scense, creative designs for the demons and an amazing lead character that has a bit of growing up to do.The anime can be found on youtube, other online streamers and the anime app Anime FTW.tv and can also be found on ebay and HMV. it\'s a great watch i wouldn\'t say buy it straight away, at least watch a few episodes and then buy. it\'s defiantly worth the time to watch and worth the time to find as it is brand new a few online streamers haven\'t currently got it uploaded.Advice: look around and send a few e-mails out to find who actually has the anime, if not then download the app AnimeFTW.tv and you\'ll find it under the N section, there will be two different ones but it\'ll be the same as the title on this review. If you are not able to find it anywhere just read the Manga it\'s equally as good as the anime and still has the action packed fighting scenes within. After all of that just be sure to sit back and enjoy....Saturday 4th Of May, 2013.     4:42 pm    ~AmyXxx attends a school close by, but besides that no one elses is ever seen leaving this house. But when a human does approach all of the real inhabitants inside the demonic japanese mansion than all od the demons inside can magically turn into a plain looking human who seem to look like servants; we even see evidence of this in the first 2 episodes of their magically transformation powers which ""all"" demons seem to posses.All of the demons in this anime aren\'t actually named demons; in this they are called Yokai, hence why in english translation this anime is actually named Nura: Rise Of The Yokia clan. The family in this clan is kind of unusual. out of all of the animes i\'ve seen and read all of the way through this has to have the most strangest acting and most strangest appearing demons. The behaviour of these demons is controlled only by the element or the actual power that they posses; because of this some will be kind and gentle and some will be madly aggresive and hard hearted towards other members of the clan. But the biggest change of all for all of them is how they change around humans and their appearance change; just this can make a huge difference as soon as they turn themselves into their human form their behaviours immediately change to the most kindest and loyal person you would of ever met in your entire life.The main story line is about a young boy who i\'ve already mentioned; his full name is Rikuo Nura. In the anime and manga all he wants is to become a human for life and all he really acres about is looking after his friends and doing what ever is possible to avoid becoming the next leader of the clan. Because of this the story is mainly based around his life and those who are closest to him. The main aim in this story is for the nura clan itself to become a bit more protected by having a leader who won\'t let them down; to have more members who aren\'t just family and are even more loyal to them as they where to other clans and finally to become the best clan and even beat all of the rival clans in japan so they will be finally known as Japans most known demonic clan. Apart from all of this there are little side stories and a few filler episodes but some of them do actually serve a purpose in the series and will have some meaning; thats if you can actually understand what is supposed to be going in the episode and you can actually link it into the other episodes; if you can\'t do any of this then you may want to skip these episodes and have a quick guess at whats going on in the other episodes...... Make sense yet??There aren\'t that many main characters therefore i will only do one character profile.Rikuo Nura: Since a child he has always joked around about becoming a Yokai and playing stupid petty pranks on the other members of the clan and also joking about becoming thenext head of the clan. Later on at school a discussion arrises about the Yokais and what those demons are really like, this changed his mind about his whole life. Even though he lives the Yokai he decided to set his life strictly on becoming a human and by acheiving this goal he finishes good deeds for humans and attends school with them. Even though he joked around about everything he is supposed to do when he was younger, he actually rebels against the current head of the clan and does nothing that he\'s supposed to do. There is a twist though on this character and a few others, but mainly this one, as he isn\'t fully Yokai he is a human during the day so he is able to attendt school but can still sense, see and hear the demons.

It was simple, straight forward and relatable. It's all about accepting who or more precisely what you are and accepting ones responsibilities so that's pretty cool.The art was okay, I wasn't amazed by it but it if very decent.The sound was good, especially loved the into sequence of the second half which was dope.Now where this anime loses a lot of it's flare is when it comes to characters. The good guys are all well and okay but the problem is the villains.  They start out with a big hype seeming to...be extremely powerful adversaries but turn out to be little more than a minor threat. They were just so anti climatic that they almost ruined this anime for me. After all what is a good heroe without a good villain.The general enjoyment is fun. It has a light hearted comedic tone so you won't necessarily get bored watching this anime.Now overall I'd say that it is a good anime to pass the time but don't expect to much for it or else you'll just be disappointed be extremely powerful adversaries but turn out to be little more than a minor threat.

It’s been quite a few year since manga ended and I couldn’t recall much of the storyline so I decided to rewatch it from the start. I didn’t know if I would enjoy it as much as I did but.....I fell in love again with this show.As someone who’s into mythology and historical genre I enjoy this show to the core. The animation is great. And night Rikuo’s seiyuu did an amazing job. The voice just suits him so well. The action scenes are really nice...too and so are the soundtracks. The animation of the Sakura tree is simply mesmerising. I wish I had one in my backyard too xDThe pacing of the story was fine by me. I’ve heard a lot of ppl say that the pacing is slow but I didn’t mind.The openings of this season are awesome. I still listen to the two songs till date and the endings are good as well.So If you’re into such genres revolving around youkai and ayakashi with modern and traditional blend then definitely give it a try! too and so are the soundtracks.

While I can ignore unrealistic age and pretend they are older than what they\'re supposed to be in...the anime, what I can not ignore is their intellectual level. I reckon stupid characters exist in nearly every anime, however, in the case of Nurarihyon no mago, at least 70% of them had about the same intellectual level as my 2 year old nephew. You know, when you tell a child ""don\'t touch the hot iron"" and the next thing you know is that is exactly what they\'re doing.More than a few characters were simply unnecessary to the story, many conversations were repetitive and shallow, the pace was slow and painful, and the climax didn\'t really feel like one, whether the conclusion was satisfying is questionable.These 24 episodes could have been compressed in a 13-15 episode series easily. the anime, what I can not ignore is their intellectual level.

I don\'t really differentiate the difference between good, decent, or poor Art/Sound. Only if a show either has exceptional or terrible Art/Sound, to me it\'s all the same. As to whether this show falls into either extreme I can tell you no. The Art/Sound was...fine for both seasons. My only gripe would be the slight increase in CGI in Season 2 that I was able to notice. When the show is 99% non-CGI, that 1% can feel out of place.I gave Season 1 an 8/10 and Season 2 a 7/10. The difference being Season 1 having two distinct Story Arcs, while Season 2 feels sometimes stretched with its single Story Arc.The Story and Characters are what drive the show. With an interesting story, albeit, cliched at times and unique characters that don\'t have the feeling of a quirky design to just make them stand out, as many shows do. My only complaint would be the main character\'s development undone when the plot needs there to be tension in the second season. 1 of 2 minor spoilers: by the end of season 1, the MC shows confidence, readiness to lead, and acceptance of who he is; then in season 2, those developments feel like their undone when the show wants him to feel inadequate for the current situation. This happens twice in season 2 and it can be a bit irritating.Possibly my only other disappointment in the story is with the opening of season 2 it feels like the show will go in a direction which would be the obvious next step for his character development: being mostly human and a quarter yokai, when the two sides clash will he side with humanity or his kin. Rather he is thrust into a conflict that revolves around his family\'s history. Settling the conflicts of his ancestors rather than his own, causes the show to make the MC feel like just another actor in the story. And, the additional past family grudge thrown in towards the end of season 2 makes things overly convoluted when they already felt somewhat convoluted.The 2nd minor spoiler, that was my reason for writing the review: the show has 52 episodes. MAL might say 24 but there are 4 extra ""digest"" episodes every 13 episodes, that only serve to recap the previous 12. A recap is especially annoying when its the last episode of a season is a replay of what you just watched. And, with how things end in season 2 feels pointless and wasted, because even with the 52 episodes this show has: it has no ending. Even the big story arc of season 2 doesn\'t have a real final conclusion.The obvious guess is the show ran out of source material, but the manga ends basically 1 year after season 2 ends. And, the amount of material a manga can produce in a year or so is not much when converted into Anime. The show ends with possibly somewhere between 6 to 12 episodes of content left. Why not just finish it off with a short season 3 or a movie?Overall, its a fun show with a good story and strong memorable characters, but the lack of an ending, real ending of season 2, makes the viewer feel like they were told 90% of a story with the storyteller just abruptly stopping before that last 10%. fine for both seasons.

The anime and its sequel (Nurarihyon no Mago: Sennen Makyo) were both rated as Very Good on Anime News Network and 11 000 000 mangas were sold in Japan, which shows that the anime and the manga were pretty well-received by the audience.I'd rate this anime in my top ten favorites anime. The character designs were pretty impressive, especially the yôkai aspect of Rikuo, the main character.  The characters were well-made, but were still a little bit cliché and mainstream shônen characters. But this doesn't take away the enjoyment I...felt from watching this anime. The story is a little bit similar to the anime Kateikyoushi Hitman Reborn!, which is also a really good anime. The fact that the main character has to choose between being a human or a Yôkai is really interesting.I'd recommend this anime to shônen adepts who don't want to watch a really long anime. felt from watching this anime.

However,...this is not how this show works, Nurarihyon focuses more on one of the genres that does not even appear as everyday life, or at least it is the image that leaves the viewer as soon as we obtain such a slow rhythm, accompanied by such a generic and uninteresting cast of characters. (especially by classmates), making it seem like the end product is simply ""defeating the monster of the week"".Another point that does not help from the perspective of an ""average Shonen"", is Art. Since to a great extent when we obtain scenes of ""action"" the planes are really very static and the battles are resolved in an unpleasant movement for the viewer.Finally I want to clarify that the Anime itself may not be bad if you have too many expectations regarding what has already been mentioned. If you have free time to continue the series and you want to see a story that is not episodic, but very slow, go ahead and you will like it.En Español:(No suelo dar puntuaciones a Animes que no finalizo por que me parece un trato injusto pero debido a las políticas de ""MAL"" me veo obligado hacerlo, por lo que trate de ser lo mas imparcial posible en la puntuacion espero sepan entender.)La verdad es que si bien el show funciona gracias a la trama enfocada hacia los Youkai, no es lo que esperaría de un Anime catalogado como ""Shonen"" sobretodo en sus 3 capítulos introductorios en los cuales uno esperaría  acción plena o al menos un desarrollo veloz hacia alcanzar el mismo foco. Sin embargo no es asi como funciona este espectaculo, Nurarihyon enfoca mas en base a uno de los géneros que ni siquiera aparece como la vida cotidiana, o por lo menos es la imagen que deja al espectador en cuanto obtenemos un ritmo tan lento, acompañado de un elenco personajes tan genérico y poco interesante. (sobretodo por los compañeros de clase), haciendo parecer así que el producto final es simplemente ""el derrotar al monstruo de la semana"".Otro punto que no ayuda desde la perspectiva de un ""Shonen promedio"", es el Arte. Ya que en gran medida cuando obtenemos escenas de ""acción"" los planos son realmente muy estáticos y las batallas se resuelven en un movimiento poco agradable al televidente.Por último quiero aclarar que el Anime en si puede no ser malo sino tienes demasiadas expectativas en cuanto a lo ya mencionado. Si tienes tiempo libre como para continuar la serie y deseas ver una historia que no es episódica, pero si muy lenta pues adelante y te agradara.. this is not how this show works, Nurarihyon focuses more on one of the genres that does not even appear as everyday life, or at least it is the image that leaves the viewer as soon as we obtain such a slow rhythm, accompanied by such a generic and uninteresting cast of characters.

It\'s been a full year since I watched Nurarihyon no Mago and I still have strong enough feelings about it to come back and write a review.This premise had everything. There was so much potential here! Youkai, yakuza themes, trying to maintain a normal school life throughout all of that- and yet it\'s terribly executed.Nurarihyon no Mago disappointed me to the core. I got invested enough in the characters to kind of enjoy it, but the second season lost me to pace. This review won\'t have big plot spoilers, but will talk about fight scenes and their...general outcomes.STORYThere\'s nothing wrong with the story. Well, not much. Well, it\'s not too bad. The plot itself is cool and all, but the pacing ruins it. This series feels like it\'s very stretched out, like they kept making more episodes just for the sake of it. The main characters seem to care more about looking cool than putting in any effort- the RAGE I felt when Rikuo just sat there multiple times watching the enemy escape like \'oh no! anyway,\'. Rikuo has main character syndrome like you\'ve never seen it, no one helps him in his fights because he easily defeats everyone he fights on his own, and he doesn\'t tell anyone to do anything even though he\'s supposed to be the commander. There is no strategy involved in this \'war\'.The show makes up reasons for enemies to get away that are ridiculous and occasionally blatantly sexist, and sometimes they don\'t bother making up a reason at all, the enemy just attacks and then leaves the main characters to recover. For what purpose?Some of the plot points are so very wasted. Yura was done dirty with the most standard subplot I\'ve ever seen, and it could\'ve been so good if they cared enough to put any effort into it.The transformation power seems cool until you realize that it\'s just there to fuel the secret identity and has barely any impact on the actual plot after the first two episodes. There are so many missed opportunities and it kills me. It\'s never even properly explained much less cleverly used like I expected it to be.ANIMATIONI\'m not usually picky on animation. I can enjoy vague art or shaky animation just fine. Nurarihyon, however, seems to go out of its way to make me annoyed. The animation switches jarringly between 2d and 3d. The fight scenes are dry and confusing at the same time. You can get used to the animation, but it\'s definitely not what I\'d call good.CHARACTERSRikuo is not likeable. This is a huge issue, because he needs to be on screen every minute of every episode, according to the producers. Rikuo is not only aggressive and careless with his clan, he also shows no determination or interest in anything ever. He\'s not caring, or hopeful, or even brash and loud. I think this changes a bit at the start of season 2, but a whole season with zero personality from the main character drags on.The rest of the characters have more personality than him, but they don\'t get much screentime individually. The show can\'t seem to decide if it wants to be a slapstick comedy or not, which makes the deadly aggression the clan sometimes throws around seem overdone and unbelievable. Yura is the only character that I felt had any depth. She\'s also very obviously a side character to Rikuo\'s big protagonist energy.The biggest problem with Rikuo\'s character is, I think, that they tried to make his night form \'mysterious\' and completely different from Rikuo. Because it has to be \'mysterious\' we don\'t get any internal monologue when he uses his night form. We never get a demonstration of his skills, or even get to hear what skills he has, or any gauge of power level. We don\'t know if he\'s training to use a sword or he\'s just instinctively a swords master. Not knowing what he can do makes the fight scenes feel like they have no stakes at all. No known limitations, no weaknesses, and Rikuo never even looks like he\'s struggling in a fight. They tried to make him look cool and failed in the basic setup of a compelling story. He gets one (1) scratch in twenty episodes and it doesn\'t even make him flinch.TL;DR:The villain, middle of the fight, ""this is a sideshow, do something entertaining""Me, looking up from my phone: Yeah! Do something entertaining!CONCLUSIONThis all being said, I enjoyed the start of the second season, and I\'m still passionate enough about this show to come back to it even now. I wouldn\'t be this mad about it if it was all bad. It was good enough for me to get invested, and bad enough to disappoint. general outcomes.STORYThere\'s nothing wrong with the story.

This review will be short compared to the other one I posted. You can find it here (change your browser to this number): reviewid=368582The characters were fun, we have a cute love triangle. My only complaints were with one of the human characters being annoying. You'll know who. And our MC who, in his human form, is a little B****. It's not unbearable though because he does start to grow up. He is only 12 but I dont mind annoyingly weak characters so long as they grow up. The problem with this anime is Season 2. Season 1 has some...kind of lackluster fights with makes sense, you're not super powerful so your characters may not be super powerful. Our MC's Demon friends and family are developed very well and 2 of the humans are developed well. The other 3 humans are wasted energy. In Season 2, I wanted to see more of our characters. All the humans are pointless save for one demon hunter but shes not a love interest.My overall for Series 1 is an 8 and Season 2 is a 5. The art, sound and dubs are great. What kills this anime is the story. It really is overrated. Loved the story with the first one so I give it an 8. I was excited for the next season as I wanted more. Now that I'm done... I will probably forget about this anime save for one of the cute love interests. kind of lackluster fights with makes sense, you're not super powerful so your characters may not be super powerful.

It is also about battle between clans as it is very famous and typical in Japanese stories. Fighting over territories and competing who should lead or not; It’s really like mafia clan battle but the difference is it’s a battle between yokai clans.About the CHARACTERSAs this is a story about yokai and leadership over countless of yokai, there are...quite a number of yokai. There are many interesting variations to choose from. However, there are really no particular likeable or memorable character. The grandpa is quite cool for his age. Sometimes, I still can’t believe that he really looked like the gorgeous Nurarihyon when he was younger. He’s younger version is a lot more gorgeous than the night form of Rikuo.About NURA RIKUONura Rikuo is somewhat the same with Natsume Takashi of Natsume Yujincho who started of bothered by Yokai. And also with Sawada Tsunayoshi from Katekyo Hitman Reborn for not wanting to succeed a leadership that is force to him. Gradually, as the series progresses all these three learn to accept it because it’s who they are. When someone has something to protect they always tend to get stronger and have an absolute resolve. He also has an alter ego who’s very different from him not only physically but with the whole personality just like a typical protagonist with a dark side or alter ego. Rikuo’s day form is not that impressive and the night form is way cooler. However, both are not particularly memorable, character-wise. I guess, the thing that’s admirable about him is his sense of responsibilities.About the ANIMATION and SOUNDSThe attention to details with the different yokai is really nice. I personally like how the Nurarihyon and Rikuo’s night form looks. Making the hair like that really helps on making him a yokai and stand out from the others, thus, really making him the boss. The whole Sakura petals scattering whenever the night form of Rikuo appears is really quite beautiful and cool.  Is it just me or one of the themes really sounds like the Harry Potter theme? It is also quite amazing that there’s a massive gathering of the most talented and famous seiyus in the series; from important characters to the small roles to villains.About the ENJOYMENTI gonna say, what’s with very young boys inheriting an extremely dangerous and important leaderships. If you’re a yokai or Japanese demons fanatic then this is absolutely for you. A yokai story is always a chance to learn more about Japanese folklore whether it is fictional or not. However, setting aside that I believe the pacing of the storyline is quite slow. Sometimes, episode would end without an important or exciting thing happening. It really makes the story less interesting. The plot is interesting enough, that much I can say but I believe it’s lacking a certain impact or certain excitement. It is not exactly what I expected it to be as I’ve really wanting to see this in a long time since everyone seems to like it. quite a number of yokai.

I picked it back up just recently because i had nothing else to watch and thought ""why not.""The plot can be very confusing sometimes and there\'s also questionable actions that the characters take. Despite those, the anime was very entertaining and fun to watch. It\'s hard to describe my experience with anything other than ""fun."" It made me feel like when i first started watching anime.The Story:The story was quite interesting and unique, something i...haven\'t seen before. I had a lot of fun with the changing stories of every few episodes.The Characters:The characters (especially the human friends) were well written and i thoroughly enjoyed watching the MC\'s friends run about and get themselves into trouble, it kept the story much more interesting. It was also very exciting when characters came close to discovering the MC\'s secret.The Art:The art is not the best and sometimes people will judge an anime for its artstyle. I would not make that mistake if i were you. This anime is extremely interesting. I made several mistakes on judging anime before such as Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure and Detective Conan which both had art styles i was not very happy with but the story made up for it.Conclusion:Unless you\'re one of those anime watchers who only watch anime for the animation, i recommend you watch this anime.

Nurarihyon no mago is kinda similar to Bleach just more supernatural. It has yokia, demons and awesome fight scenes.I luv the main character and his goals he 1/4 yokia but instead of harming people he wants to protect everyoneI luv the fights and the cast of characters that help nura on his journeyOverall this is a great series which is super underrated and definitely worth the watch it's way better than most...shouens of it's time and even today. shouens of it's time and even today."", 'Story: 8/10--It started VERY SLOW. I couldn\'t even get into the manga because of how long it took to get past the annoying introductory phase of the main character, Rikuo, which is why I started the anime to get some faster progression. After maybe...7 episodes in, you finally start to get past his indecision and see that, even though he denies wanting to be the successor, he still does all the work anyways because he wants to protect his friends. His friends are also practically in every episode. While they\'re there to be some sort of comic relief, I feel that they held back the...story from moving forward in a faster pace. When you FINALLY get into a real arc, that\'s when you can actually watch without rolling your eyes. That\'s when you can take it seriously and watch because of true interest, and not because of getting through the BS to get to the goods.Art: 10/10--This is what initially got me into the series in the first place. The art is just great. Some would say it\'s not, but the representation of those demons are all pretty good, and they get better in the sequel. Coloring is very bold, and details were graced upon the background when it counts.Sound: 7/10--For the most part, the soundtrack is supposed to be reminiscent of ancient feudal times in Japan. Not unlike Inuyasha\'s sountrack. It\'s also very similar in style to the game, ""Muramasa: The Demon Blade"". It sets the mood well enough, but I don\'t think it matched quite as well as it should have since the setting was more modern and the music was very old fashioned.Character: 7/10--I wished they touched on some character history more instead of putting nearly 100% focus on the main character, who is rather annoying when he\'s just a normal human. They touched on his romantic interest a lot through the show, but I can\'t stand how utterly dense she is. All of his ""friends"" have something quite annoying about them, which I suppose is meant for humor\'s sake, but it failed in my opinion. Antagonist characters are all obsessive. There isn\'t any depth to those characters at all.Enjoyment: 8/10--As much as there were a lot of times in which I just hated the stagnant flow of the anime, it did become more amusing later on. Progression is SLOW. Once and if you get past that, you won\'t have too much of a problem other than some irritating characters. story from moving forward in a faster pace.

The only time I ever felt invested was whenever the human characters aka Rikuo's mom and the Kiyojuji squad, were on screen.They're always a breath of fresh air considering how much time is spent being suffocated under the oversaturation of the arrogant and honestly unlikable yokai of the Nura clan.

Jujutsu Kaisen 2nd Season Recaps,https://myanimelist.net/anime/56243/Jujutsu_Kaisen_2nd_Season_Recaps,"[""I'm glad the makers decided to release these recap specials as it had been a long time since I personally revisited the first season of JJK. In fact, watching these back-to-back gave the story a chronological order, making the events more understandable. It also feels like the story of Gojo and his evolution as he teaches new students every time. Although it's a given that no one usually would jump to season 2 without watching season 1, these specials do a good job of summarizing the story so far and can help newcomers understand the plot before they prepare themselves for a much hyped next...arc all set to premiere next. I would still personally recommend checking out the episodes and the movie in their entirety to truly understand the characters and universe of JJK, but these specials which are also edited and paced tightly, hold a standalone entertaining value in themselves, therefore recommendable to anyone who wants to start JJK and also doesn't have the time to watch each and every episode or the movie. Of course, those who have watched the previous seasons and the movie might get disappointed with certain scenes not getting included, which is inevitable. However, these specials intend to summarize the story so far and help the viewer understand it in a chronological order, and it's a job this recap succeeds in doing without fail. arc all set to premiere next.

Senki Zesshou Symphogear AXZ,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32836/Senki_Zesshou_Symphogear_AXZ,"['""Fist 1, reason 0""Such a simple statement, yet so Symphogear!Senki Zesshou Symphogear AXZ is just utterly amazing experience for LA, from the first season\'s inconsistency but brimming with personality, to G going god damn crazy with it\'s plot and characters and was LA\'s personal favourite season of Symphogear to GX\'s still having it\'s own personality but felt less awesome in comparison to G and now AXZ comes into the fray and it\'s just as amazing...maybe even better?.From character development of the majority of the main cast as well as developing the new villains in this season and world building on the Alchemist that it did...in GX, crazier battles, awesome music and cliffhangers that Symphogear is well known for in making us always guessing what was gonna happen next.Character development happens to the majority of the characters, Maria gets one through her past even before G and her trying to get stronger to combat the new Alchemist threat with the help of Elfnein who has now joined SONG as a researcher of LiNKERs and general mission control (so bringing in world building through the knowledge of LiNKER), Chris gets one through new characters of Stephan and Sonia Virena voiced by Asuna Tomari and Natsumi Fujiwara respectively, as Sonia knew Chris\' parents before their deaths. Kirika and Shirabe gets one through trying to open up to everyone as well as their self-deprecative personality (Kirika for being too naive, Shirabe for keeping things to herself). Character interaction also gets a boost in combating the new villains of this season which also means NEW styles from the Symphogears we\'ve never seen before and crazier than ever seeing new ways of different duos fight Noise and the Alchemists. LA\'s favourite character has still been Chris since G, right next to Hibiki and Maria seeping into third place due to this season.For the villains however we get a more sympathetic villain in the form of Saint Germain voiced by Minako Kotobuki however she doesn\'t show it at first, her along with Cagliostro voiced by Aoi Shouta and Prelati voiced by Rina Hidaka have a bigger leader in the form of Adam voiced by Shinichiro Miki who is the leader of the Bavarian Illuminati who had influences but separate goals to Carol in GX. Adam however is probably the least interesting villain for this season all due to his goal and his asshole demeanor not only to the Symphogears but to Saint-Germain as well, in comparison to Saint-Germain and her Alchemists especially Cagliostro. Cagliostro gets some amazing fight scenes as well as her being a rather unpredictable character as well as her personality. Prelati however gets shafted due to her character-centric episode being kinda a awkward breather episode in comparison to Cagliostro\'s however is redeemed in the penultimate episode. LA\'s favourite villain for AXZ would be a tie between Cagliostro and Saint-Germain, Cagliostro for her personality and Saint-Germain for making the plot interesting. Nonetheless the villains are great in AXZ and to be honest MUCH better from Carol if only because of Saint-Germain and the Alchemists.The plot goes out all from the first episode immediately focusing on Saint-Germain\'s group and the Symphogears combating as well as finding their motive of why they are doing terrible things such as collecting life energy, the plot just never stops trucking along besides the aforementioned Prelati focused episode but that in itself was meant for Shirabe\'s character development. World building helps immensely as well as plot twists goes hand in hand as AXZ manages to reference events from ALL previous seasons (New Alchemists that tied into but no proper affiliation with Carol, Fine from Season 1 get referenced and Maria\'s past from G as well as some smaller events from G) that all ties up to AXZ\'s climaxes and plot threads. As for plot twists they do get explained later on and again even references back to previous season and although Symphogear is known for their asspulls, AXZ still had some but they did explain as much as possible and in certain cases there is enough suspension of disbelief that you can give it the grace it needs due to the awesomeness on screen that is happening. Seriously as bombastic and crazier, plot & character-focused AXZ has become away from the slice of life elements it had in the previous seasons to say that it\'s gotten even more serious, the writing is extremely clever like AXZ was the thread that was meant to tie up all 3 previous seasons together into one story that lead up to AXZ.The animation done once again by Satelight is amazingly bombastic like it should, from it\'s crazier and crazier battles, slicker character designs and decent backgrounding. Satelight did seem to have gone all out though at rare times, felt like some certain scenes did seem derpy but LA just did not care, the animation was impeccably amazing right down to the character designs, battle animation and special effects, rare derpiness be damned to Hibiki\'s fist!The voice acting is amazing as always, from Aoi Yuuki, Nana Mizuki, Ayahi Takagaki, Yoko Hikasa Ai Kayano, Yoshino Nanjo, Misaki Kuno, Minako Kotobuki, Aoi Shouta, Rina Hidaka, Shinchiro Miki and Hina Kino. Special mention would go to Ayahi Takagaki, Aoi Yuuki, Yoko Hikasa and Aoi Shouta for their amazing vocal range, battle cries and amazing dialogue, with Aoi Shouta crossdressing voices and doing it extremely well and Aoi Yuuki doing Hibiki like Hibiki as always and loving every time Aoi Yuuki\'s honed battle cries and battle dialogue are just fueled with adrenaline. Nana Mizuki probably gets best vocal voice acting through AXZ\'s OP ""TESTAMENT"" which was LA\'s favourite OP for Summer 2017 as well as Symphoear XD Unlimited\'s OP ""UNLIMITED BEAT"" (the mobile game\'s OP) as an insert song with heck even Ayahi Takagaki\'s ED for AXZ ""Futurism"" being great as well as LA never skipped the ED either. The voice acting and sound is AMAZING, expected from Symphogear.If there were any flaws LA saw from AXZ however is that Miku Kohinata, Hibiki\'s best friend voiced by Yuka Iguchi along with many of the minor characters (Hibiki\'s three trio posse for instance) kinda got shafted a bit due to all the serious business in taking down the Alchemist were thus Hibiki and the gang couldn\'t go to school as much, however this flaw got a bit of grace as they utilized Miku at least during the last few episodes and it made sense either way. On speaking of Hibiki, Hibiki got less screentime in favour of Maria, Chris and the new villains of this season but thankfully she became important in the later half of the season and even connected with the villains (especially Saint-Germain)  in some form or the other. Again Adam was probably the weakest villain in this season heck even to the point Carol had more promise than Adam did and again Prelati\'s focused episode was a breather episode but not much happened and Prelati got better by the final few episodes.EVEN SO...With these flaws, LA did see AXZ evolve even with all this, from the clever writing, character development that was VERY much needed to certain characters especially from Chris and Maria and the always bombastically musically fueled battles that never ceases to amaze LA time and again.The finale, well holy shit, although the scale of the final battle wasn\'t as HUGE as G, however the final battle was nonetheless jaw-droppingly amazing, batshit frantic and crazy as is Symphogear\'s fashion, even though there are asspulls in this finale, it is explained later on but seriously this finale was jaw-droppingly WHAT THE SHIT IS LA WATCHING BUT IS FREAKIN\' AMAZING and yeah because of that, the finale was done amazingly and gave a fulfilling finale all things considered. The final scenes of the final episode also hinted at something amazing as well that MANY fans wanted back and this hint may have been the ticket to it. Overall, this finale was amazing with many more to come due to the 5th season in the works and LA is even MORE hyped due to the revelation the finale gave us.Senki Zesshou Symphogear AXZ is LA\'s favourite anime for Summer 2017 and heck AXZ has been topping LA\'s ALL TIME FAVOURITE ANIMES list during it\'s release. It was thee ONLY anime of the Summer 2017 season where LA got pumped up to see what would happen next every episode, repetitively watching previous awesome episodes\' battles and speculating on the plot, AXZ in terms of Symphogear seasons ousted G from LA\'s favourite season all due to it\'s amazing plot progression, clever scripting, batshit crazier battles, character development and evolution, world building and and even grander spectacle of a finale than G.Senki Zesshou Symphogear AXZ went out with a blast with enough fuel to keep itself going and LA loved every moment of it but with another season in the works, it\'s a great time to be a Symphogear fan!... in GX, crazier battles, awesome music and cliffhangers that Symphogear is well known for in making us always guessing what was gonna happen next.Character development happens to the majority of the characters, Maria gets one through her past even before G and her trying to get stronger to combat the new Alchemist threat with the help of Elfnein who has now joined SONG as a researcher of LiNKERs and general mission control (so bringing in world building through the knowledge of LiNKER), Chris gets one through new characters of Stephan and Sonia Virena voiced by Asuna Tomari and Natsumi Fujiwara respectively, as Sonia knew Chris\' parents before their deaths.

Nonetheless the villains are great in AXZ and to be honest MUCH better from Carol if only because of Saint-Germain and the Alchemists.The plot goes out all from the first episode immediately focusing on Saint-Germain\'s group and the Symphogears combating as well as finding their motive of why they are doing terrible things such as collecting life energy, the plot just never stops trucking along besides the aforementioned Prelati focused episode but that in itself was meant for Shirabe\'s character development. World building helps immensely as well as plot twists goes hand in hand as AXZ manages to reference events from ALL previous seasons (New Alchemists that tied into but no proper affiliation with Carol, Fine from Season 1 get referenced and Maria\'s past from G as well as some smaller events from G) that all ties up to AXZ\'s climaxes and plot threads. As for plot twists they do get explained later on and again even references back to previous season and although Symphogear is known for their asspulls, AXZ still had some but they did explain as much as possible and in certain cases there is enough suspension of disbelief that you can give it the grace it needs due to the awesomeness on screen that is happening. Seriously as bombastic and crazier, plot & character-focused AXZ has become away from the slice of life elements it had in the previous seasons to say that it\'s gotten even more serious, the writing is extremely clever like AXZ was the thread that was meant to tie up all 3 previous seasons together into one story that lead up to AXZ.The animation done once again by Satelight is amazingly bombastic like it should, from it\'s crazier and crazier battles, slicker character designs and decent backgrounding. Satelight did seem to have gone all out though at rare times, felt like some certain scenes did seem derpy but LA just did not care, the animation was impeccably amazing right down to the character designs, battle animation and special effects, rare derpiness be damned to Hibiki\'s fist!The voice acting is amazing as always, from Aoi Yuuki, Nana Mizuki, Ayahi Takagaki, Yoko Hikasa Ai Kayano, Yoshino Nanjo, Misaki Kuno, Minako Kotobuki, Aoi Shouta, Rina Hidaka, Shinchiro Miki and Hina Kino. Special mention would go to Ayahi Takagaki, Aoi Yuuki, Yoko Hikasa and Aoi Shouta for their amazing vocal range, battle cries and amazing dialogue, with Aoi Shouta crossdressing voices and doing it extremely well and Aoi Yuuki doing Hibiki like Hibiki as always and loving every time Aoi Yuuki\'s honed battle cries and battle dialogue are just fueled with adrenaline. Nana Mizuki probably gets best vocal voice acting through AXZ\'s OP ""TESTAMENT"" which was LA\'s favourite OP for Summer 2017 as well as Symphoear XD Unlimited\'s OP ""UNLIMITED BEAT"" (the mobile game\'s OP) as an insert song with heck even Ayahi Takagaki\'s ED for AXZ ""Futurism"" being great as well as LA never skipped the ED either. The voice acting and sound is AMAZING, expected from Symphogear.If there were any flaws LA saw from AXZ however is that Miku Kohinata, Hibiki\'s best friend voiced by Yuka Iguchi along with many of the minor characters (Hibiki\'s three trio posse for instance) kinda got shafted a bit due to all the serious business in taking down the Alchemist were thus Hibiki and the gang couldn\'t go to school as much, however this flaw got a bit of grace as they utilized Miku at least during the last few episodes and it made sense either way. On speaking of Hibiki, Hibiki got less screentime in favour of Maria, Chris and the new villains of this season but thankfully she became important in the later half of the season and even connected with the villains (especially Saint-Germain)  in some form or the other. Again Adam was probably the weakest villain in this season heck even to the point Carol had more promise than Adam did and again Prelati\'s focused episode was a breather episode but not much happened and Prelati got better by the final few episodes.EVEN SO...With these flaws, LA did see AXZ evolve even with all this, from the clever writing, character development that was VERY much needed to certain characters especially from Chris and Maria and the always bombastically musically fueled battles that never ceases to amaze LA time and again.The finale, well holy shit, although the scale of the final battle wasn\'t as HUGE as G, however the final battle was nonetheless jaw-droppingly amazing, batshit frantic and crazy as is Symphogear\'s fashion, even though there are asspulls in this finale, it is explained later on but seriously this finale was jaw-droppingly WHAT THE SHIT IS LA WATCHING BUT IS FREAKIN\' AMAZING and yeah because of that, the finale was done amazingly and gave a fulfilling finale all things considered. The final scenes of the final episode also hinted at something amazing as well that MANY fans wanted back and this hint may have been the ticket to it. Overall, this finale was amazing with many more to come due to the 5th season in the works and LA is even MORE hyped due to the revelation the finale gave us.Senki Zesshou Symphogear AXZ is LA\'s favourite anime for Summer 2017 and heck AXZ has been topping LA\'s ALL TIME FAVOURITE ANIMES list during it\'s release. It was thee ONLY anime of the Summer 2017 season where LA got pumped up to see what would happen next every episode, repetitively watching previous awesome episodes\' battles and speculating on the plot, AXZ in terms of Symphogear seasons ousted G from LA\'s favourite season all due to it\'s amazing plot progression, clever scripting, batshit crazier battles, character development and evolution, world building and and even grander spectacle of a finale than G.Senki Zesshou Symphogear AXZ went out with a blast with enough fuel to keep itself going and LA loved every moment of it but with another season in the works, it\'s a great time to be a Symphogear fan!...', 'Context: I am a rather big Symphogear fan who was extremely let down by GX, and considered not even watching AXZ after the train wreck that came before it.And I am very glad that I didn\'t miss out on it.From the start to (almost) the finish AXZ has been nothing short of amazing. There\'s some weird metaphors and phrasing but it\'s Symphogear so I mostly expected that.Unlike the previous season, and even the first, every episode (with one exception) was fulfilling and enjoyable, with each making me more excited for the next one. The character development of each character was very natural and fitting,...and Hibiki especially was a massive step up from previous seasons. The use of the Gears was one of the best parts of the season, which each being used in new and unique ways, changing things up from the expected patterns of attacks. Chris in particular has this going for her as instead of her gun spamming she mostly uses various bows, with a more interesting use of her missiles added into it. It felt as a whole like they\'re all more experienced, which they\'d started to hit on in G for the original three but was sorely lacking in GX. They\'re also animated incredibly well, as is the show as a whole, with the obvious exception of far shots where everyone looks like mush, but that\'s in every anime.And of course, the real reason everyone is watch Symphogear, the music. The one good part of GX was the character songs, and even in that area AXZ stepped it up. Every track is superb with the only one lacking being Tsubasa, and even then it\'s still pretty good. There\'s more combo songs, a triplet for both the main and second team, as well as various duets of unexpected combinations. Every track is wonderful and fits the fights they\'re placed in very well.It\'d be hard to top the villains of GX for me as Garie and Carol are some of my favorite villains in anything let alone Symphogear, and while it didn\'t quite make it to their levels for me the villains were certainly great. The alchemists are sympathetic without forcing you to feel bad for them and have bursting personality and small quirks that make them often come out standing over the main cast. Adam remained charismatic and intimidating the entire way, even if his reveal had me yelling ""THAT\'S JUST SINBAD"" at his character design. The only lacking one would be Tiki, and that was only towards the end when she started getting annoying to me.As a whole this season was amazing and made me fully willing to recommend Symphogear to people after GX made me hesitant to do so. The characters, art, sound, story, everything is incredible. My only real complaint is how... terrible episode 12 was. But one 1 out of 13 being bad when the rest are amazing is an acceptable loss for me as many shows have had worse. Other than that, there wasn\'t enough Last Action Hero.Watch it, love it, and hold a determination to fist.Oh yeah also Miku was here sometimes and p good when she was. Let\'s give her back her Gear in s5.Also yes I have watched all 13 eps I forgot to update my watched list before writing this.

And here I am writing another review for season 4, can't believe i made it this far and I enjoyed every single episodes of it. I'll start with the pros and cons of this show.The pros : The animation this season is veeery good compared to the the last season and much much more than the first season. The battles are very cool and fluid, they're also much more action packed than the last one. Hell, even the final battle is cool. Also, the transformation scenes are fucking LIT, every time they transform I always get excited af....The characters are also more developed here and very likeable. I've grown from hating Hibiki in season 1 to actually liking her here at season 4. Can't forget about the awesome soundtracks tho, they're the main highlight of this anime. The opening, while not as good as GX, is still a banger this season. The battle songs are also great.The cons : Tbh, The story isn't really interesting for me, it still follows the same pattern as in G. GX provided something different but it doesn't really stick out for me. We got three new villains with the same abilities as the wielders (sounds familiar?), an autoscorer and a dude who wears a suit and fedora, which is actually the real villain (sounds a lot like Dr. Ver right?) also, they're the fucking Illuminati, how crazy is that??. They didn't really explained it that well about their plans and motivation so that one felt flat to me so I'm a bit confused at certain points in the story. The world building is also confusing af. Idk where they got the alca-noises, how the alchemist is somehow in there, Ogawa being a FUCKING NINJA and how Genjuurou gets to fight on par with the wielders, even stronger than them. There's a lot of confusing things, but it'll be too much if I add all of them here. The dialogues can be a bit cheesy at times and i sometimes cringe at it.Overall : I mainly enjoy this anime for the characters, soundtrack and animations. The story might not be that great, but at least it's somewhat enjoyable because of how crazy it is sometimes. Piece of advice, watch it without really thinking about it too much, just have fun. This anime is perfect for you if you enjoy mindless fun. Thanks for reading. The characters are also more developed here and very likeable.

(seriously MAL you couldn\'t find something else to put in here :D)Well basically there is a new threat to mankind and the girls are facing a new challenge with how to deal with this new enemy. Conflict, friendship, and explosions the perfect Symphogear formulaStory (7/10):One line from episode 2 will summarize the whole thing ""fist 1 reason 0"" :DIf you have watched the previous Symphogear seasons (and you probably did or else you wouldn\'t be watching the 4th one) you will see that this season offers you more of the same.Like i said in the Synopsis this season...will present a new challenge to the girls that they must overcome to protect mankind once again so fans of the series will be pleased to have their favorite formula.Again the process of the story is exactly the same as the previous seasons and i mean exactly the same. The way the enemy is introduced the ups and downs of the plot everything except a little difference in the conclusion is the same (which might be a little bothersome)Characters (8/10):I think the characters are one of the key factors to how you will enjoy this anime as their stories and histories and relationships move the plot forward.Some of the girls will face their pasts once again and in the process will learn to move beyond some hurdles that were hampering their progressFriendship and relationships (connection in general) always have a high priority in Symphogear as ususalThe villains characters are similar to the previous seasons which will make them kind of predictable and lessen the surprise factorArt and Animation (7/10):EXPLOSIONS!! EXPLOSIONS EVERY WHERE they show is full of flashy new explosions, moves, and transformations (This will be the second key factor for enjoying the show). You will never get bored watching thisaside from the action sequences the show look average on every aspect whither it\'s characters environment or movements but it\'s the same design as the previous season so points for constancyMusic & VA (8/10):This is the 3rd key factor for show enjoyment. Symphogear = Songs which means you will be hearing alot fo them both old ones and new ones. As with the previous season struggles and pain will show up in the voices during the songs which will give you discord but will offer more immersion (i mean what human would take a blast to the face and keep singing normally :D)OP and ED match the show vibe perfectlyEffectiveness (8/10):This is Symphogear so if you are watching it you should not be expecting a complex and thought provoking plot, you should be expecting however outrageous action and explosions and lots of music and an emphasis on friendship which the show deliver to the fullest. It is a crazy ride that will keep you entertained the entire timeOverall (7.5/10) will present a new challenge to the girls that they must overcome to protect mankind once again so fans of the series will be pleased to have their favorite formula.Again the process of the story is exactly the same as the previous seasons and i mean exactly the same.

But, lo-and-behold, I found that AXZ is the epitome of what every Symphogear series should be! It was so satisfying from beginning to end, and even when the series was already over, I was still cheering, ""Oh my god! Symphogear is so cool!"" So, yes, AXZ temporarily transformed me into an excitable, little child!⚠️ This review will have spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersThis season starts out strong, when yet again, Chris comes vis-à-vis with her personal demons. There\'s a strong scene when she...accidentally shoots a little Brazilian boy, named Stephan; and she gets blamed for his injury, and this really wounds her because of the association that their families had. Chris is forced to grapple with her childhood, once more, and comes to terms with what it means to be a savior of mankind. It\'s heartbreaking to see Chris relive memories of her parents\' deaths; one of her strongest character moments in the entire franchise!The amount of character development density increases, when Elfnein enters Maria\'s memories (in the same fashion as the movie, ""The Cell"") in Episode 5: Risking Your Life in a Fictional Theater. In a span of two episodes, Maria is forced to contend directly with her inner-struggles and childhood abuse. There are even some weird implications that she may have harbored romantic feelings for John Wayne Vercingetorix? And if that is the case, Maria was possibly the victim of child grooming and Stockholm syndrome? Either way, in the very end, Maria is able to properly face her fears and uncertainties, to come to a greater understanding of herself and an appreciation of her friends.Not to mention that later in the series, Kirika has to fight away from Shirabe, and has a panic attack from separation anxiety. They are forced to face their own separate trials, as Shirabe is also reunited with her estranged grandfather! Hibiki is also brought head-to-head with her uncertainty and self-doubt in the final battle, and is revealed to be the ultimate badass. This season is just chalk-full of beautiful and touching characters moments, each of the alchemical triad even has a small emotional arc. A very exceptional arc, in the character writing department!The plot also comes together like clockwork, each cog in the machine renders itself useful to the grand finale, which quite frankly, blew my socks off! It was just so grandiose, phantasmagoric, and well-choreographed. Each sequence had an incredible pay-off, and Hibiki\'s birthday party and her intimate moment on the balcony with Miku, was so eloquent, because her fight against the Bavarian Illuminati was the bravest she had ever been, in the face of adversity! The last episodes felt so rewarding and harmonious!Bonus: This season was extra exciting, for me personally. Because I\'m naturally a speculative thinker, I\'ve researched almost every conspiracy theory out there, so finding the correlations between the folklore about the actual Bavarian Illuminati and the representation of them in the anime was great fun! Here\'s a compilation of similarities:* The leader of the Bavarian Illuminati in the anime is the actual founder of the secret society, in real life. Adam Weishaupt is credited for creating the underground freemason group, the Bavarian Illuminati, in 1748. In the anime, Weishaupt is portrayed as being a fedora-wearing, pedophilic, nudist.* Pedophilia scandels with the Illuminati: In the AXZ anime, Adam is shown to be rather intimate with Tiki, the doll-girl with the child-like body.* Child sacrifice: Adam sacrifices Tiki, to transform himself into a giant Baphomet-like demon, an actual monument in the Church of Satan. And is said to have a correlation to the Bavarian Illuminati.* Trangender characters: There are many theories that men have been disguising themselves as women, and vis-versa, for centuries. There have even been conspiracy theories about people employing the use of alchemy to change genders or to use full-on shapeshifting, so it\'s interesting that they chose to make the Illuminati characters androgynous.* Saint-Germain, Alessandro Cagliostro, and François Prelati were all real, historical figures; that were said to have dipped their fingers in magic and alchemy.—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Katsumi Ono (director), notable works:* Beast Saga* Girly Air Force ✅* Hataraki Man* Hypnosis Mic: Division Rap Battle — Rhyme Anima* Isekai Izakaya: Koto Aitheria no Izakaya Nobu* Master Mosquiton \'99* Yū☆Gi☆Ō! 5D\'s* Yū☆Gi☆Ō!

After the first season, I was unsure of whether I could get attached to any of the characters, but the later seasons are a Herculean fusion of some of the coolest action scenes in ""Dragon Ball Z"" with sweet, saccharine shōjo-ai! I play the mobile game for ""Hypnosis Mic: Division Rap Battle,"" so now, I\'m super stoked to try out the anime adaptation!

I don\'t think I\'ve ever met one person who has remotely disliked her character! While being a hardcore tsundere, she\'s also very caring, kind, and empathetic; despite, her backstory and immense trauma during her stead as a villainess, in the first season! In my opinion, Chris is one of the best examples of a reformed adversary, and she kicks a lot of butt, too! Wonderful character and a phenomenal job overall, on the part of the seiyū and the writing team!Yuka Iguchi as Miku Kohinata, notable roles:* Arisa Hoshigaoka, Arata naru Sekai: World\'s/Start/Load/End (""World\'s End"")* Maria Takayama, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (""Haganai: I don\'t have many friends"")* Mako Nakarai, Bokura no ✅* Honoka Sawada, Chibi☆Devi!* Yashiro Hoshimiya, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko (""Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl"") ✅* Shima, Devidol!* Sherry and Chelia Blendy, Fairy Tail* Tamaki Irie, Ginga Kikōtai Majestic Prince* Mako Reizei, Girls und Panzer ✅* Suwako Moriya, Hifū Katsudō Kiroku: The Sealed Esoteric History ✅* Myne, Honzuki no Gekokujō: Shisho ni Naru Tame ni wa Shudan wo Erandeiraremasen (""Ascendance of a Bookworm"")* Naeka Fujiwara, Kamen no Maid Guy* Kaga, Tenryū, Tatsuta, Tone, and Chikuma — Kantai Collection (""KanColle"") ✅* Shizume Seo, Kara no Kyōkai ✅* Natsuko Ishikura, Koitabi: True Tours Nanto* Luea, Lady Jewelpet* Chinatsu Morikawa, Lostorage Incited WIXOSS* Rinna Fuwa, Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to the Animation* Subaru Konoe, Mayo Chiki!* Tsukihi Araragi, Monogatari (series) ✅* Kaede Mizumo, Nyan Koi!* Mitsuba Sangū, Owari no Seraph* Crusch Karsten, Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu ✅* Maho Misawa, Rō-Kyū-Bu! ✅* Yū Sonda, Sakura Trick* Hibari, Senran Kagura ✅* Astarte, Strike the Blood* Norie Okazaki, Tamayura* Yuzuha Aigae, Tenshi no 3P! ✅* Mea Kurosaki, To LOVEる ✅* Librorum Prohibitorum Index, Toaru Majutsu no Index (""A Certain Magical Index"") ✅* Aiko Andō, True Tears* Mirei Shikishima, Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid* Aoi Yukimura, Yama no Susume ✅Commentary: Despite everyone\'s dislike for Index\'s voice in ""Toaru Majutsu no Index,"" I am a fan of Ms. Iguchi\'s discography! Her role as Miku Kohinata is doting and maternal, and it reminded me of her roles as Tsukihi Araragi in the ""Monogatari"" series! She has a very charming, earthly aura when she plays certain characters — when they\'re not ecstatic, they\'re often very practical like Crusch Karsten from ""Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu""! Magnificent job in making Miku stand out, even though she starts out as a side character!

In the past, I have described Yoko Hikasa as a type of sexy, temptress archetype! She has often voiced demons, very evil characters (Nashetania Loei Piena Augustra in ""Rokka no Yūsha"" and Nanako Saeki in ""Aku no Hana"" are a couple of examples), and even representations of Satan herself! Maria starts out very much an anti-hero, she has a Spawn cloak, and an undying loyalty for her controllers; but, despite this, deep down... Maria is very caring, and the protectiveness that she feels for Kirika and Shirabe, eventually extends to her other friends, as well! Even in later seasons, Ms. Hikasa is alarmingly good at conveying Maria\'s fight between her newfound morality and her brainwashed upbringing! Great character, wonderful seiyū!Ai Kayano as Kirika Akatsuki, notable roles:* Akari Kawamoto, 3-Gatsu no Lion ✅* Futaba Ōki, Amanchu! ✅* Mikono Suzushiro, Aquarion Evol* Anya Dostoyevskaya, Aria the Avvenire* Kaga and Atago, Azur Lane* Hana Mutō, Captain Earth* Kanade Ōe, Chihayafuru ✅* Ponoka, Choboraunyopomi Gekijō Ai Mai Mii ✅* Anna Clément, Code Geass: Akito the Exiled ✅* Mikan Tsumiki, Danganronpa 3* Maihime Shirayuki, Dokyū Hentai HxEros* Mimi, Flip Flappers ✅* Megumi Sakura, Gakkōgurashi!

She\'s straight-forward and typically the most unassuming girl out of the group. She\'s simplistic and often even hard-headed, but she always means well, and she will risk her life for her partner, Shirabe! Ms. Kayano did an excellent job with this character, S-tier performance!Toshino Nanjō as Shirabe Tsukuyomi, notable roles:* Sonia, Berserk ✅* Naoto Miura, Clockwork Planet* Koko Tsukishima, Da Capo* Gankyō Kūrubiyūtei, Joshiraku* Eri Ayase, Love Live! ✅* Matsuri Sengen, Mahō Shōjo Taisen* Robu, Neko no Robu* Panpaka, Panpaka Pants Movie: Bananan Ōkoku no Hihō* Nene Kurio, Penguin Musume♥Heart* Akiho Senomiya, Robotics;Notes* Lise Hohenstein, Schwarzesmarken ✅Commentary: Ms. Nanjō has less speaking roles with the archetypically kūdere, Shirabe, but when she does has a time to shine—she\'s sweet, smart, and insightful!

Great role as a sinister antagonist, though; his role as Adam brings to mind his other malevolent-sounding performances, like Kaiki Deishū (""Monogatari"") and Shiso Mikagi (""Ayashi no Ceres"").

She usually is typecast as the morally ambiguous, ""rich girl"" kind of character. And, while Saint-Germain starts out being morally ambivalent, she turned out being one of Ms. Kotobuki\'s most powerful and majestic roles, to date!

He has primarily been cast as bishōnen characters, though his role as Cagliostro is a flirtatious, transgendered female. Cagliostro states that he was originally male, but preferred living in a female body, so he transmuted it to have lady parts, with the power of magic.

My favorite roles from her, have been Ririchiyo Shirakiin (""Inu x Boku SS""), Airi Kashii (""Rō-Kyū-Bu!""), Tamamo-no-Mae (""Sasami-san@Ganbaranai""), Logia (""Show By Rock!!""), Keiko Ayano (""Sword Art Online""), Anko Kitashirakawa (""Tamako Market""), and Kurumi Nukui (""Tenshi no 3P!""). As Prelati, she\'s a deadly alchemist with a kūdere streak, but despite this, Ms. Hidaka\'s performance still makes you want to give her a hug! Great seiyū!Hina Kino as Tiki, notable roles:* Hanako Hondo, Asobi Asobase ✅* Funicia Raffaeli, Kanata no Astra ✅* Ranka Ōkami, Murenase! Seton Gakuen ✅* Fuwa, Star☆Twinkle PreCure ✅* Kaede Kurushima, Steins;Gate 0 ✅* Linel Synthesis Twenty-Eight, Sword Art Online ✅* Sayaka Itomi, Toji no Miko ✅Commentary: Ms. Kino needs more roles! It\'s very rare that I love absolutely every performance that I\'ve seen from a voice actress, but here we are! Tiki is a malevolent Autoscorer, created by the Illuminati, she is what I would call ""hilariously evil,"" especially in the scene where she\'s shrieking and grabbing Adam\'s leg, he kicks her after tripping, and then Hibiki kicks his butt! Ms. Kino is really talented at comedy roles, I can\'t even say how many times she made me laugh out loud, while watching Asobi Asobase! Amazing seiyū; give her more work, please!Man, this show packed such a punch! As a creator myself, I still find it incredible how the script came full circle: going through cycles of grief, harrowing tragedies, and then to triumvirate scenes of karmic retribution and the girls all being able to overcome their set of diverse circumstances, to kick some major booty! I truly love this season—Symphogear G solidified my status as a fan, while AXZ made it one of my favorite series of all time! Senki Zesshō Symphogear AXZ (Season Four) gets a 9/10 and an imaginary must-watch label stamped on its BD cover!Rankings:Senki Zesshō Symphogear (Season One) ★★☆☆☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear G (Season Two) ★★★★☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear GX (Season Three) ★★★☆☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear AXZ (Season Four) ★★★★★Senki Zesshō Symphogear XV (Season Five) ★★★☆☆ accidentally shoots a little Brazilian boy, named Stephan; and she gets blamed for his injury, and this really wounds her because of the association that their families had. Chris is forced to grapple with her childhood, once more, and comes to terms with what it means to be a savior of mankind. It\'s heartbreaking to see Chris relive memories of her parents\' deaths; one of her strongest character moments in the entire franchise!The amount of character development density increases, when Elfnein enters Maria\'s memories (in the same fashion as the movie, ""The Cell"") in Episode 5: Risking Your Life in a Fictional Theater. In a span of two episodes, Maria is forced to contend directly with her inner-struggles and childhood abuse. There are even some weird implications that she may have harbored romantic feelings for John Wayne Vercingetorix? And if that is the case, Maria was possibly the victim of child grooming and Stockholm syndrome? Either way, in the very end, Maria is able to properly face her fears and uncertainties, to come to a greater understanding of herself and an appreciation of her friends.Not to mention that later in the series, Kirika has to fight away from Shirabe, and has a panic attack from separation anxiety. They are forced to face their own separate trials, as Shirabe is also reunited with her estranged grandfather! Hibiki is also brought head-to-head with her uncertainty and self-doubt in the final battle, and is revealed to be the ultimate badass. This season is just chalk-full of beautiful and touching characters moments, each of the alchemical triad even has a small emotional arc. A very exceptional arc, in the character writing department!The plot also comes together like clockwork, each cog in the machine renders itself useful to the grand finale, which quite frankly, blew my socks off! It was just so grandiose, phantasmagoric, and well-choreographed. Each sequence had an incredible pay-off, and Hibiki\'s birthday party and her intimate moment on the balcony with Miku, was so eloquent, because her fight against the Bavarian Illuminati was the bravest she had ever been, in the face of adversity! The last episodes felt so rewarding and harmonious!Bonus: This season was extra exciting, for me personally. Because I\'m naturally a speculative thinker, I\'ve researched almost every conspiracy theory out there, so finding the correlations between the folklore about the actual Bavarian Illuminati and the representation of them in the anime was great fun! Here\'s a compilation of similarities:* The leader of the Bavarian Illuminati in the anime is the actual founder of the secret society, in real life. Adam Weishaupt is credited for creating the underground freemason group, the Bavarian Illuminati, in 1748. In the anime, Weishaupt is portrayed as being a fedora-wearing, pedophilic, nudist.* Pedophilia scandels with the Illuminati: In the AXZ anime, Adam is shown to be rather intimate with Tiki, the doll-girl with the child-like body.* Child sacrifice: Adam sacrifices Tiki, to transform himself into a giant Baphomet-like demon, an actual monument in the Church of Satan. And is said to have a correlation to the Bavarian Illuminati.* Trangender characters: There are many theories that men have been disguising themselves as women, and vis-versa, for centuries. There have even been conspiracy theories about people employing the use of alchemy to change genders or to use full-on shapeshifting, so it\'s interesting that they chose to make the Illuminati characters androgynous.* Saint-Germain, Alessandro Cagliostro, and François Prelati were all real, historical figures; that were said to have dipped their fingers in magic and alchemy.—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Katsumi Ono (director), notable works:* Beast Saga* Girly Air Force ✅* Hataraki Man* Hypnosis Mic: Division Rap Battle — Rhyme Anima* Isekai Izakaya: Koto Aitheria no Izakaya Nobu* Master Mosquiton \'99* Yū☆Gi☆Ō! 5D\'s* Yū☆Gi☆Ō! Arc-VCommentary: Haven\'t watched many of Mr. Ono\'s discography, but his choreography in the Symphogear series is awe-inspiring! After the first season, I was unsure of whether I could get attached to any of the characters, but the later seasons are a Herculean fusion of some of the coolest action scenes in ""Dragon Ball Z"" with sweet, saccharine shōjo-ai!

I think that Ms. Yūki strong personality translates well in the case of Hibiki Tachibana, a cute girl that is strong-spirited and has a cosmic punch, that is practically unrivaled! Hibiki reminded me of my best girl in Girls und Panzer (""Miho Nishizumi"") and for the most part, tries to her best to keep the peace. Aoi Yūki did a wonderful job at making her cute, charming, relatable, and a fighter! Excellent seiyū!Nana Mizuki as Tsubasa Kazanari, notable roles:* Nanase Kotobuki, ""Bungaku Shōjo""* Allison Whittington and Lillianne Aicasia Corazón Whittington-Schultz, Allison to Lillia* Akiko, Aoi Bungaku Series* Oboro Iga, Basilisk* Kururu, Binzume Yōsei* Saya Kisaragi, Blood-C* Angelise Ikaruga Misurugi, Cross Ange: Tenshi to Ryū no Rondo* Misaki Kirihara, Darker Than Black: Kuro no Keiyakusha* Nanami Takatsuki and Ricotta Elmar, Dog Days* Hannah, Dragon\'s Dogma* Sieglinde Baumgarde, Dragonaut: The Resonance* Cisqua, Erementar Gerad* Wrath, Fullmetal Alchemist ✅* Bi Fei, Gin no Guardian* Lydia Carlton, Hakushaku to Yōsei* Tsubomi Hanasaki, HeartCatch!

PreCure (""Tsubomi Hanasaki"")! Ms. Mizuki conveys the anguished, yet distinguished nature of Tsubasa\'s character in a very charming and likable way! Over the span of the series, we deeply sympathize with her feelings of grief over her dead girlfriend, Kanade; as well as the struggle that she has, when pitted against the corrupt system that her wealthy family has implemented. Great character, great seiyū!Ayahi Takagaki as Chris Yukine, notable roles:* Kuro, Ao no Exorcist* Kotoha, Arata: The Legend* Suiren, Battle Spirits: Shōnen Toppa Bashin* Daina Kurogami, Beyblade Burst* Roana Dan, Blade & Soul* Nene, Canaan ✅* Takuto Tatsunagi, Cardfight!!

I don\'t think I\'ve ever met one person who has remotely disliked her character! While being a hardcore tsundere, she\'s also very caring, kind, and empathetic; despite, her backstory and immense trauma during her stead as a villainess, in the first season! In my opinion, Chris is one of the best examples of a reformed adversary, and she kicks a lot of butt, too! Wonderful character and a phenomenal job overall, on the part of the seiyū and the writing team!Yuka Iguchi as Miku Kohinata, notable roles:* Arisa Hoshigaoka, Arata naru Sekai: World\'s/Start/Load/End (""World\'s End"")* Maria Takayama, Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai (""Haganai: I don\'t have many friends"")* Mako Nakarai, Bokura no ✅* Honoka Sawada, Chibi☆Devi!* Yashiro Hoshimiya, Denpa Onna to Seishun Otoko (""Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl"") ✅* Shima, Devidol!* Sherry and Chelia Blendy, Fairy Tail* Tamaki Irie, Ginga Kikōtai Majestic Prince* Mako Reizei, Girls und Panzer ✅* Suwako Moriya, Hifū Katsudō Kiroku: The Sealed Esoteric History ✅* Myne, Honzuki no Gekokujō: Shisho ni Naru Tame ni wa Shudan wo Erandeiraremasen (""Ascendance of a Bookworm"")* Naeka Fujiwara, Kamen no Maid Guy* Kaga, Tenryū, Tatsuta, Tone, and Chikuma — Kantai Collection (""KanColle"") ✅* Shizume Seo, Kara no Kyōkai ✅* Natsuko Ishikura, Koitabi: True Tours Nanto* Luea, Lady Jewelpet* Chinatsu Morikawa, Lostorage Incited WIXOSS* Rinna Fuwa, Mangaka-san to Assistant-san to the Animation* Subaru Konoe, Mayo Chiki!* Tsukihi Araragi, Monogatari (series) ✅* Kaede Mizumo, Nyan Koi!* Mitsuba Sangū, Owari no Seraph* Crusch Karsten, Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu ✅* Maho Misawa, Rō-Kyū-Bu! ✅* Yū Sonda, Sakura Trick* Hibari, Senran Kagura ✅* Astarte, Strike the Blood* Norie Okazaki, Tamayura* Yuzuha Aigae, Tenshi no 3P! ✅* Mea Kurosaki, To LOVEる ✅* Librorum Prohibitorum Index, Toaru Majutsu no Index (""A Certain Magical Index"") ✅* Aiko Andō, True Tears* Mirei Shikishima, Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid* Aoi Yukimura, Yama no Susume ✅Commentary: Despite everyone\'s dislike for Index\'s voice in ""Toaru Majutsu no Index,"" I am a fan of Ms. Iguchi\'s discography! Her role as Miku Kohinata is doting and maternal, and it reminded me of her roles as Tsukihi Araragi in the ""Monogatari"" series! She has a very charming, earthly aura when she plays certain characters — when they\'re not ecstatic, they\'re often very practical like Crusch Karsten from ""Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu""! Magnificent job in making Miku stand out, even though she starts out as a side character! Superb seiyū!Yoko Hikasa as Maria Cadenzavna Eve, notable roles:* Hana Suguruno, 7 Seeds* Hibiki Tenshō, Aikatsu Friends!: Kagayaki no Jewel* Nanako Saeki, Aku no Hana ✅* Tio Clarce, Arifureta Shokugyō de Sekai Saikyō (""Arifureta: From Commonplace to World\'s Strongest"")* Tomoe Udagawa, BanG Dream ✅* Farnese de Vandimion, Berserk ✅* Fighter, Bikini Warriors* Erica Blandelli, Campione!: Matsurowanu Kamigami to Kamigoroshi no Maō ✅* Kiyono Amahara, Chu-Bra!!* Ayano Kōsaka, Code Geass: Akito the Exiled ✅* Sakura Sakurakōji, Code:Breaker* Kyōko Kirigiri, Danganronpa ✅* Sakie Satō, Demi-chan wa Kataritai (""Interviews With Monster Girls"") ✅* Brioche d\'Arquien, Dog Days* Hina Tachibana, Domestic no Kanojo* Freya, Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darō ka (""Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?"") ✅* Ao Gennai, Frame Arms Girl* Kei Kugimiya, Ginga Kikōtai Majestic Prince* Aya Akabane, Gokujo* Miu Osawa, Hagure Yūsha no Aesthetica* Kurumi, Hal* Emi Yusa, Hataraku Maō-sama!

In the past, I have described Yoko Hikasa as a type of sexy, temptress archetype! She has often voiced demons, very evil characters (Nashetania Loei Piena Augustra in ""Rokka no Yūsha"" and Nanako Saeki in ""Aku no Hana"" are a couple of examples), and even representations of Satan herself! Maria starts out very much an anti-hero, she has a Spawn cloak, and an undying loyalty for her controllers; but, despite this, deep down... Maria is very caring, and the protectiveness that she feels for Kirika and Shirabe, eventually extends to her other friends, as well! Even in later seasons, Ms. Hikasa is alarmingly good at conveying Maria\'s fight between her newfound morality and her brainwashed upbringing! Great character, wonderful seiyū!Ai Kayano as Kirika Akatsuki, notable roles:* Akari Kawamoto, 3-Gatsu no Lion ✅* Futaba Ōki, Amanchu! ✅* Mikono Suzushiro, Aquarion Evol* Anya Dostoyevskaya, Aria the Avvenire* Kaga and Atago, Azur Lane* Hana Mutō, Captain Earth* Kanade Ōe, Chihayafuru ✅* Ponoka, Choboraunyopomi Gekijō Ai Mai Mii ✅* Anna Clément, Code Geass: Akito the Exiled ✅* Mikan Tsumiki, Danganronpa 3* Maihime Shirayuki, Dokyū Hentai HxEros* Mimi, Flip Flappers ✅* Megumi Sakura, Gakkōgurashi!

(""Do You Love Your Mom and Her Two-Hit Multi-Target Attacks?"") ✅* Sumire Kisaragi, Twin Angel Break* Kasumi Takamiya, Witch Craft Works* Anna, Yakusoku no Neverland (""The Promised Neverland"") ✅Commentary: Ai Kayano is known for having a sugary sweet voice and that translates well into Kirika\'s character. She\'s straight-forward and typically the most unassuming girl out of the group. She\'s simplistic and often even hard-headed, but she always means well, and she will risk her life for her partner, Shirabe! Ms. Kayano did an excellent job with this character, S-tier performance!Toshino Nanjō as Shirabe Tsukuyomi, notable roles:* Sonia, Berserk ✅* Naoto Miura, Clockwork Planet* Koko Tsukishima, Da Capo* Gankyō Kūrubiyūtei, Joshiraku* Eri Ayase, Love Live! ✅* Matsuri Sengen, Mahō Shōjo Taisen* Robu, Neko no Robu* Panpaka, Panpaka Pants Movie: Bananan Ōkoku no Hihō* Nene Kurio, Penguin Musume♥Heart* Akiho Senomiya, Robotics;Notes* Lise Hohenstein, Schwarzesmarken ✅Commentary: Ms. Nanjō has less speaking roles with the archetypically kūdere, Shirabe, but when she does has a time to shine—she\'s sweet, smart, and insightful! Very good casting choice, Toshino Nanjō needs more roles!Shin\'ichirō Miki as Adam Weishaupt, notable roles:* Kuhn, .hack (series)* Crim, .hack//SIGN* Kai Shimada, 3-gatsu no Lion (""March Comes in Like a Lion"") ✅* Limone, Ai Tenshi Densetsu Wedding Peach* Ryō Shinnai, Anime de Wakaru Shin\'ryōnaika* Takuya Isurugi, Aozora Shōjo-tai* Gō Mutsugi, Area 88 (TV)* Shiso Mikagi, Ayashi no Ceres ✅* Ryōma Sakamoto, Bakumatsu* Bruce Wayne, Batman: Gotham Knight ✅* Creed Diskenth, Black Cat* Kisuke Urahara, Bleach ✅* Ren Narita, Breakers* André Gide, Bungō Stray Dogs ✅* Genzō Wakabayashi, Captain Tsubasa* Kei\'ichirō Aoyama, Chikyū Bōei Kigyō Dai-Guard ✅* Shu, Crystal Blaze* Yō\'ichi Hiruma, Eyeshield 21 ✅* Leonidas I (""Lancer""), Fate/Grand Order ✅* Koujirō Sasaki (""Assassin""), Fate/stay night ✅* Kurz Weber, Full Metal Panic!* Roy Mustang, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood ✅* Toshihiko Sanada, Ganbarist!

Great role as a sinister antagonist, though; his role as Adam brings to mind his other malevolent-sounding performances, like Kaiki Deishū (""Monogatari"") and Shiso Mikagi (""Ayashi no Ceres""). Very iconic seiyū, wonderful job in AXZ!Minako Kotobuki as Saint-Germain, notable roles:* Yūko Nishi, A-Channel* Mizuki Kanzaki, Aikatsu ✅* Saya Sōgetsu, Ange Vierge* Natsu Takasaki, Baby Steps* Yolda, Beelzebub ✅* Rickert, Berserk ✅* Yako Jingūji, Chu-Bra!!* Vert Far Breton, Dog Days* Rikka Hishikawa, Dokidoki!!

I really enjoyed her as Mizuki Kanzaki (""Aikatsu""), Rikka Hishikawa (""Dokidoki!! PreCure""), Asuka Tanaka (""Hibike! Euphonium""), Tsumugi Kotobuki (""K-On""), and Karina Kyle (""Tiger & Bunny""). She usually is typecast as the morally ambiguous, ""rich girl"" kind of character. And, while Saint-Germain starts out being morally ambivalent, she turned out being one of Ms. Kotobuki\'s most powerful and majestic roles, to date! Magnificent job!Shōta Aoi as Cagliostro, notable roles:* Gaito Kurōzu, Future Card Buddyfight Battsu* Takayuki Konparu, Kenka Banchō Otome: Girl Beats Boys* Louis Kisaragi, King of Prism ✅* Ayumu Tamari, Kono Danshi, Sekika ni Nayandemasu.* Gyōjin, Kyō mo Tsuno ga Aru* Monet Tsukushi, Magic-Kyun!

He has primarily been cast as bishōnen characters, though his role as Cagliostro is a flirtatious, transgendered female. Cagliostro states that he was originally male, but preferred living in a female body, so he transmuted it to have lady parts, with the power of magic. A compelling villain, great work!Rina Hidaka as Prelati, notable roles:* Kanade Chidori, 6HP (Six Hearts Princess)* Yuniko Kōzuki (""Red King""), Accel World ✅* Airi, Alice or Alice ✅* Rinon, Ano Natsu de Matteru (""Waiting in the Summer"")* I-400, Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova ✅* Enju Aihara, Black Bullet ✅* Waraba Hanasaka, Busō Shōjo Machiavellianism* Akari Yomatsuri, Captain Earth* Ringo Ōhoshi, Chōjin Kōkōsei-tachi wa Isekai demo Yoyū de Ikinuku you desu!

My favorite roles from her, have been Ririchiyo Shirakiin (""Inu x Boku SS""), Airi Kashii (""Rō-Kyū-Bu!""), Tamamo-no-Mae (""Sasami-san@Ganbaranai""), Logia (""Show By Rock!!""), Keiko Ayano (""Sword Art Online""), Anko Kitashirakawa (""Tamako Market""), and Kurumi Nukui (""Tenshi no 3P!""). As Prelati, she\'s a deadly alchemist with a kūdere streak, but despite this, Ms. Hidaka\'s performance still makes you want to give her a hug! Great seiyū!Hina Kino as Tiki, notable roles:* Hanako Hondo, Asobi Asobase ✅* Funicia Raffaeli, Kanata no Astra ✅* Ranka Ōkami, Murenase! Seton Gakuen ✅* Fuwa, Star☆Twinkle PreCure ✅* Kaede Kurushima, Steins;Gate 0 ✅* Linel Synthesis Twenty-Eight, Sword Art Online ✅* Sayaka Itomi, Toji no Miko ✅Commentary: Ms. Kino needs more roles! It\'s very rare that I love absolutely every performance that I\'ve seen from a voice actress, but here we are! Tiki is a malevolent Autoscorer, created by the Illuminati, she is what I would call ""hilariously evil,"" especially in the scene where she\'s shrieking and grabbing Adam\'s leg, he kicks her after tripping, and then Hibiki kicks his butt! Ms. Kino is really talented at comedy roles, I can\'t even say how many times she made me laugh out loud, while watching Asobi Asobase! Amazing seiyū; give her more work, please!Man, this show packed such a punch! As a creator myself, I still find it incredible how the script came full circle: going through cycles of grief, harrowing tragedies, and then to triumvirate scenes of karmic retribution and the girls all being able to overcome their set of diverse circumstances, to kick some major booty! I truly love this season—Symphogear G solidified my status as a fan, while AXZ made it one of my favorite series of all time!

The issue with borderline incoherent villains with strange abstract motivations is not only back in full force yet again for the fourth time, but its easily the worst case of it yet.To make matters worse, characters from previous seasons are flattened to levels even worse than what the previous season did. It's as if the show was on a mission to make...sure every character was completely one dimensional at best by the end. For some characters like Miku, who is vital to the identity of the protagonist Hibiki, this loss of good characterization hurts the work extremely so.Some somewhat interesting foreshadowing is introduced in the last episode, so the possibility that the next season could set things right is technically still there. sure every character was completely one dimensional at best by the end.

R.O.D: Read or Die,https://myanimelist.net/anime/208/ROD__Read_or_Die,"['Yomiko Readman will probably be the cutest bookworm you will ever see. Obsessed with the philosiphy ""reading first, hygine second"" The viewers will be fully immersed in the life of cute but unkempt Yomiko. In this world, books are the prized posession of the world. Books are so precious, there is a world organized task force designed in protecting these books from \'the bad guys. You\'ll be imersed in crazy steampunk/fantacy/etc vs magic conflicts and edge of your seat madness through the eyes of Ms. Readman.The story itself is very farfetched and out of this world, but its a story that everyone should experience at...leat once. Reality may be limited as paper can stop bullets or take down giant insects, but the cute and clumsy Yomiko and her friends will keep you watching with great intent. Being a three episode ova, there is little back story to all what is happening and it leaves the backstory up to its viewers imagination. Which is fine because all that leaves room for is high quality action only an anime can portray.When I mean high quality action I mean high framerate action sequences coupled with great coreagraphy and amazing attention to detail. Things like paper sticking to a hand or scouring an old bookstore littered with books and dust really show how much hatd work and effort it took the artists to make such amazing detail come to life. Nothing impresses me more than attention to detail esepecially in rooms/buildings. On top of the OVA quality artwork, this show just oozes cool from the James Bond-esque themesong and sexy girl credits to the crazy steampunk gadgets and flashy magic spells, its a pure sensory overload for me.Speaking of sensory overload, the female supporting cast were quite an eyeful. All of them were either beautiful or cute, very easy on the eyes. And for the girls, the guys are all quite burly military men in stature and can give up quite a good fight. The enemies, on the other hand, are pretty outrageous incarnations of storytime characters (Genjo anyone?) Crazy badguys do lend themselves quite easy to some fun and crazy battles. Not much can be salvaged in terms of backstory information for most of the characters, but the chemistry between all the support characters and Yomiko are quite believeable in an anime sort of way.Not much can be said in terms of negative aspects other than sloppy animations and some silly situations, but the overall experience is just too fun if you\'re really into the fantasy action genre. Don\'t get me wrong, its not the greatest OVA of all time but it is well worth your time (read: Good). If you\'re a sucker for a glasses-moe like I am (think Yuki Nagato or Miyuki Takara), you\'ll love this show. And if you love this show, I\'m sure you\'ll love the R.O.D. TV series. leat once.

It's a fusion of some of my favorite elements--steampunk, books, history, music, and espionage. Yomiko is an absolutely adorable character, and her personality is well-established the moment you get a look at her house. The characterization for the rest of the cast is excellent as well. The artwork is lush and gorgeous, and the action sequences flow beautifully and intuitively. As a bibliophile and history buff myself, the inclusion of various random intellectual figures as...villains was a nice touch. Though Beethoven gets no speaking lines, seeing him pound away at the keyboard with his archetypal wild hair made me far giddier than it should have.I cannot recommend this show highly enough. It is well-worth your hour and a half.I found it amusing how much the US president looks like Dubbya, and how much of an absolute trigger-happy pussy he is. He wets his pants at least three times when things get tough, and at one point he flips out and instead of proceeding calmly through a tight spot, tries to pound the 'nuke them all' button. Political commentary much? You must recall this vintage 2001, a very familiar year in his political history. villains was a nice touch.

Her entire check goes into her hobby. After coming into a book, she's soon under attack by a man with a strange ability. She learns that the particular book she just purchased is necessary for an organization's plan. Readman also works for the British Library Special Operations Division under the alias Agent Paper, and her mission is to learn why this outfit is after the book. -summaryFor reasons I do understand, R.O.D. is recognized as a popular anime title, and it was so well received that it spawned...a 26 episode series. Despite the claims to fame this is one title that never truly vibed with me. It doesn't get the least bit better over time, instead it does get worse and I see myself never watching it again.The plot follows Agent Paper and a second woman code named Agent Deep, as they try to reclaim the book when it's eventually taken from Paper. This leads the two into a gauntlet against multiple enemies with bizarre powers, whom happen to be clones of famous individuals such as the samurai Hiraga Gennai, French Entomologist Jean Henri Fabre, and even Ludwig Von Beethoven himself. The anime features quite a bit of historical content, and it's heavily influenced by American superhero comics. Agent Deep has the ability to phase through objects, which is the exact same power of Kitty Pryde aka Shadow Cat of the X-Men, while Agent Paper has the ability to manipulate paper and use it for combat, by either turning it into solid objects for weapons, create shields, or even a vehicle. This large amount of creativity here is the only interesting thing about this character, as it does create some pretty cool action segments.Now speaking of the action, this is where the anime shines. The animation is pretty fluid with minimum jumpiness during the quick paced battle segments, and the choreography during the hand to hand fights are also nice. The backgrounds are very pretty and they mesh well with the CG and 2D animation. There are some very pretty landscapes and artwork of New York City and even the White House. I can't say I liked the music, especially the Mission Impossible-ish opening instrumental featuring that jazzy theme canon with secret agent type movies. However, it is fitting for the anime.The plot is your standard good vs. evil, with the stock bad guy seeking to plunge the world into destruction, and here lies some of the problem. Outside of how the bad guy wants to pull off his plan, it's way too cookie-cutter, predictable, and the characters have very little depth. I didn't care for anyone in this title, and this especially goes for Agent Paper who came off way too annoying for me. It wasn't only the voice acting for both languages, but it was her personality and how the character was just written. There are also issues with the writing when concerning her abilities. It's unable to tell how exactly her powers work, and it appears things happen only when it's convenient for the script. One thing I cannot stand are power level inconsistencies.Read or Die is something that will no doubt appeal to the action crowd. I may have enjoyed it more had I been able to buy into the characters and their interactions along with the story, but for some reason it feels as if it was a vehicle only to show off the visuals, which are very pretty I must admit. The fan service is mildly present via bouncing breast, and the gore is also pretty tame.

This could be one of those anime that has the cool factor going for it, much like Shinichiro Watanabe’s anime (you should know what he directed by now.), but hopefully it’s not just the cool factor that keeps it entertaining. How well I know? Well, let the review...begin.Nerdy Yomiko Readman is obsessed with books. As ""Agent Paper,"" she works for a secret branch of the British Library, where her power to telekinetically control paper helps her on missions to retrieve rare manuscripts and protect the world from evil. But all Yomiko really wants to do is read her new book. Unfortunately it has been stolen by the I-gin, clones of historical figures who believe Yomiko\'s book holds the key to unlocking Beethoven\'s lost ""Death Symphony."" Anyone who hears the tune is compelled to commit suicide, and the I-gin intends to broadcast it all over the world. Only Yomiko, along with fellow super agents Drake and Miss Deep, has a chance at stopping them.OK, I’m just going to say this……I had fun with this anime and as much as the plot doesn’t go that deep, but then again, it is a three episode OVA clocking in at 96 minutes. The plot may seem silly and nonsensical to most people, but it isn’t too distant from reality, it’s not like “GAINAX!! OMG!! CRAZY SHIT!!” type of nonsensical; it’s much like a good action film, whose purpose is to entertain us with how unreal it is without being bored and easily distracting itself from its plot. I will say that using paper as weapons more powerful than they appear are a plus in my book, because after seeing that, I imagine somebody challenging someone to a gunfight and someone made a drawing of a gun and then it came in paper form and it did the job of a regular one, but more deadlier.Characters in here are a delight to watch as I really love the main character of Yukiko Readman or “The Paper”, as she is called here to be equally adorable as a nerdy bookworm character and capable of her being in a fight, especially that part, and considering not many of those exist in much anime….at least the ones I watch. There’s also Nancy Mukahari (or Miss Deep, which does sound a porno name…..and yes, even in the OVA, they reference that.), the token bad-ass female character with a shady past and Drake Anderson, the lone male member of the team.  The dynamic budding relationship between Yomiko and Nancy is actually the only thing I see in character development and progression. Some of the other characters like Joker (not the one you’re thinking), Drake, and the other super villains don’t really stay in our heads and some are just unimaginative characters like Joker is stereotypically posh and English and Drake is the no-nonsense American soldier. They are fine characters just nobody I would give a shit about.Studio DEEN’s print is on the animation here and knowing their reputation of shows, the animation is solid for most parts here, as I often see a few hiccups even during the paper manipulating scenes. I wouldn’t count it as vintage, maybe even for it being 11-12 years old since its release in 2001 or ’02. I did like the opening theme and sequence of the show, as I’ve said; it brought out this James Bond / superspy tone that fits perfectly into the OVA.The dub by Manga Entertainment is a fine dub with some good performances with Kimberly Yates, a relatively unknown voice actress, did capture the kindness and bookworm’s attitude of Yukiko. Amanda Winn-Lee, who also directed the dub, was good as Nancy, delivering in the deadpan humor within the character and of course, Crispin Freeman playing the not-so-subtle Joker and you can tell he was hamming it up and having fun in his role.FINAL VERDICT:  You can check it this OVA. It may not go deep within the plot that much but as you watch it, you start to not care that much, that is if you’re enjoying it but if you didn’t, then I shouldn’t recommend it to you. For those you have liked it, the series is available to get, although you might have to pay some high prices and something else to go with it…….but we’ll get to that later.’ begin.Nerdy Yomiko Readman is obsessed with books.

However, few anime do this better than R.O.D OVA. It is a stylish, exhilarating, and action-packed super powered romp with some of the most creative fights in an anime. Of course, the plot is pretty ludicrous, but this does little to diminish the shows enjoyability.Yomiko Readman is a substitute teacher and devoted bookworm, who spends most of her income on books. She also is an agent for the British Library special operations, with the physics defying ability to manipulate paper (which...she can use to block bullets and cut through metal). After someone attempts to steal her newly purchased book, Yomiko is informed by the Library that the book is part of a sinister plot. She is then assigned the mission of retrieving the other volumes before the I-gen, super powered reincarnations of historical figures. She is accompanied by fellow agents Nancy Makahari (a.k.a Ms. Deep) who can phase through objects, and Drake Anderson.Despite how ridiculous the summery above sounds, the plot actually has quite a bit going for it. While it is quite silly, it has a superhero novelty to it. It is a fun action adventure that leaves a lot of room for cool fights, which it has no shortage of. It also leaves enough room for some plot twists and character development. Considering it is only three episodes long, this OVA uses its time quite well and delivers an overall rewarding experience.All of the characters here are a delight to watch. Yomiko is the cutest bookworm you will ever see. Naive and somewhat inept when it comes to anything other than books, she is the most pure hearted of the lot. Despite her appearance, she is resourceful and quite good in a fight. Nancy on the other hand, comes off as an experienced woman with a few skeletons in her closet. At first she wants to keep her relationship with Yomiko strictly professional, however befriends her later. Yomiko and Nancy\'s friendship is the highpoint of the OVA\'s character development and depth. The rest of the characters mostly serve as plot devices, however, none come off as uninteresting. From the egotistical reincarnation of Otto Lilienthal to Joker, the calm director of the Library, all the characters have distinctive personalities. Of course, this is not where the series really shines.Where this anime does shine brightest is its technical merits. The character designs and backgrounds here are incredible. Each character is distinctive and unmistakable, especially the adorable Yomiko and voluptuous Nancy. Likewise, the backgrounds are marvelously detailed and feel like real locations, it\'s almost a shame that they are not further explored. The animation is just as spectacular, doing justice to the characters superpowers in eye-popping fights. The music doesn\'t differ too much from other action adventures, however, it is still well composed and and used effectively.The R.O.D OVA is an explosive experience. Its visuals are mind-blowing, even putting more recent anime to shame. It has a very likable cast of characters, both heroes and villains; and a good, if incredibly far-fetched, plot. While it does not have much in terms of depth, you\'ll be hard-pressed to find a more entertaining anime. Watch it. she can use to block bullets and cut through metal).

Watch it.', ""The Read or Die series is one of those series that I wanted to check out because it gave me the James bond vibe when I saw the trailer. After that, I decided to blind buy the series which I went on Cex website to see if the OVA and the TV series of Read or Die are available in a local Cex store in London. Lucky for me it was available in my local Cex which also had a lot of bizarre anime in it. After that, I decided to pop in my local Cex store and picked up the whole series of Read...or Die that contained the OVA and the TV series. Then on the weekend, I decided to marathon the whole series and in ended up loving the series. This review will focus on the OVA series as the TV series will get its own review.Story and Characters.The story of Read or Die follows a nerdy girl named Yomiko Readman who is obsessed with books. As an Agent Paper she works for a secret branch of the British Library, where she has the power to telekinetically control paper so she can project the world from evil but in reality, she just wants to read her new book. Unfortunately, it has been stolen by the I-Jin, clones of the historical figures who believe Yomiko new book holds the key to unlocking Beethoven’s lost Death Symphony. When anyone hears the tune would be forced to commit suicide and the I-Jin intend to broadcast it all over the world. Now Yomiko along with her fellow super agents Drake and Miss Deep must stop I-gin plans of destruction before it’s too late.The story of Read or Die is honestly the weakest part of Read or Die. Don’t get me wrong it was nice for what it despite the ova being only 3 episodes long and it was fun overall plot but at the same time, the ova sadly didn’t have enough time to properly explain the story to the viewer meaning that ova, especially in certain story elements, kinda stumbles quite a bit. Thankfully the ova isn’t boring at all as it remains to be an entertaining ride from start to finish thanks to being well paced.When it comes to the characters for Read Or Die I thought they were pretty solid overall despite most of them being sadly forgetful due to lack of screen-time.Yomiko is a great and unique female protagonist. She is a friendly, and upbeat person who is completely obsessed to a point where she will do anything to get a book especially the ones that she’s currently reading as seen from the first episode of the OVA.Nancy is a pretty great character as well. She may start off as this cold and focus individual but as the ova progresses she starts to open up to Yomiko where they become good friends.The rest of the characters, on the other hand, are pretty forgetful. They aren’t bad characters by any means necessary but they were clearly not as memorable as the two females of the show.While the story itself was unfortunately thrown away in the away side the character development as the chemistry and interactions completely make it up to a point where for the most part completely negate the weak story.8/10Visuals.For an OVA that came out in the early 2000s, I thought the visuals were pretty good.The character designs, for the most part, are pretty solid especially Yomiko who is by far the best-looking character in the show.As for the actual animation itself, I thought it was very good. The action scenes are smooth, fluent and well animated to the core.The one thing that I liked about the OVA is how it was able to showcase the character abilities as well as how they react to set power during fights. This alone adds more dimension and tension to the fights as they all fun and intriguing.9/10Sound.The music in Read or Die is fantastic and well directed.Every single track especially the iconic read or die theme which is by far one of my favourite tracks in action anime. The song magically gave that James Bond vibe every time the track gets played.This is one of the few series that I have not touched the original Japanese audio so I cannot comment about it. The English Dub was pretty good overall. Kimberly Yates did a pretty great job of voicing the charming Yomiko. The rest of the actors did a good job on the roles that were given.10/10Final Thoughts.Read or Die is a pretty great OVA. Sure the story may not be it’s the strongest point but the OVA completely makes it up for having a strong and likeable female lead,  brilliant character chemistry,  great animation and a kick-ass soundtrack. If you're looking for a good short action flick that has a strong and likeable protagonist than I point you towards this show. Read or Die OVA is a perfect of how two great females leads can carry a story is on the away side and I like it that way.Final Score 8/10 or Die that contained the OVA and the TV series. Then on the weekend, I decided to marathon the whole series and in ended up loving the series. This review will focus on the OVA series as the TV series will get its own review.Story and Characters.The story of Read or Die follows a nerdy girl named Yomiko Readman who is obsessed with books. As an Agent Paper she works for a secret branch of the British Library, where she has the power to telekinetically control paper so she can project the world from evil but in reality, she just wants to read her new book. Unfortunately, it has been stolen by the I-Jin, clones of the historical figures who believe Yomiko new book holds the key to unlocking Beethoven’s lost Death Symphony. When anyone hears the tune would be forced to commit suicide and the I-Jin intend to broadcast it all over the world. Now Yomiko along with her fellow super agents Drake and Miss Deep must stop I-gin plans of destruction before it’s too late.The story of Read or Die is honestly the weakest part of Read or Die. Don’t get me wrong it was nice for what it despite the ova being only 3 episodes long and it was fun overall plot but at the same time, the ova sadly didn’t have enough time to properly explain the story to the viewer meaning that ova, especially in certain story elements, kinda stumbles quite a bit. Thankfully the ova isn’t boring at all as it remains to be an entertaining ride from start to finish thanks to being well paced.When it comes to the characters for Read Or Die I thought they were pretty solid overall despite most of them being sadly forgetful due to lack of screen-time.Yomiko is a great and unique female protagonist. She is a friendly, and upbeat person who is completely obsessed to a point where she will do anything to get a book especially the ones that she’s currently reading as seen from the first episode of the OVA.Nancy is a pretty great character as well. She may start off as this cold and focus individual but as the ova progresses she starts to open up to Yomiko where they become good friends.The rest of the characters, on the other hand, are pretty forgetful. They aren’t bad characters by any means necessary but they were clearly not as memorable as the two females of the show.While the story itself was unfortunately thrown away in the away side the character development as the chemistry and interactions completely make it up to a point where for the most part completely negate the weak story.8/10Visuals.For an OVA that came out in the early 2000s, I thought the visuals were pretty good.The character designs, for the most part, are pretty solid especially Yomiko who is by far the best-looking character in the show.As for the actual animation itself, I thought it was very good. The action scenes are smooth, fluent and well animated to the core.The one thing that I liked about the OVA is how it was able to showcase the character abilities as well as how they react to set power during fights. This alone adds more dimension and tension to the fights as they all fun and intriguing.9/10Sound.The music in Read or Die is fantastic and well directed.Every single track especially the iconic read or die theme which is by far one of my favourite tracks in action anime. The song magically gave that James Bond vibe every time the track gets played.This is one of the few series that I have not touched the original Japanese audio so I cannot comment about it. The English Dub was pretty good overall. Kimberly Yates did a pretty great job of voicing the charming Yomiko.

Read or Die OVA is a perfect of how two great females leads can carry a story is on the away side and I like it that way.Final Score 8/10"", '""Read or Die"" might sound like some bizarre comedy show about over zealous parents trying to encourage their children to read more books instead of playing games/watch anime all day long, but in actual fact it\'s nothing like that. It\'s more like an anime version of X-Men (update: well, back when I originally wrote this review, this seemed like a good comparison, but now that there ACTUALLY IS an anime version of X-Men, this comparison is making me look like an ignorant n00b... but it amuses me to leave it in anyway :p). It\'s one of those shows that, category by category wise, seems to...have most of the indegredients of a great show, but somehow ends up being significantly less than the sum of its parts.I watched this set of OVA\'s twice. The first time was soon after I was suffering from withdraw symptoms, having just finished watching one of my favourite series of all time (""Seikai no Senki II"" )... and I found ""Read of Die"" to be rather boring. But suspecting that this is mostly due to bad timing, I decided to watch it again many years later, and though I did enjoy it more second time round, I still found it to be a little underwhelming.I think the main problem is that I didn\'t find it easy to get into it. Even though the premises is interest enough, there are no infectious characters in the cast. It beggars belief that the main heroine, The Paper, being such a ditzy character, can be a secret agent - I can\'t see how they can entrust anything of importance to someone like her.There are other things that doesn\'t make sense, like how ""The Paper"" can fight so well when she doesn\'t seem to have had any training, and how characters managed to escape from certain death situations etc. Quite a lot of the small details of the story like that are glossed over. However, the show got a lot stronger towards the end, throwing up some good plot twists. I was even starting to feel less detached to the characters.In the end though, it just wasn\'t quite enough. With its fantastic  visuals, good if not great music (opening theme is slightly reminiscent the opening of ""Cowboy Bebop"") and interesting plot points, ""Read or Die"" is a pretty good all round package... but it just seems to be missing a certain something that makes the whole thing tick. have most of the indegredients of a great show, but somehow ends up being significantly less than the sum of its parts.I watched this set of OVA\'s twice.

Despite the title this ultimatum has nothing to do with the show. Though main character Tomiko Readman redefines the term ""bookworm"" with her life obsession of reading, putting even hygiene second to her constant hobby. But reading can\'t pay the bills - but it can at least meet the check halfway. Tomiko has the supernatural power to control any paper and make it nifty tools or sharp weapons. And with this ability Tomiko works for the British Library Special Operations Division with code name ""The Paper"". Unfortunately for Tomiko, her eyed book is a rare item under the pursuit of the...I-Jin, an evil organization comprised of historical figure clones who also possess special powers. It\'s up to Tomiko and her agent partner Nancy ""Miss Deep"" Makuhari to protect the book and stop the I-Jin\'s plans with the cooperation of the rest of the BLSOD.I was surprised upon starting R.O.D. that it was an OVA released from 2001 to 2002. By the early 2000s the tail end of the OVA boom could be seen going out the door. The OVA is potentially my favorite anime format, with flexible production schedules to help ensure better production values and a high final quality that usually trounces TV series, while being more digestible and financially possible than feature-length movies. It\'s also been an outlet throughout the years to animate niche stories that wouldn\'t have much broadcasting pull, and even by 2001 R.O.D. has that eccentricity to its concept to confirm that.Speaking of OVAs, the thing I was instantly reminded of upon starting Read or Die is the 1992 OVA, Giant Robo The Animation: The Day the Earth Stood Still. Both feature a light lampooning of secret defense organizations and terrorist super groups, while combining elements of Japanese superheroes with a wide cast of inexplicably superpowered humans. They also both have a mix of the dramatic, comic, and theatric, going for wide-scaled set pieces. At their hearts they\'re also both powerful action epics, while Giant Robo has the space to have more impactful drama and characterization. The comparisons end here, but they also made me realize some ways in which R.O.D. didn\'t measure up.For starters, the most shocking thing about R.O.D. compared to what I initially expected was the production values. They\'re surprisingly mild in quality. While the animation is consistently fluid, the background, character detail, and coloring leaves a lot to be desired. The latter three categories are more akin to a TV series typical of this era, which isn\'t good. The eventful presentation the OVA usually has with its strong production is not really there, and R.O.D. unfortunately feels like longer TV episodes than something special. The fights are entertaining enough to watch, but lack that ""wow"" factor that might\'ve come with cleverer use of the wide range of abilities in the attack strategies. All highlights that come to mind involve Nancy\'s ability to phase through objects at will, which lends itself to some mind-bending choreography at its best and cool posturing at all other times (a common attitude in this OVA that serves it well).The narrative is also nothing too special. It didn\'t really set out to be, and chose not to dilute focus from its action, but a particular spot I feel has wasted potential is Tomiko\'s love of books and her clashing with historical figures. I thought for sure, since she recognized them, that she\'d further show off her knowledge of their works, personalities, etc. and perhaps give her some dialogue with the otherwise wasted identities of the villains. Sadly, their presences are in name only, and Tomiko\'s defining character trait isn\'t really put to much use. R.O.D. is simple throughout. Fun, but it needed some extra intelligence in its execution somewhere. I\'d give this one a light recommendation, and would again like to push the Giant Robo OVA on existing fans or those looking for an action epic who haven\'t seen either yet.

An organisation dedicated to protecting rare books sends operatives to America in order to investigate an attack on the Library of Congress and the destruction of the Whitehouse. They quickly learn that the attack was carried out by super powered clones of historical figures who are trying to get a rare book owned by one of the organisation's operatives, Yomiko Readman.It is every bit as awesome as it sounds. The story is very imaginative and it has lots of twists and turns that keep things interesting. Kurata Hideyuki took full advantage of the limited length by making every single event...important to the story, making the whole story very tight and fast-paced without making the whole thing feel rushed or incomplete. The whole story is also accompanied by an underlying theme of reading that never feels obtrusive or like it's being shoved in your face, proving that these kinds of themes don't have to be sanctimonious or annoying.The characters are three dimensional and very well fleshed out. I especially like Yomiko's character, although that could be partially because she's one of the few characters who has a larger personal library than I do. I'm joking, she's just a really well developed character. She kicks ass and has awesome moments, but she's also very human and vulnerable, which makes her a very relatable character. Nancy and Drake are also very well written characters. My one problem with this aspect of the series is that the antagonist is a little two dimensional, but even he has several interesting aspects to his character.The art is very nice. The fight scenes are very creative and flow very well. The character designs fit the characters perfectly. The backgrounds are nice and detailed. I wouldn't expect anything less from the studio responsible for Maria Sama ga Miteru and Samurai Deeper Kyo.The voice work is very well done and the sound fits the epicness set by the rest of the aspects in the OVA. Neya Michiko and Miura Rieko both do exceptionally well. I kind of wonder why Miura desn't have more voice acting credits aside from just Yomiko, but I'm sure she has her reasons.The relationship dynamic between Nancy and Yomiko is extremely homoerotic. They never do anything explicit, but I'm giving them a yuri factor of 7/10 for subtext so blatant it's almost canon.My final rating for R.O.D. the OVA is a 10/10. It's as close to perfection as it could possibly be. If you're a fan of  Witch Hunter Robin or Le Chevalier Deon you'll probably enjoy this thoroughly. The action is solid, the story is well constructed and it has a pretty high cute factor too. important to the story, making the whole story very tight and fast-paced without making the whole thing feel rushed or incomplete.

A bookworm girl who can manipulate paper into weapons and such, and villains conjuring up historic figures to take over the world. It sounded absurd, but that\'s why I was so interested.Unfortunately, absurdity doesn\'t equal quality. The show, consisting of only three episodes, throws you in to the middle of a very absurd plot, where some ""Ijin""s are trying to take over the world. Why? Well, I won\'t spoil it, but the reason is probably one of the dumbest reasons.I think the main flaw of this short OVA is the lack of character development,...as well as constructing a cohesive plot. The viewer is thrown into the story, which escalates immediately, trying to emphasize the danger of a particular book. The problem is that we don\'t know why the book is important, nor why the villains want it until later. And when revealed why, the viewer is presented with two more questions: ""How does that even make sense?"" and ""Why should I even care about what these people are doing?""  Although throughout the show it expresses the impertinent danger of the situation, the situation is a bit confusing and lacks any emotion to make viewers even care.It\'s very predictable, and the characters lack the depth needed to make this an enjoyable OVA. The actions scenes may be great, but since the characters and the story are only paper thin with details, this OVA falls flat. as well as constructing a cohesive plot.

It\'s worth watching. Anime watching librarians might especially like it. Animation is sort of ""older-style"" but well done. Characterization is done fairly well, but with the number of characters and short length of the OVA, they can only be given so much depth.This is something to consider the next time you want to watch an action anime, that isn\'t too serious, with unique action using supernatural powers and a somewhat ""jazzy"" style.

I\'d go as far to say that it should be considered one of the master pieces of our time (okay not that far but it\'s pretty good).Story- Possibly the most unique storyline I have ever encountered combining the worlds of magic, history, politics, adventure and secret organizations (okay when you say it like that it doesn\'t sound that unique but once you...see the series and the odd way in which they express these principles you\'ll most definitely agree that it is unique). Basically we have a generally nerdy character who likes to read a lot, at first you think nothing special but then she reveals that she has special paper magic powers and is an agent for an organization which protects the world, if you want to calll what they do world saving at all. Her most recent task is to recover a book which contains Beethoven\'s ""death symphony"" from a group of clones of histories greatest thinkers and revolutionaries (history nerd present) who have no particular reason acquired super powers (can you possibly imagine that).Art- There were certain things I did and did not like about the art. Since I\'m feeling optimistic today I will say the thing I enjoyed about the art would have to be the amount of realism in the drawing style and backgrounds (which were drawn pretty well) but even more than that the outfit choices I know it seems wierd but the choices of outfits for each character was just incredibly well thought out.Sound- I particularly liked the voice acting and sound effects in this series one thing I would have to be picky about would be the consistence of sound.Characters- In order to appreciate the characters you really have to have a feel for history and for your slightly generic character types. I for one was overjoyed to think that Beethoven would create a symphony that would kill people upon listening, well commit suicide to be exact but it\'s still murder all the same.Enjoyment- I actually enjoyed this OVA being a slight history nerd and all, but what really tied it together for me would have to be paper magic; as stupid as it sounds once I saw this aspect I knew I had to finish watching it because honestly I had never seen anything even close to it. see the series and the odd way in which they express these principles you\'ll most definitely agree that it is unique).

It has all the elements necessary for an anime to be considered good, but it\'s artistic value is not that high to be considered memorable or a masterpiece. And that\'s exactly why it\'s such an enjoyable show: instead of trying to be legendary or gather a huge number of fans, it embraces it\'s simplicity and just tries to be a good action anime.==============================================Story: 7Read or Die is about an agent trying to stop some bad guys from killing everybody. It doesn\'t get any deeper than that, really. What makes the story interesting is the originality. For...starters, the main character is able to control paper and her alias is ""The Paper"". Oh, and did you think she is some sort of spy working for a secret agency? Not exacly, she works for a secret brech of the British Library. Yeah, the British Library.The villains are I-Jin, clones of historical figures. So you should expect to see things such as Gennai Hiraga using a lightsaber, Jean Henri Fabre controlling insects and Beethoven killing people with his music.==============================================Art: 9There\'s not that much to say here. As expected of a short OVA, the quality is very good, despite having been produced in the beginning of the century. If you aren\'t picky about the art in an anime, this shouldn\'t bother you.==============================================Sound: 9Again, not much to say. The voice acting was satisfactory and the musics were used in the correct moments, creating good atmospheres/situations.=============================================Character: 10That\'s where the OVA shines: the characters. Each of the protagonists is very interesting and charismatic, from the tsundere Nancy to the superstitious Drake. The protagonist, Yomiko Readman, is the exact opposite of what you would expect from a top agent: impulsive, book otaku, clumsy and often fights in a very odd, but creative, manner. She is and adorable character able to manipulate paper and create a variety of weapons and tools with it.Unfortunately, there is few space for character development. But even limited by 3 episodes, the show is able to establish a connection between the spectator and the characters. Read or Die is very action-oriented, but the characters are a very important part and their moments of interaction are simply wonderful. The lines aren\'t superficial or mechanical, but natural and full of life.=============================================Enjoyment: 10Not only the show has originality, charismatic characters, a simple and interesting story as nice action sequences. The I-Jin have unique abilities and the protagonist can use paper to build airplanes, swords, shields etc. Now put these guys in a fight. You know what you get? Amazing and incredible fights, that\'s what.With so many awesome moments, you will probably want to see them again, so the rewatch value is very high.=============================================Overall: 7If you want to see the sort version of the review, here it is: just watch it. There is no need for a detailed analysis to understand Read or Die. Maybe you like it because of the action, maybe because of the originality, maybe because of the characters, but in the end, you just like it. starters, the main character is able to control paper and her alias is ""The Paper"".

The protagonist, Yomiko Readman, is the exact opposite of what you would expect from a top agent: impulsive, book otaku, clumsy and often fights in a very odd, but creative, manner. She is and adorable character able to manipulate paper and create a variety of weapons and tools with it.Unfortunately, there is few space for character development. But even limited by 3 episodes, the show is able to establish a connection between the spectator and the characters. Read or Die is very action-oriented, but the characters are a very important part and their moments of interaction are simply wonderful. The lines aren\'t superficial or mechanical, but natural and full of life.=============================================Enjoyment: 10Not only the show has originality, charismatic characters, a simple and interesting story as nice action sequences. The I-Jin have unique abilities and the protagonist can use paper to build airplanes, swords, shields etc. Now put these guys in a fight. You know what you get? Amazing and incredible fights, that\'s what.With so many awesome moments, you will probably want to see them again, so the rewatch value is very high.=============================================Overall: 7If you want to see the sort version of the review, here it is: just watch it. There is no need for a detailed analysis to understand Read or Die. Maybe you like it because of the action, maybe because of the originality, maybe because of the characters, but in the end, you just like it.', 'This OVA tells of what happened before the death of Mr Gentleman when Yomiko Readman (""The Paper"") and Drake were still faithful agents of the British Imperial Library. It is during this time that The Paper met Nancy Makuhari.If you have watched ROD the Tv in full and enjoyed it, this OVA would be a recommendable watch to better your understanding of the I-jins and the past of the characters, especially that of Nancy Makuhari. Even if you haven\'t watched ROD the TV, this OVA would still be a good standalone anime to watch.While the art and characters in ROD did not awe me, the...difference in the tones of voices of some of the characters in ROD the TV and ROD OVA was interesting to me, seeing that some of the characters have grown weaker while some have grown bitter. The story was commendable: simple with a little twist, and also because it incorporates a little knowledge of classical music in the OVA. difference in the tones of voices of some of the characters in ROD the TV and ROD OVA was interesting to me, seeing that some of the characters have grown weaker while some have grown bitter.

This OVA is actually adapted from a manga and then rendered into a movie in the early 2001 by the Studio Deen. I would love to compare this anime movie to any one of highly-acclaimed James Bond flicks. It has all the necessary elements; action, suspense, drama, intrigue and not forgetting, far-fetched idea to conquer the world. Even though the movie is only an hour and a half, it is packed with interesting characters with unique fighting powers and definitely a fresh concept. Hence, hands down, R.O.D OVA is sure to...please the fans and the non-fans. Kudos to the creator Hideyuki Kurata.R.O.D is the story of an intelligence agency, based in the British Library (of all the places in the world!). This agency has sepecial agets and these agents are to protect the world from the I-jin. I-jin is a bunch of cloned people who have developed a way to conquer the world. Who exactly these I-jin people? How are they going to conquer the world? Well... it's really complicated. You really have to watch it to get better understanding. Seriously!What I like most about this OVA is the portrayal of the protagonist. It is surely a breath of fresh air. YUMIKO READMAN or her codename The Paper is not like any other agents in most spy flicks. She is a bookish bibliomaniac (obsessed with books) and she appears to be meek and very child-like. Her alter-ego is being a substitute teacher. However, look can really be deceiving. She, apparently, is endowed with the power to control and manipulate paper and hence the code name.As for NANCY MCHARRY (in some version it's MAKUHARI) she is a leather-clad femme fatale who personality is a total opposite of Readman's. Her codename is Ms. Deep as she can pass through any solid objects by absorbing herself. She says that she despises her codename, as it &quot;makes her sounds like a porn star&quot;. She prefers to be addressed as Nancy. However, unbeknown to the agency and Readman, she is actually one of the I-jin's creations which then contributes to the twist of this OVA.All in all, I would definitely recommend this to everybody who is craving for a thought-provoking and action-packed anime movie.

The initial ideas, the main character, and the first ten minutes of the first episode intrigue enough to generate interest in the viewer. The problem is the next hour and twenty minutes of content.Yomiko Readman is a character I instantly fell in love with. She’s a ditzy book-loving girl who spends every penny she has on her massive collection of literature. Whilst on a spree she winds up purchasing a novel that has been sought out by a...collection of bad guys hoping to use the contents of the book to create an end of the world scenario and become leaders of whatever’s left afterward. Thus, Yomiko is brought in by the British Libraries to be a secret agent and stop the baddies. She’s accompanied by Drake, a mercenary, and Ms. Deep, who has the ability to phase through objects. Yomiko herself can manipulate paper making it into nearly anything depending on the situation.It’s a really neat set-up. I dig the idea of a library sending out secret agents to collect books and stop certain bits of knowledge from  being used for ill gain. It’s like a more intelligent James Bond…you’d think.The bad guys have a giant underwater base with a huge rocket ready to be launched. It’s ridiculous and cheesy. It works to an extent, but leaves me bewildered, especially considering how smart I felt the anime would be.Read or Die is a show about books. Its hero is a nerdy girl who would most likely rather read with a guy than bang him. The anime doesn’t capitalize on this. The book is just a catalyst for a dumb action plot. Replace the Library with MI6 or the CIA and you have the same thing. That’s what bothered me the most because as a concept ROD is unique and has a lot of potential. Perhaps the television series does a better job focusing on the books a little more than the maniacal schemes.This leads me to the penultimate questions: is Read or Die good or bad and is it worth watching? And the answer is…eh.Everything about it screams out to my personal likings yet it felt misguided. It underutilized the things it had going for it and the more unique aspects while highlighting facets that you can find elsewhere. Because of this, Read or Die is merely an average OVA that may be worth a shot to those who think the idea sounds interesting, but can be passed by if you’re expecting anything more than a silly homage to James Bond. collection of bad guys hoping to use the contents of the book to create an end of the world scenario and become leaders of whatever’s left afterward.

', '""Could I please have my book back ?""---Yomiko ReadmanI love Yomiko Readman, but that just might be because I have somewhere around 5000 paper books in my home, I own a complete collection of Amazing Stories/Analog Magazine to mid 1980s on microfiche and have God only know how many e-books. She is the perfect anime woman in my book.Anyway to the meat of the review , will you like R.O.D. or not ?Well the OVA series is fast paced fun that has a valid ending.  The story isn\'t that great, it might as well have been lifted straight from a James Bond...movie, and it has a fair share of stupidity.The characters do make up for the shortcomings of the plot. They don\'t change over the course of the OVA but they do show you what they are made of. Some you will smack your head as their names scream out to you what they are up to, others you just gain a deeper insight into as you watch them.Needless to say, Yomiko is by far best girls :D. If you are a book lover you\'ll probably think so as well. If you are a married book lover you may find your spouse coming up short by comparison. Ahhh well such are the failings of 3D women.The voice acting and music age well and hold their own. Given the nature of story you do expect a certain standard in music and R.O.D. doesn\'t disappoint.The art however is another matter. The anime was done in 4x3 instead of the current 16x9 screen ratio. It\'s also very much old style animation, and just live up to current standards.TL:DR there\'s a lot to like about R.O.D. movie, and it has a fair share of stupidity.The characters do make up for the shortcomings of the plot.

It's uptempo, doesn't take itself seriously, and is the definition of pleasant surprise.The story is mediocre, the characters are nothing special but very well fleshed out, the art and sound are good - not extraordinary on their own, but they fit the general mood very well. There is no deep moral, no cerebral overtone, nothing to make you say this deserves a deep look. The sheer absurdity of some of the plot would fit better with all-out comedy. The action is not anything so astounding that you'd talk about it to all...your friends. You'd expect this combination to give an unremarkable result, and most of the times, you'd be right.But what we have here is a triumph.The fact that it is so short, with the clever editing and structure means that not a single moment is wasted. The characters are developed just to the point needed, the plot goes between absurd to hilarious to action to serious and back, and in the end, it all fits together brilliantly. If you are looking for anything deep, serious, or meaningful, don't waste your time. But if you just want some light-hearted fun, look no further. your friends.

Such a creative world that wasn't put to waste. The animation is spectacular. It also really had some great pacing. A really interesting premise of a character who can control paper really gets a lot of mileage for three OVAs. I would gladly watch this again and again. Thanks Dragon*Con 2001. Turns out sleeping in the overnight Anime Room can have some really interesting results.The story was fun but still compelling. There are some emotional scenes but this is an action series at it's heart. It's just a scotch too fanservice to really recommend to just about anyone...but it's not so much fanservice that you can't watch it in front of people. but it's not so much fanservice that you can't watch it in front of people."", ""Pros:-Great art and animation. Some really nice looking action scenes and background design, particularly in the third episode.-A finale that wraps up everything nicely and had a good open ending.-Solid voice acting and sound design.-Likeable characters. The main character, 'The Paper' is maybe a little overly cutesy but she can brawl when she needs to and Nancy is a cool character who has a decent story arc as well.Cons:-Barely any background is given on the characters, they didn't feel 'complete' until the third episode, which is a problem when the OVA is only three episodes long. There's a similar problem with the organisation they're working...for which isn't properly explained either, I don't think it was even named until the third episode. Why are there monsters flying around and no one raises any eyebrows? How are historical figures being resurrected? etc.-First two episodes were fine but felt like they floundered a bit, luckily the end of episode two picked things up and then the last episode ended on a high note.Overall this is worth a watch, but more information should have been given to newcomers like myself. Even a short introduction at the start (like a text scroll or voice over) to the world the characters live in would have been sufficient. for which isn't properly explained either, I don't think it was even named until the third episode.

It strikes that nice balance of seriousness and comedy that I am always a fan of with anime (such as Hokuto no Ken or Trigun).I had an overall good time, and have very few negatives to say. The main reason I gave it an Very Good (8) rather than a perfect 10/10 was for two reasons. The first and main reason I docked points was because although...I enjoyed my time with the show, it didn't pull me in strong enough to fully focus on the show and would occasionally view notifications on my phone. Again I don't think the show or the story was bad, but there were times where I didn't feel too bad for looking away since nothing of note was going on. The other reason was that the epilogue was a bit too short for my liking, but I think it is a fine way to conclude the OVA.

Junjou Romantica 3,https://myanimelist.net/anime/25649/Junjou_Romantica_3,"['Back when I watched the first two seasons of Junjou Romantica, I was an inexperienced gay teenager who had no idea how relationships worked, so this series seemed like the epitome of drama and romance to me.I was very excited when I found out about the third season, and I binge-watched the first 9 episodes. While I still believe that it\'s a decent and enjoyable series, I think I might\'ve outgrown it.Ironically enough, in an anime focused on romance, the most interesting and entertaining interactions for me revolve around friendships and day-to-day life. Unfortunately, they feel much more natural than what the couples bring to...the table.All of the relationship drama seems extremely contrived and none of the characters simply TALK to their lovers. Instead, they all jump into downright stupid conclusions, never voice what worries them directly until they overthink the situation to the point that they snap and make a scene out of it. I know we\'re on a time limit here, but it would be nice to see these characters interact like normal people once in a while, because generally it feels like when they\'re not fighting or having sex, they are mere acquaintances who for some odd reason ""love"" each other. That would be sort of okay for a new couple, but for someone who\'s been in a relationship for several years, it\'s just frustratingly underdeveloped and melodramatic. Speaking of which, their displays of affection also look silly in that context. It always has to come down to lots of grabbing, and pulling, and blushing, prefaced by monologuing for ten minutes. You\'d think after four years with Usami, Misaki would be less awkward when it came to intercourse, but nah... he still acts like it\'s their first time and he doesn\'t want to do it. I guess some people might find it cute, I did for the first two seasons, but at this point, it feels unimaginative, repetitive, and tiresome. the table.All of the relationship drama seems extremely contrived and none of the characters simply TALK to their lovers.

To rightfully express what I had in mind I had to refeer myself to the series. Hope it is not a problem, I'm pretty new to this and apologize in advance if that is so.Just noI’ve been so frustrated watching this 3rd season that it’s nearly impossible to me to explain in a plain way the disappointment I got watching it, though I would give it a try.The main problem I have with this 3rd season has one name:...MISAKI.From the very beginning –the opening video- we see how Misaki first reject Usami to later jump on him. I was relieved: that’s it, we will now see how Misaki will finally change and take the guts to fully live his love with Usami. The 2nd season closed with Usami asking him to love him 10, 20 times the way he did and 3 WHOLE YEARS OF relationship HAVE PASSED in the mean time. A turnover is just the natural development of the season, I thought. Always at the beginning, in the 1 ep Misaki get jelous on Usami. Well, I cant’t be wrong!The season develops. The stakes grow higher. The last year of Misaki approach, Takahiro urges Misaki to move out with the last year’s end, Usami’s father can’t stand the unmature feelings of Misaki and looks like that a impostor -Mizuki- is sent from America to tear Misaki and Usami apart. Ijuuin declares himself, puts Misaki under pressure and Usami gets more and more depress and doubtful and Misaki, Misaki… well DOES NOT DO ANYTHING!Not talking about his job. Fine, Misaki got one. But that’s not the point! The more the end of the season approached, the more astonished I was. How could it ever be possible that he doesn’t grow? That after 3 years he still have that shy reactions even when he is BARE ALONE with Usami. It is just not belivable. There must be a development in the end! As a crazy fan of JE as I am, I barely accepted they gave no more than 1 ep for JE and JT. Well there must be a reason, that’s what I thought. Well… NO! The last episode arrive: Takahiro caught them together and Misaki doesn’t get the chance to speak to him, Ijuuin confronts him and Misaki doesn’t slam in his face that he can’t love him as far as he is damnly in loved with Usami, and at the very end Usami thoroughly expose himself sharing his last desire and Misaki doesn’t get the chance to share his own too. What’s the fucking problem with your sticky tounge, jerk?!Now I see that the only target to the author here looks like ‘how do we manage to get the series longer? How more commercial –not a single hint of sex here, bros –So disappointed.Even more: this story just doesn’t work! Dear authors, you pushed it too far: aiming at a longer story, you tore it off. And forget my disappointment – at the end, an author still has the holy freedom to develop the story the way he wants, wether it matches fans expectations or not. Here I’m strictly talking of logic.Do you want an example? There are tons! Though, as the review is already becoming an everlasting writing, I will report here just one. The most important example. Of the most important word: I-love-you.In 2nd season an enchanting power has been endowed to this magic 3 words, I-love-you. Misaki hurdles, strives with his own feeling but at the end of their first true date he eventually says it: Usami, I deeply love you. Straightforward. And a bless: Usami’s light-up-the-world smile appears and they keep the moment, just holding their hands…And then you come to the3rd ep of season 3 and get Misaki declare his love to Iijuuin.No, seriously: WTF!!!???!!And even more: ep 11, same situation, same tensions: a doubtful depressed Usami.

I'll asume that you're familiar with the general plot line so I won't give a detailed sumary. So lets go to the review:Story - 7I think that Junjou is one of the most original stories in the yaoi world, I love so much that the stories doesn't have to have sense all the time (I think that Junjou's random humor is actually funny) BUT the autor trying to make the plot longer isn't always the best. Junjou Romantica plot line started to...become more repetitive since the appearence of Ijuuin Kyo (I hate him so much), actually, it isn't that interesting anymore (since we're specting for something important to happen). Terrorist is always cute, I love them.Art - 10The art has improved so much... As well as the manga's.Sound - 9I still don't know if I like the OP... But background music is good, as well as the ED.Character- 8I find Ijuuin and Mitsuki kind of annoying. For the others, maybe Usagi-san and Misaki have kind of disappointed me ('cause their relationship doesn't go further). In general, I like character's desingn and personalitiesEnjoyment - 8Overall - 8Junjou is a good series, I hope it to become better in the future (please Nakamura Shungiku-sensei!) become more repetitive since the appearence of Ijuuin Kyo (I hate him so much), actually, it isn't that interesting anymore (since we're specting for something important to happen).

However majorly focused on couple of Junjou Romantica, but from couples of Junjou Egoist and Junjou Terrorist are only appeared in 1 episode as minor focus, it's so disappointing, it's really pending to me the couple of Junjou Egoist and Junjou Terrorist, which is Junjou egoist is one of my favorite couple.Art (10/10):I am very impressed and happy of the animation which is...very highly improved as high quality of animation, unlike from season 1 and 2 it's looks like old, of course they keep on keep improving the animation in these generations. Also I'm so flattered the art of the characters, to be honest it's really hot men I've ever seen!Sound (9/10):The background music is finely new and I love the 3rd season of opening song!Character (9/10):All of the characters are quite improving new, some a bit of personality development I've seen, also not quite over dramatic characters like from season 1 and 2 they are over dramatic, and now from season 3 expressing so comedic faces! Then, very unexpected one character appeared from anime of Sekaiichi Hatsukoi and wow really crossover!Enjoyment (8/10):From my enjoyment, commonly I enjoyed where the romantic scenes of both men and more lovely kisses, I really melt myself seriously!

But how can I help it? I'm going to review this objectively for people who have seen the first two seasons before I go into my feelings in more depth.To begin with, there's actual small bits of kinda storyline at points throughout this season. While they still rely heavily on tropes, there is enough plot mixed in that it isn't the same drab formula over and over again. However, I will warn you that it does cut down on the...~smexy~ scenes quite a bit compared to the two preceding seasons.As for the art, it's an amazing improvement. I hated the art of the first two seasons, but this is so much cleaner and so much prettier that I can actually see how some characters might resemble proportional and possibly attractive human beings.The OP and closing are always upbeat as always, but I also appreciated the soft romantic background music that they began to use this season. It was a nice touch compared to before.However, again, the characters are my main problem with this show, like usual. They are honestly just fetishizing gay men and sexuality in general is kinda warped. Also, the men don't act like men? I doubt any actual gay man was involved in this project. It's very 'young woman writer writes about smexy alpha males who are paired with a variety of ukes who are very feminine and therefore expose the young female audience's dark fantasies without them having to face the fact that they like the idea of a dominating male' kinda thing. And in all honesty, the trap the show throws is exactly aimed at me-- I'm the audience they're looking for. So despite the lack of any real characterization, I still enjoy this show to bits.All in all, I really have to say that I hate myself for liking this, haha.I would recommend this if you: like classic yaoi, liked the first two seasons, like love triangles and jealousy plots, like seme/uke stuffI would NOT recommend this if you: hated the first two seasons, hate fetishization of sexuality, don't like the seme/uke dynamic, don't like heteronormative gay relationshipsP.S. I have to add that the 'rapey' scenarios are pretty toned down from seasons before as well.Have a great day everyone! ~smexy~ scenes quite a bit compared to the two preceding seasons.As for the art, it's an amazing improvement.

And season three is no exception! However, I believe that it is a must-do to watch the first and second seasons beforehand to fully understand the plot. Also, minor spoilers will be mentioned within this review. Without further adieu, let\'s go!First off, the character design. Studio Deen managed to capture the essence of the characters from the original 2008 anime, and further improved upon them. That is to be an expectation though, considering the seven year gap between the first and third seasons. The animation is fluid and well-produced, and...didn\'t leave me disappointed. It really is magical to be seeing Junjou Romantica in 720p.And now onto the story. It was as enjoyable as the previous seasons, and introduced a new and intriguing love interest. There were lots of heartfelt scenes between Usagi-san and Misaki, which was more than satisfactory for me. I also loved seeing the though processes of each character elaborated upon, as I found the psychological aspects of each character to be of great interest. It made for a very enjoyable experience.However, I most certainly did have some issues with this season. In particular, my frustration was towards Misaki, Usagi-san\'s love interest. At the end of the OP, Misaki is shown blushing and shy, but then he jumps on Usagi-san and kisses him. That gave me high hopes that Misaki would finally be true to his feelings and also initiate things with Usagi-san for once. However, I thought wrong. The most that is shown of Misaki being assertive is him saying he should ""molest"" Usagi-san, and then some failed attempts to try and top him. Like seriously, what the hell even happened to Misaki\'s character development? In the second season he was able to openly express that he loves Usagi-san, yet in the third he can barely mutter it to himself? It\'s aggravating to say the least.In conclusion, Junjou Romantica is a fantastic anime and one that all fujoshi and romance fans in general would enjoy. The pros far outweigh the cons. Each episode was so drama-filled that it constantly kept me on the edge of my seat. I highly recommend all three seasons of this anime. didn\'t leave me disappointed.

I highly recommend all three seasons of this anime.', ""Seems fitting I write a review on the third one like I did with the first two. This one was not as enjoyable for me. Unlike the first two seasons which had a steady time pace, this one just sped up quick. The first episode is set three years ahead which would be fine if the episodes flowed together. That didn't happen, though. Each episode to me was just fast paced. I think they jumped months ahead after the previous one unless it ended in some mini cliffhanger.Aside from that, the character development bothered me. Misaki and Usagi are my favorite couple out of the...three and while I enjoyed Misaki's slow acceptance with coming to terms with his feelings for Usagi the first two seasons, after three years I would expect him to grow up a bit and at least be able to admit he loves him and be open with him in private. But he still has that flighty personality.This couple was given nine out of twelve episodes and all you get is Misaki's back and forth with his feelings while making a new friend, setting up a career for himself and apparently now fighting the advances from another famous author. If I remember correctly, he was also dealing with Usagi's rude, freeloading cousin as well.Another thing I hated was the lack of actual intimate scenes. They were mostly implied this season, unlike the previous two seasons which also kind of ruined the viewing experience.The terrorist couple, nothing happened with them. No progress or nothing. Same with Nowaki and Hiroki. Then yet those couples only got one episode. I don't think I even want a fourth season. It might jump another three years and not make any sense. But still, this third season did not wrap anything up. three and while I enjoyed Misaki's slow acceptance with coming to terms with his feelings for Usagi the first two seasons, after three years I would expect him to grow up a bit and at least be able to admit he loves him and be open with him in private.

And this anime was on point on those two.As for the characters, I really liked watching them as they matured and came to understand the situtations in...each episode.Personally, I like the first couple and it seems to be the main couple in the series of JR.Misaki was a 10/10, the humor was great, I couldn't watch an episode without laughing just once at least, so I had to replay that moment over and over.Overall, a very good anime for yaoi lovers.I give this season a 10.Good animationFunny momentsGood storyImproved art each episode.Personally, I like the first couple and it seems to be the main couple in the series of JR.Misaki was a 10/10, the humor was great, I couldn't watch an episode without laughing just once at least, so I had to replay that moment over and over.Overall, a very good anime for yaoi lovers.I give this season a 10.Good animationFunny momentsGood storyImproved art"", ""I'd just like to state for the record that I'm 100% straight, though that didn't stop me watching (or enjoying) the whole Junjou Romantica/Sekai-ichi Hatsukoi franchise god knows how many years ago. Incidentally as many have pointed out then, media about gay relationships was understandably more scarce then so it was a really novel experience for me, and thus explains why my opinion of it might have been slightly disproportionate (by which I mean, inflated) then.If you are looking for a realistic portrayal of how gay relationships work, though I don't have any experience at it myself I daresay it's not as smooth-sailing and sparkly...perfect as JR portrays them to be. Sure, the characters face hiccups in their relationships, but all is always resolved at the end of the day with the power of love! (tm). Honestly, if you took out one of the characters in each pairing and substituted him with a girl, you would get every walking cliche in the shoujo book and considerably lower ratings, I believe. In each pairing there's usually a partner with a 'stereotypical' girl personality anyways (i.e. portrayed in manga as wildly insecure, often lets imagination run wild with worst case scenarios, and all-out tsundere), so the only thing that makes this remotely a yaoi anime is that the body housing the personality is male. The kind of hiccups they face in their relationships, while varied in manifestation, always emerge on the basis of insecurity and a whole lot of possessiveness- this is something that's been playing since season 1, and frankly it's feeling a lot like i'm running on a hamster wheel. I mean, the show's timeline states that the relationship has been ongoing for 3-7 years (depends on which pairing)- if your insecurities are still running so deep then, that's probably not a good sign.That aside, JR3 isn't without its positives. The touchy-feely scenes may come off as a touch too cliche, but mostly succeeded in leaving me with a warm fuzzy feeling inside, so I'll count that as a win for the producers. There's also a sense of the protags growing up, dealing with some real-life problems (transition from uni to work life, being gay in conservative Japan)- I'd have liked more on these but it was only 12 episodes so hopefully they'll be touched on in future seasons! The art while not fantastic is definitely above average, and something that really caught my attention this time round was the OST. Hijiri Anze has always done a good job with the JR and SIH BGM's, but I felt he really outdid himself with JR3's and am definitely looking to download it.tl,dr: not for you if you're looking for something serious (or, as should be obvious by now, if you are opposed to shows about gay relationships...), but if you want the fuzzies with a whole host of bishies do give JR a shot! perfect as JR portrays them to be.

It was sweet, fluffy and the inner struggle about falling in love with a guy, denying it and yet never wanted to let go was actually lovely to watch.The second season was good as it continues the first season. It filled the I-want-more parts, but as it progresses I became annoyed as some point especially the main couple Misaki and Akihiko.This third season became bland and annoying at most part. Although I should have expected it since the manga was way ahead of the anime. Still,...I don\'t understand as to how their (Misak and Akihiko) relationship hasn\'t progresses for more than, what? Five years of being together. When I say \'progresses\', I mean \'matured\'.Misaki was still in denial, almost as uncomfortable as he was the first time he realized he actually like Akihiko back. For a supposedly \'live-in\' relationship, he was still acting like a virgin on their first night together. He was so bipolar with his relationship with Akihiko, that when his lover shows him how much he loves him, he kept on pushing him and even gets mad at him for being clingy, but when Akihiko seems to momentarily became oblivious of him, he became whiny and paranoid and jealous for unknown reason.It was like he wanted to be continually tame, er, pursue, courted? in a way and yet doesn\'t want to return the favor. He was acting like a highschool girl, really. Even worst.Misaki also knew tha Akihiko was jealous with Ijuuin, and yet he continue to talked, get close and comfy with him. Yes, Ijuuin was his \'idol\', but he should know his boundary when he knew his \'lover\' was not comfortable with it. He kept on dismissing Akihiko, not once he actually shown he loves him in front of every one (that\'s why Sekai ichi hatsukoi is much much better, as Ritsu had shown and admitted that he loves Masamune) or anyone for that matter. He was like living in a lie, trying to hide things, and couldn\'t show or tell anyone he\'s in a relationship already. He can\'t even fight for it. He was always unsure. Even when the two of them would start doing the \'deed\', Misaki still struggles like he didn\'t want it, and yet allowed it at the end just because he was \'use\' to it and maybe it makes him feel \'good and relax\'.Akihiko on the other hand was way too clingy. For a man whom everyone respected, he was childish and immature. Yes, it was cute with the teddy bears and all, but relationship wise, he was very insecure. I guess his insecurity do have a reason. I mean if you have Misaki as your boyfriend, you \'should\' be very insecure. But Akihiko spoiled him too much, shower him affection too much and allowed Misaki to treat him like a trash and be pushed aside. It was like he has no pride whatsoever. Akihiko was always the pursuer, and it\'s kinda annoying. It doesn\'t matter if he\'s the seme, the fact is, when showing affection it shouldn\'t be a one way street.I was hoping at some point that Akihiko gets tired of Misaki\'s denial and just let him go. I mean if he really loves Misaki, then just let him do what he wants. If Misaki prefer to live on his own and do what he likes without thinking of Akihiko\'s reaction (which by the way appears as though it was a burden), he should let him do it. I want Misaki to be a pursuer and realized how he really love Akihiko. Because honestly, it seems their relationship only existed because Akihiko won\'t let go. Misaki\'s \'love\', if there is, won\'t mature if Akihiko won\'t let him, especially with his attitude of my-love-is-enough-for-the-two-of-us. It\'s poisonous!Their relationship should be revamp. Misaki should be \'freed\' from it, so he can do what he wants and have time to think things through without Akihiko\'s influence. Akihiko should, maybe, start trying a casual dating, both male and female and see if what he feels for Misaki was true or was only impinge by his long time affection from Misaki\'s brother wherein the time he was devastated Misaki was there for him, and therefore all his affection was poured out to the best available person at that time and the fact it was \'the brother\'.It would be nice to have their ending with Misaki facing Akihiko in a public place with a determine looked on his face saying ""I love you Akihiko (Yes, first name not the Usami-san he kept on saying), and I don\'t care what the world says otherwise. I don\'t care what my brother will say when he founds out, I don\'t care if you\'re doubting me at this point because I\'ll show you and prove to you how much if you only accept me back. I wanted to be with you and no else.""ART:The art was Nakamura-san style, so I have nothing to say about it. Although it\'s not much of my taste. The Hybrid Child, with the same illustrator and author, was done a little bit better on my opinion. The jaws are not too pointy and squared.The sound was okay. The storyline not so much.

I like pretty much every character and really have fun watching this series. If you're expecting any huge character/relationship developments to happen in this season, they really don't.. and it's really frustrating.. though there's a little. But if you have fun watching the show, this is still definitely worth it. Maybe spoiler-sh ahead? idk but if there's a 4th season they better not keep dragging out this whole thing with Misaki acting like Usagi is just the perverted roommate most of the time or whatever. As always very cute art though not...the best attention to detail, decent music, pretty good voice acting, and as always, great if you don't want something with tons of plot and character development but a generally light-hearted slice of life/romance and very fun watch. the best attention to detail, decent music, pretty good voice acting, and as always, great if you don't want something with tons of plot and character development but a generally light-hearted slice of life/romance and very fun watch."", ""So really isn't to be taken sereously, it's just good fujoshi trash.Sure, there are (some) age gaps, but come on it's yaoi wdyw. It's just an enjoyable dumpster fire.Sure the third relationship is a bit creepy but lets just put that fact aside and focus on how hot Usagi is.Emm the people wrighting trash about it clearly don't know what a modent masterpiece is, can't really remember much of the story, something with the main dudes brother. that's not the important part tho.Good for new and budding weebs, the second relationship is the best one. Artstyle is verry remanicent of the early 2000s, I mean...it's a love hate relationship. Just watch it, you've probably already wasted you're time on SAO so you have the time.10/10 wanted a wedding. it's a love hate relationship. Just watch it, you've probably already wasted you're time on SAO so you have the time.10/10 wanted a wedding."", 'There’s not much to say about Junjou. All the show does is follow a tried and tested formula, and it does this throughout all three seasons.A relationship is established after going through some issues and finally admitting their feelings for each other. Then another problem or issue is introduced, these usually revolve around jealousy, bad communication or meddling from outside by friends/family. The couple will always have worked out whatever it is by the end of the episode. Then in the next one it starts all over again, just with a new problem/issue.I find the side couples easier to deal with and enjoy to be...honest. And Usagi’s character is fine, but Misaki is just the worst example of what is meant to be the innocent & oblivious character trope. Instead of coming across as cute he comes across as in denial and full of self hatred. Why else would he keep denying the existence of a relationship between him and Usagi after they’ve been living and sleeping together for 3 years already? Pushing that trope too far just causes a character to turn into a cardboard cut out…He’s 21 years old just about to finish his University degree and this idiot has no idea that it takes more than just an editor to produce a book. I mean how stupid is he meant to be here? Because he’s like way past the line of naivety and innocence and so far into just being dumb it’s painful to watch him fumble his way through life in general.Anyway, let’s talk about the best part of this season. We all know what it is, the animation!! The quality from season 2 to 3 is just astounding. You can actually tell characters apart from the first glance, the backgrounds are actually clear, everyone’s faces don’t look like Isosceles triangles, body proportions and hands in particular xD are almost even. I mean if you watch all the seasons one after the other, when you get to the third it’s like your watching a top quality series. Even though if you were to compare to a different anime it would still be not very good at all. If they had actually matched it to the current art in the manga it would have been even better, but almost anything is better than those first two seasons xD you have to REALLY love this show to put yourself through the torture of watching that. honest. And Usagi’s character is fine, but Misaki is just the worst example of what is meant to be the innocent & oblivious character trope. Instead of coming across as cute he comes across as in denial and full of self hatred. Why else would he keep denying the existence of a relationship between him and Usagi after they’ve been living and sleeping together for 3 years already? Pushing that trope too far just causes a character to turn into a cardboard cut out…He’s 21 years old just about to finish his University degree and this idiot has no idea that it takes more than just an editor to produce a book. I mean how stupid is he meant to be here? Because he’s like way past the line of naivety and innocence and so far into just being dumb it’s painful to watch him fumble his way through life in general.Anyway, let’s talk about the best part of this season. We all know what it is, the animation!! The quality from season 2 to 3 is just astounding.

Mahoujin Guruguru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/331/Mahoujin_Guruguru,"[""Mahoujin Guru Guru is probably the craziest, wackiest anime I've ever seen. Slapstick is constant - nothing is ever serious for more than a minute, if that long.In Plain Old Village (that's actually the name), Nike has been undergoing &quot;training&quot; since he was very small, as his parents are adamant that he become a dashing hero someday. Conveniently, just as the boy has grown old enough to take care of himself (age 13), that's when all the trouble starts. When his dad finds out that the king is looking to recruit a hero to deal with this resurrected evil, one thing leads to another and...Nike meets magic user Kukuri. Though cute, soft-spoken, and pretty much idolizing her new friend, she has a bit of an attitude and struggles to learn the Guru Guru circles. This leads to a lot of bizarre &quot;oopsies.&quot; You'll just have to watch to understand.Along the way of their journey, they'll meet many interesting characters. And by interesting, I mean insane. There's an old man dressed in a hula skirt who pops up at the most inconvenient times to do a disturbing dance. A sprite who wears a loin cloth. An incompetent hero wanna-be who couldn't fight a butterfly with a flame thrower. And that's just to start! Nike and Kukuri themselves frequently act the complete opposite of what their position implies.The artwork is adorable and fun, drawn completely &quot;chibi&quot; style except for a few instances. This can, however, make it hard to guess how old a character is at times. While most anime shrink the characters down for exaggerated emotions, this show actually grows them up to &quot;normal&quot; size.Overall, this is a very, very silly show in a universe that you could wake up in and think you'd eaten some bad cheese. If you're a fan of a good fantasy story and/or have ever played an RPG, you will definitely appreciate the jokes. If you like romance, there's a bit of that. If you like random and nonsensical, there's enough to choke a horse. Basically there's something for everyone.

This anime also influence me into drawing.

Every episode is such a joy to watch and it never failed to bring a smile to my face.

Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35079/Kino_no_Tabi__The_Beautiful_World_-_The_Animated_Series,"['Keichii Sigsawa\'s \'Kino no Tabi (Kino\'s Journey) The Beautiful World\' is one of the longest running ongoing Light Novel series in existence, generally releasing a whole volume of material every year since 2000. In that time it has received first an Anime adaptation in 2003 directed by the late Ryutaro Nakemura, and this 2017 adaptation by Studio Lerche. For fairness, I will not try to compare this version to its source material or the previous adaptation too much and try to judge it based on its own merit.The premise of the series is that it follows the Journey of a traveller named Kino and their...talking Motorrad Hermes through their travels across a world made up of small countries which each encompass their own unique ideologies, cultures, and traditions. From this, Sigsawa uses the perspective of Kino, a traveller with no ties to a particular culture of their own and a maintained neutral outlook on the morally grey activities which they often come across, to look at multiple  facets of philosophy and the human condition. This results in a very interesting and thought provoking episodic series, whatever its incarnation.While this will be a positive review overall, as I did find more to enjoy about this adaptation than I didn\'t, I will start this review off discussing the negatives of the series first, as they are perhaps the more glaring issue with this adaptation, and the one which may turn potential viewers (be they familiar with the source material or not) off.The biggest issue with the adaptation is without a doubt the stories that were adapted for this versions. For those of you who didn\'t know, the stories from the LN selected for this adaptation were picked from a poll in which fans of the LN were asked to vote for their favourite stories from the series. While this may sound like a good idea on paper, as it means we get to see what the fans themselves picked as the highlights, sort of like making the series a Band\'s Greatest Hits compilation which can in turn help to entice new viewers, the issue comes about when the stories placed near each other cause the series to feel extremely uneven.What I mean by this is that in the original source material, these stories would have been written in the order they were for a reason. That becomes apparent when we see how tonally conflicting the series can be, as the episodes can often be radically different in terms of tone so that one week we witness a deep and quite dark study of the way that humans take their lives for granted but then next week get a silly, action packed episode. This often extreme tonal dissonance which occurs between the stories can often feel jarring, and lead to the feeling that the series suffers a severe identity crisis in which it doesn\'t quite know what it\'s trying to be as a series.It doesn\'t help also that some of the stories in the series perhaps aren\'t what I would have selected as being among my favourites. The worst offender perhaps being an episode which is itself a compilation of short stories which each feel insufferably self parodying and painful to watch (this is episode 9 in case I\'ve convinced you to skip this episode when you watch).Another major problem with the series is the direction it takes. Lerche are  a studio whose work I\'m only familiar with from this year, and from what I can gather, the popular consensus seems to be that they\'re an extremely uneven studio, and that certainly reflects in this adaptation, which additionally serves as a showcase for both the studio\'s strengths and weaknesses. They certainly aren\'t a studio known for subtlety for one thing, and when the series does try to showcase its more philosophical side by showcasing the actions of people within the societies that exist in this world, their emotions and negative reactions to things which dilute their customs can sometimes feel a bit overblown, not helping is some really overacting VA work for those characters. This can unfortunately cause the side characters to feel a bit like caricatures, and the way such scenes are so sporadically directed to have some sort of dynamic breakdown suddenly occur can often lead to it looking a tad more silly than it was possibly intended.Additionally, the studio\'s trademark heavily saturated lighting can sometimes cause the colour pallet to feel overblown and processed, and this becomes an issue when it subtracts from any atmosphere the story in question is trying to convey, and for those with more sensitive eyes can perhaps look a bit ugly when it is done wrong. That said, this lighting effect when done right can actually help to enhance the atmosphere in some episodes, and make some genuinely lovely background art which brings the world of the series to life, looking appropriately Beautiful as the title implies.Now, with these admittedly very large issues of inconsistent story quality and sometimes harmful directorial choices, I will say that the series is actually good overall, when it manages to overcome these issues.  More specifically, when the strength of the source material is able to shine through in the stronger episodes. For me, these would include episodes 1, 4, 5, 6 & 10.  Each of these episodes appeal to the main strength of the series, a frank look at philosophy and the human condition, sometimes told through a surprisingly dark and chilling lens which invites the viewer to reflect and think about the morality of what just transpired.On the side of characters, Kino and Hermes are of course the main characters of the series, travelling across the world with a neutral stance towards the (often terrifying) events they encounter which in turn helps us the audience to view them with a similar lens. Unfortunately, there\'s pretty much nothing in terms of development for the main character as a slight result of that aforementioned episode order, with the possible exception of episode 10.Adding fuel to the fire is the addition of episodes which don\'t feature Kino as the main character, as we also see stories told primarily through the perspectives of other travellers who Kino met on their journey, such as their mentor, and Shizu; the former prince of a dead kingdom who travels with a talking dog, and later a unique child. These characters are likeable enough on their own, and does provide a counterbalance by looking through the different perspectives of characters who lack Kino\'s neutral ideology and solve situations differently from how they would, but it does become a problem in the second half of the series when their episodes dominate and cause  Kino to feel almost insignificant in their own series.On the technical side of things, I already discussed the advantages and disadvantages of Lerche\'s heavily saturated lighting. The animation looks fine for the most part, though it does look fairly safe, there\'s nothing much unique about it. Some people criticised this change in artistic style from the 2003 adaptation, but this ignores the fact that Sigsawa\'s own illustrations for the series have changed through the years he has been working on the series. The 2003 version reflected the designs he used at that time, while this version reflects his current artstyle, so it isn\'t really ""betraying the source material"" as many said.The OST isn\'t particularly grabbing, while some of the side characters do overact a bit, the voice acting is generally fine for the most part, with Aoi Yuuki being typically lovely as the voice of the main character, and Inori Minase providing an appropriate mix of nervousness and calm to her one-off character. The OP and ED are both quite lovely (and evidently where most of the animation resources were allocated above all else) capturing the more calm and tranquil aspects of the series, as well as its serene sense of beauty.Perhaps the most frustrating conclusion I have come to in this review is that I still don\'t quite know who I\'d recommend this series to. I suppose if you consider yourself a ""Super fan"" of the source material you should at least try it, outside of that it becomes a bit trickier, as I\'ve seen from the community mixed responses to the series, some newcomers feeling unmotivated by it, others enjoying it, and similarly mixed opinions from fans of the 2003 adaptation. I will say that if you\'re a newcomer, the 2003  adaptation is probably a better bet to go on, as it has a much more consistent tone and represents the strengths of the source material in a much more solid way by ignoring some of the sillier storylines that pop up in this version. And check out this adaptation after that if you feel you can tolerate it.As I said before, despite this adaptation\'s glaring faults, its uneven quality, I still found it to be a fairly faithful adaptation of the source material. Especially in those stronger episodes that I highlighted. And it does reveal many of its cracks, especially in the second half of the series, but for what it was, and for those episodes I liked, I do give it credit. talking Motorrad Hermes through their travels across a world made up of small countries which each encompass their own unique ideologies, cultures, and traditions.

After those 2 episodes things get better and some episodes will leave...a good impression after finishing this series.The story is simple and relaxing following Kino on his motorrad through his journey from a country to another meeting different people and learning about each country's customs and culture during his 3 days stay. A variety of themes are explored and morals to learn from them at the end of each episode.The characters are better explored in this series especially the side characters who get a spotlight in some episodes (the focus is not only on Kino like in the old series) which is a strong point and brings a lot of diversity to the story and plot. The visuals are gorgeous and the scenery is very captivating and this is an essential factor for the main concept of this show.An interesting fact from this show is how they portrayed the bond between motorrads&travelers and presented both of their perspectives about the meaning of a journey.One big problem this show has are some episodes who lack substance and don't manage to get the viewer attached to the characters and story.For example they should explored more about the characters backgrounds and how they end up in that situation instead the presentation is rushed and it leaves a dry taste in your mouth after finishing an episode. Although the old Kino did a better job at that the remake has some remarkable episodes that will surely become your favorites.The scenery, ost and animation are superior and for those who enjoy those stuff from an anime if the old Kino didn't seem appealing to you this remake will surely captivate you , especially the opening song animation having a rich visual vocabulary and innovative concepts. So my advice is to give it a try and don't binge it you need to take your time with this show and enjoy each minute from it. a good impression after finishing this series.The story is simple and relaxing following Kino on his motorrad through his journey from a country to another meeting different people and learning about each country's customs and culture during his 3 days stay.

I say it that kind of way because the show\'s narration doesn\'t quite explicitly focus on them all the time, but then it\'s still fascinating to see how Kino survives with Hermes on the journeys of good and bad and getting a fine taste of what\'s to come.And also, this time we have another set of people: Shizu and Riku (from Episode 6) whose intention is the same: to travel around and experience life that\'s a journey. Unfortunately, I feel like their on-screen time could have been given a bit more than just 2 or 3 episodes, even if their plot started out a bit later. Unlike Kino, Shizu is more regressed and too also has a heart of gold, with the dog companion Riku, they both make good progress with their lives too.Overall, this series doesn\'t need to overshine the main and supporting characters, but they at least get the job done for showcasing a simple, yet intriguing series that keeps you on your toes.Art/Animation:Again, Lerche has done great on the series, albeit that most people prefer the original due to nostalgia. The truth is that while this series has nothing new to offer, it at least got an upgrade to the visuals and music (which I\'ll discuss later). For a world that\'s portrayed as ""not being beautiful, therefore it is"", the environment looks lush and beautiful and could not go any further. But with that said, some liberties are taken directly from the original source material, but it\'s honestly not too bad. Surprisingly enough, I did notice a fair share of lack in quality, but it quickly overshadows that with the immersive story. Another job well done.Sound:This might be the 1st of a few times where I actually like Yanagi Nagi\'s music composition with the OP and ED, it sticks out in a very melodious atmosphere, and honestly it could not get any better than this. Her music makes you feel like you\'re experiencing something totally new and fresh, and that\'s how I like how she portrays the surrounding and makes the sound of music combine with the visuals to give it a good-sounding edge over the rest of the other shows out there. Overall, high praises for the music and BGM, the reason why it compels me to watch this show.Overall:As mentioned, there\'s some debate over this and the original to further extent, and I don\'t blame anyone for it, because we do share our own opinions and have a liking for the ones we love. With that said, Kino\'s Journey -The Beautiful World- 2017 reimagining is one show from Fall 2017 not to be overlooked, even if the aesthetics do fall apart at times and have people overwhelmed by how it sticks out like a sore thumb to the original. I personally liked the calming atmosphere, and it is truly one of the great shows of the season. out for the country, even if for the citizens of the respective countries they come from.Honestly, I wouldn\'t go so far as to call the 2017 version a reboot of Kino\'s Journey, but like as mentioned, a reimagining with sprinkles of the original anime mixed into the substance as well, and I kinda quite liked the direction it took, even if some scenes were hard to understand and swallow.Characters:The simple Kino, her adaptation of the name from a traveler of the same name who got murdered (Episode 11 spoilers) riding along with her motorrad Hermes, both characters take the cake for being the main ""protagonists"" of the show. I say it that kind of way because the show\'s narration doesn\'t quite explicitly focus on them all the time, but then it\'s still fascinating to see how Kino survives with Hermes on the journeys of good and bad and getting a fine taste of what\'s to come.And also, this time we have another set of people: Shizu and Riku (from Episode 6) whose intention is the same: to travel around and experience life that\'s a journey. Unfortunately, I feel like their on-screen time could have been given a bit more than just 2 or 3 episodes, even if their plot started out a bit later. Unlike Kino, Shizu is more regressed and too also has a heart of gold, with the dog companion Riku, they both make good progress with their lives too.Overall, this series doesn\'t need to overshine the main and supporting characters, but they at least get the job done for showcasing a simple, yet intriguing series that keeps you on your toes.Art/Animation:Again, Lerche has done great on the series, albeit that most people prefer the original due to nostalgia. The truth is that while this series has nothing new to offer, it at least got an upgrade to the visuals and music (which I\'ll discuss later). For a world that\'s portrayed as ""not being beautiful, therefore it is"", the environment looks lush and beautiful and could not go any further. But with that said, some liberties are taken directly from the original source material, but it\'s honestly not too bad. Surprisingly enough, I did notice a fair share of lack in quality, but it quickly overshadows that with the immersive story. Another job well done.Sound:This might be the 1st of a few times where I actually like Yanagi Nagi\'s music composition with the OP and ED, it sticks out in a very melodious atmosphere, and honestly it could not get any better than this. Her music makes you feel like you\'re experiencing something totally new and fresh, and that\'s how I like how she portrays the surrounding and makes the sound of music combine with the visuals to give it a good-sounding edge over the rest of the other shows out there. Overall, high praises for the music and BGM, the reason why it compels me to watch this show.Overall:As mentioned, there\'s some debate over this and the original to further extent, and I don\'t blame anyone for it, because we do share our own opinions and have a liking for the ones we love.

The original 2003 series was a hidden gem of the decade that depicted a series of short stories that were parables focused on elements of the human condition observed through the traveler, Kino. The stories tended to vary in their mood and intensity, being either bizarre, insightful, or having a dark and twisted element to them. In spite of the changing moods, the 2003 Kino's Journey adaptation did a great job with balancing them out with exploring both the joys and pains of being human.This remake sadly lacks the subtlety and...nuances that made its 2003 counterpart a pleasure to watch. The stories for this remake are more blatant in exploring the moral they are focused on and many of them seemed to lack the time to allow the viewer to be immersed into exploring the various lands visited by Kino, thus reducing the impact of when the true side of the visited country gets revealed. The story order also felt more disjointed as several episodes of this series shifted over to exploring other characters like the swordsman, Shizu, and the slave girl, Photo. While interesting characters in their own right, there's little further elaborated on with Shizu following his introduction and Photo only has a single episode devoted to her. But perhaps the worst element to this adaptation of Kino's Journey is the series often getting too immersed into showing off action when Kino and Shizu get into any sort of major conflict. Said action scenes mostly have nothing to do with exploring the moral of each of its episodic stories beyond showing off the anime's animation and goes against the whole point of Kino's Journey about the series as a whole being moral-focused parables with an occasional cruel twist. Anyone who has seen the 2003 adaptation of Kino will notice the rather jarring difference in story mood, focus, and presentation choices as some episodes for this remake adapt stories also featured in the 2003 anime like the Coliseum arc and the Land of Adults story.The only real praise that I can give this remake of Kino's Journey is the improved artwork over the original series. There is greater detail put into character designs and scenic shots are more pleasing on the eyes. Animation is also more fluid for the most part with more natural movement depicted with characters, especially noticeable during the anime's action scenes. In spite of the improved animation though, the use of CG animation still sticks out badly compared to the regular animation and is quite noticeable at points where complicated animated sequences are depicted, particularly whenever Kino is riding on Hermes. Also in terms of a presentation choice for a series like Kino, the more detailed and brightly-colored visuals don't mesh well with a series like Kino that is more focused on exploring the morals each story has to offer up on an element of the human condition.Overall, I would say Kino's Journey 2017 easily makes for the biggest disappointment I have for an anime series this year. In spite of its improved visuals, it felt like Lerche did not have a clue on what made Kino's Journey an enjoyable series during its 2003 run as there were points where it felt like the series was unsure over what it wanted to focus on and then when making the effort to explore a moral, the focus of it felt forced and lacked the subtlety and impact offered from its original series. If you want a better option at seeing how Kino's Journey could be adapted in animated form, I strongly suggest checking out the 2003 series over this subpar adaptation for it. nuances that made its 2003 counterpart a pleasure to watch.

This season is a remake.Story: (8/10)As of episode six there is not much to the story but it is simple. The main character goes from country to country in what seems to be a post apocalyptic world. The world is very separated and each country she visits seems to harbor something new and unexpected. This story tells of her adventures as she travels with her talking motorbike named Hermes. She meets dangerous and humble strangers and learns new ways of life.Art: (9/10)As the world is ""anything but beautiful""...the animation proves otherwise.

They are really shrouded in mystery along with the world around them. Kino is a very like able character and I enjoy seeing what she has up her sleeve next. She is actually quite bad ass.

Yeah, I know, weird. But I like it and I wouldn\'t want it any other way. Hermes is Kino\'s companion on her travels. We do not know much about their ways but to me it seems they are inseparable.We end up meeting a few characters here and there that Kino becomes acquainted with during her travels.

Why such a low score? It is because there is no reason to watch it. The 2003 version is better, and Lerche\'s remake has no good ideas and none of the things that made the original so loveable. This new Kino, cutesy and staid, has only really succeeded in becoming a clunky metaphor for the anime industry at large—gutted, and a hollow husk of her former self.Kino\'s Journey has been lobotomized in favour of something more...accessible and easily digestible. All the magic is dead. Gone are the days where Kino riding Hermes around the countryside was given the dignity of normal 2D animation. That old friend you loved, the sepia tones and the somber beauty of an angular, awe-inspiring world, is no more. There\'s something unsettling and depressing seeing some new studio snatch up this I.P. and make it dance to the tune of modern anime trends, and thinking about this well after finishing the series has been the only time Lerche\'s remake made me feel something akin to what those old Kino episodes did.What is the purpose of this show? Why does it exist, and why watch it? That\'s why I\'m here writing this, to warn adventurers that some countries aren\'t worth going to—that they look like the towns you know, streets you grew up on and vistas you have grown to love over the years, but are now dead countries, joyless and cheap and filled with a million identical cardboard cutouts of high-gloss Akihabara maid cafés staffed by energetic catgirls in miniskirts. Those old memories would be worser for it. There is no beauty here, only popcorn and a quick flip to the next channel.The world is not beautiful, therefore it is; some worlds are ugly, and sap the life out of those you love.Is this show any worse than others this season? Probably not, but it all depends on what you value as a viewer. If you want something easily watched and easily forgotten, Kino\'s Journey 2017 is definitely for you. But if you want something meaningful, something that you might love and cherish for years afterward, please just watch the original. accessible and easily digestible. All the magic is dead.

It is not an objective view of the 2017 anime alone. I would have found it boring and shitty regardless of the 2003 show\'s context, but then this review would lack the indignation of seeing everyone\'s favorite anime indie art film reduced to a cheap and casual throwaway series.Are you new to Kino\'s Journey? Well lucky for you the whole original series is available on a number...of streaming services for free and there\'s no need for you to waste your time here.Memorize the phrase ""boring and shitty"", because that can be used to describe most of this tonally devoid, shallow, toothless, low IQ series.THE PREMISE:Kino\'s Journey is the tale of a person named Kino who is on a Journey. WOW, right? But it\'s not a traditional adventure story, it\'s a much more philosophical one. The pitch is that Kino stops at a country for exactly three days, takes in the culture, and leaves. Every different country presents a different moral dilemma to consider, and Kino serves as an outsider looking in, generally choosing not to get wrapped up in their affairs. You\'ll get presented with prompts that cause you to consider the nature of communication, humanity, society, free will, morality, etc and each adventure has a little take-away and food for thought. Like a demented book of fables, Kino shows us something about our world by exploring the one she lives in.If that sounds great, this is not the series for you, because this adaptation is basically about one of the girls from K-On! scooting around shooting people with a psychotically apathetic smile on her face, presented in the most boring ways possible.THE STORY:The original Kino\'s Journey introduced us to Kino, the philosophical nature of her Journey, and the shit she has to go through and how she copes with it.This adaptation opens with Kino eating cake and then some guy gets murdered, with the moral of the story being ""if everyone owned a gun, society would be peaceful"" and that\'s about it. Kino then goes to a place and kills a bunch of people for the sake of testing her skills and avenging a character we\'re never introduced to. She never shows emotion and seems completely disinterested in everything that\'s happening around her. She has no established rules or moral code and by episode three she\'s a traveling murderer and not much else can be derived from her time on screen.THE ART and ANIMATION:The original Kino was low-budget for sure, it was indie as hell, but had incredible direction and cinematography to make up for it. The series original series is moody, tense, eerie and kind of surreal. It still holds up today as something unique and fascinating.This series looks like Sword Art Online. All the characters look the same. All backgrounds are devoid of real detail. All colors are bright and cheery at all times, with flat colors and no thought about lighting. All camera angles are flat shots of talking heads or just panning shots of nothing. There is no cinematography going on here. Kino\'s bike is CGI because modern Japanese animators can\'t fucking draw, but they\'re also paid $500 a year, so who would want to?The opening sequence is a poppy borefest of BIRDS BIRDS BIRDS because Kino said something about birds once. It\'s like this whole thing is directed by a high school student.WHAT DOES IT SOUND LIKE?The original series\' music is pretty cool, with acoustic guitars and panflutes and one darn great OP.This series has j-pop. It\'s about as generic as an OST can get. It feels very upbeat at all times, no matter what\'s going on.Kino here sounds kawaii. Her bike\'s voice actor sounds like, uh, Mechazawa from Cromartie High? Soothing and male? Originally the bike\'s voice was grainy and cynical-sounding, adding to the series\' eerie atmosphere. In this one, the voice aligns with the series having no atmosphere at all, so I guess it\'s fitting.All side characters sound as over-acted and generic as you could expect anime characters to sound. Kino\'s Journey has gone from one of the most off-beat Japanese properties to one of the most unimaginative and anemic.ARE YOU JUST MAD THAT IT\'S DIFFERENT?No, I\'m mad because it\'s shit.2003 Fullmetal and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood are different series. They\'re both good and do different things with their different tones. One is a drama, the other is action shounen.B-BUT THIS ONE IS MORE FAITHFUL TO THE SOURCE THAN THE ORIGINAL ANIMEI hate to break this to you bud, but the Kino novels are probably mostly crap, written by a hack, and the original anime\'s directors, writers and artists are what made the show memorable. I love Nightow, but no one wants a faithful Gungrave adaptation. It\'s the same situation here. The author supplied a cool character and premise, and people with more talent than he made Kino a franchise worth remembering. That\'s that.This series has no tone. It\'s just bad and effortless. It\'s a lifeless application of ""How to Make a Marketable Anime in 2017 in 5 Easy Steps"" except they fucked it up because they applied it to Kino\'s Journey and not fantasy light novel #8473.There\'s really nothing redeeming here.Go watch the original.Unless you\'re just into anime because you want something that looks the same as everything else you watch and have no interest in thinking or feeling any mild discomfort at all.

I hate you though.', ""“Sometimes having a remake of a well-known series isn’t a good idea at all because it can potentially damage a franchise for good” -Me 2017The Orginal Kino's Journey or as I like to call it OG Kino is an endless classic that many anime fans love. It had great worldbuilding, amazing themes, and messages; the episodic episodes were well told and well written that had a point. The characters despite being episodic were all memorable and likable due to them being well written. The visuals while being basic had great direction and cinematography and music while not having many tracks was still great. Plus both...the sub and the dub were very good.While I was watching OG Kino I decided to watch the new Kino alongside with OG Kino weekly. After watching the last episode of New Kino as well watching the last episode of OG a day prior to watching the last episode of New Kino and am going to say this right now.New Kino or as I like to call it Lerche Kino completely misses the point of the original series in every way possible as well completely disrespects fans of the original series.After watching OG I was satisfied with what I watched, however, Lerche Kino makes me facepalm because Lerche Kino took everything that was great from the OG Kino and manages to fuck it all up to a point where I can say is THIS IS NOT MY KINO.With all that said Hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcomes to my review of Kino' Journey 2017 (Lerche Kino) and with that all that said let's us begin.Story.The story of Lerche Kino is the same as the original Kino. It follows a young girl called Kino and her talking motorcycle Hermes and they travel to many different countries and forests, each unique in its customs and people. She only spends three days and two nights in every town, without exception, on the principle that three days is enough time to learn almost everything important about a place while leaving time to explore new lands.The story of Lerche Kino is a mess. A very boring, uninspiring and poorly directed mess.To get things started the show doesn’t have much atmosphere. I know am talking about the visuals this early but this is the problem that Lerche kino and it hardly goes away. Because Lerche has almost no atmosphere most of the worlds that Lerche Kino goes to arc bland compared to the original. You see every Country in OG has a different and unique atmosphere that showcases the tone of each country as well as the theme. Lerche Kino hardly does this because each world that Lerche Kino shows are either watered down versions of OG Kino or they are just uninspiring new Country’s that OG Kino did not showcase.One of the examples of Lerche Kino being uninspiring is in episode 1 A Country Where People Can Kill Others. That episode alone completely sets the wrong tone of the series which I will explain soon after a compare the first episode of OG Kino. The first episode of OG Kino which is called Land of Visible Pain where Kino visits a town where people with incredibly advanced technology, however, it appears that everyone is living in total isolation and shuns any contact of other people. Once Kino finally started to have a conversation with one the town residents he reveals the advanced technology of the town allowed them to modify their bodies so they can understand each other thoughts allowing for much easier communication. Ofbersly this idea eventually turned sour because it meant that people could no longer hide thoughts on each other and so the nonstop communication eventually drove everyone in the town into isolation. The main themes that were explored in that episode were human modifying, isolation and the consequences of relying on advanced technology. OG Kino did a great job with the first episode and its easily one of the best first episode I have ever seen in an anime.Lerche Kino Episode 1 A Country Where People Can Kill Others is a perfect example of how to not do the first episode. Kino travels to a country where murder is legal and the reason why she even wants to travel to that country is that she want's to kill someone just for her own satisfaction that she killed someone. She want's to kill someone not because she has a grudge against someone or anything like that but she wants to kill someone just for her own satisfaction. Do you see how this series completely misses the point? Not only that the episode itself doesn't really change the nature of the murder of that town not to mention there's barely any theme exploration as well having characters that you can sympathize with in that town.Don’t get me started with the Colosseum arc in episode 2 because that arc was atrocious. Not only the themes were butchered to hell but the pacing, writings, character interactions/development and production values were abysmal.  It felt like a badly made shounen series.Another problem with Lerche is pacing and worldbuilding. The pacing in Lerche Kino is honestly pretty damn bad. Most episodes just drag on to the point where you just get bored and let’s be real unlike OG Kino most of the events of Lerche are not that interesting in a slightest due to the show butchering its themes and messages for no reason other than appeal to the lowest common denominator of anime fans who like watching crappy light novel adaptations from A1 Pictures. As for worldbuilding, it’s very lackluster and almost none existent. Every Country in OG had a lot of detail put into it while most of the Country in Lerche Kino feels empty and lifeless.However, I give Lerche Kino this.As much I dislike Lerche Kino colosseum arc Lerche Kino did a good job with the Kino back-story arc and it was the only arc that I can consider to be good in Lerche Kino,Overall the story of Lerche Kino is terrible. It has poor pacing, butchered arcs, no atmosphere, barely any themes exploration.3/10Characters.This is where the show literally falls apart.Why because the characters in Lerche Kino are a complete bastardization to the OG counterparts.Seriously it’s like director Tomohisa Taguchi didn’t even watch the original series while directing Lerche Kino.Let’s start with Kino herself. What did Tomohisa Taguchi do to you? The original Kino is a transient being and her personality was kept to a minimum. What makes the original Kino so great are her unpredictable reactions.Lerche Kino has too much personality and she often portrayed as a little brat. What makes it worse he is her reactions which are almost predictable and this alone completely defeats the entire point of her character. Overall Lerche Kino is shit.As for the rest of characters. They are all bland and uninteresting which is honestly a shame because characters like Shizu and Shishou were interesting in the original while in the new one they are bland and uninteresting.Overall the characters in Lerche are a big failure.2/10Visuals.The original Kino wasn’t the best-looking anime in the world is as it sticks to the old washed out color pallet for every episode but what the original Kino had over Lerche Kino is constantly as well having great cinematography.Why am I bringing this up? Because the visuals in Lerche Kino is shit.Terrible lighting, subpar character designs that are inconstant and constantly go off model, awful background design that doesn’t fit with characters that are in it. What makes this worse is the camera shots and overall direction. For example Episode 1 we have a close shot of Kino traveling while the backgrounds are just burred out and overall less detailed. Also unlike the original Hermes is completely done in CGI and it was horrible. Poor Hermes you DESERVED better than this.As for the animation itself, it’s pretty okay overall.The main reason why I really dislike the visuals of Lerche Kino’s because not only it abandons the charm and consistently from the original but it actually butchered a lot of messages thanks to this shows shitty visual direction and poor camerawork.Overall the visuals of Lerche Kino are shit and it completely missed the point of the original Kino.3/10Sound.The soundtrack in Lerche Kino is bland and very forgettable.The opening and ending themes are pretty decent overall and they fit into the series quite decently.As for sub vs dub. They are both pretty good overall so I have no complaints.5/10Final Thoughts.So that was Lerche Kino. A bad remake that has terrible production values, shitty writing, butchered themes, lackluster characters and awful pacing.This is honestly one of the worst anime remakes I have ever seen in anime.It completely misses the point of the original Kino series and it has no charm on its own at all.This is one no contest one of the worst animes from 2017.You better off watching the original Kino and completely skipping Lerche Kino.Final Score 3/10 the sub and the dub were very good.While I was watching OG Kino I decided to watch the new Kino alongside with OG Kino weekly. After watching the last episode of New Kino as well watching the last episode of OG a day prior to watching the last episode of New Kino and am going to say this right now.New Kino or as I like to call it Lerche Kino completely misses the point of the original series in every way possible as well completely disrespects fans of the original series.After watching OG I was satisfied with what I watched, however, Lerche Kino makes me facepalm because Lerche Kino took everything that was great from the OG Kino and manages to fuck it all up to a point where I can say is THIS IS NOT MY KINO.With all that said Hello everyone this is Shawn aka KurataLordStage and welcomes to my review of Kino' Journey 2017 (Lerche Kino) and with that all that said let's us begin.Story.The story of Lerche Kino is the same as the original Kino. It follows a young girl called Kino and her talking motorcycle Hermes and they travel to many different countries and forests, each unique in its customs and people. She only spends three days and two nights in every town, without exception, on the principle that three days is enough time to learn almost everything important about a place while leaving time to explore new lands.The story of Lerche Kino is a mess. A very boring, uninspiring and poorly directed mess.To get things started the show doesn’t have much atmosphere. I know am talking about the visuals this early but this is the problem that Lerche kino and it hardly goes away. Because Lerche has almost no atmosphere most of the worlds that Lerche Kino goes to arc bland compared to the original. You see every Country in OG has a different and unique atmosphere that showcases the tone of each country as well as the theme. Lerche Kino hardly does this because each world that Lerche Kino shows are either watered down versions of OG Kino or they are just uninspiring new Country’s that OG Kino did not showcase.One of the examples of Lerche Kino being uninspiring is in episode 1 A Country Where People Can Kill Others. That episode alone completely sets the wrong tone of the series which I will explain soon after a compare the first episode of OG Kino. The first episode of OG Kino which is called Land of Visible Pain where Kino visits a town where people with incredibly advanced technology, however, it appears that everyone is living in total isolation and shuns any contact of other people. Once Kino finally started to have a conversation with one the town residents he reveals the advanced technology of the town allowed them to modify their bodies so they can understand each other thoughts allowing for much easier communication. Ofbersly this idea eventually turned sour because it meant that people could no longer hide thoughts on each other and so the nonstop communication eventually drove everyone in the town into isolation. The main themes that were explored in that episode were human modifying, isolation and the consequences of relying on advanced technology. OG Kino did a great job with the first episode and its easily one of the best first episode I have ever seen in an anime.Lerche Kino Episode 1 A Country Where People Can Kill Others is a perfect example of how to not do the first episode. Kino travels to a country where murder is legal and the reason why she even wants to travel to that country is that she want's to kill someone just for her own satisfaction that she killed someone. She want's to kill someone not because she has a grudge against someone or anything like that but she wants to kill someone just for her own satisfaction. Do you see how this series completely misses the point? Not only that the episode itself doesn't really change the nature of the murder of that town not to mention there's barely any theme exploration as well having characters that you can sympathize with in that town.Don’t get me started with the Colosseum arc in episode 2 because that arc was atrocious. Not only the themes were butchered to hell but the pacing, writings, character interactions/development and production values were abysmal.  It felt like a badly made shounen series.Another problem with Lerche is pacing and worldbuilding. The pacing in Lerche Kino is honestly pretty damn bad. Most episodes just drag on to the point where you just get bored and let’s be real unlike OG Kino most of the events of Lerche are not that interesting in a slightest due to the show butchering its themes and messages for no reason other than appeal to the lowest common denominator of anime fans who like watching crappy light novel adaptations from A1 Pictures. As for worldbuilding, it’s very lackluster and almost none existent. Every Country in OG had a lot of detail put into it while most of the Country in Lerche Kino feels empty and lifeless.However, I give Lerche Kino this.As much I dislike Lerche Kino colosseum arc Lerche Kino did a good job with the Kino back-story arc and it was the only arc that I can consider to be good in Lerche Kino,Overall the story of Lerche Kino is terrible. It has poor pacing, butchered arcs, no atmosphere, barely any themes exploration.3/10Characters.This is where the show literally falls apart.Why because the characters in Lerche Kino are a complete bastardization to the OG counterparts.Seriously it’s like director Tomohisa Taguchi didn’t even watch the original series while directing Lerche Kino.Let’s start with Kino herself. What did Tomohisa Taguchi do to you? The original Kino is a transient being and her personality was kept to a minimum. What makes the original Kino so great are her unpredictable reactions.Lerche Kino has too much personality and she often portrayed as a little brat. What makes it worse he is her reactions which are almost predictable and this alone completely defeats the entire point of her character. Overall Lerche Kino is shit.As for the rest of characters. They are all bland and uninteresting which is honestly a shame because characters like Shizu and Shishou were interesting in the original while in the new one they are bland and uninteresting.Overall the characters in Lerche are a big failure.2/10Visuals.The original Kino wasn’t the best-looking anime in the world is as it sticks to the old washed out color pallet for every episode but what the original Kino had over Lerche Kino is constantly as well having great cinematography.Why am I bringing this up?

A bad remake that has terrible production values, shitty writing, butchered themes, lackluster characters and awful pacing.This is honestly one of the worst anime remakes I have ever seen in anime.It completely misses the point of the original Kino series and it has no charm on its own at all.This is one no contest one of the worst animes from 2017.You better off watching the original Kino and completely skipping Lerche Kino.Final Score 3/10"", 'I personally like Kino\'s design and yay! for the ""rare"" female protagonist! But that alone shouldn\'t be the deciding factor.Jumping straight to the story;I\'ve watched ""a few"" episodes of the 2003 version and I would say that I prefer the reboot (2017 version). I dropped the 2003 version after a few episodes because I didn\'t really like how they did the show.In the 2003 version, I personal found that the stories were a bit ""too vague"" (with morals neither here nor there...verging more towards negative I would say), not to mention that Kino was acting indifferent even in the face of injustice (not sure...about later episodes of the 2003 version). The 2003 version seems to be pushing this thing about humans being immoral/evil, and ""that\'s just how humans are and we should let them be""...which I\'m strongly against. Well, I guess that\'s to be expected from the theme of the show which is ""The world is not beautiful, therefore it is.""I\'m not sure about others, but I find that Kino and Hermes in the 2003 version quite annoying as most of their dialogues seemed pretty empty and at some points had questionable morals and reasoning...Pros of the 2017 version as a standalone:- Kino having more depth as a moralistic person. I like how in this version it clearly shows what Kino is okay with and what she\'s not okay with. Thankfully, so far (up to ep 5) there hasn\'t been any questionable reasoning by Kino.- Hermes says questionable things once in awhile but I\'m glad that the show made it clear that its just Hermes\'s point of view as a motorrad / machine.- I like how this show highlights humans being evil and that oftentimes criminals/evil people should be gotten rid-of to maintain peace.Cons of the 2017 version as a standalone:- Kino seems somewhat overpowered at times compared to the average civilian but then again there are some other characters in the show which are somewhat overpowered as well...so I guess I could just brush it off as something that just goes on in Kino\'s universe, as in if you\'re skilled, you\'re going to be somewhat super skilled at times.. Thankfully most of the time it\'s done somewhat realistically.- Some episodes feel empty. As in it works as a story but doesn\'t have much meaning behind it.- There are some logic holes here and there. Thankfully not much.- Oddly enough, Kino\'s sex seems to be a ""thing"" in this reboot. I\'m not sure why as it just seems off... Well I guess that\'s to be expected when most people seem to be really into finding out what genitalia a person has...and assuming that they would act differently based on certain preconceptions about their sex...Overall Enjoyment:I\'m still enjoying it for now because it\'s rare for a show to highlight corrupted humans and actually encourage getting rid of them. And I personally enjoy watching Kino in action XD. Hopefully the show continues to be decent.Rating: Wanted to give 10, because it\'s rare and hard to find a show doing well when it comes to human nature and morality... but sadly there are some major logic flaws in some episodes... So it\'ll be a 9 for me. about later episodes of the 2003 version).

So it\'ll be a 9 for me.', 'Doing reboots, remakes, or any sort of revival of a certain work always seems to be an insurmountable task for just about any creator. It becomes sort of a balancing act where to the fans, the work doesn’t stray too far from the original that it loses the point of the original was all about, and it isn’t too similar that it feel like a rehash of what has been done before. It feels the need to appease old fans without blocking out new fans, and open up to new fans without insulting the old fans. When it comes to Kino’s journey, well it comes...down right in the middle of all these and maybe thanks duely to the source material that the show proves to be a competent yet vapid dud.Depending on how you look at it kino’s journey is either a remake or re-adaptation of the 2003 anime or light novel, respectively. The series follows a motorist and her talking motorcycle as they travel around to diffrent counties, which serve more as walled city-states than actual countries. Kino only stays in each country for 3 days and 2 nights which most of the story is focused on. As each country is truly unique on its own as each one fluctuates when it comes to technology, culture, and ideologies, so in one instance they can be in a futuristic country and in another they can be in a pseudo early-industrial europe. The world of Kino’s journey isn’t interested in constructing a cohesive world, but rather create small vignettes to look into different ideas, ethics, and purposes in life.  With the residents of each country, or just about any character serving as mouthpiece for some sort of idea. While kino serves as a stand in for the viewers as an observer for the events that happen in almost each episode. The shows are episodic in nature, and it usually goes comes full circle within or across an episode/s. However while this show does stay true to what kino is about, there are several aspects that it fails which the 2003 kino’s journey did better.Now don’t take this as me being nostalgic over the original show since i only watched a bit of it when i was younger, and only got around to finishing it this year.Since kino’s journey is an episodic series with no clear overarching structure the show had the ability to tread new ground. Which it did as the show ventured into new countries, and meet new people. Yet at the same time it also has episodes where it retreads over what the previous show did. It’s because of this that i can’t help but compare the two shows, and why this series isn’t at the same level as it’s predecessor.While this version of kino is more polished when it comes to its production value, the same can’t be said about its writing. The show comes off as predictable as the end result or at least how the show will pan out can be seen way before the halfway point. While being predictable isn’t a bad thing, it starts to become very weary after each episode. It’s also because of its predictability of the show that it starts lacks any sort of driving point to any of the episodes. Even its darkest of moments feel empty as all it can do has been presented and it has nothing more to say. While the older one was very on the nose on what message it was trying to convey, at least it tried to leave something thoughtful for the viewers to leave with. There’s also a pacing issue that happens in one episode mostly due to the fact that the older version lasted on that country for 2 episodes. Even in the older version it was one of the lower point in the series, but compared to this it changed my perspective on how well done it was in the older version.Now these two come off more as nitpicks about thing i personally didn’t like which may not have bothered others. The first being that some of the episodes are wasted on other characters rather than on kino. I get that the show wants to focus on other characters that kino have meet on their travels, but this is called “Kino’s Journey” not “Kino and and other’s Journey. It’s not detrimental to the series, but i would rather the show just focus on Kino and only Kino. secondly is structure which is odd since it being episodic means it doesn’t really have a structure, but this is mostly focused on two certain episodes. The episode that is about kino’s origins, and the episode that sort of serves as a mirror between her and another character in that episode. It’s the problem that it tried to do the same, but also being different at the same time that the episodes lack the sort of emotional impact that the older version had.I don’t want to come down as not liking the show. I still thought it was an enjoyable experience during the moment. It still had many aspects that made kino fun to watch even if not all of it was fully actualized down right in the middle of all these and maybe thanks duely to the source material that the show proves to be a competent yet vapid dud.Depending on how you look at it kino’s journey is either a remake or re-adaptation of the 2003 anime or light novel, respectively.

The appeal of the series supposedly based on the uniqueness of each country they visit, rather than some overarching grand adventure, so apart from some recurring characters, there is very little connection between the episodes, and indeed from what I heard it’s neither in the order of the original novel, nor in the order of the previous adaptation.Therefore the enjoyment of the...series rests on how interesting or thought provoking each individual country/story is. While I had high expectations , in general the stories fell rather flat for me. A couple of them could probably be considered “memorable”, but most range from mediocre to forgettable. And even the memorable ones are hardly masterpieces, just more unique than the rest.This is not helped by the fact that each story has to be either one episode or half an episode long, which makes some of them feel slow and drawn out, while others feel too fast and hurried.The ending, however, was just... bad. I'm not really how sure how they can close of a series in this format, but episode 11 seems like a much more fitting ending than 12, which consists of bizarre story followed by Kino murmuring half-asleep about where travel begin and ends. It's just... completely anti-climatic.Kino travels through a myriad of different settings, from rural to urban, from ancient to modern, from land to sea. It could have been a great visual feast, but instead Kino no Tabi choose to use a drab, faded, one-look-fits-all type of feel. It works in the sense that the world feels coherent despite the different settings, however it takes away the uniqueness of each different country, and make them all feel like clones with minor adjustments.Character animation is somewhat stable, however there are serious problems with certain animated sequences, particularly the 3D ones -- oftentimes the framerate is so bad that it feels like watching a slideshow rather than an animation.The OP, ED, and OST as a whole is largely forgettable, and nothing from the OST even pops into mind. It's just... bland and boring like most of the show.In the end, I’d probably rate the best stories 8/10, and the worst ones 3/10, and the ending 1/10. The series as a whole would sit somewhere at 5/10. series rests on how interesting or thought provoking each individual country/story is.

A 13-episode anime adaptation was produced by A.C.G.T and Genco aired between April and July 2003. Two manga adaptations were produced, and a new anime series aired 12 episodes between October and December 2017. As of 2017, around 8.2 million copies of the novels have been sold in Japan. Newtype USA (a monthly magazine publication originating from Japan, covering anime and manga) named Kino\'s Journey the Book of the Month for November 2006 and called it...""inviting and addictive,"" while AnimeOnDVD said it ""sucks you in,"" and ""allows you to experience the journey"" together with the main character of the series, Kino. The series has a huge fan base, including the fact that the series is usually mentioned in Takarajimasha\'s light novel guide book Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi!.Interestingly, you do not have to watch the original series to understand the new remake. It is still highly recommendable to watch the 2003 version after finishing the newer one. However, do not think that the original is much better than the remake. What I am trying to say is that if you do not like the remake, there is no need for you to watch the original series. Anyways, for those who do not know anything about that title, I will say it one more time, you do not have to watch the original series first; however, if you are a fan of old animation, you can watch the original first and after it watch the remake. It addition to this, if you think that you can call yourself a fan, consider reading the novel, too.  By the way, I would also like to mention the fact that I am going to refer to the main protagonist of the series (Kino) as they. While their gender is not a major spoiler, but there is a story about it, and I do not want to spoil it; it is for you to find out.Kino’s Journey tells us a story of Kino, who is on a never-ending journey. Their journey started in 2000 and now there are 20 volumes that describe the beauty of Kino’s journeys. Kino, together with their motorcycle, travel to different places and countries that have their own customs and laws. As a general rule, Kino only stays in each place for 3 days. During these three days the story will show you the most beautiful places you have ever seen in your life, or perhaps even the cruelest country you have ever seen. There is always a philosophical dilemma that Kino has to solve and these dilemmas sometimes involve some serious decisions that might put Kino’s life on the line.It is worth mentioning that the series used to be very popular in 2000; it still has quite a remarkable fan base. Just like me, you might have seen the original in 2003, or even started reading the novel in 2000. In that case, you already know the whole beauty of this series. If not, Kino’s Journey is definitely a huge pearl for those who like slice of life. However, if you believe that this genre is too boring, but still want to watch the series, I would highly recommend you to watch only two episodes a day, otherwise you might find it boring. I also want to concentrate your attention on the fact that Kino’s Journey is not your usual slice of life; you will find philosophy, many life dilemmas, some really tragic scenes, and even some action scenes. Granted, if you are patient, this diamond will reward you with its reach story-line.Art and sound wise, the new remake has a new voice actor cast for both Kino and Hermes, and it is quite a challenge to say if they are better than the previous one. They did their work quite well. As for the opening and ending themes, as well as for the OST, I am sure that the original series did a better job with them. But I would not say that it might be a big problem for you. Art wise, on one hand, the original has a darker feeling to it with its animation, on the other, the remake has a superb new animation, which also does its job the way it should: character designs, background; they all are stunningly beautiful.As it has already been stated before, there are two protagonists in this series. Kino is the first main protagonist in the series. They travels to different countries with their talking motorcycle Hermes, which is the second main protagonist, discovering different cultures, customs and people. I am sure that it was one hell of a task for the new voice actors to voice their characters, but they managed to do it. The remake has not lost its best part--characters. The duo is able to keep you interested in what will happen next, providing you with the necessary character development.If you want to know my opinion, an opinion of a hardcore Kino’s fan, the remake deserves its name. I will not try to hide the fact that I am really disappointed that the old voice actors did not take part in the remake, but the new cast still did one hell of a job. Kino’s Journey (2017)  is still the anime that I watched long time ago.Overall rating: a very weak 10/10.All in all, Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World (2017) is a show that I would recommend to: a) all Kino’s fans, b) all fans of the SoL genre. However, if you are not a fan of the genre, as it has already been mentioned in my review, you should either watch this anime little by little, or you should just avoid it. Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World (2017) is, indeed, a worthy remake. I hope that you will enjoy your journey with Kino and Hermes! ""inviting and addictive,"" while AnimeOnDVD said it ""sucks you in,"" and ""allows you to experience the journey"" together with the main character of the series, Kino.

It addition to this, if you think that you can call yourself a fan, consider reading the novel, too.  By the way, I would also like to mention the fact that I am going to refer to the main protagonist of the series (Kino) as they. While their gender is not a major spoiler, but there is a story about it, and I do not want to spoil it; it is for you to find out.Kino’s Journey tells us a story of Kino, who is on a never-ending journey. Their journey started in 2000 and now there are 20 volumes that describe the beauty of Kino’s journeys. Kino, together with their motorcycle, travel to different places and countries that have their own customs and laws. As a general rule, Kino only stays in each place for 3 days. During these three days the story will show you the most beautiful places you have ever seen in your life, or perhaps even the cruelest country you have ever seen. There is always a philosophical dilemma that Kino has to solve and these dilemmas sometimes involve some serious decisions that might put Kino’s life on the line.It is worth mentioning that the series used to be very popular in 2000; it still has quite a remarkable fan base. Just like me, you might have seen the original in 2003, or even started reading the novel in 2000. In that case, you already know the whole beauty of this series. If not, Kino’s Journey is definitely a huge pearl for those who like slice of life. However, if you believe that this genre is too boring, but still want to watch the series, I would highly recommend you to watch only two episodes a day, otherwise you might find it boring. I also want to concentrate your attention on the fact that Kino’s Journey is not your usual slice of life; you will find philosophy, many life dilemmas, some really tragic scenes, and even some action scenes. Granted, if you are patient, this diamond will reward you with its reach story-line.Art and sound wise, the new remake has a new voice actor cast for both Kino and Hermes, and it is quite a challenge to say if they are better than the previous one. They did their work quite well. As for the opening and ending themes, as well as for the OST, I am sure that the original series did a better job with them. But I would not say that it might be a big problem for you. Art wise, on one hand, the original has a darker feeling to it with its animation, on the other, the remake has a superb new animation, which also does its job the way it should: character designs, background; they all are stunningly beautiful.As it has already been stated before, there are two protagonists in this series. Kino is the first main protagonist in the series. They travels to different countries with their talking motorcycle Hermes, which is the second main protagonist, discovering different cultures, customs and people. I am sure that it was one hell of a task for the new voice actors to voice their characters, but they managed to do it. The remake has not lost its best part--characters. The duo is able to keep you interested in what will happen next, providing you with the necessary character development.If you want to know my opinion, an opinion of a hardcore Kino’s fan, the remake deserves its name. I will not try to hide the fact that I am really disappointed that the old voice actors did not take part in the remake, but the new cast still did one hell of a job. Kino’s Journey (2017)  is still the anime that I watched long time ago.Overall rating: a very weak 10/10.All in all, Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World (2017) is a show that I would recommend to: a) all Kino’s fans, b) all fans of the SoL genre. However, if you are not a fan of the genre, as it has already been mentioned in my review, you should either watch this anime little by little, or you should just avoid it. Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World (2017) is, indeed, a worthy remake. I hope that you will enjoy your journey with Kino and Hermes!', '“You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox and now, you’re selling it...” -(I really hate that man)Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series, or, Kino’s Journey: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series as the gringos say (they don’t), is nothing short of one of the most disappointing experiences I’ve ever had to slog through, and I’ve graduated college. This contemporary adaptation of the light novels of the same name written by Keiichi Sigsawa...and illustrated by Kouhaku Kuroboshi also serves as a hard reboot/remake of the previous anime. If you couldn’t extrapolate already from my derisive tone, I admire the original adaptation immensely.Remake and reboot culture has been running rampant in Hollywood for a decade now and apparently, its vile stench has begun to reach across the pond. Usually, when it comes to remakes or reboots of any kind, the popular attitude when approaching them is one of “cautious optimism”. I’d like to say that my attitude when it came to the announcement of this streamlined version of Kino’s was along those lines despite controversies surrounding the production staff and studio. I generally take gossip like that with a grain of salt, especially with a framework like Kino’s which in theory should be royally difficult to botch. Vitriol aside, the primary objective of any adaptation should be to stand alone from its source material, whether it’s a panel for panel or word for word reimagining. Taking the light novels and original adaptation out of the equation does nothing to aid this clumsy and uneven series, one that will likely be buried worse than its hidden gem of a big sister.Time for the technicals. One of the biggest points of contention, when it came to this series, was its less than stellar production staff. I have time and time again been proven wrong by certain studios and animators but sadly I can’t vouch for this go at Kino’s Journey. If I could summate my thoughts on the art and animation into a single word, it would probably be “safe”. Nothing about the animation or art direction wowed me, nor do I really care all that much if it did (Kino’s 03 wasn’t exactly adored for its production qualities). The character models were polished, but entirely standard issue. On the topic of character models, Kino’s model was misguidedly off the mark. When Kino is made to look like a scrapped design off the cutting-room floor of a KyoAni drawing session, it entirely ruins one of the most vital aspects of her character (more on that later). There was nothing egregiously awful about the animation, aside from a few cut-corners with reused CG shots of Kino and Hermes. With the simplistic character models, I don’t imagine it was terribly difficult to animate and polish this series as much as they did.The soundtrack was entirely unassuming so I’m not going to bother expanding my thoughts on it. Most newer anime are more concerned with how polished the aesthetics are, the soundtrack is usually secondary or tertiary. The opening and ending were skippable and most episodes didn’t even have time to fit them in. Aoi Yuuki’s performance as Kino was serviceable at best and derivative at its absolute lowest. I enjoy Yuuki’s roles however it didn’t sound like she was attempting to differentiate this one from any of her other characters. I contend that Mariya Ise or even Miyuki Sawashiro would’ve been better fits for this role. For you dub purists out there, it’s safe to say that this dub is perfectly passable (no funny business with the scripts as far as I could tell...screw you Funimation), but it’s nowhere near as good as the OG’s very underrated dub.I’m not entirely informed on the process involved in cherry-picking the storylines to adapt from the light novels, however from my understanding, these storylines were voted on in some kind of popularity poll. If that’s true, then that just goes to show how much of a disconnect there is between producers and fans who have no idea how the “sausage is made.” The dozen or so storylines leave this adaptation feeling episodically inconsistent. Varying greatly in tone, scope, conflict, and characters, this adaptation feels as if it was only ever really interested in exploring the more shallow/surface level thematic elements in the individual countries.There is a lot of squandered potential in these episodes, to say the least. For example, there was one particular episode that presented a pretty interesting moral quandary with a country that was constantly moving but in the process would trample and ruin other countries...however, most of the meatier content and thematic undertones are glossed over and played for comedy, shallow action, and a predictable/boring conflict. Despite the original adaptation’s similar approach of varied storylines, it at least provided a consistent utopian throughline that made each episode weave perfectly to create a consistent product. Tonally, this anime feels like a Jackson Pollock with shades of other shows thrown on a canvas that once resembled Kino’s Journey. Except I’d probably have more fun staring down a Jackson Pollock for 4 hours as opposed to wasting another 4 or so hours watching this show. Kino’s is often considered slow and thinky, which on its own isn’t necessarily a valid criticism as much as it is a matter of taste. Kino’s (2017) wasn’t slow or thinky in its execution as much as it was dull and uninteresting which is one of the biggest crimes for a self-contained episodic series.To an extent, I agree with the sentiment that Kino serves as more of a neutral framing device to the actual star of the show, the titular journey itself. She is androgynous because her gender doesn’t matter (see my grievance with her character model), her age is vague, and her backstory is seldom explored because it has little importance to where she is now. However, there is one problem with this adaptation’s interpretation of Kino...SHE IS HARDLY THERE TO EVEN BE A FRAMING DEVICE. Sigsawa’s minimalist approach to Kino’s characterization is deliberate, she is our wish fulfillment and wanderlust incarnate, our eyes for this exploration into the deceptively darker side of humanity. Taking the character model out of the equation, they only really got HALF of her character right. Kino was not there to be the eyes for the audience, and when she was there she only half-assed her role. It’s like when Brando showed up to Apocalypse Now overweight and needing his lines fed. Kino aside, there are no compelling or noteworthy characters to speak of. Shizu, Tii, and Riku are hardly worth mentioning were it not worth noting that they are relegated to secondary protagonists in “Kino’s Journey”.When the best episodes of your reboot/remake are the ones that were practically shot for shot reskins of their original counterpart, there’s a problem. Kino’s Journey is a source material rife with content that would’ve made for excellent food for thought had it been in better hands. Some of that content was explored in this anime but ultimately handled with little care, making for a half-baked soulless product. Utterly devoid of any nuance or didactic philosophical charm that the original provided in spades, Kino’s (2017) was a sorry attempt at streamlining the source. The only subtlety to be found in Kino’s (2017) is its subtle crawl towards commercial territory. Sadly, some of the episodes are mostly above average in quality when compared to a typical gimmick ridden, thrown together, edge-biting seasonal. Despite that grading curve, I cannot award this show more than its individual merits will allow. I love Kino’s but this just wasn’t up to the expectations that were previously set. and illustrated by Kouhaku Kuroboshi also serves as a hard reboot/remake of the previous anime.

I love Kino’s but this just wasn’t up to the expectations that were previously set.', '(Disclaimer: The following review may contain spoilers. Please do not read until you have watched the whole series.)In December 2020, I made a decision to watch something a little different from the usual tastes I\'ve developed in anime over 2020, my anime breakout year. I was quite skeptical to dive into a more serious, deep, and thought-provoking series, which is the anime I am reviewing today: Kino\'s Journey.Though slow and not my type, this anime is a must-watch for anyone interested in animated stories that are more than just entertainment. It is a beautifully written piece that, as I experienced for myself, is hard to...digest at first, but the more you watch, the more you\'ll come to enjoy what\'s on your plate.Story: 9/10Kino\'s Journey is a series of 12 different stories, one for each episode. In each episode, Kino visits different countries as she travels around the vast wilderness with her motorcycle sidekick Hermes. Kino meets many people and stumbled upon a few comrades, namely Shizu, Riku, and Tifana.An old, textbook trick when it comes to slice-of-life anime, yet it really does go well with the context and aim of the story. While most other anime of the genre I\'ve seen thus far have done so, the approach dulls over time. Not this series, however. Every episode features a new and intriguing country, giving each individual tale its own uniqueness. And in each country, viewers and our protagonists alike can learn something new about being human and the diversity of identity, thoughts, and beliefs of the human race.For example: In episode 3, Kino stumbles upon a ""Travelling Country"" that is constantly moving itself around the world, which does cause an annoyance to other countries or cities as they are immobile from the path of this traveling nation. This nation accepts this fault of theirs and embraces an attitude that all living beings cause an annoyance to one another.Kino\'s Journey can be seen as helping its viewers open up to how everyone in our world is very different and have our own strengths and faults- Hence the series name, ""The Beautiful World"". Some people may be able to accept that, some may not, but there\'s nothing inherently wrong with the above attitude.What I mean can be illustrated in episode 6. Photo, a female slave in the episode, was bound to the control of an oppressive tribe in the alps. Despite the mistreatment, she doesn\'t show hatred against them and believes in a world where only people of virtue exist. This spells blasphemy to the tribe, but Photo isn\'t wrong at all for thinking this way. By doing so, she can see the world in a more positive and colorful light.The world-traveling helps Kino gain a grander view of what the world is like. A girl originally born in a country that saw no value in prolonged youth, Kino takes such experience to heart, fuelling her desire to explore and travel, without a start; without an end; without a definitive place to call home. Her travels have helped her understood more about different people, helped her gain a sense of independence and thrill from discovery, and helped her find a hobby that would truly bring happiness and meaning to her life.Today, in a world where people are confined to their own bubble and their homeland, where people refuse to broaden their horizons for various reasons, and in a world where traveling has become more of a luxury and way of personal entertainment, we seem to have lost what it means to go somewhere we previously don\'t know. These stories help us understand that.Art: 10/10Kino\'s Journey takes its viewers on an enchanting journey filled with stunning landscapes and country views. It doesn\'t slack off even on little details, like the petals in the wind from the flowerbed in episode 11, or the sudden stop every time Kino stops Hermes on the road. Swift animation of action scenes, such as the showdown in episode 1, or Kino\'s battle against the sheep army in episode 12, makes for a great change in mood or pace. Animators make good use of facial expressions, lighting, and even speed changes to bring out a suitable atmosphere for every scene.Sound: 8/10There\'s nothing particularly special about the anime with this category, but nothing dramatically bad either. All the SFXs were clear and suitable, music brings out a good touch if need be. Although, a larger variety of background music for each country would bring more to impress on the table, depending on the style and atmosphere of a place.Characters: 9/10Contrary to my usual reviews, this category is not my main focus when planning my verdict. Regardless, the series\' characters were written very nicely.Of course, Kino is an excellent character. She is mature, independent and composed in high-stress situations, and does not like to show her extreme emotions openly. She is someone filled with a desire to explore, but interestingly, she tries going into each country with a clean slate, maintaining a cautious attitude if suitable. I usually don\'t find enjoyment from characters with such traits, yet her curiosity during travel makes me find interest in her tales.Her bond with Hermes is also one thing that added a nice splash of humor and fun into the serious storyline, especially the last episode. As they started their adventures together, it was cool to see the trust and support they had for each other every time they visit someplace new.In episode 2, we are introduced to Shizu and his dog Riku. Shizu, coming from a sort of corrupted country, contrasts highly in terms of personality with Kino. Shizu likes to avoid conflict (Episode 8), and is comfortable with being ""A humble man"" (Episode 4). Adding him to the series is a nice way to show how different people deal with sudden situations during their travels.Riku is quite adorbs sometimes, especially when on a later episode, he bonds with someone Shizu met in his travels- Tifana. Said segment is quite short, but two things: One, it further solidified Riku as a surprisingly nice supporting character for Shizu and Tifana, and two, now that I mentioned it, he helped Tifana open up.Speaking of her, Tifana was originally shy and quiet, and is quite violent when she is forced to be. But later on she bonds with Riku, and yes, it is super cute. :3 I wish I saw more of her, since she\'s an interesting character.Finally, there were so many characters throughout the whole series that would take too long to discuss. In general, the producers did an impressive job at utilising a variety of characters to give us a great representation of each country.Enjoyment: 9/10Originally, I wasn\'t quite fond of this series. But as it went on, it gave me surprise after surprise, the writing getting better and better. This anime had me thinking about lots of things, like values, attitudes, etc, and I enjoyed the process a lot.Not only that, there were episodes I absolutely enjoyed, like episode 6 mentioned earlier. Episode 10, the Kind Country, also became one of the saddest anime episodes I have seen to date. The grief I had- The sign of true engagement and attachment to the storywriting. I applaud.Overall: 9.1/10Kino\'s Journey is a beautiful piece. It\'s the first anime I watched that\'s more on the serious end, but it\'s still filled with a lot of fun as well. I\'m glad I stuck around to see some stories I see myself remembering for quite some time. digest at first, but the more you watch, the more you\'ll come to enjoy what\'s on your plate.Story: 9/10Kino\'s Journey is a series of 12 different stories, one for each episode.

I\'m glad I stuck around to see some stories I see myself remembering for quite some time.', ""Just as a heads up, I haven't read the manga or watched the original, but I still enjoyed the remake overall. Kino's journey is a very beautiful and relaxing anime that is imaginative in how it creates its setting and characters. The main overall problem in Kino's Journey is that all the characters are either black or white. Either they have open minds like Kino and the main characters or are ideological zealots of their country. You rarely find characters that disagree with their country's viewpoint, or a country with a pluralistic ideology, so a lot of the countries felt unrealistic or exaggerated, like a...self-insert of the author's more cynical viewpoints on how many people follow the herd mentality. One advantage of having simplistic characters is that it allows for many unique scenarios that Kino encounters in each country he visits, so even if I wish there were more nuanced characters I still found the plot to be interesting. Overall I would recommend this if an episodic anime revolving around interesting journeys is appealing to you. self-insert of the author's more cynical viewpoints on how many people follow the herd mentality.

While I believe it is admirable to judge the 2017 adaptation with fresh eyes and a clean slate, I also believe there is merit in comparing the reboot to its predecessor. As a disclaimer, I have not read the LN.Perhaps the difference between the two adaptations is best determined through their focus. The 2003 Kino no Tabi places greater emphasis on the world and the journey through its writing, episode sequence, and themes. The 2017 Kino no Tabi tends...to stress its characters over its world, though the 2003 version arguably accomplished this better as well in certain episodes.I would recommend this year\'s adaptation if you are interested in watching a series that is not entirely sad, or entirely happy, but something that tries to display human hubris while keeping the spotlight on a cute, plot-armored girl. If you prefer something with more substance, greater focus on the world, equal prominence of the main character, and don\'t mind cruder presentation, then the 2003 original would be more gratifying.Generally regarded to be more thought-provoking or morally ambiguous, the original anime owes its reputation partly to its director, Nakamura Ryutaro, who oversaw Serial Experiments Lain. This is not to say it lacked levity or lightheartedness, but the show very much exemplified one of Kino\'s mantras--The world is not beautiful; and that, in a way, lends it a sort of beauty.The 2003 anime had moments of cruelty, of inevitability, of the human desire to change things for the better and of the tendency for those consequences to end poorly. It was also hopeful, touching, and a celebration of life. I want to make clear that the 2017 anime still retains most of these aspects. But the one thing that sets them apart is that Nakamura\'s version was far more subtle. There is little reading between the lines in the 2017 show, as characters do not hesitate to provide exposition or explain their motivations. It is hard to imagine the winter or library episodes existing in the current adaptation. Another major difference is the consideration given to Kino\'s backstory. The 2003 anime preferred to get it out of the way much earlier than the 2017 one, which pivoted our attention back to the world sooner. The newer adaptation keeps her origins hidden longer, as one might expect if the focus and suspense is on the main character.Visually, comparing the new and old series is like comparing day and night. The art of the 2017 version is fantastic. The lines are sharp, the colors pleasant. Kino\'s design more closely resembles her appearance on the LN covers. In contrast, the 2003 version was rough even for its time: the designs were cruder, simpler; Kino looked more aloof, easygoing, sarcastic, and shrewd at the same time; she also appeared more androgynous, lacking moe or particularly feminine qualities. There were times when this was a detriment, such as viewing palatability and reduction of stakes (it is far harder to lament the loss of a bland, ugly world than a colorful, detailed one). And yet the cruder artstyle of Nakamura\'s storyboards allowed greater appreciation of the nonvisual content of the show--the tracks, the story being told, the atmosphere. Sometimes what is less beautiful on the outside may surprise you on the inside.The music of the 2017 reboot lends credence to its slice-of-life description. Overall the tunes are more happy-go-lucky than the original, but this is not a bad thing. I find the OPs and EDs to fit their respective shows, though preference will depend on the viewer. The VAs were perfectly cast.For better or for worse, Kino is more expressive this time around. It\'s easy to say this is a demerit, that it draws attention away from the ""beautiful world,"" but it doesn\'t. It goes without saying that it is not necessarily wrong to give greater focus to Kino, for we accompany her journey through her eyes and her actions. Hermes remains mostly the same. The greatest departure the 2017 version makes, however, is the dedication of multiple episodes to characters other than Kino and Hermes. This decision allows viewers to see Kino\'s world from a different pair of eyes, and I found it a highly enjoyable break from the expected format. The biggest drawback is that these episodes take time away from Kino and her mostly non-meddling policy and the series would have been stronger for it if a second cour were planned.Kino\'s Journey (2017) could be considered iyashikei. It is more casual, relaxing, humorous, and pleasant to watch, with a hint of thoughtfulness thanks to the source material. Kino\'s Journey (2003) could be called iyashikei, for different reasons. It is easy to call the new one an inferior remake, but overall it is neither worse than nor a reimagining of its predecessor. Some of its episodes are remakes, yes, but they have improvements as well as detractions. Parallels between both versions may be gleaned in a couple more. The rest are simply new stories presented from an angle that is perhaps more agreeable to the modern demographic.Whether or not the newest Kino no Tabi is weaker than the original depends on what you expect or desire. But for most people looking for a pleasant show to spend half a day on, I think Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World - The Animated Series is worth their time. to stress its characters over its world, though the 2003 version arguably accomplished this better as well in certain episodes.I would recommend this year\'s adaptation if you are interested in watching a series that is not entirely sad, or entirely happy, but something that tries to display human hubris while keeping the spotlight on a cute, plot-armored girl.

This was better then I first thought it would be. This show is about a girl named Kino, who along with her talking motorcycle, named Hermes, travel their world. They travel to different countries and stay for only 3 days to learn about that country's culture and people. These countries are very very interesting and are basically the backbone of the show. No countries are similar and are quite varied in many ways. From what they look like, to the level of technology they are at. Although the countries...are the main part of the show, the characters are also interesting in their own right. Kino is a bad ass, smart, chaotic good sort of character with a mysterious past. Hermes is a jokey, reliable, intelligent companion to Kino who has been with her most of her life. This series is episodic, you do not need to watch any of the episodes in order. The art of this show is sharp and polished, very beautiful. There is only one problem I have with this show which is the animation quality throughout. It is all over the place, sometimes there are just amazing scenes where the animation is crisp cool and clear, then there are some moments where it seems like the frame rate dropped about 5 frames sometimes. This doesn't mean much to me, but this can cause some problems to someone who cares about that sort of thing. The music is good, its silent most of the show, although the music swells where it needs to. I adored this anime. I give this show a perfect 10 out of 10.

Without wishing to commit the misdemeanour of spoiling the story, Kino's journey may be summarised as simply as Kino and his motor bike Hermes, which can speak, travelling around different countries and visiting there for a maximum of three days.Kino is often very fair in assessing each country he visits, and whilst he does hold his personal preference towards one over the other, this may be at its subtlest and reflects...the cultural relativist's idea that no single culture is morally significant to the other. The strong contrast between characters native to their country narrates the discernible lack of objectivity, nor the common nature between them. For aspiring philosophers, like yourself, this is a highly recommendable series to indulge in; alas, apart from the visual portrayal of cultural relativism the series perhaps lacks in enthusiasm, or a dynamic coherence between each episode compared to other series such as Code Geass.Nevertheless, such criticism may not truly reflect the weaker side of this series, as one may be dubious in comparing Kino's journey to Code Geass, and the watchers aren't necessarily expecting a plot-twisting anime with cleverly fabricated foreshadowing, but a more contemplative time to enrich his day.I must admit I haven't watched this series for over a year, so maybe I'm not covering a pivotal aspect of it, which other reviews may have adressed. Hopefully, my point has been delivered across to the reader enough to encourage a quick peak of the first episode. My personal highlight was episode 10; for the more time-restrained watchers, perhaps starting with episode 10 isn't the worst point of entry, as most episodes don't necessarily follow or introduce each other anyways.Apology goes to the long read, for those tolerant enough for the full review. I understand the hypocrisy of opening the review claiming brevity and clarity, and end up writing the non sense I feared I was going to do so, but in hindsight nothing has been regretted. the cultural relativist's idea that no single culture is morally significant to the other.

That's why I adore Made in Abyss last season. Well, after hearing a lot of complaints from fans of the 2003 series, is this show still worth watching? I don't know if my opinion can help but imo this series is definitely worth my time.The best thing about Kino's Journey is the world. Of course for a series about our main character traveling from place to place, if the world isn't interesting, then this will be a stinky pile of garbage. However, Kino's Journey really did pack in a beautiful world for me to explore. I enjoyed myself learning about each countries Kino traveled to. Each of them are very unique and interesting. I'd say if you love world building in anime then be sure to check this out. No, YOU MUST CHECK THIS OUT.The 2nd part I like about Kino's Journey is it's art and animation. The scenery for each country was beautifully drawn and that's enough for me. If an anime about traveling can't draw the scenery correctly, the it fails hard. Fortunately, Kino's Journey packed in quite an eye-catching scenery for me to look at and to love. The animation, although there are an awful ton of CG usage in some episodes, but as I'd say before, I don't hate CG. The CG in this series is natural, I guess. It didn't bother me that much but I'd say the art itself covered up the shit CG. I can forgive the animation because of the beautifully drawn art.Also, I love the OP and ED theme for this series. It's sung by Yanagi Nagi, who if you haven't heard before, sang the OP for SNAFU and Just Because. I really love her voice. It's soothing and calming. The background music, also didn't stand out much, was still well-placed.Character-wise, I like Kino. But other characters I don't really care much about. Although they did show us the backstories of other travelers, but in the end I watched this series for the world building and it already satisfied me, so even if the characters didn't stand out much to me, I still won't hate this series.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed myself watching Kino's Journey 2017. It's a refreshing watch and for a person who likes world building like me, this series is perfect. Now, if you excuse me, I'll head over to the 2003 version. 8/10 That's it for my review.

Kino was a fantastic character to watch! She had real substance, which made her so relatable. I thoroughly enjoyed that NO romantic character was attached to her or on her mind! In this day and age, it\'s so difficult to find a complex storyline for a female lead that doesn\'t involve romance.Honestly, I didn\'t care for the other female characters because they were a part of ""the woman psyche is irrational"" trope, which I dislike very much....The motorrads were cool. I definitely want more information about them and about Kino\'s Master. So, I\'ll have to read the novels eventually. The motorrads were cool.

So, with that, there is a risk to take: there will be good episodes, great ones and others that is nothing more than ok stories.By the way, Kino no Tabi shows us a interesting view of world, government and society, with good characters and a stunning visual of the presented scenarios, representing the differente cultures of the world, its beautiful paisages and the pecualiarity of the human being.So, it's something that values the watching and a good anime that might pass out of view when we talk about this last season. "", ""I was late to the party on the original series - I didn't really get into anime until 2011, so going back and watching a 2003 anime in glorious 360p was a bit jarring. Despite that, Kino's Journey still left a sizeable impressionable, despite my bias against its visuals. It was, to use a tired phrase, thought-provoking, and it was told from the perspective of perhaps one of the greatest neutral characters I've ever encountered in fiction.As a reimagining of the 2003 series, how does 2017 Kino hold up? For sure it looks a lot prettier. They clearly put a lot of effort into the...3D on Hermes, but it's hard for me to say how much of the 'prettier' is just the fact that I can now watch in 720p. 2017 Kino is also much brighter and more colorful, where 2003 Kino was a darker, more subdued style. I could argue that both are completely appropriate, and I won't pick sides as to which is better.The quality of the storytelling remains mostly unchanged. If you've never seen 2003 Kino, you're in for a treat. Kino is a story-of-the-week deal where Kino visits various countries, each of which have some specific quirk about them (a country where murder is legal, a country where rules are created by outsiders who compete as gladiators, a country where virtue is quantified and earns you points). Over the course of 20 minutes, the country's quirk is dismantled, exploited, and taken to its logical extreme, and all of the various consequences and fallout are put out on the table.Kino, as a neutral observer and learner, tends to just let everything happen, and it leaves it to you, the viewing audience, to ponder. Would I really want to live in a place where murder is legal? Would I be okay with the benefits of living in a country that was always on the move, even if I knew the damage that movement caused? It's hardly practical philosophy without going to extreme lengths to relate it to anything realistic, but it's brain candy, and that's always a nice treat.If you haven't seen either, should you start with Kino 2003 or Kino 2017? 2003 has my favorite episode of the lot, and it does a better job of capturing Kino's darker side. 2017 is just a lot prettier to look at and has a little faster-paced and easier-to-understand stories.

If you're watching both regardless, start with 2003. Otherwise, pick whichever sounds better, you can't go wrong."", 'I cannot say that I was a fan of the original Kino no Tabi, though I thought it was – overall –  competently made. It sought to be thought-provoking and deeper than the typical anime, and it succeeded, even if not every episode knocked it out of the park. I ended up watching the new, 2017 Kino no Tabi on a whim, and I found it disappointing.The new Kino is not a sequel or – not quite – a remake of the original, but rather an adaptation of several of the original short stories, about three or four of which were also adapted by...the original anime. Each episode is a stand-alone story centering on various countries found throughout Kino’s world. Each of these countries typically has some unique custom or cultural value or attribute that sets it apart from the others, and much of Kino no Tabi is Kino’s journey through these various countries, where she learns about their customs and then moves on. Some of these countries evoke interesting questions ranging from personal morality (eg. a country in which people do good deeds to save up points that allow them to get away with certain immoral acts) to the effects of globalism (eg. a wealthy country contained in a constantly moving fortress that would be devastated if the fortress stopped for too long, but which, in its movements, can have a negative impact on other countries). The episodes focusing on these kinds of countries tend to be Kino no Tabi’s best – something true of both the old and the new Kino.However, these kinds of thought-provoking episodes are uncommon in this adaptation. This adaptation tends to focus less on the countries that Kino visits, and more on what she does whilst she’s visiting. And it feels like much of what Kino does is resolved by a gun – whether hers or someone else’s. Violence isn’t inherently bad – at least in fiction – and I don’t think violence can’t be thought-provoking, and Kino only ever acts in self-defense, but I do think that violence can be overused as a means of creating and resolving conflicts, and I do think that the use of violence in fiction often creates a shallow conflict. Which is all to say that in 2017, Kino goes “pow! pow!” way too much.Though, to be fair, at least some of the gunplay comes from a cast of supporting characters. Whereas Kino and her talking motorcycle, Hermes, were the only two recurring characters in the original, this adaptation features a few episodes where Kino and Hermes barely appear, if they appear at all. The most prominent of the supporting cast are a fellow traveler, Shizu, and his talking dog, Riku. In contrast to Kino, who generally takes a hands-off approach when visiting new countries (she’s a traveler, after all), Shizu tends to be more pro-active in righting apparent wrongs. Shizu features in three episodes, and is the primary viewpoint in two of them. For such a prominent character, I think that Shizu – and his approach to life – don’t really fit the tone of Kino no Tabi. If Kino no Tabi is about a traveler (or several) visiting different countries and learning about what differentiates them and makes them unique, Shizu is someone who is closed-minded and oafish, with little interest in learning about others. If Shizu were a one-off character whom Kino meets on her journeys, he would be an interesting foil, but I don’t think he works as a viewpoint character.Animation is perhaps one area in which the new Kino no Tabi can be said to excel. It looks not only like a modern anime, but a very fine one. Is it the best looking anime of 2017? I wouldn’t know. However, every episode was pleasant to look at. The visual effects enhance the look of the animation, and the CGI, whilst apparent, isn’t particularly distracting. Kino, likewise, looks better and far more suited to being a traveler than she did in the original. The soundtrack helped to accentuate whatever was happening on screen, without standing out too much. I am not the best judge of these things, but overall it looked and sounded good.The new Kino no Tabi is definitely more accessible than the old, but that comes at a cost, I think. It looks nice, has more than two recurring characters, and tends to be more action-oriented, but it rarely poses any challenging questions. I find myself thinking sometimes of some of the episodes from the original and the ideas they presented; I don’t think I’ll ever think about anything from the new Kino no Tabi again after I finish this review. Of course, this anime being more accessible isn’t bad, and I suspect that it’ll interest people in the original Kino, but some of the differences make it hard to go from the old Kino to the new.I would say that if you are a fan of the original (or, if like me, you respect what the original was going for even if you didn’t like it), you probably won’t get as much out of this adaptation. If, however, you have never seen an episode of the 2004 Kino no Tabi, I think you’ll find something of value in the 2017 Kino no Tabi. Perhaps you’ll even like it enough to watch the superior, previous adaptation. the original anime. Each episode is a stand-alone story centering on various countries found throughout Kino’s world.

During the adventure we will see that ""people are different"" someone good some one bad.It\'s really great philosophy right but the presentation will make this mnd blowing by making us observe and interpret the body language every character or think about some weird ending in every episode. After we see the problem from ""people are diffrent"" so how can we solve it ? Most of...Social criticism anime for now is trash like mahoushoujo site or medicre cause of lacking problem solving. But this series not. If we interpret character of kino we will see that she ""Don\'t give a fuck to much but don\'t runaway from your problem"" and ""Just care about somethig u love"" so thats how we can get beautiful world just like kino be.Art and Animation: Thanks to Leche hard work  the art and lighting really make it colorful but to not fuck your eyes painfully ike Great pretender . This really make u want to adventure with them.Even this show is not trilling to much but the animetion really smooth and lively.Compare to 2003: Most kino fans always talk that 2003 better but in my thought my kino should be deep and also lively in the same time so i appriciate 2017 one. Cause of directing of  tomohisa san kino really great show which is good at playing contranst between philosophy and lively atmosphere of adventure . Meanwhile 2003 one is just only dark and be delusional too much which is cliche. Social criticism anime for now is trash like mahoushoujo site or medicre cause of lacking problem solving.

You could compare this anime to binging tiktok but all the tiktok's turn out to to amazing pieces individually.Not only we get dopamine but we also get quite a unique way of viewing what makes a country 'normal'. For example, that one country where someone's moral actions is...a points system. On the surface such a system sounds very promising. Like no way anything could be wrong with that.

I'll try and avoid any spoilers here since this series is episodical so any spoiler would be an episode gone to waste. For the most part, I'll be comparing this series with the original one in terms of what has been improved and what has been demoted.StoryAs I said, most of this are completely new countries that Kino visits so even if you, like me, did watch the original series this one is still going to be enjoyable for you. The remade episodes, however,...aren't as good when compared to the original. Episode 2 is a remake of a three-episode arc in the original series so they've basically removed everything good in it and replaced it with Kino practicing shooting in the entire episode. The side-characters' development was erased, Kino's perspective of the country was left ambiguous and the relationships that Kino built with most the characters were mostly unmentioned. If you haven't watched the original this, probably, won't be a problem for you. Though, the rest of the remade episodes, three in total, were well-done and although weren't as good as the original, they didn't demote the original story as was with episode 2. In either case, the new episodes are completely new experiences and most of them were very interesting and beautiful so those you're probably going to enjoy regardless of whether you watched the original series or not.ArtAbsolutely beautiful. The older version was fairly old so the style gave a somewhat dark vibe to it, which I frankly enjoyed. Nonetheless, this one is, in my opinion, far more suitable to the story since it intends to show the beauty of various countries and the experience of traveling from one to another. One good example of that is the scenery which have become so vibrant. Another would be the characters whom Kino encounters; the new art style adds a lot especially to the remade episodes. Kino has also become fairly more expressive and cheerful as well which I like to think of as a result to visiting that many countries and the encounters with the other travelers.Character DevelopmentIn the original, the main character development we had was Kino's and Hermes' while everyone else felt like a supportive character. However, this time there are other travelers whom we see and they get their own fair share of character development as Kino does which acts as a good break to see other travel experiences. What makes it even better is their perspective of traveling is very different than Kino's. For Kino, traveling is for the sake of experiencing new things and exploring the world while for the other party, they travel mainly for the best country they get to settle in. Kino also avoids getting involved with any country no matter how absurd their way of living may be while the others apply their own beliefs and righteousness to wherever they go.EnjoymentIf you liked the original, then you're definitely going to enjoy this one as well. New countries, new people and absolutely stunning scenery. Most of what you liked in the older version is still here with even more.If you're new to the series and don't want to bother seeing the older version, this anime is mild when it comes to action, but it has its own share.

Choosing which version to watch is up to you, I believe that the Kino's Journey work itself represented in the two anime is beautiful and rewarding enough to be viewed in these two versions.The universe of Kino is particularly interesting, humanity lives in multiple cities and thus multiple different realities yet contained in one and the same world in the heart of which we travel from one episode...to another. We find ourselves transported into a world that contains thousands of others, we travel with it, to the heart of different mentalities, different lifestyles, different laws and problems of each city...It is particularly important to highlight how each story is particularly well written and whose imagination and creation are superb, this is part of the beauty of Kino's Journey.This anime is fascinating and deeply impactful. The rhythm is particularly well modulated, an episode represents like a trip, a city and every moment is worth watching.Everyone will find themselves attached to episodes implied in cities more than others because each city has its universe, its problems, its style, its inhabitants, its history which means that in my eyes everyone for to find oneself in this animated and will have its own attachments, one can project oneself and prefer certain cities to others. Our imagination can continue writing the anime, we can imagine thousands of other different cities, we can imagine a city just for us with its own rules...Our reality finds itself perfectly mixed with fantasy, dystopia, the universe is well done so that we accept its imagination without problems. Where the surprise appears is that violence mixes with poetry, in such beautiful landscapes the themes, issues and stories are not so sweet, they reveal somewhere the vices of the human..We are struck in many aspects, whether by the visual beauty of the graphics, whether by the extent of the Kino universe which we can grasp without difficulty [even with a talking motorcycle, I assure you] , by the multiple emotions that it provides.. It is an anime that can please everyone, we can satisfy the aspects that we wish to find there, it lets itself be looked at like a jewel..Kino brings an even greater charm to the anime, whether through her story that we experience as an additional wave of emotions, whether in her mysterious, endearing and valiant personality, she also brings a figure of an independent, strong and courageous woman who is inspiring…The fact that Kino is the only main character means that we immerse ourselves completely in her journey and that we can concentrate only on her while attaching ourselves to the characters of each city that she can meet and the bonds that she can meet. she develops with them. What is precisely surprising and pleasant is that we find that at the same time we get attached to secondary characters despite the rhythm.We let ourselves be carried away by the anime, you have to want to find a certain philosophy in it, each story brings beautiful lessons... We feel this impression of calm watching the anime, the loneliness of Kino who is not really alone but who takes us on a journey in a calm that inspires us to walk alone with oneself to recharge our batteries and find ourselves, a kind of inner journey, his character is not transcended by strong emotions, these are his thoughts and his values which transport us.. We feel that Kino evolves thanks to these trips but it is above all the spectator who evolves in her vision of her character, and from the lessons she brings as her journey progresses, we learn from her character, its values, its lessons, Kino's Journey is a refreshing, soothing, enriching animated film.- Chiyooko. to another.

Not that there is anything wrong with doing so, its just that I would like to read on what the anime was, not what it was supposed to be. I myself haven't seen or read any Kino's journey material so this review will be fresh and vanilla, based only on this anime and specifically made for those others like me.Story:If you haven't already read from the description (or the...title of the anime) the story of the anime revolves around the adventures of Kino, a young traveler who jumps from country to country learning all the different cultures and practices of each place.The flow of the story is erratic, meaning, for the most part, you could watch episode 10 without needing to watch the previous episodes. Although there are some episodes where you need to watch to understand the flow, this doesn't heavily affect your watching experience (trust me i accidentally watched episode ten after episode three and I still love this anime to pieces).The different philosophies of each country were interesting for the most part, showcasing the different sides of humanity. It was extremely entertaining to watch the protagonist handle the different situations that come along the way. Each episode offers a treat, weather it be a lighthearted comedy bit or a heart-wrenching story it always brought something new to the table.Art:The art of the anime was well done as the color pallet really helped show us the beauty in Kino's world. The vibrant colors puts you in a very peaceful trance and helping you set the mood of the adventure.Sound:Let me just get this out now: i LOVE the closing sound track. The music of the anime works so well in immersing you in Kino's world. If I were to name the feeling that the music brought out of me, the closest would be freedom. The music did such a good job in setting the mood of the anime from start to finish and it has certainly earned my praise.Character:Aside from Kino and Hermes not much character development happened throughout the anime as the focused more on the adventure aspect of it. The supporting characters weren't exactly fleshed out and you don't really know what makes them tick, showing the anime's focus on the main characters. Although underdeveloped, it doesn't really hurt your watching experience.If you watch Konosuba for its comedy, or Attack on Titan for its action, you would know Kino's journey for its adventure.

Each ""country"" they visit has it\'s own issues, own resolve, own people.  Some are bad and some good but the emphasis is on the pov of the people living in the country themselves.  As a traveler, Kino is smart and doesn\'t make judgements that override whatever the rules or governmental aspects, etc are and act without caution.  He might seem heartless in the fact that he, most of the...time, is calculating and only thinking of himself but most of all, he knows his goal is ""experiencing"" and not there for ""judging"".  That point is clear.  If you can\'t tell, I love this aspect of how the character was built.The story isn\'t half bad at all.  But, it doesn\'t really have a story, it\'s very episodic with the two leads Kino and Shizu traveling (for two different reasons).

That point is clear.  If you can\'t tell, I love this aspect of how the character was built.The story isn\'t half bad at all.  But, it doesn\'t really have a story, it\'s very episodic with the two leads Kino and Shizu traveling (for two different reasons).

much better than the old version (2003), let\'s go to the following points.Characters: The characters in this version are much more charismatic than the previous version, much better built, even visually, all the main and co-main characters (Kino, Hermes, Kino Original, Shizu, Sakura, Shishou, etc. .) are much more human, you can have a lot more empathy for them, in the old version it was as if they were all robots.Kino\'s appearance in this one is much superior to the previous version, in this Kino is much more feminine than the other version, and we were able to buy her...skills much more than in the last version, because her master was introduced and a piece of her past was told, kino is also much more expressive and seems to care more about the things around her, she is no longer just a script element like in the 2003 version and has become a really interesting character.Sounds: The opening, ending and all the soundtracks of the episodes were amazing and conveyed much more feelings than the previous version.Plot: Man without comparison the plot is much more natural in this version than in the previous version, all the episodes seem to fit together and complete each other much more than in the 2003 version where all the episodes were played and you didn\'t feel a kind of empathy for them , did not create a connectivity.People will only say that the 2003 version is better because it has a veneer of intellectuality, but in that version everything is so forced that it borders on the unreal even when it comes to metaphors and as entertainment, the old version is very bad, I will make a comparison using the my experience, to watch the 13 episodes of the old version I spent about 5 days because I kept scrolling to see the episodes, in this version I can say that I spent a maximum of 2 days actually not even that.In this version, things happen so subtly and not forced that you, in addition to understanding the moral of the episode, you have fun together, in this version you really understand the title ""The Beautiful World"" because it really passes that, in the old version you had to force it a lot of thought to come to the conclusion that it was beautiful.PT-BRSinceramente essa versão (2017) é muito melhor que a versão antiga (2003), vamos aos pontos a seguir.Personagens: Os personagens nessa versão são muito mais carismáticos que a versão anterior, muito mais bem construídos, até mesmo em questão visual, todos os personagens principais e co-principais(Kino,Hermes,Kino Original,Shizu,Sakura,Shishou,etc..) são bem mais humanos, você consegue ter muito mais empatia por eles, na versão antiga era como se todos fossem robôs.A aparecia de Kino nesse é muito superior a versão anterior,nesse Kino é bem mais feminina que a outra versão,e conseguimos comprar bem mais as habilidades dela que na versão passado, pois sua mestre foi introduzida e foi contado um pedaço de seu passado,kino também é bem mais expressiva e parece se importar mais com as coisas a sua volta,deixou de ser só um elemento de roteiro como na versão de 2003 e passou a ser de fato um personagem interessante.Sons: Cara a abertura, encerramento e todas as trilhas dos episódios estavam incríveis e passavam bem mais sentimentos que a versão anterior.Enredo: Cara sem comparação o enredo é bem mais natural nessa versão que na versão anterior, todos os episódios parecem se encaixar e se completar bem mais que na versão de 2003 onde todos os episódios eram jogados e você não sentia uma espécie de empatia por eles, não criava uma conectividade.As pessoas só vão dizer que a versão de 2003 é melhor pois passa um verniz de intelectualidade, mas naquela versão tudo é tão forçado que beira o irreal mesmo se tratando de metáforas e como entretenimento a versão antiga peca muito, vou fazer uma comparação usando a minha experiência, para assistir os 13 episódios da antiga versão eu gastei uns 5 dias pois eu ficava enrolando para ver os episódios, nessa versão eu posso dizer que eu gastei no máximo 2 dias na verdade nem isso.Nessa versão as coisas acontecem de forma tão sutil e não forçada que você além de compreender a moral do episodio você se diverte junto, nessa versão você realmente compreende o título “The Beautiful World” pois realmente passa isso, na versão antiga você tinha que forçar muito o pensamento para chegar a conclusão que aquilo era bonito. skills much more than in the last version, because her master was introduced and a piece of her past was told, kino is also much more expressive and seems to care more

and does not take into account the original product, as well as any other of its aspects (light novel, manga and other anime).""The world is not beautiful, therefore it is"". It is with this phrase, present in the anime synopsis, that we can correctly summarize the story of Kino, a young traveler, and Hermes, his motorrad (a kind of motorcycle).With a great dubbing job worth paying attention (starring Saito Souma, magnificent as Twelve in Zankyou on Terror, and Yuuki Aoi, striking in Gosick as Victorique), the story tells the adventures of...Kino by the countries in which she passes, staying at most three days in each, which, according to her, is the ideal to know the customs and traditions of a place. Here, it is worth emphasizing the immense creativity in developing completely different rules and scenarios for each country, which fuels the curiosity of the viewer without letting the anime fall into the same or become too dull. It\'s all always new and different (although the same script will always be followed on each visit).With a dazzling animation, full of colors and with abuse of the great general plan (which masterfully reinforces the open world feeling and freedom), unfortunately the series sins in one of the points that could raise it from very good to spectacular: soundtrack. Despite an Opening beautifully performed by Yanagi Nagi, the fantastic singer behind Nagi no Asukara Endings, Ano Natsu de Matteru and many others, it\'s a shame that Kino no Tabi\'s  soundtrack has just done ""homework ""(which is not to be expected from Satoki Iida, the sound director who was also responsible for the musical part of such great hits as Angel Beats and Tsuki ga Kirei).The chemistry between the principals works, and if it were not for the fact that Kino is a human, and Hermes a motorcycle, it would not be wrong at all to assume that they were blood brothers who have always been together since the beginning of their lives. But those who think that there are only two as recurring characters are deceiving themselves.As charismatic as they are, the anime still reserves a few episodes to introduce other travelers and develop (albeit shallowly) their stories, and of course show the key character that made Kino initiate such a lifestyle (the episode in which him appeared is by far one of the most distressing and cruel).However, I can not fail to mention the total exemption of time positioning. Without any rhythm of continuity between episodes, the show culminates in sporadic and punctual stories, almost a huddle of one-shots, not knowing when they occurred or how much time passed between them. Undoubtedly, this is due to the fact that this anime is only an adaptation of the favorite stories of readers of light novel in a contest of popularity, which makes it impossible to connect the facts of history. Anyway, it is absolutely possible to skip a few episodes (or almost all) and still be within the end of the series.A brave anime, full of endings of imaginative and unexpected episodes (the feeling of surprise is constant during the watch), a pinch of fantasy, dialogues, monologues and a miraculous break of the fourth wall in the last scene, in which Hermes assumes the paper of the viewer, and Kino, the representative of the series in general. Kino no Tabi is more than fit to marathon on a rainy weekend accompanied by treats.PORTUGUESE;*Esta crítica não apresenta spoilers e não leva em conta o produto original, bem como nenhuma outra de suas vertentes (light novel, mangás e outros animes).“O mundo não é bonito, portanto é”. É com essa frase, presente na sinopse do anime, que podemos resumir corretamente a história de Kino, uma jovem viajante, e Hermes, sua motorrad (uma espécie de moto).Com um excelente trabalho de dublagem que vale a pena prestar atenção (protagonizado por Saito Souma, magnífico como Twelve em Zankyou no Terror, e Yuuki Aoi, marcante em Gosick como Victorique), a história conta as aventuras de Kino pelos países em que passa, ficando no máximo três dias em cada, tempo que, de acordo com ela, é o ideal para se conhecer os costumes e tradições de um lugar. Aqui, vale ressaltar a imensa criatividade em desenvolver regras e cenários completamente distintos para cada país, o que atiça a curiosidade do telespectador sem deixar que o anime caia na mesmice ou se torne maçante demais. É tudo sempre novo e diferente (apesar do mesmo roteiro sempre ser seguido em cada visita).Com uma animação estonteante, cheia de cores e com abuso do grande plano geral (o que reforça com maestria a sensação de mundo aberto e liberdade), infelizmente a série peca em um dos pontos que poderiam elevá-la de muito boa para espetacular: a trilha sonora. Apesar de uma abertura maravilhosamente bem interpretada por Yanagi Nagi, a fantástica cantora por trás dos encerramentos de Nagi no Asukara, Ano Natsu de Matteru e muitos outros, é realmente uma pena que a soundtrack de Kino no Tabi tenha apenas feito o “dever de casa” (o que não é de se esperar de Satoki Iida, o diretor de som que também foi responsável pela parte musical de grandes sucessos como Angel Beats e Tsuki ga Kirei).A química entre os principais funciona, e se não fosse pelo fato de Kino ser um humano, e Hermes uma moto, não seria nada errado supor que eram irmãos de sangue que sempre estiveram juntos desde o início de suas vidas. Porém, enganam-se os que acham que há apenas os dois como personagens recorrentes.Tão carismáticos quanto eles, o anime ainda reserva alguns poucos episódios para apresentar outros viajantes e desenvolver (apesar de forma rasa) suas histórias, e, claro, mostrar o personagem-chave que fez com que Kino iniciasse tal estilo de vida (podendo ser citado que, o episódio em que esse apareceu, é de longe um dos mais angustiantes e cruéis).Contudo, não posso deixar de citar a total isenção de posicionamento de tempo. Sem haver qualquer ritmo de continuidade entre um episódio e o outro, o show culmina em histórias esporádicas e pontuais, quase que um amontoado de one-shots, sem sabermos quando ocorreram ou quanto tempo passou entre uma e outra. Sem dúvida, isso se deve ao fato de que esse anime seja apenas uma adaptação dos contos favoritos dos leitores da light novel em um concurso de popularidade, o que nos impossibilita de ligar os fatos da história. De toda forma, é absolutamente possível pular alguns episódios (ou quase todos) e, mesmo assim, ficar por dentro do final da série.Um anime corajoso, repleto de finais de episódios imaginativos e inesperados (o sentimento de surpresa é constante durante o assistir), uma pitada de fantasia, diálogos, monólogos e uma mirabolante quebra da quarta parede na última cena, em que Hermes assume o papel do telespectador, e Kino, o de representante da série num geral.

The story is rich and efficiently narrated, and it goes without saying that one has to watch the entire series several times to perceive all the details. In this respect, this anime holds a really particular place in my list because I think that it is more than an anime:  it is a philosophical work.   Indeed, I think that Kino no Tabi is also an invitation for us to travel virtually and think about our world and our role in society from the point of view of an outsider who has no history with it, just like...Kino.That being said, I have to admit that developing the characters' backgrounds a little further would have been appreciable.All in all, if one seeks a peaceful and deep anime, Kino no Tabi is a good choice.

If you\'re thinking about watching both, watch this one first, otherwise you\'ll be disappointed.The excessive CGI was very distracting. The artwork lacks the character of the original, the characters look very generic. It\'s also a lot more colorful, which made it look ""cartoonish"" to me.The episodes themselves leaned toward ""cute"" rather than the more dark and philosophic stories of the original. Some of them are just short vignettes, and in many of them Kino doesn\'t even appear. As a whole, it feels rather dumbed-down, fluffy entertainment instead of engaging and...though-provoking.I don\'t think watching it was a waste of time, but it will probably sit on the shelf for a long time before I watch it again. though-provoking.I don\'t think watching it was a waste of time, but it will probably sit on the shelf for a long time before I watch it again.', 'I made the mistake of watching this remaster, before watching the 2003 versionof this show...but even so, it was still a great adventure.Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World!

Great music and very pretty visuals too! Must watch!', 'Standalone:Kino\'s Journey (2017) is an interesting examination of cultural practices, political ideology, and personal philosophy. It mainly uses our protagonist Kino as a lens through which the origins and/or results of those things are observed, at times also acting to correct what she sees as unbearable injustice, or failing systems. By framing cultures and practices loosely similar to our own civilizations, Kino\'s Journey attempts to make us introspectively examine our own lives and the systems around us. However while similar they are not the same. The systems examined are basically taken to the extreme ends of an ideology, and taken all the way to their...then logical conclusions. The extreme of the extreme. Paired with vibrant beautiful art Kino\'s Journey paints us the picture of a beautifully varied, and flawed, world.The show runs on an episodic structure, having little overarching story and no real chronological importance to the series of events.It is definitely an intriguing series, but if you\'re into more action packed anime this one is definitely a slow burner. I definitely recommend a watch if you\'re looking for something a little different. I also recommend you pick up the 2003 adaptation, even if you ultimately decide not to watch this one.In comparison: (SPOILER ALERT)While I would not say that the 2017 adaptation is bad, I can definitely say it is inferior in it\'s story telling to the 2003 version. This has much to do with the fact that the new adaptation surveyed fans to decide which stories from the light novels to cover, resulting in a noticeable shift in the tone of the story. Because of the stories chosen Kino appears to be more of an activist going around solving problems than the pacifist observer which the light novels intended her to be, only taking action when she is personally put at risk or the situation becomes overwhelmingly unbearable for her to watch.In addition the directing and voice acting, while not objectively bad, also has played a role in changing the story. For example if we look at the episode covering Kino\'s origin, the speech and movements of the adults after Kino is killed, while the script and even shot composition is mostly the same, when comparing the 2003 adaptation to 2017 the situation seems very different. In the 2003 adaptation it is very clear by each speaker\'s tone of voice and their gestures that it was legitimately an unexpected result and that their attempts to rationalize after the fact was defensive and is actually because they are all lobotomized. On the other hand the 2017 adaptation\'s characters seemed almost spitefully sarcastic in their vocalization, giving off the suggestion that the act was perhaps intentional.

I liked how the episodes are mostly separate, with somewhat different tones. I didn't find it *jarring* at all, just a natural part of the anime, and the variety keeps it interesting. The focus in each episode is less on Kino, and more on the story/drama of each of the weird countries she visits. I really liked Kino's unique neutral perspective; unlike basically every other protagonist ever, she isn't really trying to achieve anything in particular or change the world. With all that in mind, I think that the slow rate of...character development for Kino was appropriate, and I would've been totally satisfied without any backstory for her whatsoever in these 12 episodes. In fact, I felt at times that it was being *forced* into certain anime plot tropes in a way which detracted from it.I mostly liked the art style, though in a few movement-heavy scenes they seemed to switch to a different (more computer-generated?) animation style which I found jarring. Audio was largely unremarkable.I hope they make many more episodes. character development for Kino was appropriate, and I would've been totally satisfied without any backstory for her whatsoever in these 12 episodes.

I watched the 2003 anime several years ago (in fact it was one of the first anime I ever watched) and I adored it right from the start. So I had my fingers crossed that this series would make me fall in love with Kino all over again - and it definitely did!Story: 9All of the stories presented in this new series follow the same basic line that those in the original series did. They are quick, easy to follow, and often leave you think about human nature...and just what is up with us all.

Serene and profound. Philosophical but not hard to understand. Almost every episode is a complete stand alone story, and really nicely wrapped up. Each story makes you go ‘aah, that is brilliant.’ There’s a peaceful setting and mood, a muted colour palette and quite a slow pace. Music works out perfectly for the anime.I found the anime to be unique (I mean, I know it’s a remake and all, but I’m saying the actual story of Kino no Tabi itself is unique. I’m sure...I’d give the original at least as high a score as this). Gives you an appreciation of the world and life, and a different perspective on events.The paradigm shift I experienced after seeing episode 5 was definitely the deciding point for me - I knew I was invested in the series after that. The twists are always wonderful to watch and never fail to add depth to the story, there’s never a story that only has one layer to it or ends up being superficial. The anime’s entertaining but more like life lessons than a fun escape from reality. And after watching it, I will say I too agree that ‘the world is not beautiful, therefore it is.’ Truly a masterpiece.I didn’t, however, give it a 10 for two reasons: A) there were a few episodes (for example ep 4) where even though the story was good, the pace was just too slow and the episode ended up boring me as a result. B) I felt the ending was lacking – I just didn’t get the same feeling from it (both full and empty at the same time) that I did the rest of the story.These aren’t really major faults, though, and I’d most definitely recommend Kino no Tabi for anyone and everyone. Even if you don’t think it’s your type of anime, give it a go. It might help change your perspective a bit. 😊 XD I’d give the original at least as high a score as this).

To understand what makes this such a failure of an adaptation, you have to understand what worked about the original Kino’s Journey.First, the original had a true visionary behind it—that of Ryuutarou Nakamura. For those unaware, this is the same guy who directed Serial Experiments Lain; it’s clear Nakamura has a penchant for highbrow philosophical experimentalism in his work....Compared to Lain, Kino is approachable and down-to-Earth, but in a way that still leaves you with food for thought. By the end of the OG show’s run, we still didn’t really know much about Kino, Hermes, or any of the other characters we were introduced to—and that’s fine, because for what that show was trying to be, it didn’t matter. Kino’s Journey wasn’t a show about the characters, the characters were just a vessel for the viewers to see the world and be fed ideas to think about.Those ideas took the format of an episodic morality play. Each episode, Kino would travel to a new “country” which had its own laws or customs which would challenge the viewer’s perception of right and wrong. The stories were often told in the same way as fables, where the logic of those “countries” doesn’t make a whole ton of sense when you really stop and think about it—but that’s the thing: like with a good fable, you’re not supposed to think about details of how a society would practically function with such ridiculous rules. The scenarios aren’t supposed to be taken absolutely literally. Each country functions as more of a thought experiment into concepts like the futility of menial work and the danger of self-fulfilling prophecies.This is the first way the remake falls flat. It largely eschews the heady themes and format of the original show and instead focuses on world-building and character development… and it sucks. For instance, we spend an entire episode developing the backstory of a character named Photo who it seems like they intend on becoming a recurring character, but we see them exactly one time and that’s it. And it’s a god-awful episode. We also spend a lot more time with Shizu, but it’s mostly to develop this new character Tii who is a completely uninteresting silent-loli. And the episode she’s introduced in is a god-awful episode. They try to build Kino’s characterization up by making her a badass action hero which feels both out of character and dumb. And the last episode of the show where they try to really lock that image of her in is a god-awful episode.Not only is the new material bad, but they managed to fumble the parts of the original show they remade as well. They condensed Colosseum down from a two-parter to a single episode and lost a lot of its nuance in the process. And then they aired the episode Kind Country before A Country of Adults. Viewers of the original show will know that A Country of Adults sets up the events of Kind Country in a way that satisfyingly pays off. The remake airs them in reverse order for absolutely no reason and it totally ruins the foreshadowing and callbacks of that pair of episodes.I’m honestly baffled as to how this happened. I get that Nakamura wasn’t involved, so the style of the show understandably sucks. But it’s still the same source material, so how could the quality of the writing fall off so hard? I’ve never read the light novel these shows are based off of, so I can only assume Nakamura adapted the chapters that fit his vision—which were the good chapters—and left only scraps for the remake to pick up. Whatever the cause was, the end result is that the original was interesting and thought-provoking, whereas the remake loses all the intrigue of the original by wasting time developing characters and a world in a way that raises none of those same interesting questions about what it means to be human.The second thing that makes this remake miserable is the art style. I won’t harp on this too much since the original wasn’t exactly a feast for the eyes either—Kino’s Journey is about the ideas not the visuals. And yet, watching CGI sheep bounce off a CGI car driven by CGI Kino in the final episode just made me absolutely howl laughing, which is not a great note to end your show on.I’m almost at 800 words for this review, but the TL;DR is this: skip this show and watch the original. Everything they remade from the original is worse here, and nothing new is worth your time.Thank you for reading.

What's happening in the episodes is in a completely different order than in the manga and some of the core parts that made the manga so good have been taken away. Scenes like when Kino for instance kills a person for the first time, instead it's replaced by a weird episode with a bunch of sheep.Towards the end, it just felt like there...was no purpose in the series, and the charm that the manga has just wasn't here at all. The characters aren't too different from the originals which is a good thing but the plot just isn't there and it just doesn't work for me.It wasn't horrible, it just didn't entertain me towards the end and things just stopped making sense to me.

I would first like to say there must be a another adaptation or manga that you have to read/watch to understand this. Either that my personal view of the show will stand. First of all I would like to say I found the show to be almost incoherent.You have all this time skipping back and forth with not notice. The only way you can tell is if you had been paying attention to trivial details (Woodsman in ep 2 I think, being acquired in Ep6 iirc). We add to...this blender of entertainment little to no backstory about our dull, and lifeless MC, and almost no world building other then the countries that are visited. Though I don\'t recall their ever being a discussion about why every country has walls 60+ meters high.Lastly what was the message the writer was trying to convey? I cant be sure, other then maybe when people get together they do stupid things?  In each ""country(I use the term lightly as 20ppl does not a country make)"" We find everyone in complete agreement with each other regardless of how malignant the countries belief. I understand the ""countries"" are small but its difficult to suspend my disbelief.That said the artwork was sublime, though i felt the soundtrack to be uninspired and not the least memorable. I feel a lot of people really hyped this show up, and so I am confused as to how it achieved such greatness. Everyone has different preferences(unless your in a country in this show) so maybe this show just wasn\'t for me. I will revisit it in a year or two. this blender of entertainment little to no backstory about our dull, and lifeless MC, and almost no world building other then the countries that are visited.

It's been 11 years and I was excited to see such an amazing philosophical series get some recent love and attention!!! To give you an idea, I gave the original series and a lot of other Kino no Tabi titles a 9/10.Now, on with the review.Animation:1) overall, I really like the visuals. There's a lot of CGI usage but most of the times it blends nicely with the rest of the animation. I love how they made the world and characters more colorful.2) However,...there are a few instances where it's noticeable that they kept recicling the animation. I understand it saves time and money but when it's noticeable it looks terrible.3) Throughout the episodes, Kino's hair and eye colour change randomly from green to blue or purple without any reason whatsoever.Sound:1) Although this is a remake, every single character got a new seiyuu. I will never agree to this practice unless it's inevitable due to death, illness or retirement. Most of the cast are experienced and amazing talented people but nothing beats the nostalgia of having Aigase Ryuji as Hermes and Maeda Ai as Kino. It just feels that their performances over the years as those iconic characters didn't get the recognition they deserved.3) Soundtrack is pleasant but not memorable.Story:1) I was addicted to this series on the first two episodes. From that moment forward, the excitement just died down with a couple of exception on the 6th and 11th episode.2) the events are predictable but not in a bad way3) the 7th episode starts off as a flashback until it cuts to the present day. To have Kino narrate the rest of the flashback instead of continuing the flashback sequence made no sense: it broke the momentum and pacing of that entire episode.Although the visuals are are a major improvement compared to the 2003's version, for me this remake is a 6/10. I'd highly recommend to watch the original Kino no Tabi instead of this more recent release. there are a few instances where it's noticeable that they kept recicling the animation.

It is a kind of completely different version. Well almost. Only 3 stories are shared between the two, out of which one is Kino's background story.Well, as expected the art work is great. Everything is just eye pleasing to look at. Unlike the 2003 series, it doesn't have the dark tinge to the colours at most times. This brings a more cheerful and modern feel to the show.The storyline is great too. No complaint here. Though I feel there are fewer...elements in retold stories (from 2003 one).

I felt that some countries could be skipped while detailing other ones a bit more. But that's that.Even though there are some killing scenes are shown but still this show is less darker than the counterpart. 2003 one was way darker in aspect than this show, making this version more children friendly. Overall the series was fun to watch.I would recommend one to watch the OVA of previous series along with this show.

I decided to watch this purely on the aesthetics, and in that regard wasn't disappointed.As soon as I realized it was going to be episodical series with no plot, I needed to accept that and it was a pleasant ride. The show at least tries to ask deep philosophical questions about life and explore the ontology's of being a human. It's not trying to give answers, but rather start a conversation between the themes.Animation is super pretty and the occasional 3D elements didn't ruin it for me....If they bother you, grow up.Voice acting was on point. I prefer the subtle use of voice rather than the over the top yelling.But I still have to give it only a 7, since there's no plot and it feels hastily patched up together.

It was nice to see a down to earth non dramatic and logical character. I wish we got to know more about where Ti and that one dude ended up... that's the main think I dislike about it.I felt like this anime was very wholesome with a...lot of out of pocket dark episodes and vibes so it was really shocking sometimes.

Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/145/Kareshi_Kanojo_no_Jijou,"['Kare Kano was a romance anime that could have become incredibly great, if it had the proper budget and ideas from the producer to actually complete the show properly. Unfortunately the stale ending that Kare Kano ended on left myself and I’m sure many other fans in frustration. Based on the popular shoujo manga by Masami Tsuda, Kare Kano is about the blossoming love between two high school students who lived a life of lies, pretending to be the perfect person for their own reasons. Being able to truthfully open up to each other, their initial friendship turns to love. Sadly, life isn’t so easy...for them as they face many trials to be together.At first glance, Kare Kano is your average high school romance story. Thankfully, the odd personalities of the two leading characters break the idea of this just being another romance story. Kare Kano does contain the usual shoujo romance story elements when it comes to the trials for our main couple (jealous outsiders, temporary separation). But originality is able to come through with the way the leading characters handle their problems, often ending in a comedic resolve to their troubles. Besides the usual love trials, Kare Kano also features a number of interesting side stories about the support characters, so if you’re not a fan of the main couple, fear not, there are other amusing couples in the series as well. Unfortunately, Kare Kano’s story takes a nosedive with the lack of an ending. The last few episodes continue to build the plot up, but the series simply ends before anything can come out of the previous events. This is one of the greatest annoyances when it comes to Kare Kano, especially if one is not a manga reader.The animation is more or less quite poor in Kare Kano. Taking into account this show is from 1998, anyone can easily see the budget was definitely not allocated to producing good animation. The first half of the show had its moments, the animation in this part of the series were acceptable. One of the techniques that the producers used was to cut out still images directly from the manga, which can be both a good and bad thing. Obviously this saves the producer a lot on cost of actual animation and some may think it is quite cheap of them. But I would think majority of people feel the black and white manga images added to the atmosphere of the show, especially in the moments they were used (which were when things became more serious). The second half of Kare Kano was when the animation began to lose its charm. More still images were constantly being used. Episode 19 of Kare Kano had the entire episode made up of cardboard cut outs, which were stuck on sticks and moved around (like a puppet show). The last five episodes were horrendous, a lot more of the manga pictures were being used, but rather then adding to the atmosphere, it just made the entire show feel cheap. The final episode barely had any animation at all, simply still images.The sound in Kare Kano is one of its stronger points. The opening and ending have catchy pop songs that some may or may not like depending on their taste in music. There are also a number of enjoyable piano tunes in Kare Kano. All in all, the background music fitted well to the mood in this anime. A good pat on the back for the Japanese voice actors of Kare Kano as well. The VA for Yukino (the leading female) did a wonderful job in bringing out Yukino’s two faced personality, as did the VA for Arima (the leading male). If anything, the only complaint I have for the Japanese VAs was the one for the supporting character Tsubasa. I only felt her voice did not feel right.Perhaps Kare Kano’s strongest point would be the characters. The leading couple is two somewhat eccentric two faced people (particularly the female) who pretty much break out of the stereotypical shoujo couple. The leading female, Yukino is an absolute riot to watch. You will witness her stressing over the smallest of things, unbelievable for someone who at first glance seemed to be the most perfect person you could find anywhere. Supporting characters such as Asaba and Tsubasa are also equally enjoying to watch as their odd personalities fit in perfectly with Kare Kano’s quirkiness. Character development is very thorough in Kare Kano, with even Yukino’s parents having screen time to develop their back stories. The only negative feature when it comes to the characters is that even towards the end of the show the characters are constantly built up with development, only to have the show end before anything could happen.For why I enjoyed Kare Kano, I was previously a fan of the manga already. My favourite character would definitely have to be Yukino for her weirdo personality and decisions to solve her problems. I also really like the ending song, which I thought was perfect. Albeit I was definitely frustrated with how the show ended. The terrible animation was just painful for me to watch (especially the last 6 or so episodes). And I thought it was a poor decision on the producer’s part to end the show like it would end every other episode, and slap on a “The End”. I mean, nothing ended at all.Overall, despite its obvious flaws Kare Kano still manages to be a favourite amongst the shoujo lovers for its interesting array of characters and somewhat unique storyline for the main couple. If you aren’t normally fond of stereotypical high school love stories, try giving Kare Kano a try. It’s recommended though to continue with the manga after watching the anime if you want to see how the story ends, since you won’t find any ending from here. So yeah, If you like comedy, romance, weird characters and high school settings then Kare Kano will probably be for you. for them as they face many trials to be together.At first glance, Kare Kano is your average high school romance story. Thankfully, the odd personalities of the two leading characters break the idea of this just being another romance story. Kare Kano does contain the usual shoujo romance story elements when it comes to the trials for our main couple (jealous outsiders, temporary separation). But originality is able to come through with the way the leading characters handle their problems, often ending in a comedic resolve to their troubles. Besides the usual love trials, Kare Kano also features a number of interesting side stories about the support characters, so if you’re not a fan of the main couple, fear not, there are other amusing couples in the series as well. Unfortunately, Kare Kano’s story takes a nosedive with the lack of an ending. The last few episodes continue to build the plot up, but the series simply ends before anything can come out of the previous events. This is one of the greatest annoyances when it comes to Kare Kano, especially if one is not a manga reader.The animation is more or less quite poor in Kare Kano. Taking into account this show is from 1998, anyone can easily see the budget was definitely not allocated to producing good animation. The first half of the show had its moments, the animation in this part of the series were acceptable. One of the techniques that the producers used was to cut out still images directly from the manga, which can be both a good and bad thing. Obviously this saves the producer a lot on cost of actual animation and some may think it is quite cheap of them. But I would think majority of people feel the black and white manga images added to the atmosphere of the show, especially in the moments they were used (which were when things became more serious). The second half of Kare Kano was when the animation began to lose its charm. More still images were constantly being used. Episode 19 of Kare Kano had the entire episode made up of cardboard cut outs, which were stuck on sticks and moved around (like a puppet show). The last five episodes were horrendous, a lot more of the manga pictures were being used, but rather then adding to the atmosphere, it just made the entire show feel cheap. The final episode barely had any animation at all, simply still images.The sound in Kare Kano is one of its stronger points. The opening and ending have catchy pop songs that some may or may not like depending on their taste in music. There are also a number of enjoyable piano tunes in Kare Kano. All in all, the background music fitted well to the mood in this anime. A good pat on the back for the Japanese voice actors of Kare Kano as well. The VA for Yukino (the leading female) did a wonderful job in bringing out Yukino’s two faced personality, as did the VA for Arima (the leading male). If anything, the only complaint I have for the Japanese VAs was the one for the supporting character Tsubasa. I only felt her voice did not feel right.Perhaps Kare Kano’s strongest point would be the characters. The leading couple is two somewhat eccentric two faced people (particularly the female) who pretty much break out of the stereotypical shoujo couple. The leading female, Yukino is an absolute riot to watch. You will witness her stressing over the smallest of things, unbelievable for someone who at first glance seemed to be the most perfect person you could find anywhere. Supporting characters such as Asaba and Tsubasa are also equally enjoying to watch as their odd personalities fit in perfectly with Kare Kano’s quirkiness. Character development is very thorough in Kare Kano, with even Yukino’s parents having screen time to develop their back stories. The only negative feature when it comes to the characters is that even towards the end of the show the characters are constantly built up with development, only to have the show end before anything could happen.For why I enjoyed Kare Kano, I was previously a fan of the manga already. My favourite character would definitely have to be Yukino for her weirdo personality and decisions to solve her problems. I also really like the ending song, which I thought was perfect. Albeit I was definitely frustrated with how the show ended. The terrible animation was just painful for me to watch (especially the last 6 or so episodes). And I thought it was a poor decision on the producer’s part to end the show like it would end every other episode, and slap on a “The End”. I mean, nothing ended at all.Overall, despite its obvious flaws Kare Kano still manages to be a favourite amongst the shoujo lovers for its interesting array of characters and somewhat unique storyline for the main couple. If you aren’t normally fond of stereotypical high school love stories, try giving Kare Kano a try. It’s recommended though to continue with the manga after watching the anime if you want to see how the story ends, since you won’t find any ending from here. So yeah, If you like comedy, romance, weird characters and high school settings then Kare Kano will probably be for you.', ""His and Her Circumstance, Kareshi Kanojo no Jijyou, Kare Kano, whatever you want to call it, there is one important thing you should know about this romantic comedy: not once at all does the male lead accidentally faceplant into the female lead's breasts, nor does he accidentally see her naked when her towel slips off, nor does his hand by chance find its way onto her butt.Instead, they have sex.And this is what sets Kare Kano apart from all the other romance anime that have come out in the last decade or two. Those anime are not romantic comedies, they are comedies with sexual tension....The romance in Kare Kano is real romance. Yukino and Souichiro's relationship is treated realistically, seriously. They meet, they fall in love, things progress. It has a remarkable authenticity, especially in the early episodes.The comedy element works, too. Yukino Miyazawa, who obsesses over being the perfect student, gets snapped back into reality by a rival perfect student, Souichiro Arima. But while she is left dejected, he ends up smitten. The comedy is character-based, feeding off the hesitation and awkwardness from the two teens as they muddle their way into a romance. Yukino's family also provides good comic material, especially in the parents, who had their daughters a little too early in life. Other character types are explored: the sassy athletic girl, the jealous girl, the cute guy who's hard to figure out, etc. But these side characters don't get in the way of Yukino and Souchiro's story.The series is based on Masami Tsuda's manga, and its weakness is its format. Even with the legendary Hideaki Anno of Neon Genesis: Evangelion fame at the helm, the series suffers from a lack of budget and abundance of static images. Scenes that read quickly on Tsuda's pages get stretched as filler on screen. The most annoying thing about it are the episode recaps, which on a couple of occasions approach the three minute mark. That's three minutes that the writers unfortunately couldn't fill. The budget only gets worse as the series progresses, and when we get to the final episode it's almost unbelievable that they go as far as they do. No colors, no animation, just line drawings. No full cast either, just two narrators.The series ends not even halfway through the full 21-volume run of the manga. What the series does cover it covers quite accurately, so the story itself is as strong as the pages of the book, but Kare Kano, for all the quality they could squeeze out of it, remains rough and unfinished. The anime is enjoyable, but I highly recommend reading the manga. The romance in Kare Kano is real romance. Yukino and Souichiro's relationship is treated realistically, seriously.

Not to say that it lacks any other aspect besides romance but, it's the kind of show where you become intertwined with the heart more than the funny side-comments or the playful animation. The story is simply about two people in high school who meet, share common-ground, and fall head over heels for each other. Perfect for you hopeless romantics, eh?Character(s) & Their DevelopmentThis one is certainly major for this show. The emotional interaction is at such a high level that at times, I...was amazed at how lifelike it was. I felt I could meet each and every character if I walked around my own school long enough. It's not that their all completely realistic or even that they have no uniqueness but, the fact is that these people make you believe they exist is some space.Yukino was certainly a character I had to keep a keen eye on. At first, I couldn't find the strength to actually like her but, by the second episode I found herself thinking the same thoughts I had just that very day. She has an extremely worrisome type of behavior when it comes to her relationship to Soichiro. It's not that she is meek but, it's that she has no idea how any of this is suppose to work because of the way she's lived her life. She was always so cheerful to her classmates, but she was distant. So far away, in fact, that no one could tell until this secret was disclosed when Yukino was not guarding herself.She finds the relationship to Soichiro difficult at times, and yet that's only because of her own thinking. She thinks and thinks, doubting how well she can read him and be close to him. How much can she give, she really, truly wonders. A lot of the show is her ideals on her love towards Soichiro. I related to her, and at times was dumbfounded how much her very thoughts seemed like they were straight from my own mind.Soichiro, on the other hand, doesn't get as much time to shed his concept on himself or Yukino as much as his counterpart; however, you don't need to hear his development to really know that he is changing. He becomes much more lively and socially active even though he still holds his own secrets & demons from the person he holds dear. In a way, it's a bit sad that Soichiro never comes to terms with his emotions in the anime, as he is cut off from overcoming his shadows since the show was never finished.AnimationI've never understood completely why but, the majority absolutely despise the art in Kare Kano. As I said, I can't comprehend it since the studio had such a tight budget and because of that, I think they deserve some slack. The anime was also made in 1998, and there was a huge decline in money during that time in Japan (or something or another). Honestly, I don't judge too hard when it comes to this aspect. Story and characters are much more important to me, and they certainly come up strong while the animation is a tad weak.Despite all that, the style has a plain cuteness while being soft. I've never had an anime where it was realistic but the style made me think: charming.MusicThe sound had to grow on me before I drowned into the youthful, playful melodies this anime has to offer. While some of it was increasingly fitting, the ending theme always had me bored. While I adored the lyrics, I could never get into the beat, but that was probably just me. The opening was certainly a gem though. I find myself singing to it even if I don't want to, it just had a perfect tune that couldn't deny the anime's own attraction in itself.Dubbing/SubbingOh, I adored the dubbing in Kare Kano. The actor for Soichiro is dead-on, no question. Soichiro is more of an emotionless, hold-it-all-in type of guy and the inexperience of his actor actually aides in defining the character. Yukino had the hyper, somewhat angry, yet politeness you would expect from a role model with a weird personality. I was surprised to find the actress is really the voice of Ash Ketchem from Pokemon though.OverallIn general, Kare Kano has a slice of the anime pie all to it's own. It's graceful in it's deliverance yet funny within it's own boundaries. The blandness witnessed is some episodes is picked up by the pure innocence of each character's quirks. This is the type of anime that is more than just a simple-minded cartoon, it actually lives and breathes like a human being that can grow and morph. It's charming and realistic in thought and action. There's little Kare Kano misses when explaining a relationship, and it doesn't miss at all the heartbeats, doubts, fears, and sadness faced with a first love. However, this show is not depressing despite situations where characters suffer; it remains optimistic.This a show that's certain to give you that warm feeling, not for the cuteness (because, in all honesty, there isn't too much of that), but for watching the way these characters live out their lives, hardships, and accomplishments.

People either think it\'s brilliant and one of the best romance anime ever created, or complete garbage. When you have a MAL rating below 7.70, you KNOW you done fucked up. That means the average MAL user thinks this show is worse than Future Diary or Elfen Lied. Despite this, His and Her Circumstances has a small but dedicated fandom who hold it up as an all time masterpiece. So who is right in this dispute? Are the casuals simply too naïve to notice its brilliance? Are...the elitists being pretentious assholes again and placing garbage on a pedestal? The answer is complicated. His and Her is both brilliant and highly flawed. In order to enjoy it, you have to look past its many issues.Pros:Miyazawa and Arima are one of the most interesting couples in anime. Both suffer from psychological issues and create a fake persona to use in public. As the series progresses, both must learn to discard their masks and be truthful with themselves and each other. Miyazawa has a bad inferiority complex. She is jealous that she isn\'t naturally a genius or athletic, so she spends all her effort trying to trick others into thinking she is. She has a low self esteem and has a pathological need for constant praise. Without it, she would fall into a helpless depression. Arima was born to abusive parents who were a disgrace to his wealthy, extended family. He is so terrified that he will become like his parents or that people will associate him with his parents, that he creates an angelic persona. Even though many of his extended family hate him anyways, he must act perfectly or he fears he will lose the love of his aunt and uncle who raised him. We create masks to deceive others into thinking we\'re better than we actually are. However, no good can ever come of lying to yourself.“Above all, don\'t lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him, and so loses all respect for himself and for others. And having no respect he ceases to love.” - The Brothers KaramazovBesides the excellent main couple, His and Her breaks free of several constraints that anime places on itself. Both main characters actually have family that you meet! I want you to think about how rare that is. I\'ve seen over 950 anime and less than 10 of them have 2 main characters that each have a father, mother, and siblings that we meet. Anime characters always are orphans or only have a mother or their parents are overseas. Despite the great emphasis that Japan places on family, anime is paradoxically terrified of portraying families!You know what other taboo this show breaks? The 2 main characters ACTUALLY HAVE SEX in a shoujo anime! If you\'re new to anime, you probably can\'t appreciate how rare this is. Space Brothers lasts 99 episodes and the main couple never have sex or get physical in any way. Nodame Cantabile is the same way. What about Spice and Wolf, which always makes the top 5 for best couple in anime? Nope! No sex, no kissing, nothing. You sit through 26 episodes of economics lectures to watch the main couple get together and...you get a Wonka ending. ""You get NOTHING! You LOSE! Good Day Sir!"" The only anime I can think of where the main couple have sex are Berserk (good example) and Future Diary (bad example). As a shoujo, His and Her stands almost alone in very rarely explored waters.Finally, you get all the psychology and character drama of Eva without suffering through the most laughably obscurantist plot in the history of anime. A plot filled to the brim with half baked ideas and homages to ancient mecha like Ideon. The central conflict of the entire series is that the Angels are attacking humans. After 26 episodes you never learn why. After Death/Rebirth and End of Eva, you STILL don\'t know why. If you want to learn basic, essential plot details without consulting the internet, you have to watch the reboot movies, buy the 15 video games and the Japanese Daizenshuu. Can you imagine any other work of art that\'s held in any esteem getting away with that shit? ""Yeah Bro! I just finished Werckmeister Harmonies. Now I need to beat the video game in order to make sense of it! I got through the circus level, but the whale boss keeps kicking my ass!""Cons:The character art is shit. I can\'t tell which characters are adults and which are children. Miyazawa\'s parents don\'t look any older than her younger siblings.Due to massive budget issues, the first 5 minutes of every episode are a recap using previous animation. That way, they only have to animate 17 minutes of new footage each episode. Even that wasn\'t enough, so we get popsicle stick characters and animation that\'s so bare bones it\'s a joke. Also episode 13 is entirely recap. What the FUCK was wrong with Gainax and meeting their budgets? I think they must have blown all their cash on cocaine and hookers.The secondary characters aren\'t really that great. They don\'t get enough time to really develop, but do get just enough time to steal from the main characters in a way that hurts the show.The original mangaka allegedly HATED this adaptation and apparently thought it was pretentious. There was even a rumor that she drove down to Gainax, screamed at Anno, and pulled the plug on a second season. Anno went into a deep depression and walked off the series after episode 18. The rest of the anime after that point is garbage. Even the most diehard fans of this show don\'t watch episodes 19-26. It\'s like the Post-Kyoto Arc part of the Rurouni Kenshin anime. It\'s so bad it doesn\'t exist in the minds of the fans.Overall:His and Her Circumstances isn\'t a series for everyone. However, if you have patience and can get over its shortcomings, you will witness one of the most unique and moving romances in anime! Hell, it just might be the greatest anime that Hideaki Anno has ever made (that isn\'t Re: Cutie Honey). I can\'t get my offline friends to watch this one, and half my online friends dislike it.

At first she was very conceited and wanted others to respect (""worship"" could be a better word) her. Then she met Arima, the perfect schoolboy in all respects. Her first instict was to defeat this arch-enemy of hers. However, people say that Hate is what`s closest to Love, and as you may have guessed, hatred soon turned to love between these two. Here`s Kare Kano`s story in a nutshell.Animation:Gainax did 2K (Kare Kano). They also did Furi Kuri (FLCL) which has a reputation for...being ""weird"". Even in 2K you see that same weirdness. In many episodes, the dialogues are written instead of spoken. And often, there is no motion picture, just a set of slide shows to show a scene. You will also notice that there is a lot of scene-display. Like showing buildings, roads, traffic lights and stuff. Another point to note is that the characters` emotions are very much exaggerated, just like in FLCL. Big teeth, hyper-wide grins and the like. Finally, the animation will often reach an extreme climax with shouts, lots of fast actions and just after, die down to a low hum. This can often disorient the viewer. However, the animation is fluid and there are no major flaws.Sound:Like in my other reviews, I don`t pay much attention to sound. The OP and ED have nothing special. However, there are some in-movie music tracks that are worth listening. Nothing bad. Nothing great.Story:Here comes the interesting part! As you know, 2K is a love story involving the 2 main characters Yukino and Arima. So, expect these 2 to get lots and lots of screen time. The story of 2K evolves around those 2, depicting their problems, how they strengthen their love-bond and how the characters around them react. There is also some emphasis on friendship and helping friends in need. The series will also illustrate people and the problems they face in their lives, particularly in their emotions. The first 20 or so episodes are nicely laid out.However, there are 2 things I hate: The flashbacks/recaps and the ending. Every 2-3 episodes, you will get some kind of recap. It becomes very very annoying in the end, with a full 1.5-2 episodes of recap. That really annoyed me. Why do we need recaps that often. We are not amnesia patients! It seems that these recaps are there to fill holes in the series, where the people who made 2K had no idea what to do/write/draw. So they just stuffed a recap and it`s a go.Next, the ending is really poor. Seems that the budget got drained completely at the end of the series. The drawings just suk! Trust me, you don`t want to watch those again. There is almost no sense in the last 2-3 episodes. The main characters completely vanish, leaving only 2 secondary characters and their budding love story. Even then, we are not told clearly what`s happening. You have to witness that horror of last episode to know what I`m talking about. It`s very incoherent and difficult to understand. Basically, that ending totally ruined the whole series. And mind you, we are not told, even in the end, as to what happens to Arima and Yukino, or the other characters. What becomes of the 2 brightest students of the school? Get married supposedly.. We don`t know, we just hope..P.s. Another annoying thing: The number of times you will hear the name ""Arima"" in the series is overwhelming!Character:I can say that the characters are well developed and well introduced. At least for the main characters. We are given elaborate details about their lives, their likes and dislikes, and the detail particulars about them. Each of them has their own particular personalities and distinct feelings. This is nice to see.The problem here is that sometimes, characters disappear randomly and without reason. Eg. Tsubasa`s ""brother"" completely disappears and for no apparent reason! I thought he was going to come into play later in the series when he was introduced, but alas.. he disappeared into nothingness! :S Likewise, the 2 main characters completely vanish from the scene in the last few episodes!But the way the characters are introduced and maintained through 2K covers for this flaw and earns an 8 from me.Value and Enjoyment:Not much to say here. It`s just a nice romance story for people who like the genre. However, do not expect very much from the series. And if you can bear with some dark points, like vanishing characters and difficult-to-understand stories, then you might give this series a try. Personally I enjoyed it for the first 20 or so episodes. But after that, I nearly dropped it. But I didn`t just because I wanted to know how it would end, but I was deceived there.Not much rewatch value, except if you really like the genre and got nothing else to watch. That`s all from me! :P being ""weird"". Even in 2K you see that same weirdness. In many episodes, the dialogues are written instead of spoken. And often, there is no motion picture, just a set of slide shows to show a scene. You will also notice that there is a lot of scene-display. Like showing buildings, roads, traffic lights and stuff. Another point to note is that the characters` emotions are very much exaggerated, just like in FLCL. Big teeth, hyper-wide grins and the like. Finally, the animation will often reach an extreme climax with shouts, lots of fast actions and just after, die down to a low hum. This can often disorient the viewer. However, the animation is fluid and there are no major flaws.Sound:Like in my other reviews, I don`t pay much attention to sound. The OP and ED have nothing special. However, there are some in-movie music tracks that are worth listening. Nothing bad. Nothing great.Story:Here comes the interesting part! As you know, 2K is a love story involving the 2 main characters Yukino and Arima. So, expect these 2 to get lots and lots of screen time. The story of 2K evolves around those 2, depicting their problems, how they strengthen their love-bond and how the characters around them react. There is also some emphasis on friendship and helping friends in need. The series will also illustrate people and the problems they face in their lives, particularly in their emotions. The first 20 or so episodes are nicely laid out.However, there are 2 things I hate: The flashbacks/recaps and the ending. Every 2-3 episodes, you will get some kind of recap. It becomes very very annoying in the end, with a full 1.5-2 episodes of recap. That really annoyed me. Why do we need recaps that often. We are not amnesia patients! It seems that these recaps are there to fill holes in the series, where the people who made 2K had no idea what to do/write/draw. So they just stuffed a recap and it`s a go.Next, the ending is really poor. Seems that the budget got drained completely at the end of the series. The drawings just suk! Trust me, you don`t want to watch those again. There is almost no sense in the last 2-3 episodes. The main characters completely vanish, leaving only 2 secondary characters and their budding love story. Even then, we are not told clearly what`s happening. You have to witness that horror of last episode to know what I`m talking about. It`s very incoherent and difficult to understand. Basically, that ending totally ruined the whole series. And mind you, we are not told, even in the end, as to what happens to Arima and Yukino, or the other characters. What becomes of the 2 brightest students of the school? Get married supposedly.. We don`t know, we just hope..P.s. Another annoying thing: The number of times you will hear the name ""Arima"" in the series is overwhelming!Character:I can say that the characters are well developed and well introduced. At least for the main characters. We are given elaborate details about their lives, their likes and dislikes, and the detail particulars about them. Each of them has their own particular personalities and distinct feelings. This is nice to see.The problem here is that sometimes, characters disappear randomly and without reason. Eg. Tsubasa`s ""brother"" completely disappears and for no apparent reason!

That`s all from me! :P', ""You're not going to get what you expect.At first the series is very similar to your standard Shoujo anime. The main character is a cannonball of humor and humanity - not a dainty wussy female heroine. She's someone a real female can relate to.Visually, as the anime progresses, it delves deeper into an avant-garde style of presentation. It becomes less of an animated series and more an experiment in visual storytelling. I actually appreciated this aspect of the series and looked forward to seeing how the story would be told in each episode. From the popsicle stick figures, cityscapes, flashing images, sketch book drawings, etc....everything was very different and very interesting to watch.The story itself is great - it branches off gracefully from the stories of our two main characters as they progress in high school and develop into adulthood.The behind the scenes problems led to a number of useless recap fillers and a hanging final episode. I presume there was the intention of continuing beyond 26 episodes because the final episode does nothing to wrap up any loose ends. (Typical, right? The bright side is that the manga continues well beyond this final episode and any individual who desperately wants to know how all these fantastic and complex characters will end up is able to read on to a very satisfactory and complete ending.)Understanding that this is incomplete, experimental, and yet totally emotionally captivating this series is recommended. everything was very different and very interesting to watch.The story itself is great - it branches off gracefully from the stories of our two main characters as they progress in high school and develop into adulthood.The behind the scenes problems led to a number of useless recap fillers and a hanging final episode.

So bad, that at times it shows manga panels accompanied by words. And still, I can easily say that Kare Kano is one of the best anime I've watched.Unlike most shoujo anime, it has the kind of depth you can only find at Kimi ni Todoke or Sukitte Ii na yo, and the kind of realism in the story you can find in almost none. Kare Kano will not expand much on the characters' depth, however for the few that it does, it does so effectively and interesting at the point where...it becomes the main reason for liking it.We all know that Japanese humor is not actually funny,  nonetheless I laughed quiet frequently throughout its duration.In general terms, it is a most cheerful, funny and alluring anime, except for the sadness one might feel when it starts narrating real life problems, such as psychological ones...sense of inferiority, defense mechanisms, concealment of reality...Note that the story does not finish in the anime, therefore you will have to read the last chapters from the manga. It truly isn't a bother though, you will want to know the conclusion so much you will do it more than willingly.To sum up, albeit its drawbacks Kare Kano is not a boring anime-I finished 26 episodes in five days-so, every person watching shoujo anime should try watching it. it becomes the main reason for liking it.We all know that Japanese humor is not actually funny,  nonetheless I laughed quiet frequently throughout its duration.In general terms, it is a most cheerful, funny and alluring anime, except for the sadness one might feel when it starts narrating real life problems, such as psychological ones...sense of inferiority, defense mechanisms, concealment of reality...Note that the story does not finish in the anime, therefore you will have to read the last chapters from the manga.

Those of us who do not possess these seemingly super-human traits can be left gazing up at them in awe, wondering why we ourselves cannot be more like them. But whatever outward appearances may suggest, ultimately these people function the same way we do, and the only difference between us and them (social class and genetics notwithstanding) is a question of motivation. Rather than ask ourselves we do not experience the same results,...we should really question what drives us to behave the way we do, or more to the point, what drives a person to be so unashamedly approvable?This is the question posed by Hideaki Anno’s Kareshi Kanojou no Jijou, AKA Kare Kano. It’s a romantic comedy which tells the story of high-achiever and self-styled ‘Queen of Vanity’ Yukino Miyazawa, a high school debutante who has just had her hopes of a perfect high school entranced dashed by the equally successful Souichiro Arima. Right from the get go Yukino makes her motivations clear- wanting nothing more than to be adored by others publically and acknowledged as ‘the best’. This does not work out so well when she is beaten in the entrance exams by Arima, who then becomes the class representative and takes the admiration and attention which Yukino so desperately craves. She vows to get better grades than him in the first round of exams, steal his place at the top and then rub it in his over polished face.So begins the storyline of the greatest romance anime of all time, perhaps the greatest shoujo and maybe even the best sitcom too. The competition on these fronts is admittedly weak, but Kare Kano still comes on strong and, despite possessing a few obvious flaws, remains a stellar overall: If you want solid characters, it has them; if you want something different from the usual fare, this is a shoujo in name only; if you want something artistically interesting, then Kare Kano engages in visual experimentation that would make Studio 4 degrees C blush.  In fact, if you think that Neon Genesis Evangelion is the best anime that Hideaki Anno has produced, you are about to discover how wrong you were and be amazed by how wrong everyone has been these last fifteen years.These may seem like bold claims, but do not mistake them for embellishment or exaggeration. Let us begin by considering the typical Shoujo Romance: we start with a shy and timid, profoundly girlish high school girl as our lead. We introduce her to a teenage boy who is interested in boyish things like sports and is popular in school; his masculinity offset by his caring nature and his almost feminine good looks. He is crafted in such a way as to be desirable in every since, without being intimidating. One speculates that, if a relationship in a shoujo anime were to progress as far as intercourse (which it never does) our pretty heroines would be shocked to discover that their beloved saviour would not have any genitals whatsoever.This criticism may seem harsh, but let’s not pretend it isn’t fare. It is actually a source of fascination that productions aimed at girls could be, almost without exception, so misogynistic.Kare Kano is different though. As the series opens, Yukino’s character has not only been getting by without a knight in shining armour, but has been kicking ass in her own right. Her motivations are questionable of course and ultimately driven by her own weaknesses, but her outward appearance is one of strength and confidence. As her relationship with Arima develops, her character changes and abandons her old outlook on life, deciding that she and him together will live life honestly and openly. Even here though the decisions are mutual and it never feels as if the mere presence of a man is prodding the plot forward.This mature approach to writing a female lead in a romance story is something which could easily be adopted by other anime series, and yet they continue to produce the same formulaic characters time and time again. But this alone is not what makes Yukino a great character; it is the level of depth and progression of her character while remaining true to her established personality. Attempting to completely change your behaviour and world view are not straightforward tasks in real life, and in fiction this is even more apparent. The realisation that she needs to change comes very early in the series but it is not until it nears its conclusion that this is fully realised. Every so often, when one starts to forget about her character’s desire to change, we are prompted with a reminder that it is an ongoing process. It feels very natural.Speaking of an ongoing process, as mentioned above it is common that shoujo romance stories experience limited progression and can even seem like one misunderstanding after another. These strings of awkward situations are intended to be dramatic, but this is usually not the case if you are unable to suspend your disbelief; a difficult task if you have ever been stuck watching romantic comedies with your mother. Thankfully, Kare Kano abandons this will-they/won’t-they nonsense and progresses quickly; perhaps even a little too quickly. The pacing is similar to that of a real relationship (i.e. it doesn’t take six months for the characters to have their first kiss) and actually manages to discuss the subject of love maturely and convincingly. One particularly memorable example is when Yukino, having learned about something unsavoury from Arima’s past, says: “I love this man, this man who hurts himself for the sake of others”. It was already clear that this was not a mere puppy romance, but this line marks the point where the story unfolding is no longer some teenage fantasy, but an honest and genuine love story.As for Arima’s character, while he does possess many of the qualities of the stereotypical shoujo male love interest (athletic, popular, girlish appearance, kind attitude) his clean cut appearance and modest abilities belie a character with a troubled past and a deep feeling of inadequacy despite his successes. While he shares Miyazawa’s drive and goals, his motivations and circumstances could not be more different and he turns out to be a rather dark horse. The son of abusive parents, Arima was adopted by his auntie and uncle and feels that he must succeed both to satisfy them and to prove that he will not follow in his parents footsteps. It is a considerably less happy back-story than Yukino’s, yet at the same time it feels just a little too... obvious. What drove Miyazawa to behave the way she does is a complex question which does not have any real explanation beyond a love of praise and special treatment, while it is very easy to pin down exactly what makes Arima the way he is. The second may seem like clearer and better storytelling, but if you consider your own personality, has it been formed rigidly by a single experience from childhood?Arima’s character is a bit weak in contrast to Yukino, but at the same time Yukino is among the best written anime character of all time, and Arima is still an almighty cut above even the best of his contemporaries. The pair are a perfect match, and for the purposes of storytelling, allowing the audience to clearly see two different paths that could lead to highly driven individuals, both showing that such people still possess weaknesses and experiences troubles that others face, and most importantly of all, that such people are still human.Kareshi Kanojou no Jijou, better known as Kare Kano, is a series directed by Hideaki Anno and produced by Studio Gainax. But there are no giant robots to be found, nor are there any whiny teenage boys. In fact, this series is a romantic comedy, and the characters are exceptional: intelligent, successful and popular. They are the kind of people that everyone else wants to be.Mary-Sue! I hear you shout, but you would be wrong. Because while on the surface the cast of Kare Kano appear to be too good to be true, what motivates them and gives them the drive to succeed in this regard is that most pitiful of weaknesses; desire for the approval of others.Unfortunately, as the series reaches its close it begins –ill advisedly- to introduce other characters, some interesting and some not, but none of which can hold a candle to the lead roles. Their introduction is made necessary as a part of Yukino’s recovery process, but alas they are but meagre archetypes concocted to fill space. Each one has their own background but they are quite predictable and feel like a distraction from the main storyline. Still, it feels that the time could have been better spent on Yukino and Arima, or even on Yukino’s family members, who as supporting cast members go are superb, providing alternative points of view neatly and punching above their weight on the comedy front. Fortunately, there is one episode towards the end of the series, a filler episode if you wish to call it that, which places the spotlight on Yuki’s youngest sister Kano. This is actually one of the highlights of the second half of the series, although its placement is bizarre to say the least. Unfortunately though it is not anywhere near as bizarre as where the series actually finishes.There are several stories attached to the production of Kare Kano which you may or may not be aware of: the first is that the Mangaka was dissatisfied with Hideaki Anno’s portrayal of the series, and that he abandoned the production in response. Another story is that towards the end of the series, the money supply was running out, and so production values went out the window. The first of these stories is known to be true, and Anno’s directorial influence is absent from several episodes of the series. Unfortunately, the man who took his place – Kazuya Tsurumaki, who later directed FLCL, was unable to continue Anno’s vision and so things just peter out.The rumour about the money supply may or may not be true, but I consider it unlikely for two reasons- first of all, the windfall of cash in Gainax’s coffers following  Neon Genesis Evangelion’s success, and the highly experimental tendencies of the studio in both earlier episodes of Kare Kano itself, and in other Gainax productions.  In fact, it could be argued that there is more visual experimentation in Kare Kano, than in productions like FLCL, Panty and Stocking, or anything by Akiyuki Shinbou.The series manages to frequently experiment with visuals, without them becoming jarring or intruding too much on the storyline. Every episode seems to include a new and interesting way of communicating with the viewer: from Kano and Tsukino using a manga to illustrate Yukino’s complex over Arima to using puppets to review the story in a re-cap episode. These are among the more obvious sequences; some are more subtle, such as a first person view sequence in which Yukino’s sisters run up a staircase. Frequent angle changes are not easy to draw accurately, yet here it is pulled off flawlessly. It also has the effect of emphasising the characters rushing from place to place. It’s so original and so effective, it’s wonderful.Other motifs worthy of note include the use of establishing shots to provide visual cues and symbolise the emotions of the characters. Kare Kano makes the use of pictures of industrial scenery, water pipes, and traffic lights as interludes between romantic sequences. Initially this seems like an odd choice for a romance series, but as the series progresses this becomes clear. The series also makes heavy use of printed text, reminiscent of the work of French director Jean Luc Goddard. While visually appealing, translating these shots and putting them in subtitles is a challenge and if you are unable to read Japanese then you will just have to accept being unable to read everything. Fortunately, this doesn’t really inhibit you from enjoying or understanding the series and usually the text simply paraphrases what is said in the dialogue.On the subject of dialogue, the script is exceptionally well written. It manages to avoid sounding overly lovey-dovey or naive, a miracle for a high school romance. The voice acting in the original Japanese version is excellent on all accounts, although you may find one character -Tsubasa Shibahime- irritating if you are not fond of nasally voices. Nonetheless, the acting is of a high standard and appropriate for each character.  The English dub, in contrast, is a point of contention. Some consider it to be of a high standard- in terms of acting, this is without question. All of them are capable and each line is delivered perfectly. However, as I see it there is one major problem which rather spoils the effort: Arima’s voice.  Arima is a teenage boy, yet his voice is deep enough to make Barry White sound like a tenor. The acting is fine, but hearing such a masculine voice coming from someone in the middle of their teenage years is a bit too much. Ultimately though, the choice is yours to make. But what good is dialogue without music to back it up?Fortunately Kare Kano is well endowed here too. The opening and ending themes are both catchy pop tunes that you’ll be singing along to every episode. Then there is the background music- incredibly varied and highly versatile: it ranges from happy bossa nova influenced light jazz to capture the relaxation and familiarity of both school and home, to standoffish, heavy riff based rock to accompany conflict. This is to say nothing of the touching piano melody which acts as the refrain.Kareshi Kanojou no Jijou is not only a masterpiece, but a neglected masterpiece. It’s not perfect; in fact it is flawed in many respects, largely the product of its rocky upbringing. But from beginning to end, it is an outpouring of creative ingenuity which no other production comes close to. Neon Genesis Evangelion may have been the title that enjoyed mainstream popularity and the place in the history books, but Kare Kano is the work with higher ambitions and more radical ideas. Evangelion changed super robot shows forever; but Kare Kano influenced animation as a whole.Evangelion is what got everyone’s attention; but Kare Kano is the production that changed the world. we should really question what drives us to behave the way we do, or more to the point, what drives a person to be so unashamedly approvable?This is the question posed by Hideaki Anno’s Kareshi Kanojou no Jijou, AKA Kare Kano.

Evangelion changed super robot shows forever; but Kare Kano influenced animation as a whole.Evangelion is what got everyone’s attention; but Kare Kano is the production that changed the world.', ""Smart anime?! Smart anime in the shoujo category?? It does exist!Story:It's rather straight forward in my opinion in spite of the various entanglements the characters encounter but essentially...the story is about a girl and a boy who fall in love, the subsequent emotional development, their interactions with the people around them, the lives of their friends and their romances as well, and of course it's about growing up and finding out who you are as an individual.Art:It didn't impress me much but the comedic expressions are funny as hell...it's attractive enough and develops a lot in the manga.Sound:I have the...soundtrack. Very motivating.Character:Are total win. Characters are the most important aspect of any series to me. They have to be funny, smart, and confident (or if not exactly confident then they should be trying to get there somehow) and Kare Kano has it all. No one is really dumb here and most of them say what they think or feel or eventually develop enough to do so. The anime isn't quite able to encompass all the lovely character development due to budget cuts and mangaka/producer disagreements but if you get a chance, read the manga. The only character I do not like as much as the rest would probably be Arima...and again if your read the manga you'll know why.Enjoyment:I own the series but I do regret that the production company was forced to such lows to produce some of the episodes. The anime does not have a proper ending and if you want one, look for the manga...although I will admit that the anime did encompass a lot of Yukino's arc..which is IMHO the highlight of the series...what follows in the manga is a huge dreary arc on Arima...but in between you'll find some gold when Tsuda decides to focus on the other characters.Overall:I like it lots.  And if you want to listen to a good conversation between characters instead of long overly macho crap in shounen or hurried &quot;I love you, but I can't love you&quot; crap in shoujo then you're in for a treat. :) soundtrack.

It was based off of a manga by Tsuda Masami. And, apparently, she was unhappy with the way Gainax handled it which resulted in it not receiving a full adaptation. So, what exactly is wrong with the adaptation? Let\'s take a look and see what went wrong. Or maybe she was just being overly picky. We\'ll see.Story:Miyazawa Yukino excels at everything. She\'s an outstanding student, a strong athlete and is well liked by everyone. There\'s just one problem. She doesn\'t show her true personality to anyone outside of her...family. She puts on a mask because she loves to be praised. One day her major rival, Arima Soichiro, uncovers the truth behind the mask. The pair become friends and quickly go beyond friendship. The narrative from there goes into their ups and downs as well as their relationships with those around them.The big narrative problem with this anime is that the last third is really atrocious. Here\'s the thing. Roughly the first two thirds have a strong comedic aesthetic where problems come up, get resolved in ways that are pretty entertaining\xa0 and things flow from there. Roughly the last third throws that out and adds a bunch of terribly written angst and poorly thought out drama. This causes the series to devolve from an entertaining romp to being virtually unwatchable. The ending is trash too. Most anime that aren\'t going to cover an adapted work entirely have the decency to give some closure and end with some pressing issue getting wrapped up. This one takes the rubbish heap route and leaves every single plot point unanswered.There are some lesser problems before that. Yukino\'s friend, Maho, talks about dating a dude who\'s almost thirty and no one finds it creepy except the people in the audience who have sense. Hate to break it to you guys in your late twenties, early thirties, but if you\'re chasing after high school girls you are objectively a complete fucking creep. Same with those of you in your mid twenties. Even early twenties is pushing it given the developmental difference. The anime is also pretty lazy. It features a lot of long recap segments, a full recap episode and two episodes that are half recap. To an extent, I do understand it since the economy was doing poorly, but it still does impact the quality of the work when it wastes your time rehashing to that extent.On the positive side, the first seventeen or eighteen episodes are enjoyable, except for the recaps. The high levels of humour work quite well. To the point where you can almost completely forgive the lazier elements. If it had maintained that momentum, this could have been a very solid anime. But some incompetent moron working on the adaptation lost the plot. It was probably Zach. No one likes that guy.Characters:The characters were never super complex. Even before Zach ruined everything. But this was a more comedic series and the characters did work well in that regard. Then we reach the shite segment of the series and Arima gets obnoxiously angsty and drags the whole cast down with him. They also introduce a male love interest for the girl who has spent the entire series showing interest exclusively in cute girls. Which actually makes me mad. Like, I haven\'t entirely forgiven Fire Emblem Fates for pulling that shit with Soleil and I liked that game considerably more than I liked this anime.It\'s also a bit annoying that they basically get rid of all Tsubasa\'s character after wrapping up her arc about her dad remarrying. It\'s like they couldn\'t think of anything for her character to do and didn\'t know how to work her into the friend group. So, they gave up and had her just go feral.Art:This is another area where the obvious fiscal problems resulted in a lot of laziness. There are a lot of scenes where characters will be talking and they\'ll just show some still images of street lights or some other nonsense that doesn\'t matter and is just boring to look at. They\'ll also just cut to quiet scenes of the same kind of scenery for no narrative reason and just linger on it to pad out the episodes. The series uses a lot of boring still images and recycled animation in general. It doesn\'t help that it has one of the worst drawn dogs I\'ve ever seen in anime. How do you have a dog that isn\'t even a little cute? Honestly, most of it looks pretty bad.Sound:Here\'s where the director royally failed. The acting in this can be pretty damn bad. Shintani Mayumi, Fukui Yukari, Kiyokawa Motomu and several other actors sound really stilted in their delivery. There\'s also a lot of over the top comedic exaggeration that might be fine in more moderation but gets grating when it\'s employed this often. I\'ll give the series credit for having some theme tunes that are pretty good, musically. The imagery isn\'t. The rest of Sagisu Shirou\'s soundtrack is pretty mediocre.Ho-yay:There\'s Sakura and her thing for cute girls. There are also moments where both Asaba & Tonami seem to have a thing for Arima. And there\'s an episode where Yukino\'s sisters seem to pick up female admirers solely for cheap jokes. Naturally, this episode is at the point where the series has already gotten bad.Areas of Improvement:Lose the badly written, ill conceived angst. There\'s a place for angst. Preferably, as a temporary shift due to some major events. But it doesn\'t work in a mostly comedic series. Especially when it just keeps going.Do not give the one character who\'s been portrayed as not straight a hetero love interest. Yes, we get that bisexual people exist. However, there\'s also this terrible tendency in media to have one LGBT character to earn some ""representation points"" and then give that character a hetero normative relationship so you don\'t actually have to deal with any of that queer stuff. Fuck that. Fuck it with something long, awkwardly shaped and covered in literal spikes.Have a satisfying conclusion. I get it, Zach is an awful writer and screwed up, thereby making it so the series had to end prematurely. At least give us some closure. End the emo Arima phase and show Yukino\'s play. Just give us something to make it feel somewhat satisfying.Final Thoughts:This is, honestly, a bit difficult for me to rate. On the one hand, I did enjoy the series for about two thirds of it. And if it had maintained that standard, I could somewhat forgive the lazy, rubbish artwork, the lazy rehashing and even the poor directing. If not for the way it ends I\'d be going with a ""6"" maybe slightly higher. However, the final third is utter tripe and those elements that worked get heavily bludgeoned to the point of being nearly unrecognisable and a whole slew of problems come in to make sure they stay damaged. And if the entire series was like those last eight episodes, I\'d be giving this a ""1"" and making rude gestures in its general direction. Still, I can\'t bring myself to call it bad given the way it started. So, I\'m going with a 4/10 for the whole thing. Maybe I\'ll go read the manga and it won\'t have the same problems at the end. Maybe that final stretch is what made Tsuda unhappy with the adaptation. In which case, completely justifiable response there. family. She puts on a mask because she loves to be praised.

In which case, completely justifiable response there.', ""Yukino Miyazawa is at the top of her class in both grades and respect. She’s the perfect model student... poised, generous, cultured, the picture of a school idol. But before you can start throwing around accusations of her being a Mary-Sue, she informs you very clearly that it’s all an act. She pretends to be perfect, working her little butt off to not only get good grades, but to make it look easy. Why? Because she loves receiving praise, and Japan has that whole ‘sempai’ thing going on.Her world is thrown into turmoil when a new student transfers into her class, named Soichiro Arima, and...his good grades immediately bump her from her pedestal as the smartest kid in school. She declares him her rival, and he declares her... His love interest?There’s a lot to talk about in regards to this series... I’ll try to touch on most of it... But to start, I can’t restrain myself from gushing about the English dub, which is easily one of the best I’ve ever heard. It consists mainly of some of the best and brightest stars of the nineties, and they all give four star performances. Yukino is a very talky character, whose inner monologues take up a disproportionate amount of the script, and this would be unbearable coming from anybody other than Veronica Taylor(Ash Ketchum, Amelia Wil Tesla Seyruun), who has a distinct habit of throwing herself wholeheartedly into every single role she performs. Her obsession over her grades and her budding relationship is every bit as convincing as her drive to become a Pokemon master ever was, and she never misses a beat on this project.Christopher Nicholas plays Soichiro just as flawlessly, hitting a wide range of emotions where most other actors would have just gone flat. He’s a damaged boy with very profound abandonment issues, and his motive for overachieving is entirely different from Yukino’s, even though it has about an equally complex affect on his life. He does such a great job that I have to wonder why he only had six other anime roles aside from this one.Soichiro’s childhood friends consist of Hideaki Asaba... Or Sexy Carlos, as AMV Hell 3 called him... and Tsubasa Shibahime, who has an unrequited crush on Soichiro. Because of course she does. Hideaki is played by Liam O’Brien, and I don’t really think Dr. Tenma from monster needs me to tell you how great he is. He loves his lascivious ladies’ man character, and eats up every sleazy line he’s given. Lisa Ortiz, who voiced my favorite character of all time Lina Inverse, portrays Tsubasa, and she’s able to command the screen even when her dialogue is reduced to growling. Which is a thing that happens. Rachel Lillis also has a handful of roles, and while they’re not as diverse as her multiple roles in Pokemon, she still does a great job.The other two of note are Yukino’s younger sisters, Kano and Tsukino, but the only really big part they play in the story is the fact that it’s their job to dole out plot summaries at the beginning of most episodes, and the preview at the end of every episode. And who did they cast for these roles? Megan Hollingshead (Officer Jenny, Nurse joy, the Sonozaki Twins) and Jessica Calvello (Excel!). While either of these actors are phenomenal on their own, they work even better together, feeding off of each others’ already boisterous energy.By the way, i’m going to go briefly off topic to say how awesome it is to have Calvello returning to voice acting. She’s already done a few recent roles for Sentai filmworks, and even some Cyanide and Happiness clips, and now she’s going to be in Attack on Titan! Glad to have you back, and I mean it!Oh, I should probably say something about the music.  There's some nice sounding 60's stuff, but the track you'll remember the most is a very somber piano piece.  You'll remember it the most because they play the damn thing over and over and over again.Since this series was produced directly after Evangelion, I don’t think it’ll be any surprise that it had an abysmally small animation budget to work with. But that’s never the death knell of any anime... Any show can look fantastic even with the barest of budgets. And since Kare Kano is a slow paced and text-heavy romantic comedy, it should have been easy to cut corners wherever possible without really upsetting anybody.But since this is late nineties Studio Gainax, the order of the day seems to have been ‘make it look like the last few episodes of Evangelion.’ Much like he did in Eva, Director Hideaki Anno overcompensates for the lack of animation money by employing hyper, eclectic visual style that’s meant to distract us, like dangling keys in front of a baby. this is a huge pet peeve of mine, and until now, I always assumed that Bakemonogatari was the worst offender. The art direction is largely directionless, as the breakneck editing frequently jumps from style to style. When we’re not watching the lifeless key frames of the actual material, we’re looking at art-class charcoal sketches, monochromatic manga images, and... I swear I’m not making this up... Actual cardboard cut-outs on popsicle sticks, all in a hilarious attempt to distract us from what little visual flare the soft, pastel-clad series has to offer. There’s no OTHER reason for such a slow paced anime to do this... Oh, wait, yes there is.In order to talk about the writing that went into Kare Kano, I’m going to have to start by explaining the concept of Show Don’t Tell. Well, a condensed explanation is in order, as it pertains to a visual medium. Basically, telling the viewer about something isn’t going to give them the same experience as showing it to them. If a feeling or emotion can be stated with a simple change of expression, there’s no reason to have the character blab on about it. For example, my biggest problem with Kick-Ass 2 was that the admittedly bold character development was explored through long-winded emotional speeches, rather than actual actions. Show, don’t tell.Unfortunately, Kare Kano is an extremely ‘telly’ series. Every single plot point is stated to us, sometimes over and over again, and I’m not just talking about the plot recaps. The voice-over narrations between our two heroes are incessant, as they beat us over the head with every thought, concern, or emotion that may be going through their minds. We’re constantly reminded about things that we couldn’t have possibly forgotten, and no matter who’s talking, they won’t shut up about Yukino’s personality, whether real or constructed, or about the fact that her and Shoichiro are changing each other. A good cast can go a long way, but this amount of expositional soliloquizing wears out it’s welcome fast. And don’t even get me started on the constant... And I mean constant... On-screen text.Basically, it has the pretentious writing style of Evangelion, and the heavily randomized viaual style of FLCL, and that wouldn’t be such a bad thing if it wasn’t for it’s slow pace and limbo-champ stakes.Which is unfortunate, because when the show actually shuts the hell up for two minutes and develops the characters normally, it can deliver some heart-stoppingly beautiful moments. But they're few and far between.I don’t think it’s a big spoiler to say that our two leads become a couple, since this is a romantic comedy, but the surprising factor is just how fast they get together. Instead of relying on the cliched will-they-won’t-they dynamic, Kare Kano isn’t a story about them getting together as much as it is about them staying together. And that would make for a really interesting plot, if there was any actual threat to them. Yes, the characters themselves may not be annoyingly perfect, but their relationship damn well IS. Every conflict they ever face... And I hate using hyperbole, so no, I am not exaggerating about this... Is resolved as quickly and easily as possible, before being instantly forgotten. Even the characters that try to get in their way are defeated, befriended, and robbed of any future identity or screen time.Unfortunately for Kare Kano, my other big pet peeve is when a series spends an entire episode... Or two... On one character's arc, giving them development or a backstory just to drop them out of the story immediately afterwards. When that character is going to be killed off, that's one thing, but when they're going to lose all of their dialogue and literally act like a monkey for the rest of the show, that's something else. And not something good.Sometimes, even the events revolving specifically around our couple ultimately result in nothing. Here, I’ll give you a spoiler-example. Soichiro was abandoned by his deadbeat father and physically abusive mother as a child. He’s raised by his aunt and uncle, and at one point in the series, we travel with him to his family reunion. And because of some betrayal his father committed, everybody hates him, saying he’ll amount to nothing. You may be saying “Wait, isn’t he at the top of his class?’ Yes, and his uncle brings up that exact point, telling all of them that they’re feelings toward him make no sense. And that’s where that storyline ends.If having a character point out that something didn’t make sense was enough to make up for the fact that it didn’t make sense, I would have enjoyed Angel Beats a bit more.Now, here’s the part where I put my money where my mouth is; That entire plot point could have been easily improved. Rather than openly hating him for something he didn’t deserve, why not have them secretly hate him, but wear fake smiles around him and pretend to love him BECAUSE of his grades? Then when they find out that his grades slipped because of his girlfriend, their true natures show! See, by doing that, they could have tied this conflict directly into the main plot. His relationship to Yukino could have been dragged into it, kicking and screaming if necessary.To address the elephant in the room, a lot of people consider this show’s damning flaw to be the fact that it suddenly ended at episode 26, leaving off without any sort of conclusion. This was done because the manga author, Masami Tsuda, didn’t like the direction the adaptation was taking. She said that Anno was focusing more on the comedy than the main romance, and as such, she refused to let them adapt her work any further. Personally, I think it was unfair and entirely inaccurate of her to imply that this show was moving in some sort of direction in the first place. But yes, I have to side with her on this. I’m actually glad she cut them off, because in addition to protecting her own name, she prevented Anno from embarrassing himself any further.There's a long list of shows that were inspired in some way or another by this particular series, including one of my first positive reviews, Yamada's First Time. The problem? Almost all of these shows are decisively better than Kare Kano.For those of you who decided to TLDR by skipping right to my final thoughts, I’d hate to disappoint you, so here they are. Kare Kano is a train wreck. I’m sorry, I know it’s popular, and a lot of people love it, but I have to be honest; This is one of the most badly written and poorly executed pieces of work that I’ve ever seen. It showed some promise in the beginning, but even then, the cracks in the writing were already beginning to show. My expectations may have been a little too high, but even if they weren’t, my opinion of this show would still be the same. I thought it would be the best anime I reviewed this month, but no, it’s the worst. At least This Ugly Yet Beautiful World put forth some actual effort, making a genuine attempt to have a decent story and a consistent plot.I give His and Her Circumstances a 3/10. If you’re pleasantly intrigued by the idea of watching a circle of talking heads play Uno for three minutes, go ahead and raise it to a 5/10, as no other show will be lazy enough to deliver on that esoteric joy.His and Her Circumstances: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worshiping and Hate the Gainax. his good grades immediately bump her from her pedestal as the smartest kid in school.

The voice-over narrations between our two heroes are incessant, as they beat us over the head with every thought, concern, or emotion that may be going through their minds. We’re constantly reminded about things that we couldn’t have possibly forgotten, and no matter who’s talking, they won’t shut up about Yukino’s personality, whether real or constructed, or about the fact that her and Shoichiro are changing each other. A good cast can go a long way, but this amount of expositional soliloquizing wears out it’s welcome fast. And don’t even get me started on the constant... And I mean constant... On-screen text.Basically, it has the pretentious writing style of Evangelion, and the heavily randomized viaual style of FLCL, and that wouldn’t be such a bad thing if it wasn’t for it’s slow pace and limbo-champ stakes.Which is unfortunate, because when the show actually shuts the hell up for two minutes and develops the characters normally, it can deliver some heart-stoppingly beautiful moments. But they're few and far between.I don’t think it’s a big spoiler to say that our two leads become a couple, since this is a romantic comedy, but the surprising factor is just how fast they get together. Instead of relying on the cliched will-they-won’t-they dynamic, Kare Kano isn’t a story about them getting together as much as it is about them staying together. And that would make for a really interesting plot, if there was any actual threat to them. Yes, the characters themselves may not be annoyingly perfect, but their relationship damn well IS. Every conflict they ever face... And I hate using hyperbole, so no, I am not exaggerating about this... Is resolved as quickly and easily as possible, before being instantly forgotten. Even the characters that try to get in their way are defeated, befriended, and robbed of any future identity or screen time.Unfortunately for Kare Kano, my other big pet peeve is when a series spends an entire episode... Or two... On one character's arc, giving them development or a backstory just to drop them out of the story immediately afterwards. When that character is going to be killed off, that's one thing, but when they're going to lose all of their dialogue and literally act like a monkey for the rest of the show, that's something else. And not something good.Sometimes, even the events revolving specifically around our couple ultimately result in nothing. Here, I’ll give you a spoiler-example. Soichiro was abandoned by his deadbeat father and physically abusive mother as a child. He’s raised by his aunt and uncle, and at one point in the series, we travel with him to his family reunion. And because of some betrayal his father committed, everybody hates him, saying he’ll amount to nothing. You may be saying “Wait, isn’t he at the top of his class?’ Yes, and his uncle brings up that exact point, telling all of them that they’re feelings toward him make no sense. And that’s where that storyline ends.If having a character point out that something didn’t make sense was enough to make up for the fact that it didn’t make sense, I would have enjoyed Angel Beats a bit more.Now, here’s the part where I put my money where my mouth is; That entire plot point could have been easily improved. Rather than openly hating him for something he didn’t deserve, why not have them secretly hate him, but wear fake smiles around him and pretend to love him BECAUSE of his grades? Then when they find out that his grades slipped because of his girlfriend, their true natures show! See, by doing that, they could have tied this conflict directly into the main plot. His relationship to Yukino could have been dragged into it, kicking and screaming if necessary.To address the elephant in the room, a lot of people consider this show’s damning flaw to be the fact that it suddenly ended at episode 26, leaving off without any sort of conclusion. This was done because the manga author, Masami Tsuda, didn’t like the direction the adaptation was taking. She said that Anno was focusing more on the comedy than the main romance, and as such, she refused to let them adapt her work any further. Personally, I think it was unfair and entirely inaccurate of her to imply that this show was moving in some sort of direction in the first place. But yes, I have to side with her on this. I’m actually glad she cut them off, because in addition to protecting her own name, she prevented Anno from embarrassing himself any further.There's a long list of shows that were inspired in some way or another by this particular series, including one of my first positive reviews, Yamada's First Time. The problem? Almost all of these shows are decisively better than Kare Kano.For those of you who decided to TLDR by skipping right to my final thoughts, I’d hate to disappoint you, so here they are. Kare Kano is a train wreck. I’m sorry, I know it’s popular, and a lot of people love it, but I have to be honest; This is one of the most badly written and poorly executed pieces of work that I’ve ever seen. It showed some promise in the beginning, but even then, the cracks in the writing were already beginning to show. My expectations may have been a little too high, but even if they weren’t, my opinion of this show would still be the same. I thought it would be the best anime I reviewed this month, but no, it’s the worst. At least This Ugly Yet Beautiful World put forth some actual effort, making a genuine attempt to have a decent story and a consistent plot.I give His and Her Circumstances a 3/10. If you’re pleasantly intrigued by the idea of watching a circle of talking heads play Uno for three minutes, go ahead and raise it to a 5/10, as no other show will be lazy enough to deliver on that esoteric joy.His and Her Circumstances: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worshiping and Hate the Gainax."", ""Gainax's adaptation on Masami Tsuda's manga Kare Kano is a series that rarely leaves anyone who watches it indifferent. Starting off with a hectic pace, rapid development and unique characters, presents a style and animation that for some might be worth of negative criticism, while for others a true paradigm of originality and visual expressivity.As for the bigger picture, Kare Kano is a romance. This topic is the main aspect of the series during its first third, in which we find probably one of the most disarmingly honest shoujo romances ever made. From that point onwards, yes: the main couple does get more screen...time and exclusive episodes, but also other characters appear in scene and gain in importance and development, as well as the comedy aspect of the show increases.The characters are well portrayed and their development is noticeable. The main lead is very interesting, with her apparently different facets and her unique personality. Considering herself the queen of vanity and always full of pride, Yukino seems to be the opposite of the also talented but really measured male lead. Nonetheless as the time passes they notice how important their relationship is to discover things about themselves and to improve as people in general. It's also quite uncommon and great to find a protagonist for this kind of series that instead of being insecure and dubious when anything happens, decides to act with determination to solve her problems as soon as possible.The style and its original approach is one of the main sources of controversy and one of the explanations of why is this show so terribly underrated. You might have seen other Gainax's shows that could give you a clue on this matter: a previous Neon Genesis Evangelion or a later FLCL. In order to express emotions and comedy scenes, characters' shape is usually modified in what looks like caricatures. Decoloration and manga-style, minimalist scenes in where the text is simply written are also visible throughout the show. There's one episode in which this is especially hyperbolic and the backgrounds are real, while the characters are just clippings. For the major part of the show these shifts in style are done in a very effective manner, enriching emotion and making sure that the desired mood for the scene is portrayed in the best possible way.Now the major downside of the series is the fact that drags out a bit for the last eight episodes, with pointless recaps, slower pace, new characters we are not given enough time to care about and, of course, an open ending. From the last 3 episodes 2 of them are fillers and the last one, while having a better direction than the few previous ones, might result in a disappointment for the unaware audience that was waiting for a proper conclusion. Kare Kano was supposed to receive a second season but due to some disagreements between the original creator and the direction this never happened, also with director Hideaki Anno leaving the project before its completion.As bad as all the aforementioned issues might sound it is important to acknowledge that the great majority of the show is not only a fair adaptation of the manga, but also an enriching one. Its stellar direction pushed the boundaries of a more complete medium like very few adaptations in anime are capable of doing, character designs made the ones from the manga look way more appealing and audiovisuals were spot on for the major part of its airing.No complains in what concerns to the sound: both opening and ending themes are above average, with the ending sequence changing after every episode. The soundtrack is really befitting for both the occasional wackiness of the show as well as for its more dramatic moments.In conclusion, if you want to watch a well-built, funny romance story (potentially one of the best of the medium) and you don't mind about dealing with an original animation style or a rather few disappointing last episodes give Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou a try. time and exclusive episodes, but also other characters appear in scene and gain in importance and development, as well as the comedy aspect of the show increases.The characters are well portrayed and their development is noticeable.

It really should have been.  But it wasn\'t.  I have a soft spot for romantic comedies, and this is one I\'d heard about for years, so I thought I\'d give it a shot.  But after an incredible start to the show, I was just left disappointed in the end.I\'m not going into the story much, because the synopsis sums it up pretty well and going further into it would be too much spoiler so I\'ll just tell you to read the synopsis on here.  If you\'ve read any of the other reviews or seen the...anime yourself, you know how incomplete the show is.  Not just the lack of an ending either.  It felt like the story was kept to a shallow point for a long time, and then when it was supposed to start getting serious, it wafted around like ""I dunno, should we be serious or not?""  There are some serious overtones thrown in sometimes, but it stops short of revealing much of anything, and just when you feel like it\'s all about to happen.....the show ends.  Pack up, go home, and let\'s just pretend we did a good job.  Honestly, this could\'ve been so much better.  I plan to go read the manga at some point to find out what happens.In the first half of the show, there\'s a wonderful romantic comedy going on.  There are usually some review at the beginning of each episode.  I\'m not a fan of this in most anime, and that includes this one.  But it wasn\'t too bad.  There was plenty of comedy, and it was really cute at times.  It wasn\'t really serious about anything for the first half though.The second half though was just not good.  It started to do more reviews.  One episode dedicated to reviews at the midpoint is fine, but it felt like half of the last 13 episodes was dedicated to stating what had already happened, with little to no new animation.  It\'s kind of like ""the voice actors are still being paid, the animators are not"" or something.  The budget had to have been seriously cut or something.  The second half of the show was about 3/4 frame by frame manga style with some voiceovers.  Even if they knew that the story was going to be cut short, there were better ways to end it.  First of all, they could have actually deviated from the main story a bit to ensure that there is actually an ending, or had the oft-used open ending feel that kinda goes ""we love each other, we don\'t know what\'ll happen from now on, but we\'ll keep trying.""  That kind of thing would\'ve been fine IMO.  Instead, they go off on tangents.  Most of the 2nd half actually has its focus away from the main 2 characters.  And then when it starts to drift back toward them, the show just ends.Well, enough ranting.  Some scores and explanations on them:I\'ll give the story a 4 for all the stuff I said up above.  It seemed to be a good story with some pretty deep points, but it just showed flashes of those deep parts, never fully revealing any of it, and then ended abruptly.  I get the feeling that if it was finished, it would have been a very good and deep plot.  But it wasn\'t, so I have to give it a lower score.The art was nice at times.  It seemed to try to hod the manga\'s style.  It isn\'t my favorite style to begin with, but I thought in the first half it was pretty well done at least.  The second half, as I said above, seemed to have major budget cuts and at least half the time was pictures thrown up with voices talking about something.  Plus, the abundant reviewing where previous scenes were chopped up and handed to you a second, third, fourth, and so on, time.  With the good stuff in the first half, I\'ll be nice and give it a 5.The sound is where I felt the show was awesome.  Yeah, the opening and endings were nothing special.  They were good, and fit the show, but nothing special.  But the voice actors were great.  Yukino was great.  Spectacular.  Especially early in the show switching from the graceful girl, to the true girl, the evil girl trying to win everyone over.  Eventually, it\'s kind of a mix between the two, but the voice actress portrays it really well.  Also, the two sisters are a riot, and their voice actresses are likewise spectacular.  One of my favorite parts was watching these two do the episode previews at the end of the show(another thing that was done much less the 2nd half of the show).  Because of these three, and the generally good quality of the rest of the voice actors, I\'m giving the sound department a 9.The characters is hard to rate because it\'s inherently tied to the story.  Yukino was just a great character.  Her dual personality is hilarious, and is a lot of fun to watch.  With Arima, he gets a bit boring, but I got the feeling that part of that was because they were reluctant to start the deeper, more dramatic parts of the show that ought to reveal more of his personality.  And indeed, the show ended before much of it was revealed.  Shibahime was annoying to me, and they eventually turned her into a caricature of what she was to begin with.  The story arc that she got in the middle of the anime seemed to be the last part that was fully budgeted, and it felt out of place with the rest of the story, and because I couldn\'t stand Shibahime, I almost stopped watching because of it.  The rest of the group that Yukino hangs out with has their moments, but most of them seems like it\'s ""yet to come,"" and once again, the show ends before anything can happen.  Yukino\'s family is hilarious, and it felt like they were setting up to be the comic relief once the show turned more serious.  The sisters, as I said above, were spectacular.  I\'m giving the characters a 7, because I really liked Yukino as well as most of the characters, but felt like they were all a bit incomplete, as was the whole show.Overall, this show could have been something spectacular.  But because the show is so incomplete, and parts of it seem to be terribly produced, I have to rate this overall as a 6.  I really wish I could give it more, because Yukino\'s character is something that really shines among heroines in romantic comedies, but the show was just hopelessly lacking in most ways, especially in the second half after the budget seemed to have been cut.  It\'s really a shame, because I feel like the story was going to be really good.  Also, as a side note, I can\'t help but wonder why this show has gotten so many high ratings.  Yes, it shows tons of potential, and the characters are very interesting, and the voice acting is well done, but how can any show that wasn\'t even completed earn more than a 6 or a 7? anime yourself, you know how incomplete the show is.  Not just the lack of an ending either.

But since this series insulted me with its ""Oh crap we ended it too early!"" storyline, I will cover the good and the bad parts.I was greatly interested in the story and the characters in the first disc (episodes 1-5). That interest turned to disdain by the third disc, and towards the end it seemed to be getting worse. The series ends on a good note which is all i can say for the last portion.The main failing of the series is the fact...that the plot derived from the first few episodes ends shortly before the series hits its midpoint. As is the norm for series that ""end before they\'re over"" a flurry of cliches (culture festivals) makes up the last half of the series.Originally the characters can be identified with and they are very likable. Thats what makes it so sad when the series makes its remarkable dive. It\'s very likely that one can build a nice place to hide from this anime with all the tools you\'ll find making up the cast.I left this series with a feeling of betrayal, the characters had gone from awesome and real, to douches that wouldn\'t be out of place in the supporting cast of an Inuyasha movie. that the plot derived from the first few episodes ends shortly before the series hits its midpoint.

First, we have his work on Nausicaa, mostly explosions and stuff, then Nadia, a narrative in the standard format, a bit of experimenting with difficult characters and plot twists, then comes Evangelion, a work which challenged many fundamental ideas on anime, like the idea that the ending needs a plot, or that the characters need to be likable, or that mechs have to behave mechanically, and finally, we have Kare Kano.This is describable as an avant-garde romance, but that wouldn't really do it justice....It's more like a refocusing. It sort of works on three levels: the story level, the psychological level, and the allegorical level. However, Anno doesn't seem to want us to see it as any one of those, and frequently switches between focuses. As a result, we get a schizophrenic mess where characters veer wildly between being plot advancement props, symbols, and full characters. It is, quite frankly, a somewhat unpleasant that gives lots of cognitive dissonance. In my honest opinion, Hideaki Anno is toying with us.What makes this series great is its sudden and unexpected swipes at truth, concealed amidst zany animation and romantic comedy. One example was Arima’s monologue in episode 8, where he talks about an inner voice asking him if he was really having fun. And then he proceeds to describe how it seems like his day to day emotions often just seem to float on the surface of his being, making no impression, just flowing over it. He wondered if at his depths he really feels anything at all. When I watched that, strangely enough I knew exactly what he was talking about, and I suspect that lots of viewers felt the same way. Day to day emotions flowing over the surface of my inner being as water over rocks... that's deep man.Some of the depth isn't stated outright, but rather is demonstrated. One other example is Arima and Miyazawa both feel they are putting on social airs, not placing their true selfs on display to the public, and yet they are inspired by each other's lies. Both Miyazawa and Arima were profoundly moved by what they thought they saw in the other person as more noble than theirselves, but they were really both equally ignoble on the inside. However, the catch is that they are both becoming more noble on the inside by the false airs they put on towards each other. Lies and deception are improving them. It's an interesting paradox, but it seems to be a fundamental truth about the world.Ok, so I'm not going to keep bothering the reader with illustrations of what I felt was profound in this anime. Instead, let's look at the big picture. The episodes in which some thought or revelation startled me amounts to maybe 1/2 or 1/3 of the episodes. The rest of the episodes come across as either silly or pretentious. So often, it feels like this show is going to collapse, that Hideako's hands are skillful enough to balance this complicated structure, yet by the end it is clear that somehow he has managed.The art style works somewhat interestingly, with more simplistic drawings representing deeper internal states, and the most detailed drawings depicting everyday life. In the most detailed drawings, all of the characters have quite attractive designs, especially Miyazawa. I wasn't a huge fan of the simplistic drawings, but their creative usage won me over. The music was very good. I quite enjoy the opening theme, and there was this one piano song in the background sometimes that was quite lovely.The ending has drawn quite a bit of criticism. Honestly, I loved it, but don't expect a satisfying resolution. The manga goes on, and probably has a more satisfactory ending. It's more like a refocusing.

Instead, let's look at the big picture. The episodes in which some thought or revelation startled me amounts to maybe 1/2 or 1/3 of the episodes. The rest of the episodes come across as either silly or pretentious. So often, it feels like this show is going to collapse, that Hideako's hands are skillful enough to balance this complicated structure, yet by the end it is clear that somehow he has managed.The art style works somewhat interestingly, with more simplistic drawings representing deeper internal states, and the most detailed drawings depicting everyday life. In the most detailed drawings, all of the characters have quite attractive designs, especially Miyazawa. I wasn't a huge fan of the simplistic drawings, but their creative usage won me over. The music was very good. I quite enjoy the opening theme, and there was this one piano song in the background sometimes that was quite lovely.The ending has drawn quite a bit of criticism. Honestly, I loved it, but don't expect a satisfying resolution. The manga goes on, and probably has a more satisfactory ending."", ""Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou/Kare Kano/His & Her Circumstances is a romantic comedy slice of life anime originally written as a manga by Masami Tsuda. Which was then adapted by studio Gainax & directed by Hideaki Anno of Evangelion fame. Kare Kano is a rather divisive anime on MAL (and in general), it has vocally passionate fans, and strong haters who think it’s trash. I think you can guess which side I’m on looking at the score, but I might as well explain why I’m on the side that I am. This review may contain mild spoilers, read at your own risk.Story & Characters (writing):The story...of Kare Kano revolves around Yukino Miyazawa & Armia Souichiro, two genius kids who put on a false persona to trick people into thinking they’re much better as people than they actually are. As Yukino & Arima get to know each other & start becoming more friendly, they start to open up & become more of themselves.Much like the last anime I took a look at “Kimagure Orange Road”, Kare Kano’s story isn’t very complicated. But the way Kare Kano goes about writing its characters & scenarios is what turns the story into more than just 2 characters falling in love. As the story progresses, we get to see Yukino & Arima not only open themselves up more to people, but get more comfortable with just being themselves and becoming more laid back people in general. Much like Evangelion, Kare Kano dives into exploring human psychology & how these characters act & what makes them act the way they do. Personally though, I think Kare Kano does a much better job at explaining, showcasing, & working in the reasons & events as to why the characters act the way they do naturally than Evangelion does.Kare Kano’s comedy isn’t my kind of comedy admittedly, there’s some good jokes & moments sprinkled in there, & I feel as though Kare Kano’s comedy isn’t too intrusive to the story & character development at hand, as Kare Kano knows to keep its comedy out of the darker scenes, but I don’t find myself laughing at too many of Kare Kano’s jokes. Still, it doesn’t ever become intrusive enough to piss me off or annoy me.One aspect of Kare Kano that I absolutely will not excuse are the recaps. This was just a lazy money saving technique on the part of all involved at Gainax. There’s no reason I need a recap of what happened last episode everytime. One may argue “You can just skip them” but if it comes to that point, then it’s rubbish, plain and simple.Onto the characters. Kare Kano has too many characters for me to list off, so I won’t go over every last one of them, as that would start delving into major spoiler territory, and I’d like to keep the spoilers to a minimum. In fact, I’m going to do something a little different from my KOR & Maison Ikkoku review, I’m going to lump our 2 leads & the side characters into a category & explain how the show writes them.An overlying theme about Kare Kano is opening up & becoming yourself. Everyone goes through a mini-arc like that. While this brings up a point on how the side characters are used, & can be argued that this intrudes on the main characters journey, I’d argue it does, but also doesn’t. See, the series isn’t good at working its side characters into the story to help move it along naturally, & the side characters are given just enough screen time in order for this to happen. On the flip side though, this also creates layered individuals with their own character traits & stories to tell. It also helps Kare Kano’s world feel more alive & lived in at the same time. The side characters are a double edged sword, they bring goods, & bads to the series. I’d argue more good than bad though, at least they go beyond nothing more than repeated, tired jokes & caricatures like the side characters in something like Orange Road or Ranma ½ do.Art & Sound (presentation):The art is a bit of a mixed bag, unfortunately falling more on the lesser side. The backgrounds of Kare Kano look great, but the character art & animation leave a lot to be desired. What also doesn’t help the art is just how terrible Gainax was at managing its money, so the production of this show was an absolute mess, & at times shots & even full episodes (specifically the last 2) are nothing more than “Moving Manga Sequences” with barely any movement to it. The animation can look pretty good at times, but a lot of the time it’s pretty flat, if there’s one thing Evangelion definitely has over Kare Kano, it’s its animation. Kare Kano’s shots are often quite static with not much movement going on in them, although I think these shots do work a lot of the time, that’s only because this series has the strong writing that it would need to back that kind of shot up.On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing! Shirou Sagisu returns from Evangelion to compose yet another piece for Hideaki Anno & his team over at Gainax. It’s very comparable to his score on Evangelion, particularly with how both Eva, & Kare Kano use a lot of classical music. There’s a great variety in pieces & they’re all used to great effect to fit the type of mood that a scene is going for. It’s a very dynamic soundtrack, and for that it gets massive props from me.The voice acting is…… interesting to say the least. I think it’s neither outright bad, nor outright good, just, interesting. Kare Kano makes use of child actors to give a more natural feel to the dialogue, which works, but there have been better examples of this practice being used to great effect. One performance I really have to bring mention to is “Mayumi Shintari” as Tsubasa. I like her voice, but it doesn’t really fit. Overall, I'd give the voice acting a 5. There's goods & bads to it. It fits the series ok enough, but there isn't an absolutely outstanding performance attached here.Final Thoughts/OverallSo that’s Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou. Is it a perfect series? No, not even remotely. It has pretty distinct flaws to it, especially in the production of this show. Without spoiling too much, Tsuda didn’t like how Hideaki Anno & his team over at Gainax adapted Kare Kano, so she and Anno were constantly having disagreements. At some point, Anno just became fed up & not only left Kare Kano, but left TV animation entirely. This in turn lead to the show taking a lot, and I mean A LOT of corner cutting techniques, one of the episodes was literally made with paper & popsicle sticks (though I quite like that episode). At the very least these episodes were able to keep the strong writing seen in the first 18 episodes, but even that can’t begin to excuse how terrible the production values in episodes 19-26 are. Not only that though, the art is pretty mediocre, the side characters can intrude, & the recaps are pure laziness. But with all that said, Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou is still my 2nd favorite anime of all time. It may not be better than Evangelion on a technical level, but I love it way more than Evangelion & consider Kare Kano to be when Hideaki Anno peaked. I love the characters of this anime, I love the story, I love the overarching theme, I love the cinematography, I love pretty much everything about Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou. In spite of Kare Kano’s massive flaws, I will always love it. So with that said, my final rating is going to be an enthusiastic 10/10. I know not everybody is going to feel the same way about this anime that I do, and that’s absolutely ok. But if you’re looking for a rom-com/slice-of-life, or are a massive fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion, then I highly implore you all to check out this work. of Kare Kano revolves around Yukino Miyazawa & Armia Souichiro, two genius kids who put on a false persona to trick people into thinking they’re much better as people than they actually are.

I find it hard to understand their enthusiasm when watching this tripe.don't get me wrong, the manga was brilliant and although many of the characters where generic it had situations that where altogether new and exciting and to a certain degree the comedy and romance aspects mixed well. But that is in the manga. THIS is the anime.Where to begin?Honestly, thia...anime is so badly done that I felt insulted by the animators, and i'm not even the mangaka, and we all know how he felt about this anime (notice the lack of a second season). There are simply too many problems here that rather than speaking of inexsperience or time/money constraints speak of an inherrent laziness that would make you think that the animators spent most of their time reading the manga instead of animating, since there's so little actual animation in this show.As far as the story goes, it's good. And in the beginning it follows the source material pretty well, for the story alone you could actually enjoy this anime, if it weren't for the equally fitting half assed attempt to sub this anime which considering this anime was licensed was devestatingly terrible. Entire scenes would go by without any subs and when the subs do appear their in a horrible yellow text that's often blurry and at times just popped in for a few seconds then vanished rendering them pointless. The fact that it began so close to the source material adds further inclinations toward the creators laziness, since copying text from the manga means you don't have to come up with anything new for people to say.Where the biggest problem comes (and the laziest part of this anime) is with the animation itself (which I dare say hardly qualifies as animation at all). This show has some of the laziest animation I've ever seen, so lazy that it's an insult to the animation industry. Let me break it up into percentages for you:80% of the anime is just still images from the manga with voice acting over them, and some zooming and panning from the camera.The remaining 20% is 'gif' like animation where characters move erraticly but consistantly the same way over and over again again, with voice acting over it.What has the animation industry come to when this kind of shoddy excuse for animation is passed off as consummable by the general public who are, honestly, expecting actual animation to take place. As if that wasn't lazy enough they also couldn't be bother to use colour so the 80% of the anime that remains stationary is in monochrome like the manga. Honestly why bother, you may as well read the manga since this is just audio over the manga 80% of the time.on the topic of audio, the voice acting in this anime isn't half bad, but this show's budget must have been dreadful, since there are literally only 3 pieces of music in this entire show if you exclude the opening an ending creds. After you've heard funny music for umpteenth time, and romance music 1 and 2 for the umpteenth and a half time you get so irritated and tired of it that you want to smash your face through a combine harvester. Each piece of music is used with respect to situation and quite stoicly at that since there are only three types of situation throughout this show, comedic situation, awkward romance/issue situation, and romance resolved situation. The manga was more detailed and explored more of the characters and their history whereas this show just acts melodramatic hoping you won't notice the rotting cheese they left all over the frames.The characters are waaaay too melodramatic and although there are plenty of you're average manga character in this it's good to see a stronger female lead, and her friends and character are funny at times but arima is just too boring in this anime since they don't explore his character much beyond aluding to a hidden self which only makes his character seem inhuman since he hasn't really got a very emotional V/O artist.all in all you should read the manga instead, it's waaay better and not so lazy and half assed like this bargain basement garbage. You might be able to watch it and enjoy it superficially and maybe find the characters interesting. It's justa shame about the cheese. anime is so badly done that I felt insulted by the animators, and i'm not even the mangaka, and we all know how he felt about this anime (notice the lack of a second season).

It wasn't like most animes where we have to endure all the hardships that happen BEFORE the relationship. This anime told the story of before and after. I definitely looked forward to watching something new.Story: Like I said, it was a catchy story. I thought it was newer and unique than most of the animes that are out today. We focus on the two characters falling in love and working through the hardships of falling in love. It was an innocent, cute, funny, plotline. Although the ending was rather disappointing, the beginning and middle were...failry decent. One thing i do have to comment on that was bad, was the re-caps. I found that the recaps soon took up half or even full episodes. No need for such long recaps. I'm sure most would agree.Art: The art is what realllly got to me. I found myself reading rather than watching. It was like they took the manga and just put it onto the episode. Also, I watched the subbed episodes, and it was rather difficult reading what was on top of the screen and what the subs were saying. [You'll understand if you've seen it] I know it was made a while ago, and during a bad time in Japan, but stilll. There were episodes that were fine, why couldn't it have just remained that way? It was a big let down.Sound: I didn't have much to complain about the sound. There were a few episodes that the voices were off from the picture, but i assumed that was from my slow connection. If it wasn't than that's another issue. The music wasn't the best, it was catchy enough. I don't have much to say about sound.Characters: The characters were likable. The main girl character, although could get on your nerves, was down to earth and truthful. She was loud, yet cute. The main guy character was confusing, yet friendly. Both characters were very realistic. Most of the other characters were also realistic. Although we could see character growth in only a few of them, we can assume the growth in the others.Enjoyment: Personally, I started off enjoying this anime verry much so. But i was highly disappointed at the end. I was left confused, mad, and let down. I had to go to Wikipedia to read what happens in the manga at the end. So after reading that, i was sort of satisfied. I don't know about any of you that want to watch it, but I think you'd enjoy the realism, humor, cute romantic parts, and the love that the two characters share.Overall: Mediocre. It was realistic. It was cute. It was funny. Although it lacked a decent ending and better art, it was enjoyable for the time being. Don't expect to &quot;WOWED&quot;. (:Hope this helped. failry decent.

(:Hope this helped."", 'this review is based on:26 episodes of the anime seenEpisodes 1-11 of the English dub&amp; Episodes 11-26 of Japanese w/ English SubtitlesThis review contains mild spoilers to refer back to, so be careful!Please keep in mind this review is meant for people who have seen the anime.Quick SynopsisThe story revolves around the romantic life of Miyazawa Yukino and Soichiro Arima. Yukino is the &quot;perfect&quot; role model who is beautiful, perfect, intelligent, and loved by everyone. However, deep down inside, she&rsquo;s the opposite. She&rsquo;s like a psycho angry girl who puts up a &quot;role model&quot; front to get attention. When Yukino attends high school, her...first ambition is to get the highest test scores, and to become the most admirable girl in school. However, her goals are crushed when she finds that Soichiro Arima is scoring higher scores, is way more talented, better looking, and loved by everyone. The worst part is, he isn&rsquo;t faking it the way Yukino is! Because of this, Yukino holds a grudge against Arima and starts to truly hate him (But whenever she&rsquo;s around him, she &quot;pretends&quot; to be nice).One day, as Yukino and Arima pass in the wallways, Arima goes up to Yukino and confesses to her, saying that he has always loved her. Yukino thinks that Arima is just trying to &quot;trick&quot; her, but in the end, Arima&rsquo;s feelings for Yukino are expressed in a way that can&rsquo;t possibly be a lie. Yukino begins to fall in love with Arima and thus their love blossoms~!StoryI love it i love it i LOVE it. There are so many things about Kare Kano that make the story perfect. I really like high school romances that revolve around ONE main couple and no weird love triangles or squares or whatever&hellip; Because of that, it allows space for the two characters to grow, and the relationship to deepen. The anime lacks in &quot;drama&quot; and just focuses on romance. &quot;Wait&hellip;if there&rsquo;s no drama, wtf is the anime supposed to be about?&quot; Well&hellip; it just goes into the inner thoughts of the characters, basically. But that&rsquo;s what I LOVE about Kare Kano. Omg&hellip;The the anime expresses how the Yukino and Arima are in love with each other in a way that&rsquo;s so believable you can&rsquo;t help but go KYAA~! Well, scratch that. It&rsquo;s more of a deeper feeling than &quot;KYAA&quot;. You just feel this rush of emotions and make you realize why people fall in love with each other, and how much being in love means, etc&hellip; Tho, i can see why people wouldn&rsquo;t like it. I mean&hellip; if you&rsquo;re a boy who has never really been in love before, then Kare kano would be some crap and boring shit that you wouldn&rsquo;t understand&hellip; ah well..What i also love is the humor. The humor in anime made in the 1990&rsquo;s shall always be fresh and funny xD I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t see anime these days that have the same humor D:I have to admit&hellip; towards the middle and end of Kare kano, a lot of new characters are quickly introduced and the focus turns away from Arima and Yukino D: The anime doesn&rsquo;t spend a lot of time with these other characters, and if they have a flash back or inner thoughts it usually lasts like&hellip;one episode. Not enough for one person to interpret or understand :/ This is where the anime starts to decline. Not only that, but there are recaps every 2 or 5 episodes. But none the less, I still enjoyed it.AnimationIt&rsquo;s hard for me to judge the animation&hellip; I mean, this anime was made waaay back in 1998 where anime was in low budget. The animation is defiantly creative in my opinion, even though at some points they&rsquo;re scans from the manga, still scenery, or just still animation in general. But the character design looks a LOT better than other character designs made during that time *cough serial experiments lain&hellip; ah my goddess&hellip; etc&hellip;* the animation is not spectacular but it&rsquo;s definatly not terrible. I would say it&rsquo;s pretty, and bearable :PSoundAgain, it&rsquo;s bearable @_@; At times, the BGM kind of interferes with the moment and most of the BGM is very overused and repetitive. The opening and ending theme songs are kind of addictive, but they&rsquo;re not the best op and eds ever. As for voice acting, I&rsquo;m going to be honest. When it comes to Arima and Yukino, i prefer the english dub. When it comes to all the side characters, i prefer the Japanese dub. But Japanese dub vs English dub&hellip; I much rather prefer english dub. not because i&rsquo;m too lazy to read subtitles, but because it&rsquo;s easier to &quot;get into&quot; the episode when you listen and understand the emotion, instead of reading subtitles and a somewhat understanding of japanese emotion in language&hellip;.CharactersYES. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Not only does it exist, but it&rsquo;s believable xD It&rsquo;s just so&hellip; natural how much Yukino and Arima change while being in a relationship with each other. It&rsquo;s also fun to watch how Arima and Yukino interact with other characters. All the characters in kare kano have their own background story that make you fall in love with them. I LOVE characters like Asaba who just brighten the mood with humor in a non crazy way xD Tho I have to admit that a few characters are there for a weak purpose, but for the most part, all the supporting characters have some kind of contributation to the story.EnjoymentI obviously loved Kare Kano, but I would only recommend it to people who LOVE love. If you love watching people fall in love, express their feelings of love, change because of love, go crazy because of love, then you MUST watch Kare Kano. I think the only people who wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy Kare Kano are those who don&rsquo;t really care about love, don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s like to be in love, or have no heart -_-. However, stop around episode 10 or 11 because the anime begins to decline due to low budget x_o;; such a shame&hellip; first ambition is to get the highest test scores, and to become the most admirable girl in school. However, her goals are crushed when she finds that Soichiro Arima is scoring higher scores, is way more talented, better looking, and loved by everyone. The worst part is, he isn&rsquo;t faking it the way Yukino is! Because of this, Yukino holds a grudge against Arima and starts to truly hate him (But whenever she&rsquo;s around him, she &quot;pretends&quot; to be nice).One day, as Yukino and Arima pass in the wallways, Arima goes up to Yukino and confesses to her, saying that he has always loved her. Yukino thinks that Arima is just trying to &quot;trick&quot; her, but in the end, Arima&rsquo;s feelings for Yukino are expressed in a way that can&rsquo;t possibly be a lie. Yukino begins to fall in love with Arima and thus their love blossoms~!StoryI love it i love it i LOVE it. There are so many things about Kare Kano that make the story perfect. I really like high school romances that revolve around ONE main couple and no weird love triangles or squares or whatever&hellip; Because of that, it allows space for the two characters to grow, and the relationship to deepen. The anime lacks in &quot;drama&quot; and just focuses on romance. &quot;Wait&hellip;if there&rsquo;s no drama, wtf is the anime supposed to be about?&quot; Well&hellip; it just goes into the inner thoughts of the characters, basically. But that&rsquo;s what I LOVE about Kare Kano. Omg&hellip;The the anime expresses how the Yukino and Arima are in love with each other in a way that&rsquo;s so believable you can&rsquo;t help but go KYAA~! Well, scratch that. It&rsquo;s more of a deeper feeling than &quot;KYAA&quot;. You just feel this rush of emotions and make you realize why people fall in love with each other, and how much being in love means, etc&hellip; Tho, i can see why people wouldn&rsquo;t like it. I mean&hellip; if you&rsquo;re a boy who has never really been in love before, then Kare kano would be some crap and boring shit that you wouldn&rsquo;t understand&hellip; ah well..What i also love is the humor. The humor in anime made in the 1990&rsquo;s shall always be fresh and funny xD I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t see anime these days that have the same humor D:I have to admit&hellip; towards the middle and end of Kare kano, a lot of new characters are quickly introduced and the focus turns away from Arima and Yukino D: The anime doesn&rsquo;t spend a lot of time with these other characters, and if they have a flash back or inner thoughts it usually lasts like&hellip;one episode. Not enough for one person to interpret or understand :/ This is where the anime starts to decline. Not only that, but there are recaps every 2 or 5 episodes. But none the less, I still enjoyed it.AnimationIt&rsquo;s hard for me to judge the animation&hellip; I mean, this anime was made waaay back in 1998 where anime was in low budget. The animation is defiantly creative in my opinion, even though at some points they&rsquo;re scans from the manga, still scenery, or just still animation in general. But the character design looks a LOT better than other character designs made during that time *cough serial experiments lain&hellip; ah my goddess&hellip; etc&hellip;* the animation is not spectacular but it&rsquo;s definatly not terrible. I would say it&rsquo;s pretty, and bearable :PSoundAgain, it&rsquo;s bearable @_@; At times, the BGM kind of interferes with the moment and most of the BGM is very overused and repetitive. The opening and ending theme songs are kind of addictive, but they&rsquo;re not the best op and eds ever. As for voice acting, I&rsquo;m going to be honest. When it comes to Arima and Yukino, i prefer the english dub. When it comes to all the side characters, i prefer the Japanese dub. But Japanese dub vs English dub&hellip; I much rather prefer english dub. not because i&rsquo;m too lazy to read subtitles, but because it&rsquo;s easier to &quot;get into&quot; the episode when you listen and understand the emotion, instead of reading subtitles and a somewhat understanding of japanese emotion in language&hellip;.CharactersYES. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Not only does it exist, but it&rsquo;s believable xD It&rsquo;s just so&hellip; natural how much Yukino and Arima change while being in a relationship with each other. It&rsquo;s also fun to watch how Arima and Yukino interact with other characters. All the characters in kare kano have their own background story that make you fall in love with them.

And on top of that, it was the first box set too.  I had seen a few episodes on On Demand on my anime selects (when it was free - now you have to pay).  I sat down during the summer and switched on the T.V and my journey began.I kind of yawned at the first episode. There was a few good laughs, but the series didn't seem all that special to me.  In fact, through out the series, it got a little boring at times.  Yes, there would be something going on...in the story, but it just wouldn't be that exciting.  It seemed a slow, easy going anime.  So at first, I thought to $60 I had just spent on this set was a waste.  But then I realized something really special about this anime that I don't think many can do: I could relate moments in the anime to moments in my own life. You really can't do that with a lot of animes since a large portion are mechas, fantasy, and the such.  But here, with Kare Kano, it was a realistic storyline of romance and comedy that I enjoyed. It took a while to get use to, around the fourth or fifth episode I started laughing and relating the moments to my own life.  I started to sing along to the intro music eventually, even cry at times.But speaking of intro music... the composer of Kare Kano's soundtrack, Shiro Sagisu, is the same composer for the ever famous Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Like for the soundtrack of Evangelion, Sagisu used the piano a lot here.  The music did have little variation as far as genre goes - mainly just piano and jazz (a marching song or two was also mixed in), but it was such a  different type of soundtrack than most animes.  Jazzy, calm, it helped show the true colors of Kare Kano, fitting the moods perfectly.  I even bought the soundtrack 2nd CD (could never find the first).  And with the CD, I use it for winding down and work because of it's nice easy going style.  So along with the anime, I recommend getting the soundtrack too.I did start relating some of the characters of Kare Kano to my friends and family.  I'd say &quot;Oh, Yukino reminds me of my smart friend Ashley, who likes praise too&quot;. At one point, I related the pervert Asaba to myself.  Although the main characters of the series were Arima and Miyazawa, every other character had a story to tell.  Some would tell stories of bullying, others of friendship.  There wasn't much character complexity here, which could be viewed as both good and bad depending on your taste (for me it's good).Why didn't this anime make a 10 overall? There were the minor bad parts about the , such as the mentioned snore moments, but the rest was good.  It's amazing what this anime did to me: laugh, cry, dance, sing.  And hey, a 9 out of 10 is not bad at all, so don't let that fool you. I liked this, and I think any person looking for a good comedy romance will too, because this anime is nothing short of a good time. in the story, but it just wouldn't be that exciting.

I don't get why the rating is so low. Maybe it's not the most accurate adaptation, but adaptations don't have to be accurate to be good. Maybe the visual storytelling got a little too crazy and abstract. Maybe there were too many recaps. Maybe the lack of a proper ending bothered some people. Maybe this maybe that. I'll say this: despite all of that (actually it's BECAUSE all of that), this might go down as the best anime I watched this year.

If you want to pick up the manga and read from where the anime ends to continue the story, then it's a great anime and an awesome introduction to the manga.If you want to just watch the anime, be ready for a sudden and abrupt unsatisfying ending.  A lot of the anime has you wonder what will happen and guessing at things, and then in the final episode, not only does it not answer any of your questions, it introduces a LOT of new plot to leave you with even more questions!It's just so odd that...there was never a continuation/sequel/movie even made and the unsatisfying conclusion haunts me still to this day. there was never a continuation/sequel/movie even made and the unsatisfying conclusion haunts me still to this day."", ""If you want a general plot line, my review of the same manga can be found and read. Or just mail me - I'll be more than happy to explain it in detail. :)Yes, the anime had a poor budget which was reflected in the show. Yes, the director quit when the mangaka didn't like the direction the anime was taking and refused to let them do a second season. Yes, it's unfinished.But I can't, and won't, fault this beautiful anime. On three reasons:1. It's the most beautiful, simple story of all time. It doesn't involve; incredulous plotlines; fantasy scenes which, in denial or not,...we know are never going to happen; or stupid sexual tension between two people which resorts the story falling back into over-used cliches to support it.2. The music is phenomenal. A sheer joy to listen to. I cried at certain parts just because of this wonderful score.

Sheer, unadulterated joy to watch."", ""His and Her Circumstances (Kare Kano for short) is a romance anime that provides more of an introspective look into the intricacies and insecurities that come about falling in love. Kare Kano spoke to me on a very personal level, so it is hard to say that someone will like it if they can't relate to the main characters. I'm starting to feel that that may be the case with the romance genre in general. When I can't strongly relate and empathize with the characters, I tend to distance myself from their experiences and the themes seem to have less value. In this review, I...will talk about Kare Kano as an experience. I will discuss my takes on the characters and themes. I will also talk about the convoluted production of the anime and how it affected the storytelling.Characters:If there's one thing in particular that Kare Kano excels in, is its characters. When you first meet every character, you get to only see one side of them to later (or immediately) find out they are much more complicated. This is very reminiscent of what meeting others is actually like. Everyone appears simple at first glance, but the more you get to know someone, the more you find out how truly diverse humans are. Kare Kano might overemphasize this aspect a tad, but it doesn’t feel too forced. Character’s actions when they appear simple are justified even after you find out they’re not so simple. I can’t think of another anime that pulls this idea off so effectively.Another thing I find impressive about the characters is how strong of a personality they have. For 15-year-olds, the characters have a lot of things going on. My high school life was not that complicated. Having said that, it’s not overdone to the point where it feels like the characters are needlessly forced to be complicated for entertainment’s sake. They seem completely realistic with their own sets of insecurities. The fact that they, and other characters, constantly make comments on how busy they are serves to reaffirm this point. I knew a girl in college that was the school president, president of two other clubs, went to school full time, and worked full time. People this busy do exist.Themes:As far as themes go, what impressed me was how accurately naïve the characters are at the beginning. They appropriately don’t understand love or their feelings towards one another. They then fall madly in love. Then they begin to lose their naiveté about love as they mature. This happening in less than a year is slightly unrealistic, but it didn’t bother me much. They’re supposed to be pretty smart anyways. This coming of age portion of Kare Kano, the understanding love part, is done extremely well. I’d argue even more so than the more generic coming of age themes also featured in here about becoming an adult and accepting oneself.The other aspect of the themes that hit home for me happened near the end. The main character Soichiro is very relatable to me. Seeing him struggle with reality was a real eye-opener for me. Sadly, we don’t get to see his resolution because the anime gets canceled. I’ll be reading the manga to find out what he does. This is primarily the reason I liked Kare Kano so much probably, because of how much I was able to empathize with Soichiro.The rest of the characters I honestly could not care about. They were pretty well written, especially Yukino, but they simply didn’t do much for me. I think half of the anime was wasted, but I’ll talk more about that below.Production:The most infamous aspects of Kare Kano are probably the departure of Hideaki Anno and the anime’s cancellation. Hideaki Anno probably carried Kare Kano on his back with his breathtaking directing style. This romance/comedy a lot of the time felt like the masterpiece psychological thriller Evangelion. The fact that I can make that statement goes to speak volumes about the quality of Kare Kano. I knew Hideaki Anno had left the project on episode 14 and that it was canceled on episode 26 so I was fully braced for it. However, when Kazuya Tsurumaki took over, it was extremely seamless. He did an incredible job during the dramatic scenes. He kept the Hideaki Anno feel during those scenes almost intact. He was also a more inventive director and that showed during the comedic scenes. He had incredible shoes to fill and did so well. The only bad part is that he picked up Kare Kano in a phase where it was doing nothing. They spend almost half of the anime trying to spread out all these character arcs and I did not appreciate that at all. I know they were planning on making the anime a lot longer, and it would’ve been tolerable if that was the case. But, it got canceled at 26. Now it feels like a ton of time was wasted. I understand they had to fill in space, and I understand that things can’t always be happening for the same characters all the time, but I still found it stale. No other characters were anywhere near as interesting as the main two. Thus, any camera time spent on anyone else turned out to be inconsequential as only 3-4 of the side characters ended up having any kind of impact on the relationship of the main two characters. Kazuya picked up the anime as this side stuff was just getting started, blunted the majority of it, and then was tasked with dealing with its cancellation.The other part of the production that is very noticeable is how small the budget was. Expect a lot of still images, wanky drawings, recaps, recycling of shots, etc., I mean everything you can think of. Imagine the budget for the last two episodes of Evangelion spread out over an entire anime. Still, this was very masterfully handled by Hideaki Anno. As I said, he carries the anime in its entirety on his back. The directing is simply incredible for its budget.Cancellation:I know most people are left massively disappointed by the ending, and it’s understandable. The cancellation did not do good things for Kare Kano. It left absolutely everything unresolved as gears were turning towards a downhill. Major problems were arising, but we did not get to experience them manifesting or resolving. I don’t think this is a bad thing. I believe it was a perfectly good place to end (outside of episode 25, which was pointless). The end forces us to more carefully think about what will happen to the characters, how they will react to their present situation, and what their future will bring. I don’t think these are bad ending notes for an anime.Ending Thoughts:I think Kare Kano was great. Whether that is a bias towards my love of Evangelion or my uncanny similarity to Soichiro, we will never know. It was just the right mix of being genuinely good while appealing to me personally.

Best romance I've seen to date."", ""In making Kare Kano I sense that Anno set up two rules for himself when directing. The first rule is to never break the flow of dialogue and action on screen except to set up a moment of atmosphere. The second rule is to always try to represent the subjective humanity of the characters as much as possible.I have no idea how much Anno took from the manga since I haven't read it, but from sources it seems as if he chose to retain the elements of the plot and dialogue completely. In that case then it has to be Masami Tsuda's writing ability to...be able to provide Anno with so much psychological insight to work with. Never since Kokoro Connect have I seen characters so brimming with psychology as those in Kare Kano. Toradora only reveals its cards fully at the last emotional arc. Kare Kano goes in all the way, with characters frequently ruminating on the exact scope of their relationships, worrying and analysing different aspects of their life from the very first episode.Indeed Kare Kano is a wholly psychological romance comedy. It posits a method, that this is how people build personas of themselves, this is how group dynamics function, this is how personas are broken, this is how relationships are made. Anno's editing only serves to really emphasize the characterization a thousandfold. Episode 3 is a powerhouse of tempo, almost perfectly blending in the character reveals, the comedy, the confessions and the emotions to a fever pitch of an ending outpour. Drawing from his Evangelion experience, Anno uses deep reds, shadows, silhouettes and voids to accentuate Arima's psychological torment. When he recounts the slap his father gives him you can almost feel the weight of the palm.Something tells me that most of the innovation is derived from budget. KareKano is sort of the precursor to Shaft's erratic style of editing, down to the text across the screen and the sound collage. Yet it is also completely minimalistic. Anno draws back on the art when the moment is not an atmospheric one but he always sees the need to draw very detailed aspect-aspect shots to establish a location. He uses manga art half of the time rather than animate the characters directly but the very nature of his editing makes it okay. In episode 6 (another atmospheric powerhouse) there is a moment derived entirely from manga shots scrolling rightwards. It works because the tempo syncs with the piano soundtrack and perfects the pace of a slow uncovering of memories. If majority of the romcoms out there had the editing capability Anno had, they would not only save on budget but would also be a whole lot more immersive.If you think about it, by eschewing the background altogether for most scenes, or by stripping down the art, there's a greater motivation to express character's purely through psychological landscapes. Kokoro Connect and Toradora bask in the glory of having enough of a budget to draw out all the backgrounds and settings for their characters. Of course not everyone can be like Shinkai and maximize on their Romantic design, but rarely does a director think of stripping back the design until Shaft arrived in the picture.Episode 6 does a kind of dual-ling thing where scenes are repeated but showing the two main characters different viewpoints. Moffat, when he made the television series Coupling, did the same thing in an episode used a split screen to show the aftermath of a breakup. Yet Coupling's main goal, being a comedy, was still the comedic payoff of having dual-misunderstandings and dual-synchronizations of two characters leading disparate lives. In this case though its used in the old Anno-esque fashion, of showing the clash between the misunderstandings of two lives, and the gaps between two hearts trying to get together. While Miyazawa was ruminating on Arima's great personality, Arima was feeling inadequate at Miyazawa's bright nature and questioning the veracity of his own life. As the episode passes and goes through a really melancholic atmosphere of rain and pent-up longing, it eventually culminates in this dual weaving with the method which I outlined above, using the right scrolling manga panels to indicate the joining together of two lives. (For those more interested in getting to know how Anno's camera works, a shot-breakdown of this episode is on the blog)Episode 8's Act 0.5 is another very beautiful vignette, taking place before Arima and Miyazawa got together, dealing with Arima's slow realization of the emptiness of his own life and the development of his love. The whole atmosphere is a cooling down of the comedy-drama pacing that normally occurs. Great shots are developed, with cherry blossoms, haunting monochromes and red dusks. The manga drawing interjections here serve the purpose of ramping up the romantic feel, of having very clear and clean shoujo designs as opposed to the rawer animation, during the moments when Arima idealizes Miyazawa. The dusk scene when the two talk to one another is done with matching shots, and the correct framing to emphasize which parts of the conversation the characters are more invested in (a closeup of Miyazawa's eyes when she inquires about Arima not going to a private school despite having the funds).With all that being said, the main problem is also its main strength, mainly the psychology. Being a romance manga, even with an astounding amount of character insight, and even with Anno's ability to draw moods, there is still the existence of genre conventions. As a result there is the episode with the school trying to interfere between the budding romance of the two, there is the episode with the love rivals and jealous alpha bitches that try to alienate Miyazawa from the rest of the class. Coming from the rich Freudian landscape of Evangelion, coming from the tight characterization of Toradora, Kokoro Connect and the cynical sociology of Yahari Ore No Seishun, it always feels that there's a huge amount of wasted potential. Especially with the knowledge that Anno later drops from the project (since I'm only at episode 11) makes it all the more depressing. Already though KareKano goes a farther way than most of the conventional plots out there by its willingness to delve into introspection rather than falling into the same old genre circles(I'm looking at you Shinbo and Nisekoi).Whatever it is, KareKano is proof that even with the most rigid and overused genre, there is still loads of room to improve and loads of area to explore. It is a documentation of a skilled director plying his trade with a work that is not exactly in his realm of comfort. There's so much information to glean just from even one or two episodes about pacing and creating moods that its a wonder this work did not become more influential. Staleness is one of the great sins of any creator and if a work from about 10 years ago can outshine most of the works now then there's really a problem. be able to provide Anno with so much psychological insight to work with. Never since Kokoro Connect have I seen characters so brimming with psychology as those in Kare Kano. Toradora only reveals its cards fully at the last emotional arc. Kare Kano goes in all the way, with characters frequently ruminating on the exact scope of their relationships, worrying and analysing different aspects of their life from the very first episode.Indeed Kare Kano is a wholly psychological romance comedy. It posits a method, that this is how people build personas of themselves, this is how group dynamics function, this is how personas are broken, this is how relationships are made. Anno's editing only serves to really emphasize the characterization a thousandfold. Episode 3 is a powerhouse of tempo, almost perfectly blending in the character reveals, the comedy, the confessions and the emotions to a fever pitch of an ending outpour. Drawing from his Evangelion experience, Anno uses deep reds, shadows, silhouettes and voids to accentuate Arima's psychological torment. When he recounts the slap his father gives him you can almost feel the weight of the palm.Something tells me that most of the innovation is derived from budget. KareKano is sort of the precursor to Shaft's erratic style of editing, down to the text across the screen and the sound collage. Yet it is also completely minimalistic. Anno draws back on the art when the moment is not an atmospheric one but he always sees the need to draw very detailed aspect-aspect shots to establish a location. He uses manga art half of the time rather than animate the characters directly but the very nature of his editing makes it okay. In episode 6 (another atmospheric powerhouse) there is a moment derived entirely from manga shots scrolling rightwards. It works because the tempo syncs with the piano soundtrack and perfects the pace of a slow uncovering of memories. If majority of the romcoms out there had the editing capability Anno had, they would not only save on budget but would also be a whole lot more immersive.If you think about it, by eschewing the background altogether for most scenes, or by stripping down the art, there's a greater motivation to express character's purely through psychological landscapes. Kokoro Connect and Toradora bask in the glory of having enough of a budget to draw out all the backgrounds and settings for their characters. Of course not everyone can be like Shinkai and maximize on their Romantic design, but rarely does a director think of stripping back the design until Shaft arrived in the picture.Episode 6 does a kind of dual-ling thing where scenes are repeated but showing the two main characters different viewpoints. Moffat, when he made the television series Coupling, did the same thing in an episode used a split screen to show the aftermath of a breakup.

In Kare Kano, the two main characters have spent their whole lives suppressing themselves in an attempt to satisfy the expectations of others. The story really begins when they work together to disregard traditional standards, instead choosing to find their own personalities that had barely been given the chance to grow.Not everything is so dramatic; in fact, comedy makes up a slight majority of the show. The downside is that none of the jokes are funny, because they rely exclusively on a zany feeling...derived from each character's single gimmick. It feels like a series of halfhearted gags that, in normal shows, would have a tenth as great a presence. But then again, Kare Kano's greatest strength is that it defiantly rejects normality.Even the animation is far removed. The creators had absolutely no problems using uncolored sketches and text boxes, to the extent that those things are actually as prevalent as regular animation. Some of it, like a live-action episode featuring cardboard cutouts of the characters, is experimentation. Given how persistent some of the qualities are, however, it's more akin to a new style – one that is being fleshed out alongside the characters. It works especially well since Yukino and Arima are such good characters.Arima is particularly interesting. We're shown enough glimpses of his past to know how he came to be, and enough episodes from his perspective to know how he is, but his intentions are still hard to guess. Despite being a nice guy, there is a profound sense of malice for himself and others that creeps up surprisingly often. It can't be described as evil, but it goes beyond simple insecurity. Yukino has multiple layers as well, but they aren't as serious and in some cases are created deliberately to match Arima's complexity.Unfortunately, none of the character's efforts amount to anything because the story mires in secondary plot threads and recaps. More than that, the series itself ends abruptly at the beginning of a new arc. Maybe it wouldn't have been so distasteful if the supporting characters, who frequently had their own episodes, weren't hyper-boring cliches. They were though, and it shows.I won't be forgetting the good scenes from this anime, but when something spends so much time disappointing it's hard to say I enjoyed it. derived from each character's single gimmick.

Kare Kano takes a spin on what could be a normal/ seen it/ shoujo and makes it into something that I was not expecting.Story: As for the story it has it\'s cliche moments, but as a whole is very unique and pretty powerful for a shoujo. (Ahh this review is making me sound biased against shoujos)Art: People may often judge Kare Kano for its art, and while I am not crazy about it, you have to remember that it is one of the older animes. It also did not get...as much money/hype as a lot of the ""prettier"" animes.Sound: I honestly didn\'t know this show made it to America and was dubbed so I can\'t tell you about that. However, I can tell you that the Japanese version is amazing. The show is a little old and the subs were obviously done a while a go, so the subbing might be a bit sketchy.Character: All the characters in Kare Kano usually are very funny. The two main ones, are definitely the main focus, but they do go into backgrounds of the other characters.Enjoyment: Overall I really liked this anime and I was super-sad to see it end so soon (it was never finished so be warned of the short -abrupt- WTF ending).  I had to read the manga straight after this to see how it ended. I recommend this to all who want a good dramatic love story with some surprises in it. as much money/hype as a lot of the ""prettier"" animes.Sound: I honestly didn\'t know this show made it to America and was dubbed so I can\'t tell you about that.

For a long while, I use to dislike the genre mainly because found the majority of rom-com anime to underwhelming. Many of the rom-com anime that I’ve watched back then barely had any real romance or at the very least had good character chemistry with each other.My negative mindset was left intact until I watched His and Hers Circumstances (Kare Kano) for the first time back in 20114 His and Hers Circumstances was not only the rom-com anime that made like romcom anime again but also the first anime that I ever...reviewed. It had fantastically written characters that all had the purpose of in the plot, the story was well-paced, interesting and entertaining that fully delivered it’s romance aspects. I loved the experimental animation that was used to cover up the obvious low budget and I adored the 1960s style soundtrack.It was a fantastic anime that I love, and I held it in high regard. However, that was 2015 it’s now 2020 and I’ve seen a lot more romcom anime since my first watch of it.Some of them were better than others but finally understood the appeal of the rom-com genre. Naturally, I decided to revisit His and Hers Circumstances just to see if I still hold on high regard and it ultimately did.Right, out of the first scene, the series gives a very strong first impression of our female lead Yukino trying her best to keep her image intact around her classmates by being this perfect high school student. However, while Yukino is being this perfectly high school girl some of her peers and family comment that how she’s not being her self. I liked the commentary because not only it makes the setting feels more alive but it also plays with the show’s themes and narrative which I will talk about in a bit.The social commentary really gets stronger as the series progresses through the first half as thanks to the student gossiping confits and confits keep appearing on the path of the leads. Stuff like one teacher having a strong disagreeing with Yukino and Arima dating during school life, the whole class ignoring Yukino’s after finding she’s a fake idol to a love foil that wants to grab Yukino away from Arima. It makes the school setting of His and Hers Circumstances feels alive That’s not all to this show. The comedy is brilliant and well-directed thanks to the show’s understanding of comedic timing.Every single joke that the anime ditches out perfectly land due to this show’s specular comedic writing. Hardly any joke feels dry or hamfisted to the viewer and comedy has a unique visual direction that made it stand out from most anime of that era. It feels like am watching an old school cartoon straight out from Boomerang.I feel this series and Kodocha has inspired Kaguya Sama Love is War when it comes to comedic timing. For the most part, His and Hers Circumaces is a beautiful narrative experience that has focus.Pacing (excluding the final two episodes and recaps) is very good as the show moved at a steady focus pace with little hiccups. Writing quality ranges from great to near perfection especially in the first.The romance elements in the show were excellent as the main couple keeps on development their love beyond just a kiss status.My favourite episode 11 His and Hers Circumstances happens in episodes 11.Despite being a simple episode on paper the episode perfectly captures Yukino’s character growth as well the themes of friendship and making up from their past mistakes.Since this show was directed by Hidekai Anno the same guy that did Nadia and Evangelion you will naturally expect the same themes of not running away and over your problems to be present and while all the themes from Evangelion were present here I feel the themes were better executed here. I felt the themes had a better sense of direction as it didn’t feel as hamfisted compare to Evangelion.This is not that to say that the thematic execution in Evangelion was bad or anything in facts the thematic execution of Evangelion was brilliant and iconic but I felt like His and Hers Circumstances perfected it. Not only that but the expended them into newer heights that Anno couldn’t achieve in Evangelion. Relating to a person’s flaws and completing each other is the central theme of His and Hers Circumstances. From the couples Yukino and Arima to the friendly duos Yukino and Maho, Arima and Hideaki.What made His and Hers Circumstances truly stand from other rom-com before and ever since is that the main couple engage with sexual intercourse and it’s not hamfisted or anything of the sort it felt with general love. These two have come a long way since their first encounter and seeing them grow so much to a point where they got to do the act was truly satisfying. His and Hers Circumstances basically broke the whole kiss equals love and nothing else barrier.Having the main couple kiss is good and all but I wanted to see the main couple development go beyond a kiss and this is what His and Hers Circumstances and a couple of 90s anime rom-com did.It honestly makes up all the issues that I had with the series which I will talk about now.For a 26 episode series, it spends a good amount of time recapping various events that we see already. It wasn’t that bad in the beginning but it becomes more apparent once you enter the second half especially when the show ran out of budget. Speaking of the second half the ending was unsatisfying.The series just ends leaving various plot threads in the final third open. Not helped by the fact that the mangaka of the series was fed up with Anno for making a series a comedy instead of a serious character drama that the manga was.Yukino could have been easily another generic rom-com heroine where all she does is being dense for the sake of drama. She’s a very realistic and compelling character that grows a lot in the series. The one thing that made Yukino stand out from most romcom leads before is that she’s capable of solving their problems without relying on men. One of my biggest pet peeve of the Shoujo/Romcom genre is that the female heroines more often rely on men to solve their problems. Sure that are expectations like Haruhi, Sana, and to a less extent Misaki but most heroines seemed to rely on men to solve their problems. This alone really breaks the viewer’s emersion as the female lead stops resembling a people as the author starts to use the heroine as a tool for their fantasy.This doesn’t happen with Yukino at all, and it’s perfectly showcased in episode 10 where not only she shut down two of her foils that were screwing around with her new unmasked honest school life she also told Arima and the teacher to stand down and allow herself to handle the problem.This are the stuff I want to see in heroine’s being able to stand up for themself without relying on people. Combined with an adorable personality as hilarious character interactions towards the cast and you got yourself one of the best romcom heroines’s ever made.Arima is one of the most intriguing romcom males I’ve seen. From the minute he started interacting with Yukino to his dark past I knew he was going to an interesting character.That’s all I have to say about Arima without going into heavy spoilers and I don’t want to do that since you should experience his character arc for yourselves but all I can say that’s he’s a fantastically written character that develops beautifully.Maho is a character that had grown on me. When I first watched it I didn’t care for her all that as but as I re-watch this series I started liking her to a point where my second favorite character in the series outside of Yukino. She’s the perfect foil and later on a friend of Yukino.Maho and Yukino bounce each other flawlessly.Tsubasa is also another character that I really enjoyed. She’s filled with personality, loved her two-episode arc in the show that tackles the subject of family issues and she was just a joy to watch especially when she makes funny faces.One other thing that makes His and Hers Circumstances from modern romcoms especially in recent memory is the inclusion of family’s. That’s right the characters in this series have families and there are well-established ones on top of that. From Yukino’s chaotic family to Arima’s cautious family the series feels once again alive. On top of being fascinating characters in their own right they also the centre couple grow and I like their respective parents get along with each other despite them coming from different social backgrounds. The only other two rom-com that I have seen that especially the families of the protagonists is Marmalade Boy and Kodocha. I wish the family element of romcoms would make a return someday because some of these recent romcoms lead need family support.The rest of the characters range from good to great overall as their all aid the main two couple growth in the series.His and Her Circumstances was produced by Gainax. The same studio that gave us the legendary Neon Genesis Evangelion, Gurren Lagann as well other lesser-known works like Nadia The Secret Of Blue Water, Medaka Box and Mahromatic.It was also done by J.C staff who also gave us Toradora, Slayers, Raildex and Revolutionary Girl Utena. Compared to Ganiax previous work Evangelion His and Hers Circumstances didn’t have a good of a budget, to begin with.This is not to say is visually bad tho. Some of the scenes especially the first couple of episodes featured some great looking scenes that are on par with other anime in the 90s. It just that theses not as visually appealing compared to the other anime 90s let alone other anime from Gainax before and after His and Her Circumstances.Despite its low budgets, His and Hers Circumstances has one thing that most animes from 90s lack and that’s direction. Hideaki Anno is a master of handing low budgets and His and Hers Circumstances is no exception. I really adored how visually creative can be from it’s over the top character expressions, the use of live-action footage, the paper cutouts to the various experimental animation which give the series is unique visual flare despite being low budget.The soundtrack was done by the talented Shirou Sagisu the same person who did the soundtracks for Bleach, Kimgure Orange Road and Neon Genesis Evangelion. Needless to say, the soundtrack of His and Hers Circumstances is excellent filled with classical, upbeat, old school, piano 1960s style tracks that enhance the tone of the series. Both the opening and ending themes are memorable and catchy.This may come off as an unpopular opinion to many, but I really adored the Engish Dub for it. Sure the dub is cheesy and showed its age, but I feel it fits the series perfectly. You can tell the dub actors have a blast voicing their characters.Best performances go to Carol Jacobanis as Maho, Lisa Ortiz as Tsubasa and Veronica Taylor as Yukino.It has been over seven years since my first watch of His and Her Circumstances and after re-watching it for the fourth time I can that this show is still just as brilliant as I remembered. The story was a very enraging and well put together romcom tale that had me at the edge of the seat (minus the crappy recap episodes) The characters were very likeable and masterfully written. The visuals despite its low budget were mostly fascinating to watch due to the superb direction by Anno and the animation staff. The soundtrack done by talented Shirou Sagisu was astonishing.His and Hers Circumstances is not only one of my favourite anime romcoms period it’s also the best anime I have seen from Studio Gainax. Yes, I prefer it over Evangelion, despite it also one of my favourites series. Everything that did EVA was executed better here. From the character drama, experimental animation, the soundtrack to the overall direction.I am glad that the series has gained a strong following over the years, despite the author and some manga readers despising the anime. Sure the anime may not be as dramatic heavy as the manga but I feel the anime has what the manga lacks and that’s determination.The anime knew that it was willing to be an incomplete adaptation. It knew that it was going to be various budget restraints by Gainax, It knew that was going to get robbed away from but despite all that, the show never gave up and we end up getting one of the best rom-com ever made. reviewed.

The same studio that gave us the legendary Neon Genesis Evangelion, Gurren Lagann as well other lesser-known works like Nadia The Secret Of Blue Water, Medaka Box and Mahromatic.It was also done by J.C staff who also gave us Toradora, Slayers, Raildex and Revolutionary Girl Utena. Compared to Ganiax previous work Evangelion His and Hers Circumstances didn’t have a good of a budget, to begin with.This is not to say is visually bad tho. Some of the scenes especially the first couple of episodes featured some great looking scenes that are on par with other anime in the 90s. It just that theses not as visually appealing compared to the other anime 90s let alone other anime from Gainax before and after His and Her Circumstances.Despite its low budgets, His and Hers Circumstances has one thing that most animes from 90s lack and that’s direction. Hideaki Anno is a master of handing low budgets and His and Hers Circumstances is no exception. I really adored how visually creative can be from it’s over the top character expressions, the use of live-action footage, the paper cutouts to the various experimental animation which give the series is unique visual flare despite being low budget.The soundtrack was done by the talented Shirou Sagisu the same person who did the soundtracks for Bleach, Kimgure Orange Road and Neon Genesis Evangelion. Needless to say, the soundtrack of His and Hers Circumstances is excellent filled with classical, upbeat, old school, piano 1960s style tracks that enhance the tone of the series. Both the opening and ending themes are memorable and catchy.This may come off as an unpopular opinion to many, but I really adored the Engish Dub for it. Sure the dub is cheesy and showed its age, but I feel it fits the series perfectly. You can tell the dub actors have a blast voicing their characters.Best performances go to Carol Jacobanis as Maho, Lisa Ortiz as Tsubasa and Veronica Taylor as Yukino.It has been over seven years since my first watch of His and Her Circumstances and after re-watching it for the fourth time I can that this show is still just as brilliant as I remembered. The story was a very enraging and well put together romcom tale that had me at the edge of the seat (minus the crappy recap episodes) The characters were very likeable and masterfully written. The visuals despite its low budget were mostly fascinating to watch due to the superb direction by Anno and the animation staff. The soundtrack done by talented Shirou Sagisu was astonishing.His and Hers Circumstances is not only one of my favourite anime romcoms period it’s also the best anime I have seen from Studio Gainax. Yes, I prefer it over Evangelion, despite it also one of my favourites series. Everything that did EVA was executed better here. From the character drama, experimental animation, the soundtrack to the overall direction.I am glad that the series has gained a strong following over the years, despite the author and some manga readers despising the anime. Sure the anime may not be as dramatic heavy as the manga but I feel the anime has what the manga lacks and that’s determination.The anime knew that it was willing to be an incomplete adaptation. It knew that it was going to be various budget restraints by Gainax, It knew that was going to get robbed away from but despite all that, the show never gave up and we end up getting one of the best rom-com ever made.', ""NOTE: This is my first Anime Review!'Kare Kano' - definitely an overlooked and underrated Shoujo series!I couldn't believe that the same studio and director of Neon Genesis Evangelion took part in such a romantic tale. There is no doubt that it exceeded my expectations. I was not disappointed at all for the most part.In a nutshell - it is an oldie but a goodie!THE OPENING: (8/10)Real catchy. It was so 90s and I loved it. It introduced all the characters vividly as you get a rough idea on what the story will be about. As the titles rolled, I immediately caught on to...a certain word that popped up. 'Gainax.' No doubt it gave off Evangelion vibes in not only the opening, but throughout the Anime itself.STORYLINE: (7/10)From the very beginning, the story truly draws away from your stereotypical Shoujo. Most of these kind of genres stick to a repetitive narrative - that being either the boy, or girl is more popular than the other. Kare Kano offers something different to the table. Both characters are popular and are seemingly 'perfect' among their peers. As both Arima and Yukino learn more about each other and 'unmask' their true selves, many themes tie in together.There are times with obvious romantic elements and comedy relief. Other times, there are concepts of sexual intimacy and maturity being explored. There is even, to some degree, aspects of the psychological genre (loneliness and isolation) - which is to be expected coming from the man behind Evangelion. Overall, its quite 'realistic.'CHARACTERS: (7.5/10)The characters were real solid. We get introduced to a good band of individuals, with their own set of personalities and interesting story arcs. There wasn't a character that deemed to be 'annoying' or 'useless.' Each had their own part to play.ANIMATION: (6/10)The animation was 'fine' at best. There were times however, that felt like I was watching a Manga rather than an Anime. Certain scenes didn't quite feel 'intimate' enough as well - especially during a romantic atmosphere. It usually consisted of still images just like the panels of a Manga. Even so, being a 90s Anime, there were parts with great cityscapes and sunrises/sunsets.THE ENDING THEME SONG: (6/10)Not as strong as the opening, but still catchy and rather winsome. Again, we are given Evangelion vibes - this time with the panning of real life buildings and corridors of schools and rooms in Japan. Iti s quite interesting to watch - a fairly unique ending theme.DUB or SUB? (7.5/10)To be honest, both are pretty great in my opinion. There is quite a significant difference however. Ideally the Sub expressed characters as sounding more 'lighthearted' and 'young' in comparison to the English version. The Dub cast provided more 'mature' voices. In fact, Arima came across to be quite 'deep' and 'sexy.'Personally, I liked the DUB.OVERALL: (8/10)Give this series a go! Its a great breath of fresh air from the typical Shoujo Anime being released today (despite its launch in 1998). Kare Kano represents what a Shoujo series can be. It handles certain relationships and direction of plot in both a delicate and mature manner.ADDITIONAL NOTES:- The ending wasn't very satisfying.- There are a few episodes that contain fillers or recaps.- Kare Kano supposedly ends half way through episode 24. The remaining two and a half episodes drifted away form the story. (Budget?)- It contains 'Josei' elements.- I suggest to read the Manga, as it fills in the gaps substantially. a certain word that popped up. 'Gainax.'

The show chronicles the blossoming relationship between high school students Yukino Miyazawa and Soichiro Arima as they navigate the challenges and joys of falling in love.One of the most striking qualities of Kare Kano is its deft subversion of conventional romantic tropes. The series eschews the traditional notion of a dominant male lead in favor of a more egalitarian approach that gives equal weight to the perspectives of both Yukino and Soichiro. Additionally, the show deftly explores themes of...self-discovery and identity in a manner that feels both authentic and resonant.The animation in Kare Kano is a true feast for the eyes. The character designs are both evocative and idiosyncratic, while the use of diverse animation techniques such as manga panels and live-action footage adds an element of delightful surprise to the viewing experience. The soundtrack is equally noteworthy, featuring a mix of classical music and original compositions that perfectly captures the show's tone.Kare Kano's characters are another highlight of the series. Yukino and Soichiro are depicted as fully fleshed-out individuals with their own unique quirks and flaws that render them all the more relatable. Supporting characters such as Yukino's siblings and Soichiro's childhood friend likewise contribute to the richness and depth of the story.One of the few drawbacks of Kare Kano is its pacing. While the first half of the series is compelling and well-executed, the latter half can feel hurried and underdeveloped. Nevertheless, the show manages to deliver a satisfying conclusion that provides closure to its various narrative threads.In conclusion, Kare Kano is an outstanding romantic anime that is well worth the watch. Its nuanced portrayal of the evolution of a relationship, breathtaking animation and soundtrack, and fully-realized characters make it a standout in the genre. Despite some issues with pacing, Kare Kano remains a must-watch for fans of romantic anime who crave an emotionally rich and resonant viewing experience. self-discovery and identity in a manner that feels both authentic and resonant.The animation in Kare Kano is a true feast for the eyes.

This is a good thing to implement in the story on account of most romances that tend to be dragging their story as much as they can. also, its not like being in a relationship cant develop the romance between characters. Being a couple can develop their romance even further since your partner is...the one you are most close to and overcoming trials and turbulence with each other would surely strengthen their bond. besides yukino and arima, there are other compelling character relationships, but most of them are likeable and relatable because of their flaws and the difficult circumstances or situations they are put in that we as an audience can empathise ourselves in fact of how real they seem.The anime ending felt abrupt and rushed but the start of the anime was really good and anno hideakis chaotic directing, extensive portrayal of characters thought and emotions and heaps of symbolism seems to fit quite well with the series in spite of being a slice of life romance. unfortunately, the studio was running out of budget and the mangaka wanted it cancelled because it was veering off from the tone the manga had. you can also see a alot of effort was put in to the opening it looked really great the ending however were just live action shots of a school or something idk i skipped it.I would highly reccomend this to people who are infatuated with character driven stories and shoujo romance fans. the one you are most close to and overcoming trials and turbulence with each other would surely strengthen their bond. besides yukino and arima, there are other compelling character relationships, but most of them are likeable and relatable because of their flaws and the difficult circumstances or situations they are put in that we as an audience can empathise ourselves in fact of how real they seem.The anime ending felt abrupt and rushed but the start of the anime was really good and anno hideakis chaotic directing, extensive portrayal of characters thought and emotions and heaps of symbolism seems to fit quite well with the series in spite of being a slice of life romance. unfortunately, the studio was running out of budget and the mangaka wanted it cancelled because it was veering off from the tone the manga had. you can also see a alot of effort was put in to the opening it looked really great the ending however were just live action shots of a school or something idk i skipped it.I would highly reccomend this to people who are infatuated with character driven stories and shoujo romance fans.', ""Kare Kano is definitely the most enjoyable romantic comedy anime ever made. It is a anime adaptation of the first 7 volumes of Kare Kano manga series (which is 21 volumes long). The anime mostly follow the manga fauthfully but with changes like focuses more on humor compared to dramatic and psychological aspect of the manga. Bcuz of this the mangaka and anime director quarrel with each other and the anime was eventually cancelled as also Gainax run out of budget during the last few eps which followed the most frustrating and worst ending ever. Bcuz the last few eps building up a long story...arc but the anime ends in the beginning. But despite all this problems Kare Kano is one of the best and different rom-com anime.Story- The story is about Yukino Miyazawa is sweet, intelligent girl who is popular, always gets first in class and praised by everyone. But in home she is different person who tried very hard to get praised. But in highschool she gets beaten by her rival Souchiro Arima who is also perfect like Yukino (also likes her). One day unfortunately Yukino's ture self get discovered by Souchiro. As Yukino also discovered Souchiro's secret and understand each other. The two become friends, then become more than friends less lovers and eventually lovers. As their relationship progresses they have to overcome lot of obstacles but their love for each other become also stronger.Art- The artstyle is probably most unique aspect of the anime. The use of cartoon effects and paint, live action footages as well as straight out manga panels. The first 18 eps are mostly okay with this but as gainax run out of budget starting with ep 19 which don't have any animation and then eps 20-24 are decent and the last ep don't have any Animation at all just manga images. But it is still great.Sound- The music is also really great suit the overall atmosphere. The op is good and the ed is really unique which uses different kinds of places of real life footage.Character- The characters are the highest plus point of this series. Yukino Miyazawa is great and enjoyable female character. Souchiro Arima seems mysterious at first but we get to learn more about him. Asaba (who is friend of Yukino & Souchiro) is funny character. There are also other great characters like Tsubasa and her friend,  Maho.Enjoyment- I really enjoyed this anime a lot from the very beginning. It is one of the unique romcom ever made. I also like Arima's psychological aspects (which is explored more in manga). I love this show. But felt frustrated in the abrupt ending.Overall- I really think Kare Kano is best romcom. But could've been better if it adapt more of the manga (as the manga goes deeper into character relations with a satisfying ending). After the frustrating I read the entire Kare Kano manga and I am glad I did it. I recommend both anime & manga of Kare Kano. Believe me it is really great experience.Rating- 9/10 arc but the anime ends in the beginning.

Believe me it is really great experience.Rating- 9/10"", ""So let me begin this by saying that YOU people should go read the manga either after you see the anime or instead of watching the anime. Why? I shall explain:First up, the art was quite nice and had some very detailed scenes, some of which I would expect to be used in movies. Now, that was the first half of the anime. Towards the end, I am guessing due to lack of money, they started making some crazy alterations. One episode was composed purely of paper puppets which ruined the major plot points depicted in that episode. Sheesh, first they get you excited but...then they deceive you!Sound was very fitting in this anime, probably the best aspect. They chose appropriate music for the most fitting situations. Even the end song sort of depicted that cute love the main characters share!Which brings me to the characters. Now I'm not going to lie, but a few of these figures are definitely one of those over used personalities. BUT the great thing about this anime was that they altered the personalities and created something new. I tell ya, I was definitely surprised by some of the actions the protagonist did. Also, for once the girl isn't a complete moron. She reminds me a bit of that girl in 'Special A' which is a huge breather seeing as one can only get enough of such characters. Still, this protagonist has a bit of flavor too and an interesting family to the boot. Although her lover is just that nice fellow you see in EVERY anime. The thing that made me love the manga more was because in the manga the male character is shown in a different light with a more colorful background! He isn't as 'hidden' as he is in the anime.Ok ok now the story. Hmmmm oh the story. It was an interesting plot but the anime rushed it and actually ruined some of the most crucial points in the story. This is why I went to the manga because it satiates a viewer's thirst to understand the plot. Ya, I would suggest watching another anime, but if you have the time, give this one a shot, and go to the manga when you're done.Overall, it was enjoyable the first few episodes and it could have become something spectacular, but alas the lack of money ruined it.If you see this anime, I must tell you, I am forever scarred by the cut in nerd head they added in a few episodes. Creep. then they deceive you!Sound was very fitting in this anime, probably the best aspect. They chose appropriate music for the most fitting situations.

Creep."", 'Yukino is like your average teenager in our times, wanting to be accepted and will do anything to be admired.. except her ways are more extreme.Arima is the same thing, except his ways are more for his family not for him. Like they say in the anime, Yukino is the ""Queen of Vanity"", selfish in every way.Love is unexpected, as one can imagine. One moment, you are hating this person so badly that you want to kill them, but then... all of the sudden, you see them in a different light. You start wanting to know them... to be friends with them... to love them....This is exactly what happened to Yukino.This anime is the best I have seen, next to my favorites. It does not start like your mary sue of shojo animes... Example: Girl meets boy for first time and is head over heels in love with this guy... or in comedy animes, guy always falls in girls breasts...The comedy and shojo is true in this anime or unique. The relationship of the main characters start normal... kinda. They don\'t like each other that much, but later they become friends... then they like each other and they fall in love, like in real life. The comedy is hilarious, I cracked up so much with Yukino\'s ways and the other characters, especially her family.That\'s is what else that made this anime unique. It\'s not just about the main character\'s development and their lives, its about the other characters. Every episode went and showed everyone and their lives. The family, the mom and dad\'s relationship, Yukino\'s new friends and even went in their minds and saw their psychological being.The art of this show was amazing. The creators had to do what they needed to save the budget of the show. ( it wasn\'t going well, so they did whatever they could). Which I think, made it go well. Every episode was like a surprise, a present. I didn\'t know who I would be watching about and how the art would look like. Some of the episodes I liked was when the show was all in cut out or looked real life-ish. It was unique and well made.The music, was good. I like the ending and opening music. Lyrics went well with the plot and characters.All in all.. This anime is what you should watch if you want to see a good comedy Romance show. I actually liked it so much, I went and read the rest of the manga, which I\'m sure is what the creators of the show wanted to happen. I wanted to know what happened to them after the last episode. What happened to not just them, but the other characters.Was I happy about this show? Hell yeah. . I liked it that much that if they made a movie or another season ( I wish!) I will watch it. xDSo my verdict? WATCH IT!  I know you will love it. :3Rating:Story: 9 ( Didn\'t like how it ended abrutly... but still awesome! :3)Art: 10Sound: 10Character: 10Enjoyment: 10Overall: 10!

KAREKANO IS NOT LIKE THAT.What I like best about this show, is that the story isn't about what and how the characters do, but instead, its about WHAT THEY THINK, FEEL, AND ARE, while they're living their lives. Each character is unique, and most are thoroughly developed. You get deep into their hearts and...as INTIMATE as humanly possible with them. The intimacy that you share, knowing what they feel in depth, takes you much closer to them, than in any other anime you'll see of the genre.And the ever impressive soundtrack of the whole anime is to die for! If you get your hands on it like I did, you'll realize that the great majority of it is orchestral work. No synth crap! Orchestral! Real instruments, bringing out the best that a soundtrack can have. Plus, the fact that even one song has many versions adequated for each situation of the character.For n&ordm;1 FAVE ANIME ever since I saw it, BANZAI! as INTIMATE as humanly possible with them.

The answer is No (a good part of the time) I do not want to say that it does not go into deeper things, of course that does not make it bad in itself, every story can not be original since each one has an influence of another has a "" Antecedent"", then the concept of ""originality"" becomes a fallacy, what is sought from a story is how it is presented.A good execution and presentation of it is what can make the others unique, where the same formula can not necessarily be bad and can even be fresh if you know how to handle it properly.From there we will talk about the 3 things that most stand out to Karekano of most of the Shojos:Animation.I think the most visible and remarkable of the whole series, Gainax hand in hand with Hideaki Anno does an excellent job directing and producing. The animation itself is bad (even for the time), but the cool is how he uses the planes, the outline, his way of telling the story through cuts of manga, crayon drawings, let`s go until there is a complete episode where the Most of the time it is cardboard, and more than looking bad and ridiculous it feels fresh, putting emphasis on the darkness and / or light at the appropriate moments, giving us a feeling that we are truly inside the mind of that character, where It combines very well with another element that makes the atmosphere feel Music.Sound.The opening and Ending are very entertaining and catchy coming to remove them only a couple of times.The Seiyus of this work did a very good job of giving the voice of their characters, where each one (or the majority) fits their role, but I can not talk about it anymore because of my lack of experience in Dubbing.But if something highlights Karekano is the combination of that Extravagant animation with an exemplary Soundtrack, by the hand of Shirō Sagisu (the same from Evangelion), here he returns to do another excellent work, giving us a soundtrack that sticks very well with the greatest part of the series, where I want to highlight here the piano melodies.Character.The 3 strong aspect, but of the 3 the weakest, I explain, there is a good development of characters in the protagonists being Arima the one that more depth concerns, but Miyazawa does not notice a change or a progression in itself, after change and let out your inner self there is no change, evolution, depth as if you have Arima, and this does not mean that it is bad, only that your personality after that jump to the real self does not seem to follow a more mature evolution and the consequences of said change so marked, as if we see with Arima.But here we go with the worst: Tsubasa Shibahime Why? Basically I do not change anything, after those chapters where she gives herself to understand that she does not want to lose her father, she knows her stepbrother and finally accepts the fate that awaits her after an introspection of herself, we see her as before after those episodes (although with less prominence), is still a girl, the other characters do not appear, an argument out of nothing that leads to nothing is something I can not tolerate.The others, the one I like the most apart from the protagonists, is the short but good story of Miyazawa`s parents, where we come to understand several things about them 2 and unlike above, if there is anything, know their personality, and of course how they met.One thing that, if I see different from this Shojo compared to others, that the others are not a tool to improve the love relationship of the protagonists, but that they are Characters each with their side and where they do little (except Shibahime in a few episodes) ) to face that relationship, being that a relation of 2, where we see sharing his first kiss until his First Time.Conclusion.It became my favorite Shojo (although it is not that I have seen many), mostly because of that extravagant way of seeing it, and the psychological aspect of the characters, pity that due to disagreements of the Studio with the Mangaka we have an unfinished ending, opening new questions and where open that go to the Manga to answer them, like What happened to Arima? And where did Takefumi Tonami arrive? , but I value this work beyond that final cut and other very visible problems, I value it for its style, passion and above all Heart that shows that they put the work, not being carried away by the Industry and tried to create something fresh in an industry that every day more sinks into mediocrity.----------------------------- Español --------------------------------------------------Es algo muy peculiar en el anime, encontrarse una obra como esta, donde gracias a una excelente dirección, así como una empresa (Gainax) intentando ser algo diferente con algo, en algo por así decirlo “Ordinario” en él Anime.Primero Reflexionemos.Este es un Shojo y no hay mucho que decir acerca de un Shojo básicamente es :  Una Mujer [ inserte si es popular-inteligente-bella o no ]  conoce un chico [Que le irrita o esta perdidamente enamorada de él y no olvidar que casi siempre es el mejor o más popular de la clase ] y con el paso del tiempo se van conociendo , van pasando obstáculos [ Ponga Mujer celosa , amigos queriendo separarlos etc ] y ya superado todo esos obstáculos  su Amor llega a un puto máximo,  como si de  un cuento Shonen se tratase  donde al final de la obra el protagonista llega al máximo de su poder y ya nadie puede vencerlo y, Final Feliz.Con esa Reflexión ¿se supone que Karekano sale de ese camino ya preestablecido? La respuesta es No (buena parte del tiempo) no quiero decir que no se salga a meter cosas más profundas, claro eso no lo vuelve malo en sí, toda historia no puede ser original ya que cada cual tiene una influencia de otra tiene un “Antecedente”, entonces el concepto de “originalidad” se convierte en una falacia, lo que se busca de una historia es como se presenta. Una buena ejecución y presentación de la misma es lo que puede hacer única a las demás, donde una misma fórmula no necesariamente puede ser mala y hasta puede ser fresca si se sabe manejar como es debido.De ahí vamos a hablar de las 3 cosas que más destacan a Karekano de la mayoría de los Shojos:Animación.Creo que la mas visible y destacable de todo la serie, Gainax de la mano de Hideaki Anno hace un trabajo excelente dirigiendo y produciendo. La animación en si es mala (incluso para la época) , pero lo fresco es como usa los planos , el contorno , su forma de contar la historia a través de recortes del manga, dibujos a crayón, vamos hasta hay un episodio completo donde la mayor parte del tiempo es cartón, y mas que parecer malo y ridículo se siente fresco , poniendo énfasis en la oscuridad y/o luz en los momentos apropiados , dándonos una sensación de que estamos verdaderamente dentro de la mente de dicho personaje , donde además se combina muy bien con otro elemento que hace que se sienta el ambiente La Música.Música.Los opening y Ending son muy entretenidos y pegadizos llegando a quitarlos solo un par de veces.las Seiyus de esta obra hicieron muy buen trabajo dando la voz de sus personajes, donde cada una (o la mayoría) se adecua a su papel, pero no puedo hablar mas del tema por mi falta de experiencia en el Doblaje.Pero si algo destaca a Karekano es la combinación de esa animación Extravagante con una Banda Sonora ejemplar, de la mano de Shirō Sagisu (el mismo de Evangelion) , aquí vuelve hacer otro excelente trabajo, dándonos una Banda Sonora que pega muy bien con la mayor parte de la serie, donde quiero resaltar aquí las melodías de piano.Personajes.El 3 aspecto fuerte, pero de los 3 el más débil , me explico, hay un buen desarrollo de personajes en los protagonistas siendo Arima el que más profundidad atañe , pero Miyazawa no se le nota un cambio o una progresión en sí misma , después de cambiar  y dejar salir su yo interior no hay cambio , evolución, profundidad como si tiene Arima, y esto no quiero decir que sea  malo , solo que su personalidad después de ese salto al yo verdadero no parece seguir una evolución mas madura y las consecuencias de dicho cambio  tan marcadas  , como si vemos con Arima .Pero aquí vamos lo con lo peor: Tsubasa Shibahime ¿Por qué? Básicamente no cambio nada, después de esos capítulos donde ella se da entender que no quiere perder a su padre, conoce a su hermanastro y acepta por fin el destino que le depara después de una introspección de si misma, la vemos igual que antes después de esos episodios (aunque con menos protagonismo), sigue siendo una niña, los otros personajes ni aparecen, un argumento salido de la nada que no lleva a nada es algo que no puedo tolerar.Los otros, el que más me gusto aparte de los protagonistas, es la corta pero buena historia de los padres de Miyazawa , donde llegamos a entender varias cosas de ellos 2 y a diferencia de arriba , si llega a algo , conocer su personalidad , y por supuesto de cómo se conocieron y casaron.Una cosa que si veo diferente de este Shojo comparado a los demás, que los otros no son una herramienta para mejorar la relación amorosa de los protagonistas, sino que son Personajes cada uno con su lado y donde hacen poco (excepto Shibahime en pocos episodios) para enfrentar esa relación, siendo esa una relación de 2 ,donde vemos compartir su primer beso hasta su Primera Vez.Conclusión.Se convirtió en mi Shojo favorito (aunque no es que haya visto muchos), más que nada por esa forma extravagante de verlo, y el aspecto psicológico de los personajes, lástima que por desacuerdos del Estudio con la Mangaka tengamos un final inconcluso, abriendo nuevas preguntas y donde abra que ir al Manga para responderlas, como ¿Qué le paso a Arima? Y ¿A dónde llego Takefumi Tonami? , pero yo valoro esta obra mas de allá de ese cortado final y otros problemas muy visibles, la valoro por su estilo, pasión y sobre todo Corazón que se nota que le pusieron a la obra, no dejándose llevar por la Industria y intentado crear algo fresco en una industria que cada día más se hunde en la mediocridad. they get to know each other, they go through obstacles [Put a jealous woman, friends wanting to separate them, etc. ] and overcome all these obstacles his Love reaches a maximum fucking, as if it were a story Shonen where at the end of the play the protagonist reaches the maximum of his power and no one can beat him, and Happy End.With that Reflection, is Karekano supposed to go out of that way already pre-established?

Kare Kano actually revealed us the life that these type of people have. A lot of us might have thought what could people like this think about or do they even have a problems in life cause they seems perfect . But little did we know they have their worries and problems. As for Yukino , she was indeed a great role model for the entire school , she's smart ,hardworking , dependable just the know it all girl . Same goes with Souichirou . Effortlessly smart , and...the only person who can compete with Yukino. Kare Kano has create a world of these people where we can see their struggle .Souichirou  and Yukino is perfect for each other , they need each other .

For someone as nearly has it all like Yukino and Souichirou , there's still something missing . I understand Yukino and Arima worries and problems and i was amazed by they way they hold on to each other . It shows that we only look at that one person once we found the right one. This is why i love this show. Kare Kano was a great shoujo anime . I dont want to spoiled anything but if ur considering to give this show a try , just go for it.

I'm just asking you to hear me out!An unpopular opinion, this anime is SO underrated by the romance anime community. It's your typical high school rom-com, cute moments type anime. I would never call this a masterpiece but, if you ever got nothing to watch then, slap on this 26 ep fun comedy.The characters are lovable and it's just the right amount of comedy. ;)Say whatever you want - I did watch this in dubbed rather than subbed by...the way... the way..."", 'I was hesitant to watch this at first but i dont regret it, sort of. The first episode doesnt grab you immediately but a few episodes in i was loving it. Until about halfway through..... i dont know what happened but the episodes got confusing and were often more like a manga than an anime made the show terrible towards the end. Dont get me wrong, i love reading well written manga but an anime isnt supposed to be a manga with limited animation trying to be an anime, and a poorly done job at that. The ending was terrible (especially the last episode) and...it left it on a half cliffhanger with so much more important stuff left to happen between ALL the characters but especially the main 2. I loved the story and the characters though, and if the production of the anime was better then i would have LOVED to see the whole manga as anime.In conclusion it is worth a watch (at least the first half) so long as you are willing to read the manga afterwards.

Because of this, a lot of shows seem to have blended together in my mind, indistinguishable. This is especially the case for the many run-of-the-mill romantic comedies out there, revolving around misunderstandings that never let the feelings amount to anything. Yes, I'm looking at you, School Rumble.However, this was not the case for Kare Kano. I guess this is why it managed to not only get my attention, but also engrave itself in my memory.It is so different from all the other slice of (school) life anime I've been...watching that I cannot even think of anything to compare it to. I would not call Kare Kano realistic, but it definitely managed to touch me, taking me back to my own high school life. If there is one show out there which can entice nostalgia in anyone, it is definitely this one.Of course, this is an anime created over ten years ago. The artwork is very typical of that period en the image quality bears witness to its age. At a time where everyone has grown used to KyoAni, it is almost like taking a leap back in time. However, the story is so addictive that you will not even be bothered by this.There is also a significant difference in styles within the show. Comedy sequences are clearly animated differently from romantic or dramatic moments. Especially some of the last episodes are a good example of this. This spices things up as well and keeps everything interesting to the eye.The voice actors all seemed to fit the characters very much. However, the music is a bit unimaginative and the theme continuously played throughout the series can become slightly dull to the audio-sensitive people out there.Of course, that leaves the actual story. As I've said before, this was a story that manages to suck you in. There's romance, there's comedy and most importantly: there's progress. The main couple does not tread water when it comes to their relationship -- they grow closer, both physically and spiritually. It pleases me to watch their bond grow.The characters are flawed, but also likeable because of this. Not to mention the connections between them all are weaved like a skilful web.As wonderful as I found the anime, there is still one problem that is hard to overlook: the ending of the show. Due to the author of the manga being dissatisfied with the way it was conceptualised into animation (with too much focus on comedy and too little on romance), the ending is very abrupt and leaves many ends untied. The show was not renewed for a second season and it sort of leaves you hanging, begging for more.When I finished watching, I immediately went through all the manga volumes in one very long night. I don't know whether it was the fatigue or the huge emotional bomb this series has dropped on me, but by the time it was all over I couldn't help but shed some tears.I sort of wish it didn't have to end... But a main part of the show is the concept of growing up. The characters all realise they cannot be high school students forever and this melancholy is what makes them so lifelike.This is definitely something I would recommend. However, perhaps it would be more advisable to skip the anime and read the manga right away. It all depends on whatever floats your boat. watching that I cannot even think of anything to compare it to.

The only time they did move was when they were in chibi mode or when they didnt need to move as much. The last episode was  especially bad. It was just images from the manga itself.Sound-The sound wasn't anything special, the same songs used over and over again. Voice actors were good.Really I had no idea how they were gonna end the anime when the manga was 23 volumes long....In the end you never get to see the play and it just ends with Tonami realizing he was in love with Sakura. what a terrible ending. Maybe they didnt have enough money I dont know but you shoud defenetly not watch this anime and just read the manga. You'll regret watching this. In the end you never get to see the play and it just ends with Tonami realizing he was in love with Sakura. what a terrible ending. Maybe they didnt have enough money I dont know but you shoud defenetly not watch this anime and just read the manga. You'll regret watching this."", ""Story:I was surprised by the story line. It made me realize how much people really do put on a face for others when they leave their house. When the characters decided to reveal their true selves they gradually had to go through the change like anyone would  in real life. Though the characters had to go through the change, they came to find out anyone could accept them for who they are, even though they aren't perfect like they played out to be. It was a growing experience.Art:It was typical art. I did enjoyed the mixed mediums of anime, manga, and life shots,...but it got annoying when some episodes were primarily manga style or with many life shots (What I define as a life shot is pictures or video clips that are real life scenes). The change in character kind took me by surprise artistically. I only realized half way through the series that the main character, Yukino, seemed to change a bit physically. She started to wear her hair differently, her posture was different, even  dressed differently. Though I didn't notice this straight away, it could have been from my lack of an attention span.Sound:I did like the music of the series. There were many times where I would be sitting at my desk working and realize that the music going through my head was actually the songs from Kare Kano. I guess you can say after listening to it for a while the music can become addictive at least in my case. Nothing really special, but it's still good music.Character:The characters were good. The Main characters would get the rank of 8 because of how complex they were, but they weren't realistic. Though they proved themselves to be human and some had reasons to be 'perfect' no one can attempt to be that perfect and succeed at it. I've known people who've tried to be perfect for attention and to get approval from their family, it has NEVER worked out. Supporting characters didn't have a very solid background either, though they WERE entertaining (AKA Asaba).Enjoyment:Though I loved the series, mainly the story line, there were some rather annoying episodes. There were episodes that were hard to understand, especially some of the later episodes. Episode 25 was, in my opinion, a useless episode, it pertained NOTHING to the story, and it wouldn't have been so bad if it was shown earlier in the series, but it was the second to last episode. I understand that there was probably budget cuts and that's what  ended the series really weirdly. The final episode was quite a disappointment though. It was very abstract and it seemed like it left you to figure out what happened. There were many started stories that seemed to be left un-finished and thrown in at the last second to give you an quick conclusion. It was also weird because episode 23 felt like it was the final episode how the characters talked and everything was kind of built up. I just think if they didn't have to end it when they did, this series could have been even better.Overall:From this series, I discovered that anyone can be accepted even though they aren't perfect and I too decided to throw away my mask. So from this series, it's not only for entertainment, it can also provide a learning experience. The message of this series is to be yourself and never think that one needs to be perfect to be happy. Perfection is selfishness and love is true happiness and because of that love is not perfect. but it got annoying when some episodes were primarily manga style or with many life shots (What I define as a life shot is pictures or video clips that are real life scenes). The change in character kind took me by surprise artistically. I only realized half way through the series that the main character, Yukino, seemed to change a bit physically. She started to wear her hair differently, her posture was different, even  dressed differently. Though I didn't notice this straight away, it could have been from my lack of an attention span.Sound:I did like the music of the series. There were many times where I would be sitting at my desk working and realize that the music going through my head was actually the songs from Kare Kano. I guess you can say after listening to it for a while the music can become addictive at least in my case. Nothing really special, but it's still good music.Character:The characters were good. The Main characters would get the rank of 8 because of how complex they were, but they weren't realistic. Though they proved themselves to be human and some had reasons to be 'perfect' no one can attempt to be that perfect and succeed at it. I've known people who've tried to be perfect for attention and to get approval from their family, it has NEVER worked out. Supporting characters didn't have a very solid background either, though they WERE entertaining (AKA Asaba).Enjoyment:Though I loved the series, mainly the story line, there were some rather annoying episodes. There were episodes that were hard to understand, especially some of the later episodes. Episode 25 was, in my opinion, a useless episode, it pertained NOTHING to the story, and it wouldn't have been so bad if it was shown earlier in the series, but it was the second to last episode. I understand that there was probably budget cuts and that's what  ended the series really weirdly. The final episode was quite a disappointment though. It was very abstract and it seemed like it left you to figure out what happened. There were many started stories that seemed to be left un-finished and thrown in at the last second to give you an quick conclusion. It was also weird because episode 23 felt like it was the final episode how the characters talked and everything was kind of built up. I just think if they didn't have to end it when they did, this series could have been even better.Overall:From this series, I discovered that anyone can be accepted even though they aren't perfect and I too decided to throw away my mask.

Their voice is nothing special, but the first two verses and the chorus tell a deeply relatable, at times heartwarming and at times heartwrenching story... then on the third verse the singer stumbles for a bit and ends up having to repeat the second verse, and on the final verse the entire tune changes and is distorted until it's unrecognizable.

The strongest point of this anime is it\'s characters, they don\'t follow tropes and all have very unique personalities. The MC Yukino is an incredibly vain high school girl who feeds off the praise of her peers. She wears a ""mask"" at school and hides her true personality with kindness and humility, she\'s at the top of her class and is looked upon by the faculty and students as a model student. Arima is in a similar situation where he hides his true...personality, but not just at school, he hides it from his family and even from himself. When Yukino and Arima start going out they change as people for the better. And that\'s one of the reasons I love this anime, the MCs\' start going out not even half way through the series, and the entire show is about their relationship between themselves and their friends grow. I\'ll repeat that I love that the supporting characters don\'t follow modern anime tropes; there\'s no tsundere or loli, they\'re all unique and have interesting backstories. It\'s too bad we don\'t get to see many of their characters develop through the show since in Hideaki\'s fashion the show ran out of budget. The show even ended partway through a story arc. You can see that in some scenes they\'d severely cut the animation quality, it got bad enough to a point where one episode was animated purely with paper puppets. The background crowds were just left uncolored, there are a lot of examples of budget cuts throughout the show but in some cases I felt that it helped create a unique style that focused solely on the characters. One of my favorite things about the anime is the use of the opening song throughout the show as its\' soundtrack. The instruments would change, the tempo and the key would as well. It was really interesting seeing one song be used to set so many different moods in the show. In the end this is one of my favorite anime of all time, probably my favorite shojou. It\'s just too bad it got cut short and ran into budget issues.

It could even be an anime you quite enjoy, but you know that if there was less of one thing and/or more of another, it could be even better. The proof is that you\'ve read the manga for it, and you enjoyed it enough for you to watch the anime before you realize what the thing holding it back was. Such is the case for Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou (Kare Kano for short), or His and Her Circumstances in English; I couldn\'t praise the manga enough for its deep story and character development,...but although it\'s also there in the anime, I found myself complimenting the shortness of the budget (in a sarcastic way, of course) more than that.In case you don\'t know what Kare Kano is, it follows a girl named Yukino Miyazawa, who is seen by her classmates as a perfect model student but is actually a ""queen of vanity"", desperate for the praise of her peers. However, upon starting high school, she gets one-upped by a classmate named Souichirou Arima....and needless to say, she does NOT take this well at all. As if that\'s not bad enough, however, Yukino\'s secret gets discovered....by Souichirou, of all people! As it turns out, Souichirou isn\'t as perfect as he seems to be, and from here, the two of them end up becoming friends. Eventually, they fall in love and begin a relationship, and this series then follows them in their lives as a couple, where they strive to remove their respective masks.The story of Kare Kano was very good. Of course, some of the comedic scenes were stretched out for longer than necessary, the recaps were slightly annoying, and the anime doesn\'t pick a good spot in the manga to end at; however, the anime kept a lot of important plot points, and I enjoyed seeing them. I also enjoyed seeing the characters again; although I feel that their actions and interactions with other characters had more of a comedic feel to it, they still felt like actual human beings rather than just tools for getting laughter out of us, and they got a decent amount of development. I still found myself liking Yukino and Souichirou\'s relationship; it\'s still a very ideal relationship, with the two of them genuinely caring for each other and making each other better people. Accompanying the good story and great characters is a rather impressive musical score; the opening and ending themes (""Tenshi no Yubikiri"" by Mai Fukuda and ""Yume no Naka e"" by Atsuko Enomoto and Chihiro Yuzuki) were songs that I really wouldn\'t mind listening to again and again. Finally, the voice acting was surprisingly good; Veronica Taylor did a good job at portraying Yukino\'s character, among others with other roles in the anime.Okay, now, time to get the one thing holding this anime back out of the way: the animation. At first, it seems like despite this anime\'s age, Gainax and J.C.Staff\'s animation work is very well done; however, as time goes on and the tight budget runs even lower, the animation quality suffers. Surreal animation, still images, and recaps ended up being relied on more and more as time went on, and it got quite annoying. Sure, the surrealism works in some areas, such as scenes that show Souichirou\'s inner turmoil, but other times, it\'s rather distracting from the plot. I mean, come on, people! We\'re here to watch a romantic comedy anime about a couple letting their true selves show, not to stare at pictures of the setting of said romantic comedy anime! You won\'t be able to believe how many times during the second half that I said, ""I think they\'re running out of budget.""Despite all of that, however, Kare Kano is a good anime, and I\'d recommend it to people looking for a good romantic comedy.

But because it could have been perfection, had external factors not stopped it from reaching its full potential.Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou is the closest to true romance I've ever experienced in anime. It is an effective character study following 2 flawed people who are able to confide in each other, as they can empathise with the feeling of pretending to be someone they're not. Drama is created mostly through watching their relationship progress naturally, and the pacing in the first half of the series reflects this...excellently. The mangaka did a fantastic job at giving emotional weight to every progression the relationship made. I never thought the mere act of holding hands would have me on the verge of tears, but it was so much more effective than the overly-dramatic confessions we see in other shoujo anime. And Yukino's internal narration here was far more poignant than any bombastic declaration of love. The fact that the anime didn't shy away from the fact that teenage relationships do get physical, and went as far as to show that the two leads had sex (obviously no explicit scene though), was a breath of fresh air. It was a very mature take, and the way Hideaki Anno directed the episodes he had control of made it feel very real, very intimate.The music was lovely. The OP and ED were catchy and upbeat, but then they would show up in the actual series with different arrangements at just the right moments, and somehow absolutely break your heart. The orchestral version of the ED during the hand-holding scene especially affected me. Other than this, the other musical motifs that would appear during the moments of drama were also perfect, in my opinion.The characters were another strong point. Yukino is simply the most relatable shoujo protagonist I have ever witnessed. She has very clear insecurities and flaws, however she's not incredibly dense like many other leads in the genre. She works out why situations have occurred by herself, logically, and then takes the initiative to solve them herself instead of acting like a victim and letting her love interest do it for her. She's complemented perfectly by Arima, whose problems do run a lot deeper psychologically, but we can see him slowly be opened up by Yukino as the series goes on.The comedy also worked well, it made me laugh more than once. Yukino is hilarious and I'd definitely have been friends with her in school. Asaba is also a legend and his rapport with Arima is great. Maho's reluctant remarks during the Tsubasa arc were some of the high points of those episodes too.As I was watching the first few episodes, I really thought this was a 10/10 series. If it had ended at Episode 18, it very well may have been. But it didn't, and due to production issues and the mangaka apparently disallowing her manga from being further adapted, things started to go downhill.Firstly, the animation steadily declines as the series goes on, with the lowest points being Episode 19 and the final episode. This was quite a shame, as I actually did enjoy the character art quite a bit, as it was expressive but still beautiful. The anime is very much a product of its time on that front, unfortunately.Another issue was the abundance of recap and filler episodes. Some of the filler was enjoyable to watch, for example the story of Yukino's parents, or Tsubasa's family issues; however the entire final arc, with the play and Sakura's relationship with Tonami began to get on my nerves, as it got in the way of the progression of Yukino and Arima's story. Don't get me wrong, all of the side characters in this series are very well developed and likeable, however the fact that the series ended on this note without finding closure for Yukino and Arima left a sour taste in my mouth. The biggest flaw of this series is that it ends when it does. I dearly wish it was allowed to go further.But in the end I still have to give this series an 8, despite all its flaws, because when it was doing the right thing, it was doing it so well that it changed me - somewhat like how Yukino and Arima changed each other.

Many episodes were just panels from the manga with the characters talking in the background. It was horrible. I\'ve never seen an anime with such bad art.SoundThe music wasn\'t that great. I actually got some of the songs stuck in my head which was really annoying because they were stupid. Some of the scenes that were supposed to be serious actually made me burst out laughing because of how bad the music was. There wasn\'t much variety in the songs played and none of them were great.CharacterEven though the...art and sound sucked, the characters were amazing, especially Miyazawa and Arima. They are fantastic. The side characters are great too. A lot of the time I expected them to turn into something annoying but they turned out to be likable. The characters completely break away from all of he bad shoujo romance tropes that we\'ve all been conditioned to accept. It was refreshing.StoryThe story was amazing. At first I though that the entire anime was going to be spent with the two characters overcoming obstacles in order to finally get together like so many other shoujo romances, but in Kare Kano\'s case that wasn\'t the case. I kept waiting for a misunderstanding to end everything, but it never happened. The characters aren\'t stupid and they confront their problems before any stupid annoyances pop up. For example, (spoiler alert though I am vague) a third part appears, a male, and I was waiting and waiting for that character to fall in love with Miyazawa like in the case of so many other stupid shoujo romances. But it didn\'t happen! Instead I ended up really liking the guy. Another rival appears, this time a girl, and I was waiting for her to ruin everything. She even pulled the ""I knew him before you"" card. But it didn\'t happen! The surprise and joy I felt! (vague spoilers end here) This anime knows how to create conflict without making it unbearably painful and stupid. I have seen very few romance animes that manage to avoid using the usual stupid tropes again and again and again. I couldn\'t ask for anything more.OverallIf you are willing to watch this anime despite its horrible art and sound, do so. The show ends abruptly though and it has a few fillers near the end too. In the end you should probably just read the manga.

It is a great manga but a bad anime.', ""Kare Kano is unique in many ways amongst Shoujo anime, even exclusive.  On the face of it Kare Kano is or should be a light hearted Shoujo romantic comedy, the kind that in 2013 has been done many times already.  However it is not.  Many of the anime's greatest strengths and weaknesses have rarely been seen in anime since.  This will be less of a review and more of analysis of Kare Kano.Spoiler InclusiveGood points:1. Back in 1998, Shoujo series followed the format of either Rose of Versailles or Sailormoon.  Those were the big too but Kare Kano broke out...with the third format that more than half of all Shoujo animes since followed - wacky fun romantic comedy.  Gone was the drama and magic, in was the crazy comedy of highschool romance.  It might not seem like much as Shounen romance had already begun this shift long ago with Urusei Yatsura in the 80s but for Shoujo anime it was a big leap.  And even now, 15 years later, Kare Kano can hold it's head as being one of the funniest Shoujo animes in history.2. A number of cliched plot points or settings in Shoujo anime was created by Kare Kano, the main one being that a girl has her secret found out by a bishounen, who proceeds to tease her until they start dating.  Also Kare Kano started one of Shoujo mangas dreaded trends - after the main couple form, the story focuses on only two things.  Firstly on having superficial drama from random love rivals and misunderstandings, which are neither clever or inventive nor interesting.  Secondly by having every single character with more than 10 lines find a soul mate as well.  This trend is in Lovely Complex, Kimi ni Todoke, Special A, etc.  Many good Shoujos that were extended endlessly by this stupid idea.  However Kare Kano did not fall into this trap initially.  As most of the series occurs after the couple forms, the story maintains its interest with a strong selection of characters and believable problems with proper drama and character development.  It's astounding that the original could do what it's copy cats failed to do.3. Hideaki Anno and Gainax are both Kare Kano's strength and weakness.  Getting to the weakness later, the strength they brought is by turning a popular Shoujo series into a Shoujo version of FML, in stylistic view.  This was Hideaki Anno not long after finishing End of Evangelion.  It might sound impossible to imagine how he would tackle a Shoujo romantic comedy but it is actually very simple - he did exactly what he did for Evanglelion to Kare Kano, while adding Gainax's typical zanniness for comedy.  This is what Kare Kano has that few Shoujo since has.  It is as brooding, melancholic and thoughtful as it is fun.  Hideaki also brought is artistic style for static thematic backgrounds with him, which adds flavor to the series, at first.  Hideaki's touch made Kare Kano into something the manga was not, which is both a good and bad thing.Bad points:1. Kare Kano's problems start and end with Gainax.  I don't know who managed the company's accounts in the 90s but they should have been fired after the fiasco that was episode 25 and 26 of Evangelion.  Gainax's budget problems were as legendary as their most famous animes and it reared its head throughout Kare Kano.  After the first 3-4 episodes it becomes clear that Gainax realize they are going over budget, so in pops 2-3 minutes worth of recap at the start of each episode.  These recaps are at first done with variation in style and voice acting but soon become extremely poor with actions on the screen not matching the speech through the speakers.  Entire episodes dedicated for recap and extreme recycling of scenes proceed.2. Hideaki Anno gave Kare Kano something different with his brooding style, his flavor.  However as the budget he had to work with grew smaller his use of that style as a flavoring turned excessive to the point where all one saw was Anno being Anno, like a soup with a little hot sauce becoming only boiled hot sauce.  This is a light hearted Shoujo romantic comedy not Evanglelion and the overuse of Anno's sense felt like a mismatch.  It doesn't feel right but no one was going to say anything because Anno was able to manage the budget until...3. The mangaka herself calls up Gainax and says WTF.  Her beloved work was being turned by Anno into something it wasn't.  She didn't complain when his style improved it at first but thankfully she did when it was starting to ruin it.  The result was Anno quit, the recaps and lack of direction followed and all this and a complete breakdown in relations between Gainax and the mangaka lead to Kare Kano getting cut.Kare Kano is still one of the most unique and interesting Shoujo animes out there but like anything great Gainax did (with the sole exceptions of FML and TTGL) it was hampered by Gainax's lack of planning.  In many ways it's a study of taking things too far is bad.Story 8/10 - Original at the time and still better than many of its iterations.Art 6/10 - Visually realized at first but grows stale and recycled later on.Sound 9/10 - A strong voice cast keeps the series and its many recycled scenes alive.Character 8/10 - Develops characters with Hideaki's touch and thus surpasses the original at first.Enjoyment 7/10 - a 10/10 for the first half but after Hideaki's resignation and Gainax's cash flow problems it's hard to ignore Kare Kano's failings.Overall 7/10 - A potential masterpiece by Gainax brought down a lack of communication, budget and planning.  Typical Gainax. with the third format that more than half of all Shoujo animes since followed - wacky fun romantic comedy.

And even now, 15 years later, Kare Kano can hold it's head as being one of the funniest Shoujo animes in history.2. A number of cliched plot points or settings in Shoujo anime was created by Kare Kano, the main one being that a girl has her secret found out by a bishounen, who proceeds to tease her until they start dating.  Also Kare Kano started one of Shoujo mangas dreaded trends - after the main couple form, the story focuses on only two things.  Firstly on having superficial drama from random love rivals and misunderstandings, which are neither clever or inventive nor interesting.  Secondly by having every single character with more than 10 lines find a soul mate as well.  This trend is in Lovely Complex, Kimi ni Todoke, Special A, etc.  Many good Shoujos that were extended endlessly by this stupid idea.  However Kare Kano did not fall into this trap initially.  As most of the series occurs after the couple forms, the story maintains its interest with a strong selection of characters and believable problems with proper drama and character development.  It's astounding that the original could do what it's copy cats failed to do.3. Hideaki Anno and Gainax are both Kare Kano's strength and weakness.  Getting to the weakness later, the strength they brought is by turning a popular Shoujo series into a Shoujo version of FML, in stylistic view.  This was Hideaki Anno not long after finishing End of Evangelion.  It might sound impossible to imagine how he would tackle a Shoujo romantic comedy but it is actually very simple - he did exactly what he did for Evanglelion to Kare Kano, while adding Gainax's typical zanniness for comedy.  This is what Kare Kano has that few Shoujo since has.  It is as brooding, melancholic and thoughtful as it is fun.  Hideaki also brought is artistic style for static thematic backgrounds with him, which adds flavor to the series, at first.  Hideaki's touch made Kare Kano into something the manga was not, which is both a good and bad thing.Bad points:1. Kare Kano's problems start and end with Gainax.  I don't know who managed the company's accounts in the 90s but they should have been fired after the fiasco that was episode 25 and 26 of Evangelion.  Gainax's budget problems were as legendary as their most famous animes and it reared its head throughout Kare Kano.  After the first 3-4 episodes it becomes clear that Gainax realize they are going over budget, so in pops 2-3 minutes worth of recap at the start of each episode.  These recaps are at first done with variation in style and voice acting but soon become extremely poor with actions on the screen not matching the speech through the speakers.  Entire episodes dedicated for recap and extreme recycling of scenes proceed.2. Hideaki Anno gave Kare Kano something different with his brooding style, his flavor.  However as the budget he had to work with grew smaller his use of that style as a flavoring turned excessive to the point where all one saw was Anno being Anno, like a soup with a little hot sauce becoming only boiled hot sauce.  This is a light hearted Shoujo romantic comedy not Evanglelion and the overuse of Anno's sense felt like a mismatch.  It doesn't feel right but no one was going to say anything because Anno was able to manage the budget until...3. The mangaka herself calls up Gainax and says WTF.  Her beloved work was being turned by Anno into something it wasn't.  She didn't complain when his style improved it at first but thankfully she did when it was starting to ruin it.  The result was Anno quit, the recaps and lack of direction followed and all this and a complete breakdown in relations between Gainax and the mangaka lead to Kare Kano getting cut.Kare Kano is still one of the most unique and interesting Shoujo animes out there but like anything great Gainax did (with the sole exceptions of FML and TTGL) it was hampered by Gainax's lack of planning.  In many ways it's a study of taking things too far is bad.Story 8/10 - Original at the time and still better than many of its iterations.Art 6/10 - Visually realized at first but grows stale and recycled later on.Sound 9/10 - A strong voice cast keeps the series and its many recycled scenes alive.Character 8/10 - Develops characters with Hideaki's touch and thus surpasses the original at first.Enjoyment 7/10 - a 10/10 for the first half but after Hideaki's resignation and Gainax's cash flow problems it's hard to ignore Kare Kano's failings.Overall 7/10 - A potential masterpiece by Gainax brought down a lack of communication, budget and planning.  Typical Gainax."", 'Back in the days I watched several shoujo/josei shows to better understand what this genre is about.The biggest problem in this one is that male protagonist is completely unreletable to me. Surely it is shoujo/josei genre so that is to be expected, but still I would like to add my male view to it.On the other hand, I think a female heroine is ok for the most part and even somewhat likable, she reminds me of someone I know but may be that is just nostalgia.That said I watched this long ago so I do not remember too much.It mostly about conversations and dialogues,...which is not a bad thing per se. However in the show like this relatability of characters is or paramount importance. So many dialogues make little sense to me.This show has overall melancholic feel to it, so it would suit people with melancholic temper.All it all it is probably a better example of shoujo/josei genre. In Kaichou wa Maid Sama for example female protagonist is completely unlikable but here she is not. That one thing is very redeeming of it. which is not a bad thing per se.

Where is the drama, the love triangles, the emotions? I might pick up the manga to see if there are more to it than this, but this anime was simply not very good, despite great characters. Too bad, I had high hopes that this would be the Evangelion of school anime.AnimationThe animation is a big mish-mash of different styles of artwork with a lot of the dialogue being written instead of spoken, which is a shame if you, like me, don\'t read japanese.When I think about it, this hardly should be called ""anime"" at all; there is simply not very much animation...going on, just still frames panning and tilting.Much of the art is beautiful, but it becomes too much and I really prefer the ""ordinary"" anime style.There are a lot of gorgeous facial expressions, though, mostly from Yukino and Tsubasa.All in all, nice and progressive but too avant garde for my liking.SoundAnother let-down. Most voice acting was below average, some were even horrible (what\'s up with Rika, sounding like a 30 year old man\'s falsetto?) Most of the boys sound ok, and although Yukino\'s voice is a bit unskilled, you learn to like it after a while somehow.The opening theme is ok, nothing special but quite happy-happy and fits the theme. The ending theme I actually liked a lot for some reason, despite it sounding really amateurish. Maybe it\'s because of that it felt authentic someway. My guess is that it is sung by the voice actors.StoryThere really isn\'t much of a story going on. A bit similar to Azumanga Daioh, we get to follow some high school students through their everyday lives. There\'s no big plot, climax or anything.There is also an absence of drama; the characters never have any large difficulties getting by, and the intermezzos that actually happen, get solved far too easily.And what about the ending? That\'s it? Not a single one of the characters get to fulfill their personal ""plots"". Very disappointing.And why oh WHY are there tons, tons and tons of recaps? There even were two whole episodes containing nothing but recaps! If there was some advanced story or web of character relations, it would be understandable, but the way it is, the recaps were a total waste of screen time. Yes, I think I can remember those two are A-students and then they fell in love, thank you very much.CharacterNow this is where KareKano actually shines. The characters (most of them at least) are likeable and nice to get to know. Since there are 26 episodes (actually less, counting all the darn recaps), most of the characters get their backgrounds nicely presented, and you get a good view of the agendas of each and every one.The wierd thing about KareKano is this: Much time and work is spent on explaining how Yukino and Arima both are fake, but that they put down their masks and change their values when they start dating. I for one don\'t notice much change, they are both still best in school and show no signs of working or studying less. I might have missed something vital, but I think if KareKano was meant to bring up issues like facades and fake personalities, it failed big time.That doesn\'t stop me from liking the characters, though. I do, really, they\'re great! It\'s just a shame they were put in such a bad story.Oh yeah, wich reminds me... Even though they all have good backgrounds, no one gets to finish their story.ValueI probably will watch this again, just to try to understand stuff I didn\'t get the first time. Or if I find the manga, I\'ll probably read that instead.All things considered, this was a big disappointment as I was expecting this to be the best high school anime out there.

I loved the comedy it included and simply how wonderful the two main characters were. Unfortunately, for the anime, it really started to fall apart. The art and animation take a dramatic turn downwards and the story and character development went in a different direction.What started out as a very promising anime, turned out to be one that fell flat.Story: 8Story got the highest score of all the categories and that is...because it hooked me instantly from when I started watching it. This anime came out in 1998 and I was surprised I liked it so much. It reminded me of may shojo anime\'s that have recently come out. I loved how Yukino had a private side and tries to be perfect and the same with Arima. I think the story just really spoke to me about trying to be perfect when you\'re not. I could really relate to that aspect, because that\'s how I felt when I was in high school. Plus, I was also very different outside of school. While I never studied as much as Yukino did or work out, I kept my private life very private. Only my sister knew of my love of anime for the longest time.Anyways, I must say, I really loved the fact that Arima and Yukino didn\'t take the whole 26 episodes to announce to each other they were in love. Some shojo\'s these days take the whole season for the boy and girl to say they like each other and it is getting quite annoying.Unfortunately, the anime started to move away from our two main characters and there were a couple of episodes focusing on supporting characters and it just really turned me off. While they were focusing on these other characters our main characters were lost and their story kinda thrown to the side. I much rather have seen them spend time developing Yukino and Arima and really give them a great story. I haven\'t read the manga, so I\'m not sure about their whole story, but hopefully it was better then how it was portrayed in the anime. Also, the story kind of drifts off and so there doesn\'t really seem like a climax at all, at least to me.Art: 3Art got the lowest score because I started to get really pissed off about how the animation was given such poor quality. In the middle and towards the end, the animation was just line drawing and cut-outs and sometimes even on sticks. Like, come on. I know it was animated like 20 years ago, but it mostly seemed like a lack of time. From a message board on MyAnimeList I found out that:His and Her Circumstances is a romantic drama manga series by Masami Tsuda. Anno was tasked with directing the series but Tsuda grew displeased with the more comedy-focused adaptation. A lot of Anno\'s directorial marks were on the adaptation as well, which utilized traffic signals and railroad crossings as symbols. As Tsuda\'s displeasure grew, the show began resorting to less and less actual animation, at one point replacing characters with literal popsicle stick cut-outs. Anno left his directorial duties and the remaining seven episodes were overseen by Kazuya Tsurumaki.This sounds like a bad situation in general and it really makes me want to read the manga so I can get the real story and art. The sad thing is that the moderate amount of comedy in the beginning really dragged me in as well, but it must have gotten out of hand. It was sad to really see the anime decline.Sound: 6I really didn\'t mind the sound. I watched the English dubbed version, simply because I was busy and listening to it in English and multitasking were just easier for me. I usually don\'t like dubbed versions, but I thought the actors who played Yukino and Arima were quite good. There were a few creepy parts in there with Arima. I\'m not sure if that was the script or the actor just didn\'t know how to portray that certain scene.All in all, I thought the music fit well and went nicely with the serious scenes and the opening song was catchy. So, I honestly, didn\'t mind the sound at all.Character: 6The only reason this is so high is because of the beginning and how much I loved the characters of Yukino and Arima. They were both so similar and different at the same time. Their relationship is probably the most realistic one I\'ve every seen in an anime and I could relate to it.Yukino: She is popular, smart, athletic, but she has a complete opposite side when she\'s at home. Honestly, she\'s just popular, smart, and athletic all and all. She\'s really not that different when she\'s not at school, as far as the anime showed, except for like the first 5 episodes. So, her back story is sort of pointless, but I do get that feeling of being lost from her. Her whole character development was to figure out who she is and to be herself. I don\'t think there was that big of a breakthrough, but I still very much enjoyed her personality and her realness and kindness towards Arima.Arima: Smart, popular, and athletic just like Yukino. I think this is why this couple seems so real to me. In high school you always saw like minded people together. This time it\'s not about the jock and head cheerleader, it\'s about two hard working regular teenagers. While Yukino works hard to keep her appearances, Arima works hard to impress his ever disapproving family, besides his foster parents. His back story is kinda, ""Ehh, really?"" at some points, but I understand they were trying to go for a kid that has been abused to give him something different. I really liked him, he was kind and caring, but could be firm when he wanted to be. I especially appreciated that firmness during their relationship.Their relationship was so realistic and covered what a real relationship would be like. I think high school kids are a little more horny then these kids, but hey I get it. Yukino and Arima were shy at the beginning and the best part was you could see how they were opening up to each other, sharing everything together. I think this really reflects relationships these days.But, main characters are only so much of this anime and since they focused so much on supporting characters, I need to account for that.

This is because it focuses a lot on psychological introspection of the characters thoughts and feelings and them all facing issues and developing because of that. I found it quite compelling at certain parts, but definitely not consistently all the way through and despite that pro it was still a little melodramatic at times for my taste, and the ending left so much to...be done, so whilst it is really good, it has too many faults to be given a really high rating.Characters as said all have internal issues, it focuses arcs on secondary characters to give them just as much as development as well, this anime only adapted a third of the manga, so the characters which weren't would have most likely had their turn. I would give this an eight, after i got to know them all the characters became likeable and charming and were given a decent amount of development, there was still work to be done here, but that is more the fault of it being incomplete.Animation/Directing style - Whilst I appreciate its quirky unique style which is used to effect, this show was made too much on a budget. Manga panels/crayon drawings/paper cut outs/live action shorts, an assortment of techniques to do less animation is used and in some scenes it does enhance the experience, but it can also seem unnecessary. This can especially be seen in episode 19 as for the whole entire episode, we had characters coloured in pencil and were made out of paper cuts. The issues regarding this generally got worse as things went along, with less animation and more bizarre techniques used.The regular animation can look really good when it wants to, but it also tries to avoid animating much, so we get a lot of static backgrounds and characters or with little movement.Anno has used up his budget in a number of shows, but this was made cheap from the beginning, it isn't an action series so its hard ti blow it all on action set pieces and budget techniques were prominent from the start, which only got worse through out.The comedy is something I really liked it definitely had chuckles out off me, the weird directing techniques definitely helped amplify some of these scenes, it really did work for me. Some time this show could be 'darker' and more introspective, but for the most part it was a comedy and it did work quite well, the characters could all make me laugh and it was quirky and charming.The sound gets a six, I like the opening, ending and the OST isn't bad either its just overused, I often felt like I was hearing the same track over and over again.Despite everything this is one off, if not my favourite Romantic Comedy anime, due remember that this really isn't my genre. i appreciate the psychological introspection and the comedy could make me laugh, there is a lot too appreciate here. BUT there is equally a lot of things holding it down, from budget to incompleteness, that I can't really give too high of a rating.Story 6 - Shits the bed at the end, can be a bit melodramatic, no real aim in terms of story, its all focused on characters internal struggles.Characters 8 - Grow through out the series, focus on their internal struggles, and both main and side get a decent amount of development.Animation 6 - Nice art style but too cheap.Sound 7 - Charming/fitting but with little variance.Enjoyment 7 - I enjoyed the comedy, I liked the characters, but budget cuts did get a little distracting.Overall 7 be done, so whilst it is really good, it has too many faults to be given a really high rating.Characters as said all have internal issues, it focuses arcs on secondary characters to give them just as much as development as well, this anime only adapted a third of the manga, so the characters which weren't would have most likely had their turn.

Because it was about this girl who created this certain image of herself and had to keep it up so she would be admired like year round and the boy I forget what his story was, but at the end of the day it is all about just being yourself.I did not like the art at all it was too nineties and just not very appealing to look at. It also came off as like the writers were trying too hard for certain parts of the anime to be funny. You know like when...an anime character is mad and suddenly they go nuts and start yelling and their head gets suddenly big and they have fangs and their eyes are all white and they are just yelling at someone. That's why I think they tried too hard and over exaggerated on most scenes.First episode is suppose to pull you in and make you consider continuing to watch it and that did not happen. an anime character is mad and suddenly they go nuts and start yelling and their head gets suddenly big and they have fangs and their eyes are all white and they are just yelling at someone.

Overall I'm giving it an 8 purely because of the character dynamics, the pacing and the fact that I actually enjoyed the mixed animation.The characters had distinct personalities and that made them more relatable than an entire series full of the same boring attributes. Firstly, Yukino and Arima were great. I am over one character being the strong and silent type and the other being a girl who'll run an internal monologue for five episodes about whether...or not she's going to confess to someone. The mere fact that both of them didn't give up on the other and instead of letting one run away from a problem they confronted them together (usually within one or two episodes of the problem being introduced) was fantastic. They also delve into an area of teenage romance that not a lot of other anime's like to tread - the idea of a couple sleeping together. It was a change of pace and one that, while not expected, was a mature and completely inoffensive aspect of their relationship that made it seem a little more realistic. Clap clap* for that and their characters!That being said there were parts in this anime that had me wondering whether or not they were going to resolve scenarios that, in my avid binge-watching brain, I felt were intense (you'll know that scene when you get to it). Sadly that's where this anime fell short for me, a few underlying things that I wanted resolutions for never happened and because of that the ending left me wanting more from it. In particular I wanted a more comforting resolution on Arima's apparent psychological dependancy issues which were presented earlier (again, not resolved) and were reintroduced at the end (and not extended on or resolved).Some episodes (maybe two or three) were fillers that I truly felt could have been used to progress the story in order to develop a stronger ending but overall it moved at a good pace. It was funny, it made me cry, the main characters not being wussy's (most of the time) about how they feel, the interesting animation and the personality diversity made this show a pretty good watch for me. I definitely recommend giving it a go! or not she's going to confess to someone.

The receptionist informs you that only Room 26 is currently available. He tells you it\'s free-of-charge, and after momentarily singing internal praises, you realize that of course there\'s a catch. You ask the man in front of you the downsides of the stay. He gives you the key and tells you to go discover for yourself.As a seasoned wayfarer across various lands, you\'ve...slept on moist, leafy forest grounds and learned to drown consciousness leaning on mountain trees of shedding barks. So you ponder as you draw nearer to the room, ""How bad can the living condition in an establishment of human hands be as opposed to the unpredictable domains of nature?""You slowly open the door.""Messy"". ""Cluttered"". ""Like a whirlwind popped a classical-music-fueled waltz on every inch of the room"". ""Like a tropical storm was the housekeeper on duty.""Surely the foundation was the same as all the other rooms in the building. How can just this specific room differ in motif?Intrigued, you take a closer look,...- Step out of the frame if the scenario does not ring true to personal thoughts....It continues:You take a closer look, and realize that this was all intentional as dictated by the vision of the artist. Within the messy space you see the word ""unconventional"" sewn on every object\'s surface. There\'s method in the madness! And you have hit the jackpot of a lifetime in this rent-free room with all the bubbling energy free to examine an avant-garde massacre! The abundance of ochre, bichromatic extremes melding together seamlessly amidst equally raw wallpapers on the ceiling and figurines scrambled inside a dollhouse and a secluded school, the comedic acrobatics of objects in the background reminiscent to the passion of motion--you feel the presence of something chaotically fashioned invigorating the lost joy of living under an anime artist\'s care, which in this case certainly did not seem to be of substance from the exterior.At least, I did.(Most likely) A precursor to FLCL\'s experimental animation bonanza, Kare Kano is directed with a supernova burst of life that places the set of actors into a pedestal which forces out the limits of their expressions. This approach works out well for our main duo as it paints an interesting image showcasing commotion which contrasts picture-perfect demeanor. It extends with the side characters complementing the atmosphere by following suit with chibified models, carnival choreographies while reciting one\'s lines, and shared sleazebag behavior for most of them.Although there is one outlier that is more beast than human, but we\'ll leave the subject there for the time being.See, sometimes I feel breathless with all the movement not taking a break, and when it does so in order to chime in the necessary plaintive elements of the story, often it picks itself right back with the dance. It\'s like a cycle of playing hopscotch, tag, and kick the [character] can all on fastforward and with as brisk and bouncy an attitude at it as one possibly can, with the necessary friction of arguments, confrontations, and breakdowns situated in between each gaming session. What it does is drag me through places to places, through amusement parks and solemn conclaves, and I surrender myself at the mercy of its whimsical bearing. It therefore enabled me to storm through the first half with glee and immersion in just two days, when I basically already average three episodes biweekly in this I-fell-off phase of being a Japanese media enthusiast. The amount of entertainment was just so overpowering to my senses, and the writing of the characters, as agents under the primary theme of shedding light to one\'s authenticity to eradicate deception, hit a tad bit close to home.You know how student council presidents in anime are basically a more evolved species of humanity? I just love how we have that as our MCs. But in addition to their perfectly refined and frankly envious capabilities, we are able to see student council president-esque non-student council presidents peel off and bleed as layered sentients, giving us the best of both worlds. Of course an evenly significant core are their attitudes which they seek to change for the better--that\'s the goal of the show. Its employment of juxtaposition and animalistic personality drills Kare Kano into the viewer\'s mind as a story that can be many things all at once.One of those things being, a child of a rocky domestic relationship just like a good number of its cast.Somehow I did not think much of the production as seen through the visual deficiencies. I\'ve grown quite accustomed to the all-over outlandish behavior of the presentation that a couple more questionable decisions felt much at home. It\'s like, no matter how it is animated, or if there are no animations at all, it would very much be alright to me. It\'s like Gintama some way in my eyes, with its prankster nature acclimating us to every creative display technique in and out of the book. In that aspect, I was not disturbed.What did, however, is the quality of writing also taking the nosedive. Episode 18 Progress left in such a high note, for we\'ve entered into the realm of spiritual romance at the fruition of sexual communion. We were at the cusp of literal progress! How would this act affect the relationship of two model high school students? Just as we were being guided into a new domain with new ordeals, we got the 14 Days arc which gradually destabilized the high road to magnificence it\'s been consistently on for the first three quarters. Although it was quite remedied on episode 26 with more on Arima\'s internal struggles, nothing can stave off the melancholy of an incomplete creation forced to lay to rest in a scurry. That was a whirlwind that did not quite possess a gift for the arts, an unfortunate circumstance to live through with.There lies an opulent amount of potential (sadly rather untapped) residing within Miyazawa and Arima individually and in accordance with one another as similar people with different struggles influenced by circumstance. I did not ever mind the pacing; change is never linear, nor does it serve the wishes of the dreamer like an obedient servant. It takes on many unnoticed forms, and sometimes misleads people into self-consuming mindsets (hark Episode 24 Miyazawa). That\'s why the constancy of Miyazawa\'s ""Queen of Vanity"" persona did not wear off in existence and in relevance, that\'s why Arima\'s childhood still haunts him in a neverending nightmare and locks him in an iffy position of wanting Miyazawa to change but envying the smooth sailing of her journey (in his point of view) and thus inhabiting obsessive-controlling pulses deep inside (the baring of a fraction of its glory thereof on the last episode boosting my frustrations at the absence of what could\'ve been). It\'s just so, so engaging to see adolescents fighting against sinister behavior and thought processes, acknowledging the stain of their person and how they would go about processing it as students in the middle of growth. We need more overachievers with visceral inhibitions starring fictional tales.The very fact that Arima is who he is resonates with an uglier side of who I am. Sensing an innate deep flaw that he believes is surely not within others, the existence of a ""darker"" version of ""me"" (whatever ""me"" even is), lamenting at the sight of people well-versed in social contact--just being afraid of being a bad person deep inside paralyzes any attempts for connection, superficial or nude. That he asks questions to Miyazawa like ""You want to be with me?"" in a casually calculated way in order to breastfeed the infant inside of him scared to be abandoned and surviving from external validation of a radiant figure, that he exhibits eeriness yet beats himself for what he does and especially how he thinks, that we are witnessing a promising young boy with the future in his hands dying from mental rot, this sort of character who implodes with existential convolutions, in morals and virtue--and for this volatility and instability to be seen in a guy, like me, means exponentially. Every bit of representation really matters huh, as it effectively closes by a huge margin the unseen gorge between fiction and reality. Arima waves a mirror for me to reflect upon my progress and leaves me off more grateful to have been expelled from high school toxicity. That is why it hurts that much to be on the edge of the cliff for a boundless land like Kare Kano.The tarnished beauties that is Miyazawa and Arima...Sigh, the gears of frustration ain\'t going to stop rolling anytime soon. Nonetheless, it\'s frankly nothing short of amazing that a series can endure self-harm to this degree. slept on moist, leafy forest grounds and learned to drown consciousness leaning on mountain trees of shedding barks.

Some may criticize it for its obviously readable plot, but regardless of that it is a great show that will leave you with a smile.Story wise, its nothing special. Its how it was portrayed that makes it very entertaining. There is rarely a dull moment in it and is constantly making sure you are up to date with what has happened so far, which does get a bit annoying if you marathon through the show.In conclusion, this anime deserves a watch. If you like romantic comedies then this show is for you. ', 'I don\'t really watch 90s anime because of the animation is such a turn off. But I somehow ended up watching Kare Kano and I didn\'t regret it  a bit! I don\'t really write reviews but this story is really good but since so many people complained about the art, I decided to write one because it is unfair to give such a low rating just because the studio effed up. Yes, the anime maker screwed up especially towards the end but I\'m still going to give this an 8 because the story is just that good. If you are hesitating because of the...art please don\'t. Give this anime a try :) The manga has such a beautiful ending and I really really enjoyed this story.""two damaged people, trying to heal each other is love."" - R.HThis quote sums up Arima and Miyazawa\'s relationship :) art please don\'t. Give this anime a try :) The manga has such a beautiful ending and I really really enjoyed this story.""two damaged people, trying to heal each other is love."" - R.HThis quote sums up Arima and Miyazawa\'s relationship :)', 'A lot of reviewers seem to be under the delusion that this anime suffers from a small budget. I would like to know what anime they’ve been watching, because I can only assume these must be made in Hollywood for millions of dollars per episode and are directed by James Cameron. No, you innocent, silly goose, no no no. In fact, Kareshi Kanojo, produced by Gainax, boasts one of the higher production values of the season. Just to compare, I mean, this aired alongside the first series of Pokémon. Also the full airing of Cowboy Bebop, but that’s pretty much incomparable. Crap, now I’m reminded...of Saint Luminous Jogakuin. Horrible. Personally, I would say Kareshi Kanojo is about on par with Cardcaptor Sakura. The director does however use a high amount of still frames and stylized shots, but not to be cheap. Too much attention went into every image to say it was done to save time or money.Here’s what you should be complaining about:1)\tIf you are the original mangaka of Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou…You should despise this. In his egotistical quest to reinvent another genre of anime, Hideaki Anno has hi-jacked your charming, romantic slice of life story and has taken a territorial piss all over it. Instead of remaining faithful to the source material, which was more than good enough and one of the only shoujo’s of the 90’s that managed to keep me around for a few volumes, he tried to turn it into some hilarious, wacky high school comedy and used it as a vehicle to revolutionize shoujo. He wanted to do what Mamoru Oshii did to Urusei Yatsura (ironically one of my all-time favorite anime), interpret it and use it to advertize his own overly stylized directing. While Neon Genesis Evangelion was Anno’s own story, and he could do with it whatever he wanted (and so he did, to great success), this is not his. It’s like someone laboured to make a really tasty, healthy meal and Anno suddenly has a vision, empties a bottle of hot chili sauce and a pack of sugar on top of it, arranges everything to resemble a gothic church and proclaims it the spaghetti bolognese of the new century. This is arrogant directing and a disrespectful adaptation.2)\tIf you are a huge fun of the original manga…See no. 13)\tIf you are an Evangelion fanboy/girl…Proceed with caution to no. 4.4)\tEveryone elseThis is a refreshing and funny romance, featuring at least two realistic, more or less relatable characters with actual depth. The romantic stuff is heart-warming and the gags might tickle one or several of your funny bones. The production values are high, but there’s incredibly frequent usage of stylized still frames. Much like Osamu Dezaki did in the 70’s and 80’s, only for a more modern audience this time. Very Gainax. One can feel a bit overwhelmed by all the style and the nifty little tricks Hideaki Anno tries to pull for the sake of innovation. I found myself getting nauseous from the slightly overpaced switching between frames. Lingering still frames can offer some kind of piece of mind in a slice of life type story, but the quick succession made me feel restless and a bit annoyed at times. Every image seemed so profound and meaningful but you never really get a chance to take everything in. The human mind has a natural attention span, and Anno just ignores our inner clock and randomly crams a bunch of pictures into a random timespan.

Mixed feelings. of Saint Luminous Jogakuin. Horrible. Personally, I would say Kareshi Kanojo is about on par with Cardcaptor Sakura. The director does however use a high amount of still frames and stylized shots, but not to be cheap. Too much attention went into every image to say it was done to save time or money.Here’s what you should be complaining about:1)\tIf you are the original mangaka of Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou…You should despise this. In his egotistical quest to reinvent another genre of anime, Hideaki Anno has hi-jacked your charming, romantic slice of life story and has taken a territorial piss all over it. Instead of remaining faithful to the source material, which was more than good enough and one of the only shoujo’s of the 90’s that managed to keep me around for a few volumes, he tried to turn it into some hilarious, wacky high school comedy and used it as a vehicle to revolutionize shoujo. He wanted to do what Mamoru Oshii did to Urusei Yatsura (ironically one of my all-time favorite anime), interpret it and use it to advertize his own overly stylized directing. While Neon Genesis Evangelion was Anno’s own story, and he could do with it whatever he wanted (and so he did, to great success), this is not his. It’s like someone laboured to make a really tasty, healthy meal and Anno suddenly has a vision, empties a bottle of hot chili sauce and a pack of sugar on top of it, arranges everything to resemble a gothic church and proclaims it the spaghetti bolognese of the new century. This is arrogant directing and a disrespectful adaptation.2)\tIf you are a huge fun of the original manga…See no. 13)\tIf you are an Evangelion fanboy/girl…Proceed with caution to no. 4.4)\tEveryone elseThis is a refreshing and funny romance, featuring at least two realistic, more or less relatable characters with actual depth. The romantic stuff is heart-warming and the gags might tickle one or several of your funny bones. The production values are high, but there’s incredibly frequent usage of stylized still frames. Much like Osamu Dezaki did in the 70’s and 80’s, only for a more modern audience this time. Very Gainax. One can feel a bit overwhelmed by all the style and the nifty little tricks Hideaki Anno tries to pull for the sake of innovation. I found myself getting nauseous from the slightly overpaced switching between frames. Lingering still frames can offer some kind of piece of mind in a slice of life type story, but the quick succession made me feel restless and a bit annoyed at times. Every image seemed so profound and meaningful but you never really get a chance to take everything in. The human mind has a natural attention span, and Anno just ignores our inner clock and randomly crams a bunch of pictures into a random timespan.

After watching them, though, I was convinced that this show was a 10 and would quickly become a personal favorite.Though the beginning of this show is golden, everything in the show takes a complete nosedive after the eighteenth or nineteenth episode. Hideaki Anno leaving the show only works towards its detriment.  However, the final episode is quite nice.

They can laugh uproaringly and get a runny nose when they cry. The thoughts that cross their minds are thoughts you and I have had, maybe late at night just before falling asleep. Their worries feel real.There is no antagonist in Kare Kano, not really. The antagonists here are the hidden demons inside each character (particularly our lead...man, Arima).My only complaint woud be the lack of an ending and the animation which could be very trying at times (budget issues).Overall, Kare Kano is a really beautiful romantic  shoujo anime that represents the best in the genre. man, Arima).My only complaint woud be the lack of an ending and the animation which could be very trying at times (budget issues).Overall, Kare Kano is a really beautiful romantic  shoujo anime that represents the best in the genre."", ""If you're into slice of life drama series this is for you.

The story starts off by introducing two brilliant teenagers who pretend to be something else than what they are in real life. Yukino is the female lead who has a twisted second personality and her biggest ""enemy"" the flawless Souichirou. I really thought this was going to be another romantic shoujo anime with some humor. Again, I was dead wrong.First, this story has logical and real emotions from a realistic relationship between the two main characters. I have never seen anything like...this before from a shoujo anime. Their love builds up so nicely to the point that they actually decide to get to the next level. This is something very rare in romantic animes as most of them only build-up to the first kiss or just to start the relationship. Not this one. And the best part is that the story only just starts getting more interesting as that is the point when the main male character begins to show his real nature and thoughts. I don\'t want to spoil anything, but it gets very dark. Sadly the anime only shows the first 30 chapters of the 102 chapters long manga, so I REALLY recommend reading it.Second, all side characters have a real background and story. They are not just side characters, as they are very important to the story. Again it\'s so rare when we get so much info to get to know other characters than the mains. Any of the side characters could be this anime\'s main protagonist as they all have detailed personalities. Honestly, this amazed me! We even get to know all the parents and their backstories. This is very rare!The story overall: I hardly say this to anything, but the story is outstanding. No awkward, silly situations, everything realistic, and even managed to be funny. I read the manga straight away after watching the anime, and it was one of the most interesting stories I have ever read. 10/10Art: As amazing the story is, the art is that bad. I know we are talking about 1998, but still horrible. It\'s so low budget that it makes it unbearable to watch some episodes. It starts alright but every episode has a 5 minutes recap and they use lots of pictures from the manga. Around the 13th episode, there is a full episode that just recaps, and after that everything is getting worse. It gets to the point where they don\'t even bother with animation and whole episodes just cut out characters on sticks from the manga. Absolutely dreadful! I think the most horrible was those pictures from traffic lights and roads. It was miserable to watch them for minutes and just listen to the characters talking. The last episode was something I have never had the misfortune to see before. Pictures and lines on the screen and two narrators saying nonsense words meanwhile. Are they really thought it\'s going to be artistic?!Art was the absolute worst in the whole anime.  1/10Sound: Sound was surprisingly very good. I\'m not sure about the music, but the voices were excellent. 8/10Characters: I would write an essay if I start to analyze all of them. They are great! doesn\'t matter which character we talk about as they all have their stories. As I said above any of the side characters easily could become the main character of a stand-alone anime.The main male protagonist\'s story is so interesting that I couldn\'t stop reading the manga so I was up until 4am for two days just to get to know him better :DMy favorite was Kazuma. No particular reason simply that he is probably an angel as he is so nice, but not in the common anime way.

And I can confidently say it is the most beautiful piece I have ever found among sentimental anime.As the title suggests, it\'s obviously about a love story between high school students. We are often accustomed to finding sentimental, school-based, or more adult-themed anime that constantly plays on creating situations that lead to the protagonists getting closer until they end up together. Karekano is one of the many cases that takes a different path.In Karekano, the relationship between the two protagonists, Soichirou Arima and Yukino Miyazawa,...transforms into a relationship very early on, already in the first episodes. This relationship becomes the catalyst for both characters to become aware of their own strengths and weaknesses, leading to a development that lasts throughout the work, from beginning to end.I believe this is the strong point of the work, the fact that the relationship between the two protagonists is in CONSTANT EVOLUTION. And even when one of them is absent due to a trip, this development never stops.This continuous evolution takes us on a journey through the lives of this couple, showing us a lot of sweetness, seasoned with curiosity and sexual attraction. One point I found particularly interesting is the continuous self-analysis that the two protagonists undergo, which almost seems to echo the trend of Japanese literary genre ""shoosetsu,"" characterized precisely by this continuous self-analysis that the protagonist undergoes.For example, I could mention ""Kokoro"" by Natsume Soseki as an example. This trend gives the anime a very introspective style where even the direction finds fertile ground, showing different styles on screen in different situations, adopting specific styles to show the characters\' moments of reflection. These moments are often characterized by a manga style, where panels appear on the screen.The visual and sound components, in general, are often used precisely to represent these emotions. Citing two examples, we see the appearance of a building complex against a horrifying red background to show the return of bad memories in a character\'s mind, and sometimes the chaotic sounds of the city (such as honking) are used to show the accumulation of thoughts and worries.I believe that all fans of the medium should watch Karekano at least once. It transports you to a school environment where the dynamics of relationships between all the characters are anything but childish, showing all the complex facets that characterize relationships between lovers, friends, and even family members. And in all this, the work perfectly manages to coexist with a healthy dose of humor, which often spills over with direct references to Anno\'s masterpiece, Evangelion.It doesn\'t matter that the work is unfortunately incomplete. Ending the work abruptly, despite the staff\'s visible effort to minimize the friction of this abrupt ending, which is particularly evident towards the last episodes, where Hideaki Anno is no longer directing, doesn\'t matter much. The reduction of this friction was successful, giving us 2 enjoyable dreamlike episodes.As far as I\'m concerned, everything that came before surpasses any other sentimental anime I\'ve ever seen. transforms into a relationship very early on, already in the first episodes.

The characters have both a comedic and dramatic side, and the animation catches perfectly both of them, with over-the-top reactions or experimental visual style in the moments of introspectiveness. This is by far the most...satisfying element of the anime. The entertainment is secured by the personality of protagonists, and not much on awkward situations or clichés. Also, watching a series that didn\'t fall in any kind of fan-service like most of the genre right now was somehow a cathartic experience.Other elements that I truly enjoyed are the animation (I\'m a bit nostalgic of the old hand-made look, and in some elements this is similar to what Kaguya-sama could have looked liked if it came out in the \'90s), the beautiful score from Shiro Sagisu (both energetic and reflective) and the overall positive tone of the series. Compared to Evangelion, this one delivered more development and growth rather than deconstruction of the characters, and I was happy to see such a difference from the previous work of Hideaki Hanno.There are yet different factors that ""ruin"" the enjoyment of the series. and the ending.One of them is Hideaki Hanno\'s visual style (clearly influenced by Evangelion). I liked how it is used in moments where the characters analyze themselfs, however at some point it becomes something that ""replaces"" the lack of proper animation from the studio, leading to entire sequences featuring live-action footage of streets while someone speaks in the background. Rather than being used as a tool that elevates the quality of the show (as happens occasionally in the first half of the show), his style becomes gradually a cheap solution to fill the gaps in the runtime of the episode and burdens enormously the tone of the story.The lack of production budget becomes clear already at midseason. While the first 13 episodes are mostly well animated and detailed, the second half is really hard to enjoy as much as the first half. Probably this was the origin of the cause I explained above. Aside from Hideaki Hanno\'s style, the recap of the latest episodes becomes longer and longer, still images and voice-over are used more frequently and so on. As to the last episode, sadly it is the worst and hardest to watch, becomes of all these factors coming together exponentially. The animated scenes are drastically reduced to a minimum, and too much information is given to the viewers by dialogues and text literally written on the screen (you have to pause constantly the episode in order to read everything and understand what the characters are thinking/saying).Ultimately, aside from the overuse of Hanno\'s style and lack of budget, the ending of the show is clearly too rushed: many things are left unresolved and a feeling of disappointment is what gets you as the credits start rolling. I don\'t know how the anime adaptation distances itself from the manga, but I have the impression that they couldn\'t adapt everything they wanted to.Final thoughts: ""Kare Kano"" is a show that gave me true and special moments of enjoyment. Sadly the hellish production ruined the tone of the series in the second half, even if there were still good parts in it. If this anime didn\'t have all these problematic elements, I would have given it a 9/10 rate. I still believe it is worth watching, but if you do, be prepared to what\'s coming.P.S.

The romance in this anime is relatively cliche, and I say that with a grain of salt since it was relatively fulfilling. The comedy in this anime was a million years better, definitely worth watching.

It\'s also a mark from the age it\'s been written.', ""Kare Kano is a work with many strengths and weaknesses, and for this reason it is a divisive title: there are those who hate it and those who love it.Let's start with the Cons:Animation & BudgetThis anime did not receive enough budget to maintain a consistently high level of animation quality. In the first episodes of the series the quality is good and the variety of animations is numerous. However as the episodes progress, the budget decreases more and more and the episodes suffer a little. There is even an entire Recap episode, and also the infamous last 7 episodes (which I will talk about...later). Fortunately there's Hideaki Anno who manages to effectively exploit the budget and the number of animations available and manages to keep it a valid series through his style and his technique (Anno's style is often characterized by flat layers in parallax, the use of text, the cutaway shots of lightpoles/stoplights, the use of images from the manga itself). It is no coincidence that he managed to do the same with Evangelion in the last 2 episodes, and the 53-seconds elevator scene is an example.Episodes 19-26Episodes 1-18 worthily conclude the narrative arc of the 2 protagonists. In my opinion the biggest problem, besides the production/scheduling issues of episodes 19-26, is the questionable choice of introducing new characters and stories that are initially developed, but are interrupted ex abrupto in the last episode. However it is a very effective way to entice you to read the manga, because you want to know how the story ends!

On the other hand,is almost certain that for any story someone writes today, a similar one has been written or that part from the same premises; but the key thing is HOW a story is told, and here the anime does it great.The first part of the story tells of how the 2 protagonists manage to get together. Both wear a mask, and this is what makes them move away from each other and at the same time bring them closer: he falls in love with her fake personality and when he discovers her true personality he loses interest in her, while she falls in love with him only in the moment she finds out who he really is. Even if they are aware that they are wearing a mask, they still have a hard time understanding who they really are, and they need the help of each other to acknowledge the inability to fully understand oneself (it can be better understood from the way Anno gets into the characters' psyches and accentuates the moment with his directorial techniques).The second part instead talks about their relationship, interspersed with the stories of secondary characters that are equally interesting. Sometimes in a story, when two characters get together, occasionally that represents their point of arrival as if they have reached the maximum of their maturity, and they stop having any relevance within the story. What Kare Kano realizes is that the engagement is not an end point, but a starting point: They must face together new challenges, problems and difficulties that were not there before. The characters are all real, with their flaws and fears, and obstacles to overcome: there was at least one moment in our life when we found ourselves in the situations of each of the characters, and for this reason it is very easy to empathize with each of them. To conclude, the fast pacing of the story and Shiro Sagisu's music make it all the more memorable.Final Thoughts:KareKano is an anime with real characters lacking something they can only find in someone else, and with a story full of details that make it a hidden gem; a hidden rough gem, due to the inconclusiveness of the last episodes, but which contains an enjoyable experience that is worth having. later). Fortunately there's Hideaki Anno who manages to effectively exploit the budget and the number of animations available and manages to keep it a valid series through his style and his technique (Anno's style is often characterized by flat layers in parallax, the use of text, the cutaway shots of lightpoles/stoplights, the use of images from the manga itself). It is no coincidence that he managed to do the same with Evangelion in the last 2 episodes, and the 53-seconds elevator scene is an example.Episodes 19-26Episodes 1-18 worthily conclude the narrative arc of the 2 protagonists. In my opinion the biggest problem, besides the production/scheduling issues of episodes 19-26, is the questionable choice of introducing new characters and stories that are initially developed, but are interrupted ex abrupto in the last episode. However it is a very effective way to entice you to read the manga, because you want to know how the story ends!

It takes you all the way, from the moment they get to know eachother, becoming friends, becoming a couple, having to deal with their partners feelings, kissing and even sleeping together. All that (surprisingly) without relying on exaggerated love rivalry, parents/people trying to rip them apart or complete density of the main characters.In my opinion the biggest flaws of the show are two things;- The Art and Sound. You have to be aware of the fact that this anime already is around 20 years old, and you will...notice that in the audiovisual quality.- At least for the second half, it felt like they had to fill up on episodes, or simply didn't know what they want to do. It suddenly starts going all over the place. Ep 14 and 15 simply being recaps of Ep 1-13, some later ep also doing a recap, other eps covering completely irrelevant things, sometimes recaps at the beginning of an episode (or characters thinking the same things like a few episodes ago, just differently phrased), complete changes of art style, etc..In short, the second half mostly was pretty irritating and had basically nothing to do with the main couple anymore. Would've been better if they'd made it a 13 ep anime. notice that in the audiovisual quality.- At least for the second half, it felt like they had to fill up on episodes, or simply didn't know what they want to do.

What I got was a lovely story that, unfortunately, wasn't allowed to reach its full potential due to outside interference.Kare Kano is a story about two teenagers who are living a fake life, and how they lean on each other to, gradually, start showing more of their true selves. Arima and Yukino are a lovely couple, their interactions are always a delight to watch (I'd say there aren't enough), and the evolution of their relationship is done...in a respectful and interesting way.

She cares so much about putting on this facade, that she puts all of her efforts into getting as much praise as possible from everyone. But everything changes when she meets Soichiro Arima the first student to surpass her grades. At first, she feels threatened by his arrival and swears him to be her rival, but once Arima opens up to her and explains that...he also is putting on a facade to make himself out to be the ideal student to prove his worth to his adoptive family, the duo decides to stop pretending and to be their true selves. As they go on this journey together, their relationship slowly builds and goes from that of rivals to that of friends, to that of ""more-than-friends"" to that of lovers. It\'s a beautiful one to watch and probably my favorite in all of anime. However, the show does detract too much from their relationship and puts the focus too much on the shenanigans of their other friends and it sadly detracts from the show.Visuals: B *Aesthetically speaking, the animation style is pretty meh with lots of forgettable backgrounds, and side characters having weird designs without very much detail. And yet, since this is Hideaki Anno who was in charge of the series, there is a lot of charm that goes into the editing of the show. Unlike Eva which is slow and methodical in tone, His and Her Circumstances is hyper since it mostly follows the mindset of Miyazawa who has a very active thought-pattern. To reflect this, the art style changes a lot from the standard we see most of the time to a cuter chibi style with lots of phrases, thought bubbles, and all sorts of effects like blushing, moe blobs, and other goofy things popping up all over the screen making the show never seem to have a dull moment. And yet, since Arima does have a dark backstory, Hideaki Anno knows when to calm down with the edits and goes back to that slow and methodical approach which works well with Eva with Jean-Luc Godard-esque title cards appearing throughout as it dives deeper into Arima\'s psyche.Voice Acting: B- *Like usual, I went with the dub. The common theme of my review continues here. Arima and Miyazawa are both perfect. Kathleen McInerney is super energetic and playful voicing Miyazawa and her bubbly voice helps to make her character really likable even when she\'s being a competitive asshat. Whereas Christopher Yates is her polar opposite and has a much more relaxed and calming voice where he often feels compelled to apologize to Miyazawa for not being expressive enough to her. He\'s a recluse that is warming up to living a life filled with joy instead of only focussing on himself and his own success. Not just seeing his character change and become more open but hearing Arima\'s voice become more expressive as he opens himself up to Miyazawa was a real treat to watch. Most of the other voices were tolerable, but there were quite a few side characters with some irritable voices.Film Score/Soundtrack: B *It\'s 鷺巣詩郎 Shiro Sagisu as the composer. Of course the music is going to be excellent. I love that he reuses an Evangeliion track too and that one of these tracks gets used in the Neon Genesis Evangelion Rebuild films.***Favorite Track: Arima Souichirou II (Could easily put any of the Arima tracks in here since all of them have beautiful piano melodies. But only this one has these gorgeous strings to accompany it with a totally Eva sounding atmosphere.)***Bonus Track: Yume no Naka e III(The ending credits song played in a slower tone with gorgeous pianos and a plucked string sound before the cellos/violins bring it home. Incredible song.)Characters: C *The only characters worth a damn are Yukino Miyazawa, Soichiro Arima, and Hideaki Asaba because his wackiness is fun and he adds some comedy to Miyazawa and Arima\'s relationship by playing the third wheel to them while openly wanting Arima to himself so they can get all of the girls together. His character is absurd and over-the-top, but in the best of ways and I enjoyed every second of it. However, the other characters such as Miyazawa\'s father and sisters were over-the-top and goofy, the rival Tsubasa Shibahime was an over-the-top Shoujo trope that was obnoxious to watch. So glad that Arima didn\'t fall for her shit. And the other characters I didn\'t even care enough to remember their names. There are too many episodes focused on them and it takes away from how real Arima and Miyazawa\'s relationship is. If only the show focused more on them, cut out the side character-focused episodes, and went more into the future and the other problems that they would face as they decide their college and what they want to do with their lives. Sigh...Cringeworthy Anime Moments: Despite avoiding some of the annoying Shoujo tropes of characters being too scared to say what\'s on their minds, it doesn\'t avoid the classic rival female friend of the male protagonist getting jealous and trying to ruin the relationship cliche or the over-the-top protective father cliche. And on top of it, much like several of Gainax\'s other shows, the humor of His and Her Circumstances is very hyper. While there are times the show seems to get a bit too extra, I actually enjoy it since we are pretty much inside Miyazawa\'s brain all the time and she is such a great character and it\'s fun to see how her brain works. My brain is very fast and moves into a bunch of tangents like hers too and I felt like it was an accurate depiction of what many weird people like me think in circumstances like hers.Opening Titles: This isn\'t the official intro visuals from the show but instead a compilation of things that happen in the show. Still, it is a good depiction of how unique and exciting the artwork of the show can be. As for the intro to self, if you don\'t find yourself singing ""YOU MAY DREAM!!!... something something..."" and then start to mumble the rest before the chorus hits and then you hit that last part ""KANAU YOU NIIIIII!!!!!!!"", can you really call yourself an anime otaku? I love this intro.Ending Titles *I will never understand why they opted to have the camera moving through buildings and other places to be what is shown for the end credits of each episode, but I\'ll be damned, it\'s fun to watch the screen move as the upbeat and catchy and ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE duet with the actual voice actor and actress of the sub plays at the end. Love the ending track too!Final Verdict: It was the end of episode 3 where I realized that ""His and Her Circumstances"" wasn\'t just a quirky, cute and super hyper romcom between two likable characters, but instead, an, adorable, unique, and heartwarming show between two interesting protagonists that progresses in a natural way as they help themselves be their true selves and to grows as individuals. This had the potential to be not just a good Shoujo, but an all-time great romance. It\'s such a shame that there are some unwatchably bad episodes and that it never got a proper ending. It\'s so hard to figure out how to rate a show that I adore some aspects of yet disliked so many others. This is the type of show that I\'ll be thinking about a lot in the future and will feel nostalgia for when I hear the music from it and when others talk about Arima and Miyazawa. But to say I enjoyed watching it from beginning to end would be a lie. But the highs of this show are so worth it and will forever be a part of me.

The decision to watch it was made quickly and without thinking, so I had no idea who the creators were and I\'m not one to pay attention to credits at first. The initial impression I got was this unsettling feeling, and I was worried that something deeply wrong was going to happen. I even joked about how it reminded me of Evangelion before I found out Hideaki Anno was in fact involved, haha. I brushed that off as just his style of storytelling and things seemed to develop...normally.To get that out of the way, I really enjoyed the creativity in visually putting the episodes together. The animated comic panels, the shifts in artstyle, the clashing of real-life and cartoon and transitions between scenes were very interesting, and some artistic choices were downright hilarious. I\'d say that it felt at times like a high budget comic reading (as funny as that sounds, I think that\'s very creative). The only thing I could say that really bugged me were the endless recaps and repetitive soundtrack, but I think the team did well with what they had. With that said, I\'ll skip to the main subject I want to elaborate on.The characters, although banal at first glance, as you\'d expect with ""cheap"" romance (no offense to cheap romances though, they got their charm too) are treated like real people who act on real impulses. The main character, Miyazawa, lives in a happy home with her parents, two sisters and a puppy. She may not be rich, but she is not poor either. She\'s not spoiled, but she doesn\'t know how good she has it. She\'s aware of her assets and she uses her abilities to get ahead in life, no matter the cost. The only downside to this lifestyle is that she puts on a prissy facade to do so. Which isn\'t, actually, that bad of a thing. The only thing she\'s hiding is that she\'s just like everyone else.Her love interest, on the other hand, has been a posterchild of goodwill and selflessness. Not for his own sake, but to prove that he\'s worthy of being alive. His mask existed to support his survival after being told he\'s worthless since he was a small child and he grew to believe that at the core, he is a true monster undeserving of happiness. To him happiness was something to feel guilty about. Truth be told, he doesn\'t know who he is at all, and believes that his bad qualities must be the real personality shining through. I came to think that his selflessness isn\'t a mask at all, as his intelligence, athleticism and kindness really do come naturally. You can see that clearly when his and Miyazawa\'s grades drop at starkly different levels after they\'ve begun dating. He\'s a confused, lonely boy, and he\'s absolutely portrayed as such. He came to believe that he\'s wearing a mask because of how much he truly hates himself.Their shared idea of a ""true self"" is in actuality two different goals. The girl\'s goal was to loosen up not only part time, but full time, and fully let go of over-achieving. The boy\'s goal was letting his false perception of self to surface. Miyazawa thinks that being vulnerable and open on her part is just the same as on his part, and that their love will always be pure and fix whatever ails them. Their naivety slowly becomes their downfall. Both, who strongly opposed their teacher when confronted about their falling grades, believe that ideals they do not fully understand will lead them to happiness.It\'s such an on point depiction of how teenage romances are usually portrayed - the children\'s problems are always resolved by a beautiful speech about love and devotion, when in real life nobody lives the same exact experience and needs an individual, thorough response to their issues. After all, they\'re children, and they do not comprehend things on a larger scale, not yet. Even their parents enable that naivety, having led much different lives prior to settling down. Miyazawa\'s family believes that since she has been doing well so far, she will not fumble. Arima\'s parents are convinced that adopting a child and never speaking to him about his trauma will work itself out,  just because they don\'t beat him or berate him and provide him with a home. None of the parents mean for bad things to happen, they just share that idealised point of view of love prevailing in the end. You watch Arima become more and more possessive and Miyazawa thinking that it\'s sweet and flattering, and before that blows up in their faces, the season is over and you\'re left thinking... maybe their way of handling things might not be the right one?After I realised that, the uneasiness made sense. normally.To get that out of the way, I really enjoyed the creativity in visually putting the episodes together.

With that said, I\'ll skip to the main subject I want to elaborate on.The characters, although banal at first glance, as you\'d expect with ""cheap"" romance (no offense to cheap romances though, they got their charm too) are treated like real people who act on real impulses. The main character, Miyazawa, lives in a happy home with her parents, two sisters and a puppy. She may not be rich, but she is not poor either. She\'s not spoiled, but she doesn\'t know how good she has it. She\'s aware of her assets and she uses her abilities to get ahead in life, no matter the cost. The only downside to this lifestyle is that she puts on a prissy facade to do so. Which isn\'t, actually, that bad of a thing. The only thing she\'s hiding is that she\'s just like everyone else.Her love interest, on the other hand, has been a posterchild of goodwill and selflessness. Not for his own sake, but to prove that he\'s worthy of being alive. His mask existed to support his survival after being told he\'s worthless since he was a small child and he grew to believe that at the core, he is a true monster undeserving of happiness. To him happiness was something to feel guilty about. Truth be told, he doesn\'t know who he is at all, and believes that his bad qualities must be the real personality shining through. I came to think that his selflessness isn\'t a mask at all, as his intelligence, athleticism and kindness really do come naturally. You can see that clearly when his and Miyazawa\'s grades drop at starkly different levels after they\'ve begun dating. He\'s a confused, lonely boy, and he\'s absolutely portrayed as such. He came to believe that he\'s wearing a mask because of how much he truly hates himself.Their shared idea of a ""true self"" is in actuality two different goals. The girl\'s goal was to loosen up not only part time, but full time, and fully let go of over-achieving. The boy\'s goal was letting his false perception of self to surface. Miyazawa thinks that being vulnerable and open on her part is just the same as on his part, and that their love will always be pure and fix whatever ails them. Their naivety slowly becomes their downfall. Both, who strongly opposed their teacher when confronted about their falling grades, believe that ideals they do not fully understand will lead them to happiness.It\'s such an on point depiction of how teenage romances are usually portrayed - the children\'s problems are always resolved by a beautiful speech about love and devotion, when in real life nobody lives the same exact experience and needs an individual, thorough response to their issues. After all, they\'re children, and they do not comprehend things on a larger scale, not yet. Even their parents enable that naivety, having led much different lives prior to settling down. Miyazawa\'s family believes that since she has been doing well so far, she will not fumble. Arima\'s parents are convinced that adopting a child and never speaking to him about his trauma will work itself out,  just because they don\'t beat him or berate him and provide him with a home. None of the parents mean for bad things to happen, they just share that idealised point of view of love prevailing in the end. You watch Arima become more and more possessive and Miyazawa thinking that it\'s sweet and flattering, and before that blows up in their faces, the season is over and you\'re left thinking... maybe their way of handling things might not be the right one?After I realised that, the uneasiness made sense.', 'In the last few months, I\'ve been looking at some older anime romance series that have gotten some decent ratings.  His and Her Circumstances did come up in that search.  Someone I used to talk to about anime sent me a message a while ago and I mostly forgot about it until a few months before this review.  I decided to follow up on that message, finally!Story: Yukino and Souichirou are two top students in their class - they get very favourable grades, they\'re athletic and are very well liked by their classmates.  The beginning specifically focuses on Yukino, who does...just about everything to make sure her top spot is kept.  At home, however, Yukino is very laid back and doesn\'t act anything like she does at school.  Souichirou finds this out and, while at first he blackmails her, Yukino slowly realizes that they could be compatible after all.  They start dating and, honestly, there are many instances where they make quite a pretty cute couple.  This series does play out a lot like you might expect of some high schoolers, and when you can relate it, it pulls in the audience even more.  There\'s some pretty strong content written into the story too, which is impressive considering the year in which it was released.  The interactions between our main couple are really well played out.One thing I don\'t love about many of the episodes is the extensive use of monologuing.  It just happens way too often and while many fans won\'t mind this, I found it took some of the experience away from me.  Every so often isn\'t a bad thing because you get to hear what a character thinks in the moment, but when it occurs as often as this series uses them, you almost feel like you\'re listening to an anime, rather than watching it.Many of the episodes take some time to get us to know the backstory of several characters as well - including, but not limited to, Souichirou and side characters Tsubasa, Hideaki, Tsubaki and Takefumi.  All of their backstories are fascinating and very different from each other.  With 26 episodes to play with, I\'m glad they took the time to get us to know the side characters better.All that being said, the ending leaves a lot more to be desired.  It feels like the last few episodes don\'t really belong here because they focus on a student event, but they never execute it.  Much of the planning happens, but we don\'t get to see anything else about it after the initial episode.  It seems like a really strange way to end a series and the last episode doesn\'t even feel like a conclusion.  (7/10)Characters: Yukino and Souichirou, as alluded to above, are strong characters with some fascinating backstories to them.  Yukino tries to hide who she is at home from her classmates, even though she\'s seemingly perfect on the outside.  Souichirou has a past that he isn\'t particularly proud of, but gets exceptional grades, despite his past, which clearly haunts him.  While they more or less try and get through common problems together, you do sort of wish major points of contention were brought up more often.  Specifically, the last bunch of episodes don\'t really show them together all that much.As for your side characters, they all have strong points for what they are.  Hideaki is a bit of a weirdo, but he fits perfectly into the series.  It adds some comic relief and his interactions with Souichirou are fantastic.  Tsubasa is introduced a little later on and she has some pretty rough problems of her own.  What makes her stand out is how the group she\'s around attempt to help her through those problems and the result is really satisfying.  Takefumi doesn\'t have a great past either and works hard to try and better himself so that he\'s happy with his life.  For the most part, he\'s a fine character, but I feel like they didn\'t expand enough on his character.Characters are generally pretty strong, being propped up by a episodes that are dedicated to them.  Not everyone\'s likable - Tsubaki and Maho I feel were written in to be unlikable - but you don\'t hate any of them.  Even Yukino\'s dad got some spotlight later on.  So while you don\'t like the whole cast, you can certainly pick out some side characters and say they added well to the series.  (7/10)Art: When you\'re watching some older anime, the question that comes up is ""How well does it hold up today?"".  Sadly, this series does not hold up well - at least in my eyes.  The animation always feels lackluster and the series\' reliance on still-photos does beg a few questions.  They started doing them less in the late part of the series, but when you\'re watching our main couple in multiple still shots, it gets old.  There\'s also an episode in the middle where they use real-life backgrounds with cartoon-looking pictures as the character portraits and it really doesn\'t look good for me.  (2/10)Sound: If we\'re asking how the art holds up, we can also ask how the sound holds up, right?  Because, while the OST and tracks aren\'t super impressive, the VOs are.  Pre-2000, dubbing companies were very clearly still figuring out how to bring a strong audio presentation to the stage and this was executed really well.  Kathleen McInerney (Yukino) was fantastic.  Perfect, almost.  She\'s obviously known for her work in the Pokémon anime as Ash and his mother, but this would have been one of her early works too and she kills it.  Other veterans who grade out well here are Liam O\'Brien (Hideaki) and Megan Hollingshead (Kano).One minor thing I wanted to mention is that I love what they did with the episode previews.  You end up seeing two females talking into a mic, very expressively, about the next episode, in the recording studio.  In English, the VOs for that are Yukino\'s sisters (Megan Hollingshead and Jessica Calverro).  Obviously the audio isn\'t synced with what you see on screen, but the energy these two brought to an episode preview was impressive - and very different from what you see today.  (8/10)Overall Enjoyment: His and Her Circumstance is probably the most difficult I\'ve had grading out an anime series, ever.  The story they have in place is there, but the way it was executed leaves a lot more to be desired.  Normally, art styles don\'t bother me but I can\'t help but feel it took so much away from the experience.  If this was produced today, I feel like it would see widespread acceptance.  It\'s still good, but this may just be a case of a good anime with poor execution that didn\'t age all that well.  (6/10) just about everything to make sure her top spot is kept.

The main characters relationships develops very early in the anime, unlike those series where the literally spend the entire series goofing around and never confessing. There's a lot of time focused on the relationship itself, rather than the chase.Everything about it is great, but there's a simple reason why I rated it 1/10... The subs S-U-C-K. Whoever subbed this show, can go hang himself. Some episodes (if not all) are missing tons of subs throughout an episode. They'll speak back and forth with no lines subbed, then suddenly one line of sub appears and immediately disappears...again.

I heard it was about a fake bitch and a dude who wanted to blackmail her. I thought it was going to be a twisted romance with terrible people kinda like Phantom Thread. But they resolve and forgive all that by the second episode. Her being an attention seeking whore is practically forgotten by the 5th episode and the dude who blackmailed her was apparently never in the wrong to begin with. He ‘just wanted an excuse to talk to her’, which was the most disappointing part because when he was blackmailing her, his chipper...attitude was very entertaining. Him smiling so genuinely while saying despicable shit made him a very fun and interesting character. But alas they both turn into bland and cliche perfect protagonists who you’d never be able to tell were malicious whatsoever. The comedy was bland, the drama was dumb and I gave up 7 episodes before the finale. Every problem that crops up in this show is just resolved within the episode or in the next. Old anime is cringe in a different sense and it’s weird seeing how it (d)evolved. Still the paper puppets and paper animation in the last episode I did watch was pretty neat.BRO Aparrently this ass show was made by the same guy who did Evangelion what the fuck?! attitude was very entertaining.

It showed how Emilia was treated by villagers and how SHE treated them in return. It also showed her daily life, how she earned her livelihood before she was selected as a candidate for Lugunica's queen, her relationship with Puck, her first meeting with Puck, a little about Elior forest (her home), her powers, etc. There are also some decent (but short) fighting scenes involving Emilia and Puck plus some badass Emilia scenes in which she gets really angry. And after the credits, we have a lovely Emilia and Subaru interaction to lighten...up the mood.Btw this OVA only gave a glimpse of her past. There were still many unanswered questions (like frozen statues of people and how Emilia was frozen herself) and unnamed foes who are yet to appear and will hopefully be covered in season 2. We also get to see a little glimpse of season 2; that is, a little tease on Petelgeuse's backstory, an unknown voice at the start and Emilia's relatives.Art 10/10The art was just as good (if not better) as in season 1 so nothing to complain about.Sound 10/10Loved the OST. They really amplified the emotions in certain scenes. And the credit song was lovelyCharacter 10/10I'll just be straightforward. Emilia is beyond selfless. If anything, Subaru wasn't wrong when he called her EMT (angel), EMF (fairy) or EMM (goddess). We already know from season 1 how most people in Lugunica hated her because she looked like witch of envy. Here we get to see Emilia's willingness to become friends with the villagers but sadly they treat her like a disease (so she hid her face mostly). They ran away whenever she went to the village and called her a witch except one old man who treated her kindly. Unfortunately, the villagers and even the kind old man betrayed her by confessing her location to some slave traders. But even so, she still cared more about those villagers than herself and tried to keep them safe disregarding her own safety. Even after she saved a family from monsters, they still insulted her and were scared of her instead of showing gratitude.Puck's relationship with Emilia was also highlighted here. His caring attitude towards her and willingness to protect her from any sort of harm (like a spirit named Melakuera who considered Emilia a threat due to her likeness to witch of envy) was admirable. We also get to see Puck's original form in this OVA which was not shown completely in season 1.Enjoyment 10/10Really enjoyed this OVA. Can't wait for season 2 tbh.

Although we did not get the full story of Melakuera as I've heard from the LN readers, I think his current presentation is pretty solid even if we aren't informed of how he became what he is now. However, there were some pacing issues and overall I enjoyed this less than the Memory Snow OVA.If you're an EMT fan, I would still recommend to give this a watch!Story 8/10:I liked how the story is conveyed by Emilia's repeated actions. It shows her daily...life in the village and as if everything she does is normal. The story jumps back and forth in time as we are shown flashbacks to Emilia's past and her dormant powers, which was hinted in the anime as well. The pacing has some issues though - overall I think they fit too much content in 80 min. Some parts went far longer than it should have, and some were over in an instant.Art 9/10:I like the details of the flame animations and how Puck's ability was portrayed/animated. The spirits were also nicely animated - they are shown to be sentient and react to the people around them. The detail of how the ice became blood red by draining the blood out of the living creature sent shivers down my spine - it was so beautiful yet horrific.Sound 9/10:I didn't feel like any sound was out of place, so overall it must have been great.Character 8/10:We're introduced to the people of the village and how they shun Emilia because she's an elf of the forest, at the start of the movie. Even with the hood that hides her identity, they could tell that she's an elf. I liked how the general store manager was portrayed - a caring old man but yet very human (as he is), acting in self-interest and also fearing the Witch.The Melakuera also makes his appearance, and although his backstory was not shown, we get that he is an ally of justice or at least a counterforce against evil. I liked how he spoke in ancient Japanese, which goes to show that he is pretty old.Enjoyment 7/10:Remember I said I liked Emilia's repeated actions? But I certainly did not enjoy the repeated fights that were basically two monsters blasting powers at each other. It reminds me a lot of Dragon Ball or Digimon. No strategy involved, just pure bruteforce and the power of will/friendship. There was no fun in most of the fights, though we do get character development during then. I think the main problem is the lack of hype and tension building.One thing I enjoyed - and I'm sure everyone else did - was when Puck let his guard down when he accidentally hurt Emilia's feelings.

However if you are an Emilia Fan, a Rem fan, or yes a Felix fan, You should watch this ova because it will enlight the past that one of the main characters (Emilia) passed trought.It will fill you with a lot of emotions from cute moments to extremely sadness moments. the fights are also pretty enjoyable but obviously not like a fight genre anime.  The sound in my opinion are one of the best parts...of this masterpiece because they are always in good time with the moment and the environment. And the ending is something heartbreaking.You should watch also the trailer that is well done.I hope i helped you of this masterpiece because they are always in good time with the moment and the environment. And the ending is something heartbreaking.You should watch also the trailer that is well done.I hope i helped you', ""After season 2 was announced to be delayed until summer, I feel into deep depression. I really love the Re:zero series and I wish we had more content. Fortunately, the new OVA/Movie blu-ray released a few days ago and finally got to watch it, but is it good?Story 9/10: This ova takes place before Emilia met Subaru and the others. We get to find out more about Emilia and how she lived her daily life away with barely any social interactions from anyone, aside from Puck (and maybe you can count the market guy from the village). The thing is that at the time, everyone...hates Emilia because they think that she's a witch, which is a reason why she lives alone. Additionally we get to find out more about Puck and how he met Emilia. Overall the story is really great, however, you need to keep in mind that this OVA only gives a glimpse of Emilia's past, and moreover doesn't answer major things, such as why Emilia is treated like a witch, but it does answer a few minor stuff in case you're wondering, such as why Puck calls Emilia his daughter.Art 8/10: I really liked the art and how White fox utilized it to convey the atmosphere of different scenes. An example in particular that I liked is the use of the red colouring in the ice, in order to portray a horrific atmosphere. Speaking of ice, if you're a fan of ice powers, you're going to love this OVA. White fox did an incredible job in animating the ice powers and other stuff, such as the spirits and mixture of red and blue fire. The animation was pretty good in some scenes, however, I felt like it was lacking in the fight scenes and there's barely any action on the first half of the OVA so I was expecting better when it came to the fights, but it doesn't have a huge impact on the enjoyment of the ova, so I guess it's fine.Sound 8/10: The OST was pretty great overall and I liked how it was utilized in the appropriate scenes and atmospheres. The ending theme was also great as it is a relaxing song, which fits in the atmosphere and surroundings of the OVA to an extent, with Emilia living a silent life without having much social interactionCharacters 10/10: There's barely a cast of characters in the ova as the main cast is Emilia and Puck (and a few other minor characters), but I feel that's the reason why I gave this section a 10/10. It gave Emilia and Puck more time to express their emotions and thoughts. My favourite of course is Emilia. After I finished the ova I completely agreed with Subaru complimenting her. Even due to her conditions, Emilia is such a kind soul, and that's demonstrated in her repetitive actions. Even if all the villagers hated her, she still showed care about them (which is further proved later in the OVA), and I really loved her at the end of the OVA where she got to express her feelings in front of the evil spirit and Puck. Puck is also an amazing character. He is aware of Emilia's conditions, and instead of being scared or running away, he sticks by her side all the time. I really liked how they handled Pucks internal monologue in the text flashing to show his feelings. Even though we got like 4 secs to read them, it was pretty cool and it reminded me of the monogatari series. At the end, Puck also gets to express his emotions in front of Emilia, which made me to respect him even more.Overall 9/10: This OVA was great and it was a great opportunity to learn more about Emilia and Puck ans their place in life, even though it was a small glimpse of their past. If you're a hardcore re:zero fan or a fan of the anime in general, I highly recommend to watch this OVA, it will make you have more respect for both Emilia and Puck hates Emilia because they think that she's a witch, which is a reason why she lives alone. Additionally we get to find out more about Puck and how he met Emilia. Overall the story is really great, however, you need to keep in mind that this OVA only gives a glimpse of Emilia's past, and moreover doesn't answer major things, such as why Emilia is treated like a witch, but it does answer a few minor stuff in case you're wondering, such as why Puck calls Emilia his daughter.Art 8/10: I really liked the art and how White fox utilized it to convey the atmosphere of different scenes. An example in particular that I liked is the use of the red colouring in the ice, in order to portray a horrific atmosphere. Speaking of ice, if you're a fan of ice powers, you're going to love this OVA. White fox did an incredible job in animating the ice powers and other stuff, such as the spirits and mixture of red and blue fire. The animation was pretty good in some scenes, however, I felt like it was lacking in the fight scenes and there's barely any action on the first half of the OVA so I was expecting better when it came to the fights, but it doesn't have a huge impact on the enjoyment of the ova, so I guess it's fine.Sound 8/10: The OST was pretty great overall and I liked how it was utilized in the appropriate scenes and atmospheres. The ending theme was also great as it is a relaxing song, which fits in the atmosphere and surroundings of the OVA to an extent, with Emilia living a silent life without having much social interactionCharacters 10/10: There's barely a cast of characters in the ova as the main cast is Emilia and Puck (and a few other minor characters), but I feel that's the reason why I gave this section a 10/10. It gave Emilia and Puck more time to express their emotions and thoughts. My favourite of course is Emilia. After I finished the ova I completely agreed with Subaru complimenting her. Even due to her conditions, Emilia is such a kind soul, and that's demonstrated in her repetitive actions. Even if all the villagers hated her, she still showed care about them (which is further proved later in the OVA), and I really loved her at the end of the OVA where she got to express her feelings in front of the evil spirit and Puck. Puck is also an amazing character. He is aware of Emilia's conditions, and instead of being scared or running away, he sticks by her side all the time. I really liked how they handled Pucks internal monologue in the text flashing to show his feelings. Even though we got like 4 secs to read them, it was pretty cool and it reminded me of the monogatari series. At the end, Puck also gets to express his emotions in front of Emilia, which made me to respect him even more.Overall 9/10: This OVA was great and it was a great opportunity to learn more about Emilia and Puck ans their place in life, even though it was a small glimpse of their past. If you're a hardcore re:zero fan or a fan of the anime in general, I highly recommend to watch this OVA, it will make you have more respect for both Emilia and Puck"", ""Like another review mentioned, this is 40-50 minutes longer than it should be. They tried to turn a short OVA into a movie. Even if properly edited and paced, very little is actually revealed or actually transpires. You learn that Puck is protecting Emilia from a fire spirit and the two form a contract to fight it, win against this self-proclaimed arbiter, and then profess their love for each other and intentions to leave the forest. There is very little substance otherwise. The dialogue is repetitive, vague, meandering, and abstract. There is very little revelation about Emilia's past, how she actually met Puck, or why...he is infatuated with her. It's really only a retelling of that single point in time where they fight the fire spirit and not much else. The animation and sound are fine, no different than the anime, meaning it's far from movie quality. There are some cool icicle spell effects and fire beams juxtaposed with terrible two frame gifs of swirling fire or breaking ice. Half the stills of Puck's beast form look lazily drawn and rather deformed. The pseudo-movie in general felt very slow and underwhelming and would have been better incorporated into the anime as a flashback. he is infatuated with her.

The story revolves around Emilia and Puck's relationship from a time before Subaru came into their lives and that alone is interesting enough to explore but the way that it was done was terrible. It's a 30-45 minute long story being extended to the 1h20 mark and obviously...that makes anything become boring and just a bit of a chore to watch. It's one of those examples where a good idea is poorly executed and because of that the end result also turns out to be underwhelming.All things considered, it's a 5/10 for me. that makes anything become boring and just a bit of a chore to watch.

It was nice to see the forest and its inhabitants, Emilia\'s routine before the main series and her attachment to the village, but that is where the fun ends.This movie is about 40 minutes longer than its content really deserves and it keeps repeating itself so much that it\'s impossible to get an emotional response out of what is supposed to be the high points of its development. Too often it became...clear that there simply wasn\'t enough plot to drive dialogue for as long as the writer had planned action and emotional scenes.P.S.

For hours, she sat in the background with all the depth of the boisterous fruit seller from episode one, waiting to be written into an actual character and leaving us to wonder what could possibly sway Subaru to such undying devotion - and, more importantly, what grounds he has to make...such extravagant promises.  It's more than a question of why Subaru looks at Emilia instead of Rem (which is a pretty big question), but a question of how a character so devoid of charisma and personality could possibly be the linchpin of Re:Zero's sprawling mythology: candidate for the throne, Witch of Envy (?), surrogate daughter of Puck, guest of Roswaal's manor, patron of Subaru's knighthood, and all without displaying any particular development beyond her initial appearance.  I was seriously wondering whether Re:Zero had the storytelling chops to pull off another Rem-style reversal and reveal that Emilia had actually been an interesting character all along.Well, it doesn't seem entirely fair for that heavy recontextualization to come by way of an OVA rather than being built into the series proper, but Frozen Bonds is the window into Emilia's mind that the franchise has been sorely lacking.  At last, I feel that I have a sense of who Emilia is and what her personality is like when she is not awkwardly fending off Subaru's overly genki barrage.  I don't dislike Subaru - in fact, I consider him one of the series's strong points - but once he decided that Emilia was perfect, we never again had any opportunity to ask why.  While other characters can hold their own against Subaru's onslaught of unrestrained protagonism, Emilia is a soft-spoken recluse who struggles to claim her own screen time; though she never outright spurns Subaru's advances, it's clear that she doesn't know how to react to receiving such positive and overwhelming attention, and Frozen Bonds sheds some light on why that is.Unlike the series proper and the OVA, Frozen Bonds actually excites me about future installments as opposed to making me wonder why the one I just watched wasn't better.  Emilia has a traumatic past that we have only glimpsed, but at last we have glimpsed it, instead of just hearing characters make offhand remarks every few episodes; her years of isolation, with only Puck to call a friend, fostered deep fragility and insecurity, which the pressures placed upon her in the series have only exacerbated, and her ignorance of her origins has tortured her as much as the seemingly unjustified hatred and torment she suffers at the hands of all those around her.  Seeing how twisted her life has been and how suffocated her personality has been for all this time, it kind of makes Subaru look like a cad and a dolt when he gallivants around the land singing empty-headed praises for her.  He might as well be a viewer talking about his waifu for all that he understands about her.The conflicts Emilia faces here provide the background to make her not just a character, not just a sympathetic character, but a tragic character, and they add an equally substantial weight to her relationship with Puck.  Suddenly, the entire balance of Re:Zero has shifted - not only does Emilia seem a worthy romantic adversary to Rem, but I am eager to see further development in her story and return to the parent series with all of this context now in tow.  It's like watching Lord of the Rings only to find out at the end that Sam was a more powerful wizard than Gandalf all along.We also get to see Emilia shred the slopes of her mountain home, so that's neat. such extravagant promises.

Stretched out beyond any reasonable purpose and full of incomplete story elements, it does a better job of highlighting the problems some people have with Re:Zero than the enjoyable aspects that others would have surely hoped for here.Review in full:As a small part of a large story, Re:Zero was bound to leave a lot of questions open after its first season.  This was something which ended up being a considerable problem for many viewers who would rather not wait multiple cours to...see certain major characters fleshed out or important lore expanded upon, much less wait multiple years for a new animated season.  Perhaps this led to undue expectations being placed upon The Frozen Bond, a prequel project which appeared to promise some backstory and answers surrounding two of Re:Zero’s more ambiguous characters. However, when it doesn’t appear to serve much more purpose than either that or padding between seasons, it becomes challenging to justify it as anything other than a hollow holdover.Framed as an inner reflection Emilia has after the events of Memory Snow, The Frozen Bond centers around the relationship between herself and her guardian spirit Puck, and how it came to be that way for Emilia. One wouldn’t be blamed for thinking this would go on to expand Emilia’s character, yet it doesn’t so much as attempt to. The Frozen Bond is unquestionably about Emilia, and yet refuses to answer any real questions about her, and the main series had left many by this point. Despite spending a lot of time beating around the bush on the circumstances surrounding Emilia’s isolation in the Elior Forest, none of it offers any new perspective on who exactly Emilia is. This orbiting issue wouldn’t be so disappointing if it wasn’t the event the entire story revolves around and continually brings up to offer as an explanation for most of the story’s other events.  By displaying so little character when given the spotlight for so long, Emilia only ends up appearing shallower.The only other character to speak of is Puck, who does end up getting fleshed out over the course of this largely Emilia-centric story. The mystery surrounding him works much better not just because there’s some answers provided as payoff to the inevitable questions, but because of how much more dynamic Puck ends up being than anything else The Frozen Bond offers. His wit appears to be backed by experience, his motivations pondered over, and his side of the relationship with Emilia (unlike Emilia’s side which can be chalked up to pure circumstance) organically developed. Sadly, his role in all of this is treated as a secondary concern, often getting brushed aside and inevitably left much less complete than it could have been.Instead, The Frozen Bond devotes much of the time it isn’t vaguely and fruitlessly hinting at Emilia’s backstory on attempting to make the antagonists look like actual characters. Chap is a one-dimensional thug whose ill-defined drive of “revenge” fails to justify why anger is his sole trait. Meanwhile, Melakuera is just a spirit automaton, yet there is an ample yet pointless attempt at making it seem to be more than that. It follows reasoning that falls apart with just a handful of questions and rules that Puck quickly dismantles the validity of (and yet it still follows them). Perhaps Melakuera exists to point to the unfairness of Emilia’s situation, but Chap already bumbled his way into proving that, as shallow as he is, long before Melakuera even became relevant.The whole product suffers the effects of being stretched out much further than it had any right to be. The full extent of Emilia’s backstory that was covered could have been the side plot of a regular anime episode, yet it encompasses the majority of this feature-length entry. Chap & Melakuera’s situations add nothing substantial to the story as a whole either, and while more time could have been spent on Puck, that’s ultimately a separate story from the one being told here. Even the production quality takes a hit, with soundwork that (unusually for Re:Zero) struggles to even have one decent, memorable aspect, and visuals that slowly degrade from pretty, fluid, & clear to rough slideshows that can’t even bother to show (what would have been) the climatic final action scene. Why build up to it in the first place if the result is obvious and the production is too burnt out to do it justice anyhow? Unfortunately, it would only be fair to ask that of nearly every other element of The Frozen Bond, as none of it justifies itself any better.Verdict:Presented with an opportunity to address some of the fundamental problems of Re:Zero, Frozen Bond instead deepens them.  Stretching this half-baked backstory to twice the length needed to tell it only serves to make its pointlessness more apparent, especially at the point of the main story it suggests itself to be relevant.

Coming off the heels of Re:Zero, everything that Frozen Bond has to offer is a huge change of pace from the central premise of the series, and in all of the best ways possible.This prequel to Re:Zero focuses on further developing Emilia and Puck as central characters. It gives the essentials of both of their backstories, as well as what their lives were like predating Emilia's inclusion into a more noble, refined life.

Boring, repetitive dialogue that just drags, not from Emilia, but from the new spirit character.

While waiting for it, it\'s best to start watching both OVA (Memory Snow) and Prequel (Frozen Bonds) of the series. In fact, I would say ""Re:Zero Frozen Bonds"" is a must-watch prequel before moving on to the second season. The OVA and Prequel is also somehow connected so I would suggest watching ""Re:Zero: Memory Snow"" first.""Re:Zero: Frozen Bonds"" is a sneak peek of Emilia\'s tragic backstory, where it took place in a Frozen Forest. In this prequel,...you\'ll get to know more about Emilia\'s character and the perceptions of the living beings that surrounds her (villagers and spirits). You\'ll also get to see Puck\'s struggles in making a choice between pledge or love. Later on, Emilia gets to know more about her identity and why her existence is a sin in itself.I appreciate how the creators planned to make a movie for Emilia alone. I think the first season was overwhelmed with Rem\'s love and loyalty, and some of us doesn\'t think of Emilia\'s role that much because of her lack of involvement in those intense tragedies. The prequel is also a preparation for additional details of Emilia\'s history in the second season. I think most of the Re:Zero fans out there already knew that Rem\'s screen time will be short, which is a little bit sad for Rem\'s supporters (including me). Despite of that, the movie gave me a new ""face"" of Emilia which convinced me to appreciate her more.Emilia is selfless, she thinks more of the well-being of others more than herself. But her situation also led her to think that she also deserves to be happy. She\'s also very stubborn, similar to Subaru\'s level of stubbornness. Though their difference is Subaru\'s selfishness.The overall sneak peek of Emilia\'s history is good for me. There\'s still a lot of missing details in it and I think it will be filled later on in the second season. The fighting scenes are fine, they\'re not really jaw-dropping or anything. There\'s no epic fighing moments for me, it\'s just a bunch of magical blows and a one-sided match which is not really appealing to my eyes. Overall, it\'s just an important prequel where you\'ll get to know more about Emilia\'s personality, her relationship with Puck, and her identity. Ja Matane! you\'ll get to know more about Emilia\'s character and the perceptions of the living beings that surrounds her (villagers and spirits). You\'ll also get to see Puck\'s struggles in making a choice between pledge or love. Later on, Emilia gets to know more about her identity and why her existence is a sin in itself.I appreciate how the creators planned to make a movie for Emilia alone. I think the first season was overwhelmed with Rem\'s love and loyalty, and some of us doesn\'t think of Emilia\'s role that much because of her lack of involvement in those intense tragedies. The prequel is also a preparation for additional details of Emilia\'s history in the second season. I think most of the Re:Zero fans out there already knew that Rem\'s screen time will be short, which is a little bit sad for Rem\'s supporters (including me). Despite of that, the movie gave me a new ""face"" of Emilia which convinced me to appreciate her more.Emilia is selfless, she thinks more of the well-being of others more than herself. But her situation also led her to think that she also deserves to be happy. She\'s also very stubborn, similar to Subaru\'s level of stubbornness.

Ja Matane!', ""Ever wondered why Emilia-tan major tenshi?Re:Zero Frozen Bonds is an important movie in the Re:Zero franchise that gives us backstory into Emilia, who previously had little to no backstory given to us in the 2 cours of the original show. Surprisingly, this OVA managed to tie together the almost slice of life style of episode that the previous OVA captured, while still giving some major backstory to the deuteragonist, Emilia.Story-wise, this OVA shined, just on a content standpoint. The OVA presented vast amounts of new information that had previously been a mystery to viewers, such as part of Emilia's origin story, the meeting with Puck,...and exactly what she was doing in the forest before Roswaal picked her up. The narrative of this story flowed together, and you could definitely feel the build-up throughout the OVA. If there's one thing that I have to say about the story, however, it's that there are a lot of unanswered questions that I still have. Overall, I'd say that this is a great way to convince someone to read the LN.Given the great work that White Fox did on the anime, and the first OVA, you can expect this to reflect the same. The crystals pop out on screen, and the lighting effects done during the battles are done very well. Overall, very comparable to what you've seen in the regular show.The ending theme sells the OVA. Literally, that ending theme for me is similar to how it feels when Stay Alive starts blasting at the end of an emotional episode. Also, credit does need to be given to Puck's VA. The performance given in this OVA is exemplary.As stated above, this OVA serves to further Emilia's backstory, while also giving insight as to why Puck acts the way he does. However, in its rawest form, this is the entire point of the OVA. You watch this OVA to find out character backstory, and you expect that. While yes, this OVA doesn't disappoint and gives you exactly what you want, it is somewhat lacking in the fact that there are more questions that I have raised than were answered. These are questions that may or may not be answered even in the light novels, but still, they are now things I'll think harder about coming into season 2.I'm not sure how you could watch this and not enjoy it, seeing as how it's an OVA meant for those who have already finished the main show, plus the first OVA. You'd have to either be masochistic or forced to watch if you've gotten this far and dislike the show. Overall, the new additions to the Re:Zero anime from the light novels are enjoyable to watch. Both the first OVA and this one truly show character chemistry at work. and exactly what she was doing in the forest before Roswaal picked her up.

He\'s doing what he always does, protects Emilia and tells her how great she is.Do you expect Emilia to break out of her damsel-in-distress archetype? Being kind is still her only defining trait.This movie could easily be turned into regular 20 minutes episode, it\'d still be poor but we wouldn\'t waste so much time on watching this ultimately pointless story. I regeret wasting mine knowing I wouldn\'t miss anything if I just carried straight into season 2.

This is a short movie so the story keeps things very simple and it works!What I like about it is the setting of a frozen wood and the contextualization of Emilia's relationship with people, even some of her background. Animation is ok and the voice acting is good!There were quite a lot of things I didn't like. The design of the baddies is terrible. The dialogues, especially with the two main antagonists is is as bad as their design - it isn't believable, interesting nor does it make any sense! It's just arbitrary bad guy posturing....Another thing is that everything about Emilia's past is kept decidedly vague, and even some main plot points that are meant to be understood from the start are simply not communicated.This is the problem, there is a good premise here, but the story feels irrelevant and arbitrary. In that way it feels like an baddie of the week DBZ-movie.I still enjoyed it, but I can't say it was very good compared to the TV-anime.

It felt like an emotional, sometimes joyful but mostly lonely, journey through Emilias past.And don't stop at the credits!

Just like how slowly the author of re zero develop subaru, i think it applies the same concept towards emilia which she started to become likable in season 2 part2.The OST:-I think white fox studio nailed at most moments throughout this OVA and i have very little things to complaint. It hits at the time when it needed to make the audience felt what we should felt.Animation and Art:-It's good. Not the best or on par like KyoAni studio level, but it captured most moments beautifully, sure it has tiny flaws but it isnt really noticable.

And so on. The emotional impact of a scene hinges on how much the viewer knows about the events that lead to said scene. If the viewer knows nothing... then, chances are, they will feel nothing.This is the problem with Frozen Bonds. Buildup is essential for emotional impact. Frozen...Bonds has no buildup, and that's why it has no emotional impact.We don't know why the great spirits (and, apparently, the rest of the world) want to eliminate Emilia. We don't know why Puck cares about her. We don't even know what the great spirits, or Puck, or Emilia, are. We know literally nothing about anything that's happening. So why should the viewer care?As much as I would like to root for Puck, who's fighting against (supposedly) the entirety of the world to protect Emilia, which is certainly a badass / touching thing to do on a conceptual level... it's really hard to care when you have no clue why this conflict is even happening. For all the viewer knows, Emilia could actually be a puppet with a fake personality whose very existence will eventually destroy the world, and Puck could simply be simping for her for reasons that no could empathize with. The writer gives no indications in either direction. So, unless you already love Emilia and Puck, it's really hard to care.There's another issue caused by lack of buildup: we don't know how powerful Puck and Emilia are relative to their enemies. Which is unfortunate, because, if Puck was depicted as being weaker than, say, the other great spirits, then him challenging the others would be interesting purely by virtue of this imbalance in powers. After all, people like to root for the underdog. Seeing a weaker party emerge victorious in a conflict is often exciting simply because it's an unexpected result (though of course, in fiction, this is only true when the plot is bound by realism). But as far as the viewer can tell, Puck has the ability to destroy the world, which means that him challenging the rest of the world is literally just him flexing his powers. Which isn't very badass at all; it's just another character flaunting the powers that the writer arbitrarily decided to bestow upon them.On a final note, it's easy to notice that the basic premise in Frozen Bonds is strikingly similar to that of one of the more famous arcs in a certain popular, long-running anime series. The comparison makes Frozen Bonds all the more disappointing; it shows just how powerful this type of plot can be when executed correctly. Frozen Bonds tried to simplify the plot to the bare minimum, which, of course, doesn't work, because you can't have emotional impact without proper buildup. The end result is underwhelming at best.

From the short trailer I watched I had thought the OVA would feature Emelia\'s first meeting with Puck, but rather it showcased the beginnings of their relationship rather than the start. The small significance here is I felt for a 70 minute prequel special not a whole lot was really added to the viewers understanding of the story and world.

We get a slow burn of her every day happenings and prejudices she faces for being an elf. This however carries over into what was supposed to be the more action oriented second half of the OVA. There was some very cool effects and spell casting involved but most of the conflict in the special was standing and talking. A central theme revolves around Emelia\'s distaste for conflict, but the episode was definitely 10 - 15 minutes too long.This OVA was serviceable and while not as entirely pointless as Memory Snow it still doesn\'t add too much to relevant viewer knowledge going into the series\' second season.

I gotta be honest, I think the best part of this film was simply the relationship between Puck and Emilia getting developed. Seeing, not only how they met, but what they meant to each other was a nice backup for what we get in the main series. The art was also, of course, gorgeous. The fire effects, especially, blew me away. I’ve always thought this anime had some beautiful art elements, though.The...rest of the film was pretty average. I mean, the story that we get with Emilia is nice, and it provides further explanation into her mysterious character, but I didn’t feel like it was anything too special. That’s the thing, though, is I can’t really say this film was bad so much as it was “meh.” The pacing was fine, the story did develop Emilia (and Puck) as it was supposed to, and the emotional moments got me good. But the battles, the story itself, and the dramatic elements just felt underdone to me-- like it didn’t make much of a difference to the quality and content of the film. So, yeah. It wasn’t bad, it just wasn’t as amazing as the main series. It did still manage to get me excited for the upcoming season, though, so that’s more than enough for me. rest of the film was pretty average.

Conflicts in the OVA seemed a bit random, but that's honestly what I should come to expect now from the Re:Zero anime.

The music is on-par with what we see throughout season 1, and I really liked the ending theme.Character: 7 - Strong between our main charactersWe learn a lot about Emilia's character, and her protective/nurturing relationship with Puck. Throughout Frozen Bond, we experience more of Emilia's tragic struggle to balance her heart of gold against being constantly stigmatized and persecuted for her appearance. The challenges she endures leads to her aloof and cautious personality at the beginning of season 1. The bond that forms between her and Puck is significant to her character development, but in typical Re:Zero fashion, I'm now looking for a backstory FOR a backstory. Her opposition was the catalyst for these developments, but I didn't find the villains to be particularly interesting or sensible. Perhaps in the light novel they were more fleshed out, but in the OVA they just seem like random obstacles to give Emilia a hard time for no other reason than to push her over the edge. I mean the closest thing to a main villain is a flaming horse that spouts nonsense. We do get to see Emilia kick some ass on her own for a change, which is a welcome shift from Subaru's constant simping.Enjoyment: 5 - Gave some good contextWe got some good character development, but not nearly as much as I would have liked. Characters seemed a little too emotional. The combat, while animated well, kind of lacked grace for me. The little melee combat we saw didn't have any intricacy to it, and the rest of the combat was essentially DBZ-style back and forth energy blasts.Overall: 6 - What we neededFrozen Bond was the story arc that Emilia and Puck needed. The anime is sort of at fault for turning Emilia into a helpless damsel in distress. The OVA succeeded by making her into a much more 3-dimensional character who knows how to kick ass, but explains why she is in a vulnerable mental state by the time our loveable simp Subaru enters the story. insight from the flashback definitely makes the events of season 2 more meaningful.

On one hand, I appreciated how she embodies the pain suffered by discrimination victims, lots of scenes of the film perfectly communicate her sense of sorrow, even on a visual level we have lots of iconic and beatiful scenes. But on the other hand, Emilia is still too perfect, too good as a person, never showing any kind of flaws or negative feelings towards other (except probably an ambiguous scene in the middle of the film, but...I don't think that was enough by itself), and this brings to simplify the themes she embodies. This flaw is even more annoying considering she is always paired by immoral, flawed and well-written characters. Talking about Puck, he is the real star of the film, there are still lots of mysteries surrounding his relationship with Emilia, but we can see him genuinely attached to her, a real father-like figure making even atrocious things just to protect her and to see her smile, which is a side of Puck almost ignored by the main series. A minor issue is about one of the villain, especially his introduction, I have found him a caricature, excessively hateful in every aspect, and the cheap cliche of sexual harassment was annoying.

Movie that explains origins of relationship between Puck and Emilia. Doesn\'t contribute anything to overall plot of Re:Zero. Antagonists shown are single use, shallow characters with no real motivation but ""half-breed bad, half-breed die"".Longer:TBH, does anyone actually care about Emilia in Re:Zero? I love watching Subaru suffer and despair; Subaru didn\'t appear in this movie. Art and sound are still good, but Emilia\'s character still annoys me. Yeah, she\'s lonely, yeah, she\'s had quite the secluded life, but throughout the series and movie, she experiences no growth.Recommendation: Don\'t watch this movie. Better support the light novels author...and read light novel, it\'s much more enjoyable and story is broader and deeper in LN. If you want anime either re-watch the series or try out Mirai Nikki or Erased. Both share thematic similarities with Re:Zero. and read light novel, it\'s much more enjoyable and story is broader and deeper in LN.

It's probably best worth watching after season 1. There isn't an explanation of why the witch is bad either. Overall, not impressed, animation was good...and the ost was good.

Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan (2023),https://myanimelist.net/anime/50613/Rurouni_Kenshin__Meiji_Kenkaku_Romantan_2023,"[""In narrative terms, it fulfilled one of my biggest wishes, which was that the gimmicks and euphemisms would be reduced. Characteristics that are present in the first version and that are typical of its time. Well, in the past they made adaptations that seemed almost apart from the original with so many changes, in order to make the works lighter, childish, longer and very authorial by the director. Also, in this new version, they didn't do it in a way that was compressing everything at a rushed pace, as they usually do in remakes. The proof of this is that, in the first three episodes,...they adapted close to a chapter and a half per episode, demonstrating an unhurried pace. It is also important to point out that this version is very faithful to the manga, but it is not completely faithful. Acquiring an identity of its own, with changes only in specific aspects that generally improve the source material. In this way, management demonstrated a more respectful posture following modern standards of adaptation. This alone justifies the need for this anime to exist and be watched.Another feature that draws attention is the comic part, which was quite lame in the first version, being a trademark of the title and which has been greatly softened in the current one. Although this comic bias of the old one is good, it was never what made this work giant. Not to mention that it is a bias characteristic of an era, which is currently dated and would not be successful with the new generations. Furthermore, it would be unjustifiable to redo and follow up on something identical to what has already been done. In this way, I fully understand the motivations for the changes and I fully agree with a more sober version, as the serious tone combines much better with the premise of the work, especially in relation to the protagonist. However, it's not as serious as the tone given to the films and OVAs, which prove to be enjoyable. Therefore, it ends up having a certain originality, considering that the manga is not nearly as comical as the first anime version, but it is still much more comical than the new version.The first adaptation visually today does not seem remarkable, but at the time it was released it was above average, so much so that it remains quite acceptable. Highlight for the action scenes, which still manage to draw more attention than in this 2023 version. With that I am not saying that, in terms of the image, the current version is bad. Because it gave a good makeover, which was necessary, in addition to improving colors, shadows and details. It's just not as exquisite to make an impression as the first version when it was released, being merely good enough to be admissible and to be partially justifiable. Some other changes may be questionable, such as the protagonist's scar being less prominent, Kenshin's face becoming more rounded and his size apparently being smaller.A rurouni is a samurai who no longer has a master, a person who has no meaning for his existence, he is a wanderer who moves like the waves of the sea. There is depth in the characters of this anime because they are people who were part of the samurai class, which at that time portrayed in the work ceased to exist overnight with the end of the shogunate and with the return of powers to the emperor after about 700 years. All members of the samurai caste started to have no direction and entered a collective identity crisis, considering that the emperor imposed the end of feudalism in Japan. Taking a ronin who would naturally be aimless, to symbolize this dilemma of an entire class, making this plot a journey to find a new path in an era of peace, is a very right idea.The work presents an existential journey from which it becomes rich, for doing so through contradictions. The protagonist just being a ronin would already be feared, but he is especially respected for being a shredder, for being extremely strong and also a hero who had his responsibility for the end of the previous regime. Ironically, the fact that makes him a hero is the same thing that ended his caste and the path he decided to follow for the new era is to be a pacifist. The protagonist in this journey confronts the decay of his class and faces other highly skilled samurai who seek other paths. Conflicts in which he enters defending the values and virtues of the samurai, while carrying regrets, resentments and regrets. Despite the protagonist facing other samurai, the work sells the idea of him as the last samurai. This is evident by his upholding values that few hold, and by carrying a sword when they became forbidden, making him unique. It is worth mentioning that Kenshin's sword has an inverted blade, this is important to demonstrate how powerful he is and that he prefers to hurt himself than to kill someone again.Another factor that demonstrates that we are seeing the last samurai, at least along the ancient lines, is Kenshin's refusal to take a disciple and not wanting his supreme fighting style to be passed on to the next generation. The protagonist accepts the end, it is a message of resignation and altruism, which only finds comfort in a new beginning intoxicated by an ideal of peace. This brings up another point, that this journey does not offer a path for everyone. The answer that this work offers is the journey itself, it is individual, where each person needs to seek their own purpose in the world within an era of peace.The dramas have always been the most striking point of this work, all in a historical context, with elements of heroism, morality and romance. Comedy stands out, but ends up being a complementary relief for a deep, reflective, poetic and sad message. Therefore, a more serious tone is more adequate to highlight such characteristics and make the plot more believable. This means that if this version stays that way and adapts to everything, it will be the definitive one and superior to the first one. In this way, it offers a good reason for those already familiar with this work to follow this new version. For those who don't know the work, I suggest that you get rid of prejudices for being a remake of an old anime, since it is being a great adaptation that is very worth watching. Moreover, the anime's growing popularity is a constant trend, being already the fifth most talked about anime of the season and it would not be surprising if it ended up as the most popular.Finally, when you think that there was a real samurai who inspired such a character, you realize how rich this work is. they adapted close to a chapter and a half per episode, demonstrating an unhurried pace.

The first anime adaptation being Bee Train\'s rather mediocre effort in Summer 2008, and afterwards,...Amazon Prime had to license yet another complete re-adaptation for the Fall 2019 season, which seemed like a rather huge task for a rather low-ball studio like Liden Films at the time. And the results...spoke for themselves of everything that had gone wrong with the remake from rushed pacing to bad animation, with production values being the biggest elephant in the room.4 years later, and once again from Liden Films, we get yet another classic remake: the now infamous mangaka Nobuhiro Watsuki\'s Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan a.k.a Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story, serialized in the ever-so-popular Shueisha\'s Weekly Shonen Jump from 1994 to 1999. And before I start this review proper, I need to put a disclaimer that I know nothing about the 1996 to 1998 OG series, but at the very least, I do know that it was a marvel back in the day thanks to both studios Gallop and Studio Deen\'s efforts to bring essentially what was still an ongoing series at the time and is still revered by the people who\'ve seen it back in the day and even till now. So, I\'m betting that everyone wants to know the answer to the long, debated verdict between the 2023 vs. the 90s version: is it any better or worse than the OG?For one, most of you in the context of remakes would\'ve already seen the OG series, which was one of the highlights of 90s yesteryears anime and is a recommended must-watch, that must be said first. But if you do not know anything about Rurouni Kenshin, the story plot is exactly in the name: the famous (or infamous, whatever is your term) Hitokiri Battosai of said legendary assassin, said to wield his Sakabato a.k.a reverse-blade katana, who\'ve laid waste to kill lots of people back in the Boshin War, and after that harrowing incident, vowed to never kill once again. This brings him (and us the audience) to Meiji Year 11 a.k.a 1878, where he parades under the poised name of Himura Kenshin, a wandering samurai rurouni who\'s just enjoying life as it is after the posthumous of his infamous killings, seeking to atone for it by meeting new people, helping to seek peace and prosperity in the current Meiji Era times to avoid conflict as intended.It\'s the people that Kenshin meets that set the course of his new life forward: Kaoru Kamiya of her Kamiya Kasshin-ryu Dojo; the samurai family orphan Myojin Yahiko; the former Sekiho Army member Sagara Sanosuke; and last but not least, physician Takani Megumi. For Kenshin, the biggest blemish of his life is his assassination history. Once he found solace in the very first person that he met, Kaoru would start to mold Kenshin\'s life for the better, at a time when an impostor parading as the legendary assassin Hittokiri Battosai had developed a nasty reputation within the Kamiya Dojo, potential samurai began to shun her school, leaving Kenshin to route out the imposter and restore its reputation. Plus, it\'s not hard for Kaoru to develop feelings for Kenshin, especially since she can understand his gentle and kind-loving nature as opposed to being a Hitokiri on the verge of evil. Adding to that, Yahiko may come from a family of samurai, but he\'s not the most well taken care of since he was a pickpocket to settle debts for his family until he was given a new lease of life training in Kaoru\'s dojo. Kenshin\'s best bud comes from someone hired to do mercenary work, a fighter-for-hire after the destruction of his Sekiho Army by the Meiji government. But while Sanosuke does have the looks of a fighter, he is a rather unrefined fighter who acts on his anger, which serves as his outgoing personality. And yes, people like Sanosuke are easy targets for Kenshin to defeat, though he quickly humbled himself and began to focus on protecting the people. Last but not least, most certainly, is the physician Takani Megumi, who comes from a famous Aizu region physician family. She got into trouble coming to Tokyo to create the opium business (which is rather big back in the old days), only to fall victim to industrialization and corruption and be forced to create opium until Kenshin and Sanosuke came to her rescue. Also, Megumi is always the ""vixen"" character trying to flirt around with Kenshin, which earns the ire of Kaoru, though helping the latter realize her feelings for said rurouni.It\'s no secret that throughout the Meiji Era, Kenshin would coincidentally meet with old comrades, friends, and enemies alike: some fearless like Udō Jin-e; swift like Saitō Hajime; and brutal like Isurugi Raijūta. The people associated with Kenshin are many and in-between the character cast world that Nobuhiro Watsuki creates in his long-term romantic story, one that spans different eras and times. As of right now, this first season re-adaptation covers the first 7 volumes of the manga with the Tokyo Arc, throwing in a bit of the 2-volume long Restoration prequel, then right into the very beginning of the Kyoto Arc, where Rurouni Kenshin really takes a big hit, with it presenting the meat of the entire manga series.As expected, the people will nitpick in certain areas, one of which is the newly formed cast of VAs taking up the positions of the classic Rurouni Kenshin characters. And sure, for what VA Mayo Suzukaze managed to hit her stride for the entire series, starting from the OG series right until the Shin Kyoto-hen OVA in 2011, she was a force to be reckoned with for being the voice of the classic assassin protagonist. For the remake, Soma Saito assumes that position, and I have to say that he did a knock-out job of portraying Himura Kenshin as both a kind and fearsome assassin who\'s not a fool to be played around with, considering that he has been a fan of the manga since his childhood days. Along with the other VA companions, Rie Takahashi (Kaoru), Makoto Koichi (Yahiko), and Taku Yashiro (Sanosuke), they too did a decent job with the respective portrayals of their characters as well. But the main differentiator would have to be Liden Films\'s in-house director Hideyo Yamamoto, who, like Soma Saito, has watched the OG series in his youth and aims to perfectly replicate the Meiji Era into anime form, making the narrative into a more serious showing and avoiding adding anything else to the comical slapstick humor that the manga already had going for it in order to make it more realistic. This was consulted with the mangaka Watsuki himself, who worked on the remake\'s scenario and character designs with character designer Terumi Nishii, and the adaptation was made concise from the manga with supervision. All of these changes are left to the eye of the beholder (especially for the stringent OG fans) to determine if the re-adaptation is any better than the OG series, though there is still much debate left to be said if the re-adaptation continues down the road.Still, I\'d feel that it\'s director Hideyo Yamamoto who gave the call to adapt the classic Rurouni Kenshin as best as he could in the current modern heyday, and regardless of how staunch fans will complain that Liden Films is not the right studio to do re-adaptations, I think that what came out of this first inning of the modern remake was really very good. The production was concise, with the animation being swift, fast, and furious, especially with the action scenes that delivered as expected, if you\'re one like me who has never experienced the OG before with the excuse of it being ""too old and outdated."" Nevertheless, if this classic show\'s remake can be Liden Films\'s saving grace, then it can set the path forward to have people see the studio as a way to ""bring back the lost while cutting costs"" with older, more prominent series that rightfully deserve a remake.The music, however, is kind of hit-and-miss (but mostly good). The 1st cour\'s pairing of Ayase and R-Shitei, along with Reol for the 1st half\'s OP/ED theme songs, really hit it out of the park, being a modern rejuvenation interpretation of the classic 90s anime feel (espeically with Reol\'s ED song) and being great banger songs for what they\'re worth. The 2nd cour\'s pairing of Masaki Suda and Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra, along with Kid Phenomenon, the latter ED song continues the greatness through its striking visuals, but the former OP song feels like it belonged to another anime whilst trying to sound old-school with modern instruments, and honestly, that song was the only miss for me.So far, the Rurouni Kenshin remake or re-adaptation, from what I can tell, is quite a success, while still having its detractors who will ever so claim that the remake will never quite live up to the serendipity of the OG series. That\'s just my two cents on this matter, which will continue to be a debate as the remake lives on. What I can hope now is a complete adaptation of the manga (just like what David Productions is doing right now with Urusei Yatsura (All-Stars)) that we can see from start to finish, apart from the OG being a combination of both story and filler segments at the time.The fictional living classic legend that is Hitokiri Battosai, the wandering Rurouni samurai Himura Kenshin, is back for more peace and less conflict. Amazon Prime had to license yet another complete re-adaptation for the Fall 2019 season, which seemed like a rather huge task for a rather low-ball studio like Liden Films at the time. And the results...spoke for themselves of everything that had gone wrong with the remake from rushed pacing to bad animation, with production values being the biggest elephant in the room.4 years later, and once again from Liden Films, we get yet another classic remake: the now infamous mangaka Nobuhiro Watsuki\'s Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku Romantan a.k.a Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story, serialized in the ever-so-popular Shueisha\'s Weekly Shonen Jump from 1994 to 1999. And before I start this review proper, I need to put a disclaimer that I know nothing about the 1996 to 1998 OG series, but at the very least, I do know that it was a marvel back in the day thanks to both studios Gallop and Studio Deen\'s efforts to bring essentially what was still an ongoing series at the time and is still revered by the people who\'ve seen it back in the day and even till now. So, I\'m betting that everyone wants to know the answer to the long, debated verdict between the 2023 vs. the 90s version: is it any better or worse than the OG?For one, most of you in the context of remakes would\'ve already seen the OG series, which was one of the highlights of 90s yesteryears anime and is a recommended must-watch, that must be said first. But if you do not know anything about Rurouni Kenshin, the story plot is exactly in the name: the famous (or infamous, whatever is your term) Hitokiri Battosai of said legendary assassin, said to wield his Sakabato a.k.a reverse-blade katana, who\'ve laid waste to kill lots of people back in the Boshin War, and after that harrowing incident, vowed to never kill once again. This brings him (and us the audience) to Meiji Year 11 a.k.a 1878, where he parades under the poised name of Himura Kenshin, a wandering samurai rurouni who\'s just enjoying life as it is after the posthumous of his infamous killings, seeking to atone for it by meeting new people, helping to seek peace and prosperity in the current Meiji Era times to avoid conflict as intended.It\'s the people that Kenshin meets that set the course of his new life forward: Kaoru Kamiya of her Kamiya Kasshin-ryu Dojo; the samurai family orphan Myojin Yahiko; the former Sekiho Army member Sagara Sanosuke; and last but not least, physician Takani Megumi. For Kenshin, the biggest blemish of his life is his assassination history. Once he found solace in the very first person that he met, Kaoru would start to mold Kenshin\'s life for the better, at a time when an impostor parading as the legendary assassin Hittokiri Battosai had developed a nasty reputation within the Kamiya Dojo, potential samurai began to shun her school, leaving Kenshin to route out the imposter and restore its reputation. Plus, it\'s not hard for Kaoru to develop feelings for Kenshin, especially since she can understand his gentle and kind-loving nature as opposed to being a Hitokiri on the verge of evil. Adding to that, Yahiko may come from a family of samurai, but he\'s not the most well taken care of since he was a pickpocket to settle debts for his family until he was given a new lease of life training in Kaoru\'s dojo. Kenshin\'s best bud comes from someone hired to do mercenary work, a fighter-for-hire after the destruction of his Sekiho Army by the Meiji government. But while Sanosuke does have the looks of a fighter, he is a rather unrefined fighter who acts on his anger, which serves as his outgoing personality. And yes, people like Sanosuke are easy targets for Kenshin to defeat, though he quickly humbled himself and began to focus on protecting the people. Last but not least, most certainly, is the physician Takani Megumi, who comes from a famous Aizu region physician family. She got into trouble coming to Tokyo to create the opium business (which is rather big back in the old days), only to fall victim to industrialization and corruption and be forced to create opium until Kenshin and Sanosuke came to her rescue. Also, Megumi is always the ""vixen"" character trying to flirt around with Kenshin, which earns the ire of Kaoru, though helping the latter realize her feelings for said rurouni.It\'s no secret that throughout the Meiji Era, Kenshin would coincidentally meet with old comrades, friends, and enemies alike: some fearless like Udō Jin-e; swift like Saitō Hajime; and brutal like Isurugi Raijūta. The people associated with Kenshin are many and in-between the character cast world that Nobuhiro Watsuki creates in his long-term romantic story, one that spans different eras and times. As of right now, this first season re-adaptation covers the first 7 volumes of the manga with the Tokyo Arc, throwing in a bit of the 2-volume long Restoration prequel, then right into the very beginning of the Kyoto Arc, where Rurouni Kenshin really takes a big hit, with it presenting the meat of the entire manga series.As expected, the people will nitpick in certain areas, one of which is the newly formed cast of VAs taking up the positions of the classic Rurouni Kenshin characters. And sure, for what VA Mayo Suzukaze managed to hit her stride for the entire series, starting from the OG series right until the Shin Kyoto-hen OVA in 2011, she was a force to be reckoned with for being the voice of the classic assassin protagonist.

So many of these reviews wreak of rose tinted glasses. The same thing happens all the time in my other hobby, gaming. The original was the best, this one didn't improve on it, therefore bad remake. This one changed the music, therefore bad remake. This one was different from the original in any way, therefore bad remake.Now I'm not saying I'm immune to the effects of rose tinted glasses myself, but I am very aware of it so I tried to approach this remake with an open mind. For context, the original anime was/is one of my favorite anime of all time, I...think I've rewatched the entire thing more than 10 times over the years. So when I heard they were remaking it, I was ecstatic and a little worried at the same time. Finally a higher resolution version with possibly better animation! But... Are they going to change anything? Will they ruin it? Please don't ruin it! All these thoughts crossed my mind while waiting for it to come out. So when it finally did, I dived into it with both anticipation and caution, and after 8 episodes, I'm happy to report that I think this is gonna turn out to be a good remake.Instead of following the typical review structure of going over each category and giving my thoughts, I'll just list the points I think are most relevant to my conclusion.1) It is shockingly faithful to the source content, I found myself constantly recalling what happens next and being so happy that it happened exactly how I remember/felt it should.2) The fidelity of the animation is obviously better and I particularly appreciate that they actually animated the fights rather than keeping the original style of just flashing kenshin around the screen. It's not as graphic as the ova's but it's a good middle ground.3) The soundtrack is different and I do understand the negativity around it. Having rewatched the original so many times, the original soundtrack just blended with the anime as a single entity in my memory and it is definitely jarring at times to hear a different soundtrack paired with the same scenes. I wouldn't call it a hard negative though, it's just different, it's personal preference.4) The episodic release schedule feels like it hurts the remake. Anime watching culture has evolved over the years, we have been spoiled by a combination of ultra short and condensed 12 episode seasons and full seasons releasing at one go. This culture affects how most modern anime are put together. We have grown impatient as viewers and modern anime are written to cater to that impatience. So when we have such a faithful remake of such an old anime, retaining the same formula yet being released 1 episode at a time, it can feel like we aren't getting enough substance per episode, making it come across as boring to some.So my conclusion? This is a faithful remake of the original and I'm very happy with it. It's a visual upgrade over the original with a soundtrack that you may love or hate. It shows no signs of condensing the material or changing the original formula so it may be way too slow for some, in which case I'd advise waiting for the entire season to come out before watching it.Overall I'd rate it a solid 9 so far, versus the 10 I gave the original. We'll see how it goes as more episodes come out. think I've rewatched the entire thing more than 10 times over the years.

I feel it's exactly the voice I expect for the character.(In the OG I strongly prefered the EN track, especialy given the dialogue and kenshin-speak)The whole cast does a decent job and fits well. Full points.Art:The animation has a nice colour palette. The characters look good....Full points here.Animation:The animation quality uses a lot of fades in a more story-bookish manner for many scenes. It's not poorly done, just know the studio isn't MAPPA (nor Ghibli) and doesn't have as much in resources or room to add in consistently engrossing and dynamic minutiae of movement.Audio:I'm okay with OP and end songs, but as others have noted, the background audio track is, lacklustre to say the least. It would benefit in the soundtrack department greatly.  The adaption has some issue with flatness, and much of what could be done about this is the audio.Faithfulness:The adaption accuracy is high and very faithful. And while some humour has been toned down, it still retains humour scenes.Spirit:The studio seemed a little unsure of their groove until around e6-e7, at which point things kick up. As noted in audio, the adaption suffers from some feeling of flatness due to especially the audio. I feel like I could be sitting and eating cereal and watching before rushing off to school with each episode.Plot:S1 is the background season, before the main arcs. In the manga, this was before it was a given that RK would become an overarching project. The important character backstories are the core of S1 and this is worthwhile. Those looking for an overarching plot or breaking action will not get that until S2 and S2 (the Kyouto arc) will be a ride. S1 is the set-up for S2.Overall:Overall, I give the remake a sole 8/10, with the points off mostly for the audio and and missing dynamism in execution.I recommend it and feel it has strong promise, and hope to see the Kyouto arc live up to it's potential. I hope to see the lackustre and flat aspects in the audio and some of the scenes rectified.

From its heartfelt, thoughtful, tragic yet charming and poignant portrayal of characters living in one of the most transformative and tumultuous periods in the history of Japan to its over the top yet effective action, Rurouni Kenshin has truly left the lasting impact on people around the globe, myself included. The original works are so sacred that...the new adaptation was not even necessary, incomplete 90’s anime notwithstanding, but here we are and by the time the credits roll on the last episode of the season there is no doubt. The 2023 adaptation of Rurouni Kenshin proved itself as a confident and necessary work that does the original justice.What’s especially commendable is how much attention is paid to the source material’s writing: the exploration of themes of redemption, atonement, guilt and trauma, the difficulty of having to carve a place in the new and unpredictable world while having to bear the burden of your troubled past. What always made Rurouni Kenshin shine is the attention to careful character study and exploration of difficult topics over the entertainment value that works in the shounen genre typically provide. The main character is one of the most unique, yet relatable, grounded and complex protagonists in the works of this kind. The way the story masterfully treats most of the villains like real human beings without denominating them as either good or evil calls to comparisons with Hajime no Ippo, another great manga/anime that made its mark with its considerate approach to properly developing the opponents of the main protagonist.The only thing the new adaptation doesn’t do quite as well as the 90’s version is animation itself. 90’s anime is known for its gorgeous camera work, stunning scenery and muted yet stylish presentation that creates a perfect atmosphere surrounding the proceedings. In comparison, the new adaptation looks a bit too similar to most of the current anime and doesn’t offer much in terms of Color palette and flair. It’s confidently made and gets the job done but it feels uninspired. It made me reminisce about the gorgeous backdrops of the setting sun in the 90’s work.Nevertheless, whether you’re a newcomer or a longtime fan, Rurouni kenshin 2023 is a must watch, especially if you like shounen anime that offers so much more than just flashy action with one liners. And with the 2nd season already announced there’s no excuse to skip this one. the new adaptation was not even necessary, incomplete 90’s anime notwithstanding, but here we are and by the time the credits roll on the last episode of the season there is no doubt.

And with the 2nd season already announced there’s no excuse to skip this one.', 'When remaking a classic such as Rurouni Kenshin, a couple questions have to be asked. “Is it necessary” and “Does it in anyway enhance the experience of the original?” In my opinion, the 2023 remake answers “yes” to both of those and does the legendary series justice. Enjoyable for newcomers and longtime fans alike.Before continuing, I have to say that it’s been a very long time since I watched the original Rurouni anime, so I don’t have a lot of the criticisms that younger fans of the original who watched it more recently have.With that out the way, I can’t emphasise enough how...much I enjoyed this remake. It managed to capture the essence and magic of late 90s/early 2000s anime perfectly, while repackaging the timeless wandering samurai’s story for a modern era. It really does feel like I’ve been sent back in time to my childhood, watching this series on Toonami. Updated visuals, a great OST and Takahashi Rie in the cast list are just some of the things this remake has going for it. The fights, choreography and designs are all great modern updates on the original series.Again, this story really is timeless and a reminder that it should always be substance over style with good storytelling. Yea, you have the crazy over the top samurai fights and dudes dodging bullets, but for the most part Rurouni Kenshin is a story about a man trying to right his wrongs and move on from the past. Something many of us can relate to. The interactions that Kenshin has with people he meets on his journey for redemption are well done and feel authentic. Every person he comes in contact with teaches him life lessons. Seeing Kenshin go from a lonely wanderer to someone with a place to call home and genuine friends is very satisfying.While this isn’t anywhere near the entire story, in the short time we’ve had with this remake we can already see so much growth not just from Kenshin, but the other cast members as well. Every character receives ample development time and again, going back to the 2000s anime nostalgia, it feels good to see a group of characters who all matter in a story. In an age of OP MCs who outshine everyone else, it’s a literal blast from the past.From a personal standpoint, one of the things I love most about this version is the more serious take on the story. The original anime has a lot of comedy and banter, and I’m sure that’s very important for some, being a fan of the live action Rurouni Kenshin movies starring Sato Takeru, I like this more grounded and serious approach. That’s not to say it’s devoid of comedic moments, they just don’t go into memey territory as often.As I touched on earlier, the technical aspects of the remake are all very good. Even though I grew up with early 2000s anime art style, I personally like the modern look of anime more, so the updated character designs come as a welcome addition to me. The fight scenes feel weighty and are more than good enough for me as well.The reality is that when it comes to remakes of beloved franchises, they’re always going to be divisive with nostalgia being a big factor for many. For me, Watsuki’s crimes and personal stuff aside, remaking this story made total sense. There’s a large segment of the manga that wasn’t adapted because of the legal issues, the original definitely shows its age and the live action films have been pretty successful. A perfect storm and a perfect time to bring this story back. It succeeds in staying true to the message and heart of the original, while adding a modern flair to it. This is a must watch for any early 2000s anime fan, Japanese history enthusiast or just those looking for a good historical action series.Rurouni Kenshin gets 9, out of 10. much I enjoyed this remake.

Given what we\'ve come to learn of the mangaka behind it, my feelings on the series\' legacy aren\'t quite so nice as they were when I was watching it back in the late 90s, but this was a story I really enjoyed. And so when it was announced that it would be getting a reboot, I was... well, pensive. Reboots don\'t always work, particularly when you\'re talking about taking a classic and updating the style, and I always worry that a reboot won\'t justify its own existence by modifying the plot or finding some new...and interesting way to animate it. Beyond that, nostalgia is a double-edged sword. It certainly got me to watch this 24-episode season through, but it\'s also hard to fully distance myself from the aspects of the original series that made me love it so much back in the day.So, how is it? It\'s Rurouni Kenshin all over again, this time with a basic and clean animation style that looks pretty good, but has sanded off all the edges of the original series. If it changed the story, I didn\'t notice. They certainly changed some scenes and fights, and not for the better. In particular, a match with Saito, which stood as one of my favorites from the series as a whole, just felt sanitized and weak. I watched the original back after watching it, and the differences are very obvious: it doesn\'t feel nearly as claustophobic or dynamic, it lacks the rapid changes to camera angles, and you just don\'t really buy that anyone\'s out here to kill anyone else. It\'s just... wrong.And that pretty much embodies this whole season. It does the basics well enough, but when it comes to what makes this series sing, it just feels muted and weak. I wanted to like this, but as I worried from the outset, it just didn\'t give any reason to justify its existence, even leaving the best arc for later. I\'ll probably watch it because it is a great arc and be disappointed once again.A series like this with characters like these shouldn\'t just be ""fine."" It shouldn\'t just keep me mildly invested as I wait for the moment that it\'s going to do something interesting, only to realize that it won\'t deliver. I don\'t hate it by any means, but there\'s just nothing here to recommend. I recognize that much of this review has been me comparing it to the original, but part of the point is that the original had an identity to it, something that made it distinct and memorable besides a solid cast of characters and decent fights.

I agree that the 90s animation looked better but this doesn't look bad either, the company who's animating has been known to have a brighter touch to things and have bold lines for character designs and I think they've kept very good to the original...character designs. So far they've nailed Kenshin's death stare very good like his serious battle face and just everything has been way better than people are saying, It feels that people are too spoiled with animation companies like MAPPA, WIT Studio, UFO Table, Bones, etc. So far the show has been great and just for people thinking this is a money grab, THEY NEVER FINISHED ANIMATING THE 1996 VERSION SO NOW THEY ARE GOING TO ANIMATE IT ALL SO WE CAN SEE ALL THAT HAPPENS. I personally never got to read the manga sadly so that's why I want this show to do good because I want to see all of it animated also I can't wait to see how they animate the Kenshin vs Shishio fight (hopefully we get there but so far the popularity is iffy so they might drop it like they did the 1996 version). character designs.

Kaoru, the first character who has contact with the protagonist, preaches that these concepts serve to protect people while the bad character random number 1 (Gohei Hiruma) from the first episode contradicts said philosophy with a real one of ""a sword is a weapon, kenjutsu It is the art of killing"" while Kenshin agrees with the bad guy Random No. 1, emphasizing that Kaoru\'s ideology is simple childhood fantasies, but despite that he wants to believe in it.Basically, Kenshin takes refuge in a lie that he shares with Kaoru, not because he is a deluded or childish person at 28 years old, but because this ideology conveniently coincides with his path of redemption in the face of the crimes committed in his past. The initial message of the work is quite interesting since it is not very common to the typical self-improvement messages that are very common in the demographic.The Tokyo arc is made up of self-concluding/episodic chapters and small arcs as we saw in this first season, Tokyo is undoubtedly the weakest arc since at all times only characters are presented and almost never any conclusion or conclusion is reached.

Also, of Aoshi, Hannya, and the Oniwabanshuu. These flashbacks add depth to all the characters.So awesome to finally see the Hiruma Bros and the real plot against Kamiya Kasshin Ryu.I can't wait to see the Kyoto Arc and hopefully the Jinchuu Arc.The music is the one area this anime lacks.

While that may sound like the most important thing an adaptation can do, it ultimately misses the point in my eyes.The plot of Rurouni Kenshin is… simple, especially in the beginning. It’s mostly episodic stuff with one-note villains doing one-note bad stuff and the protagonist saving the day at the end in a deus ex machina like fashion. What made the Rurouni Kenshin manga work despite its shallow plot is the expressive main characters, the comedy and the fights, and in...that regard the new version fails at being a faithful adaptation, at least so far.The main characters shown so far are Kenshin, Kaoru and Yahiko, and while their characterization is accurate on paper, their expressiveness has been hugely diminished compared to the source material and also the old anime. The manga is generally very exaggerated with its expressions and the old anime being a 90s product naturally had many of the absurd facial expressions that era is known for. The new anime on the other hand goes for a more natural approach that rarely gets off-model, thus reducing the expressiveness of the characters considerably.Kenshin in particular suffered the most here as his silliness is almost entirely gone. In the manga and old anime he was constantly falling victim to all kinds of slapstick humor resulting in some of the silliest distorted faces you can think of, but this is completely gone in the new version. His silly expressiveness and gentle warmth was replaced with a Gary Stu-ish personality that makes me think of Kirito from Sword Art Online. Kenshin is now just “mr. coolguy#257” whose appeal is that he saves the day in the last minute and has everyone comment on how awesome he is. His iconic “ORO!?” has also been reduced entirely to its iconography alone with the actual point being lost. It’s not there for comedy purposes anymore, but because he said it a lot in the manga and therefore it must be included.Even the action scenes with him are rather underwhelming thus far as they mainly consist of Kenshin doing a very fast slash and that’s it. It worked far better in the manga due to the more static nature of the medium and the old anime also did a good job at capturing the impact panels through the use of freeze frames. The new version is more concerned about capturing the speed of the slash but since the fighting is so minimalistic it loses all its impact and comes across as rushed. That said the action is where I see the most potential with this new adaptation, especially when it reaches the later arcs.The music, sound effects and even the voice acting are all very underwhelming. I’ve seen Kenshin’s voice actor being praised for being a man now instead of a woman like in the old anime but I don’t see how that says anything about the performance. The old voice actress was super expressive and delivered the warm, silly and badass personality traits of Kenshin perfectly, while the new one just sounds monotonous and bored out of his mind no matter the situation. At the end of the day I only care about performance, not about whether the person behind the mic has the same genitals as the character they are voicing.As I already pointed out, the story of Rurouni Kenshin is nothing spectacular, especially in its first few volumes. It’s not until the Kyoto arc that the story becomes any interesting and even then it’s just your typical fighting shounen stuff. Rurouni Kenshin doesn’t separate itself from other series of its kind through its plot but through its characters, and so far the anime does a subpar job at capturing the appeal of those characters. So in my eyes it’s a faithful adaptation only on a surface level. Yeah, it’s more accurate than the previous adaptation in some aspects; the first episode takes place at night instead of the day, just like in the manga. The first one-note bad guy had a one-note bad guy brother, just like in the manga. There’s actual blood, just like in the manga… these things are all more accurate in the new version, but do they really matter that much?

If we compare both anime for the episodes they have both done so far I think the OST is also better in the new one (that might change in the Kyoto arc).Overall the anime is very good and I've been enjoying it. When...I saw the reveal trailer I was worried as much as I was excited but it exceeded my expectations by far.I'm excited to see how well this remake will handle the Kyoto arc, which is one of the best arcs in Shonen history.

I think this series is a great way to get into the franchise! HOWEVER, only as an entry - here\'s my story.I\'ve always liked Rurouni Kenshin but never got around to watching the original anime, I watched the Live Action movies first actually and quite enjoyed them! I tried giving the original anime a watch and I\'m not into Shounen much to begin with, especially ones that drag out things so I lost interest within 3 episodes. However I still respected and enjoyed...Rurouni Kenshin. When I heard this anime was coming out and when it started airring, it resparked my interest in Kenshin! This remake is very streamline and actually more faithful to the original manga, it gives you the very base story line of Rurouni Kenshin. However while waiting for the episodes, I decided to revisit and properly give the original anime a chance and well, I can see why many people prefer the original anime still. It\'s slower but it gives the proper time for the viewer to invest in the story and characters. The music is also far much more better, it has this very ""classic"" feeling, campy but a welcomed campy feel to it. Kenshin is like a folktale character, he\'s like Robin Hood or Wong Fei Hung, he\'s the guy with a story that inspires those around him and gives the idea that everyone can redeem themselves no matter what their past is.This new remake is a flashy clean version, it does what it\'s intending to do but misses what made the original so special. It sounds lazy but there\'s no other way to put it, this version is missing the ""heart"" that comes within Rurouni Kenshin\'s story, despite it following the Manga closer, Anime and Manga are 2 different mediums meaning they\'re consumed differently, story beats hit different from reading a still image to watching an animation.Everyone is voice acted quite well, Rie Takahashi\'s Kaoru is very cute and has some spunk. Soma Saito\'s Kenshin is decent but it holds no candle to the original JP voice actress, there\'s this strange masculiness that she provides over an actual male voice actor that makes her the better Kenshin in my mind. Sanosuke sounds more like a delinquent in this version and less stoic than the original. The music as many people have pointed out is extremely lacking, no real stand out OST at all. I do like the first opening and ending theme though. I swear one of the OST in this remake is inspired by Pink Panther\'s theme, it\'s when they talk about women or girls, you can\'t miss it.Animation is rather lacking, they make up with it with smart cuts to give the illusion of intense fights, you could say they\'re being true to the manga by making sure to translate those pages to keyframes. Kenshin\'s fight with Kurogasa was noticeably well done though compared to the rest. I\'m not a fan of the thicker outliners and I personal nitpick but I think the art style is a little too round looking? If that makes sense.Anyhow despite what I\'m saying, this is still a great watch! It\'s just sadly in the shadow of the Original 1996 Anime and Manga. I highly recommend this if you\'ve ever had any interest in Rurouni Kenshin! Because starting this could spark your interest in checking the OG Anime!8/10 Rurouni Kenshin.

Considering how Bleach is back, City Hunter is back, Black Butler is going to be back, Spice and Wolf is going to be back, Panty and Stocking will be back, and now Kenshin. Why is it then that there is still no news about either High School DxD and No Game no Life. Why is it particularly these two?Well anyway, For those of you who are oriented with the original, you know what it is more than my meagre words can express. For the newbies who are wondering...what this is about, Kenshin is the Anime, or rather the manga from which originates Gintama, One Piece, Flame of Recca, Shaman King, Bleach, Naruto, Drifters, Trigun, Assassination Classroom, Sword of the Stranger, Samurai Champloo, even something as recent as Demon Slayer or Jujutsu Kaisen and many, many more. Along with Blade of the Immortal it is quite possibly the most influential Manga of the 90s that more or less has shaped both the Manga and Anime culture ever since.Also, what happened with the author is just sad, he let us down in a huge way. Yes, for once my perception of the author has completely changed, I don't even want to hear the name of the author anymore. However, Kenshin if anything has been the exact opposite of it's author. Yes, I have the exact amount of loathing for the author as I had when it was first known, but I also have the exact amount of admiration for Kenshin as I had from the very first moment. If some Twitter user, or an inhabitant of the land of freedom wants to go hate on the author, more power to that person, though if you project that to Kenshin, I hope you get the proper love and care from your close ones, because you deserve it the most.Plot: The synopsis gives you a very accurate description of what it is, and going forward what it will be. The story is set a few years following the Meiji restoration. As you'll be able to understand from the very first episode the samurai class has been all but wiped out or retired. In this new world here is a samurai without a sword, rather a sword that can't kill, or it won't kill. How does this samurai, now a wanderer fare, what will he experience, and will he be able to sever the gushing red threads of his past, that is the Anime for now. (Key words for now)As you can see, this is a new adaptation of an already existing Anime. In that way it is more or less something similar to Hunter x Hunter and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Don't get me wrong, Kenshin is arguably as legendary as the other two, possibly even more. As such you can understand that though this will closely follow the Manga, more closely than the original did, there will definitely be a new approach to it. For example from the beginning itself you can surmise that the humour or the original is toned down for this adaptation, as well as certain events are realigned and new Anime only scenes added to it. So far it seems to be better than the original in that regard.Characters: In case you're wondering the whole story is centred around an wanderer and the people he befriends following a chance encounter, and No, this not a spoiler, the Title says as much (Rurouni=Wanderer). It felt as if this adaptation has portrayed the characters just as well.Also if you know your Japanese history, or you know your Gintama, chances are you'll recognise atleast a fair few of the characters. These are the characters which will become the archetypes for countless future Manga and Anime to follow.Animation: From a neutral standpoint the animation certainly looks good. The fights look decent, the characters look decent, the background seems fine, and more often than not the motion seems fine as well. There is nice flow between the frames that makes the motion fluid. The bright lighting gives a colourful feel to the whole atmosphere. That is until you realise that the original Rurouni Kenshin Anime exists.If I can give you an analogy, think about the first three seasons of the High School DxD Anime, and compare it to the Fourth season. Or better yet, think about the original City Hunter series, and compare it to the recent City Hunter movie. I'm sure by now you can see what it is. The new stuff looks and moves fine till you observe the characters seem as if they have drastically become ten fifteen years younger. Which points how well the original managed to do this part.The color palette seems somewhat too bright, the lighting seems far more enhanced, and that too after they toned down on the humour. It's not a fault or anything, it just seems uncanny to anyone who has known the original. I'm sure none of the newbies will find anything unusual in this. To me it felt a little odd, but considering the approach of this new adaptation, it seems it'd be incredibly hasty to say anything right now.Of course this adaptation does the action much better compared to the original. In the original it was just shaky movements and effects, but here they show the movements, the stances, the particular cuts and gashes, which adds character to the animation itself. Huge props for that.Case in point, the Opening credit looks cool and actually pays homage to the original. In the opening theme, if you focus specifically on the opening part following the Rurouni Kenshin logo, you can see the actual colour palette and lighting of the original for about 12-15 seconds. Another few seconds later there is a sword fight between two characters in a washed out snowy backalley. That is sort of the original character designs and vibes. Now it may not seem a lot to most, but it'll definitely catch your eye if you have known the original.Music: There is hardly enough music out yet to formulate an opinion on this subject. The opening sounds catchy though. Especially with the kind of Anime it is, the music goes well with the vibe. Similarly the ending theme seems catchy enough, albeit a little too modern for my liking. This perhaps would've worked better as an Overlord opening. Though the visuals most definitely help it become a Kenshin ending in it's own right.Enjoyment: Personally, it is always a pleasure when an old, influential Anime such as Kenshin gets a tastefully crafted rendition like this. There are things that may not be to everyone's liking, but overall it is rather well done with lot's of care and effort put into it. Like Jujutsu Kaisen you'd have to be a special kind of person with even more special circumstances to not enjoy this. Really looking forward to it and how much better it can be from the original. what this is about, Kenshin is the Anime, or rather the manga from which originates Gintama, One Piece, Flame of Recca, Shaman King, Bleach, Naruto, Drifters, Trigun, Assassination Classroom, Sword of the Stranger, Samurai Champloo, even something as recent as Demon Slayer or Jujutsu Kaisen and many, many more. Along with Blade of the Immortal it is quite possibly the most influential Manga of the 90s that more or less has shaped both the Manga and Anime culture ever since.Also, what happened with the author is just sad, he let us down in a huge way. Yes, for once my perception of the author has completely changed, I don't even want to hear the name of the author anymore. However, Kenshin if anything has been the exact opposite of it's author. Yes, I have the exact amount of loathing for the author as I had when it was first known, but I also have the exact amount of admiration for Kenshin as I had from the very first moment. If some Twitter user, or an inhabitant of the land of freedom wants to go hate on the author, more power to that person, though if you project that to Kenshin, I hope you get the proper love and care from your close ones, because you deserve it the most.Plot: The synopsis gives you a very accurate description of what it is, and going forward what it will be. The story is set a few years following the Meiji restoration. As you'll be able to understand from the very first episode the samurai class has been all but wiped out or retired. In this new world here is a samurai without a sword, rather a sword that can't kill, or it won't kill. How does this samurai, now a wanderer fare, what will he experience, and will he be able to sever the gushing red threads of his past, that is the Anime for now.

If there is any weakness or criticism to be had about RK 2023, it\'s from the cookie-cutter storyline and not the adaption. Lindenfilms is doing a great job with this. It\'s a shame oldheads are weighing the score down over petty shit, because if the reboot doesn\'t do well enough in its first season then we might not get the latter manga arcs adapted after all.--------------------------------------------------------------MUSIC: I\'m honestly surprised people enjoyed Freckles and the other OPs as standalone...songs, but I guess that\'s just preference. In any case, the arguments that the new OP and soundtrack doesn\'t fit RK are absolutely insane to me. Not saying its a genre I\'d listen to on the daily, but the new OP matches RK waaaaaaaay better than Freckles. It\'s not even close. I do, however, miss the old EDs but it\'s fine to try out new genres.ANIMATION: As expected, the newer anime has better animation quality. If you are a fan of that ""90s feel"" or whatever, understand that any new reboot of old shows was never going to have the exact same style. A successful reboot SHOULD bring in its own style and not just be a clone of the original. I did not think that the old style was bad by any means, but this new style is pleasing to look at and I welcome the change. Again, preference. Maybe people were expecting JJK or Demon Slayer levels of animation, but unfortunately RK does not have the same amount of clout so there was no realistic avenue to more funding and hype.STORY (PACING): We are only 11 episodes in (at the time of this review), however it\'s already been made clear that the pacing is astronomically better. No filler, absurdly long recaps, conversations that take up half the episode, pointless screen time, etc. The story itself remains engaging thanks to this increased tempo, because although RK employs many shonen cliches (which were fairly new in the 90s admittedly) it is not done in a cringey manner.CHARACTERS: I found Kaoru and Yahiko to be pointless and annoying characters in the original. That might still be the case once the reboot reaches the departure arc, but as of right now I can say that they\'ve successful toned down the annoying aspects of these characters. I can only hope that they fix Misao as well when she appears (please!). The other characters were fine in the original, and are even better here.COMEDY: Some say the comedic bits have been toned down, others say it hasn\'t. Personally I haven\'t seen a difference, and think that the reboot strikes a good balance between ""serious"" and ""funny,"" just like Kenshin\'s split personality.VOICE ACTING: Older fans were saddened that Kenshin\'s original VA did not come back, and I can understand where they are coming from. However, it\'s been roughly 30 years, and life outside anime happens. Both the old and new VAs were strong casting decisions, and I could go for either one.Thank you for reading. songs, but I guess that\'s just preference.

Rurouni Kenshin is one of the anime that defined 90's shounen. Although I am not the biggest fan of remakes, I find it appropriate in this case since the original series has its downsides (lots of filler, incomplete adaptation etc.). Being a remake, it will naturally be compared the 1990's variant of the series. How does it compare? I think it's pretty solid so far. The voice actors are all casted pretty well in my opinion. Kenshin has an appropriate male voice in this series. It was difficult for...me to watch the original in Japanese because Kenshin's voice was too feminine in my opinion. The animation is solid but not amazing. I really like the 90's aesthetic, but this version is fine in its own right. The music is a bit of a downgrade though. The original soundtrack had some amazing tracks, but most of the music here is kind of forgettable. The only thing that really holds this series back is the 24 episode cap that they had to set for themselves. The beginning arcs of Kenshin are still solid in their own right, but there's a lot of exposition, and the payoffs for the action sequences are good but not great. They serve as a strong foundation for the recurring conflicts and character dynamics throughout the series, but in a vacuum, they have a hard time standing out amongst the crowd. The next arc with Shishio (i.e. the most recognizable antagonist of the series) is one of the greatest shounen arcs of all time in my opinion. If you have made it this far as a new viewer, then I would definitely stick with the series. It only gets better from here.

Anyway, since I don't have any nostalgia for it, I can say clearly that, as a filmmaker myself, the direction of the new version is significantly better. As a musician for films, I also find the music to be less impactful. And as a viewer, I enjoyed the 90th version just slightly more.

This is my first experience with the Rurouni Kenshin series and as such I have no prior knowledge or nostalgic rose-tinted glasses when it comes to giving this anime a try. Despite what\'s been said about the author, I\'d heard plenty of times how good this series was and how much of a classic it is. That everything gets better the further into the story we go. Well I gave it a go and stomached the whole 24 episode season for the sake of giving it a fair shot.But c\'mon... no matter how much everyone...was trying to sell it to me about the story, there was nothing great about it.

The 90s version of Rurouni Kenshin may have had its issues, but it was top shonen material for its time and had amazing music score. The current version has neither; its early episodes come off as a generic shonen and the music is largely forgettable, making it a series very few bother to watch.There are many reasons for that, the most obvious ones being it is airing along with an extremely popular show such as Mushoku Tensei, an...extremely well-animated show such as Jujutsu Kaisen, and another sword-fighting series with far flashier battles such as Bleach. Rurouni Kenshin has none of that, and its first dozen episodes are generally very simple in structure. The peak comes in the Kyoto arc, much later, so for now all you get is a low-energy samurai drama with nothing much to pay attention to… if the only thing you care about is action.Let me be clear about something. This series has far better-written characters and an overall far better-handled plot than the aforementioned heavy-hitters. It just takes its time with introducing the characters and their ideologies, and the battles are for the most part short and simple in battle choreography. Most today have no patience for that and would rather watch some dumb action show with flashy animation, regardless of how terrible plot and characters are. And let’s be honest here, nobody watches Jujutsu Kaisen or Bleach for the plot or the lackluster characters. As for Mushoku, well, you have a 30 year old pedophile protagonist pretending to be part of a redemption story while getting horny over every (mostly underage) girl he comes across, as opposed to this show’s protagonist, another 30 year old mature man who already got his redemption and is now trying to settle down.What matters the most nowadays is pretty colors, so you can yell OH MY GAWD THAT ART AND ANIMATION, BABY! AAAAWWWW! A low-energy samurai drama doesn’t cut the mustard, regardless of how well-written it is, or how well-handled its characters are. The damage is then doubled when you happen to be aware it is a remake of something far better. The 90s version was a superb samurai drama with amazing music and one of the best OVA prequels (Trust and Betrayal). It came out before the Big Three, so there wasn’t much to compete against at the time. Then came the live action movie remakes which were also largely amazing in visuals and music, and also had no other similar movie franchise to compete against. Those 2 earlier versions were the best samurai dramas of their time.Compared to them, well, the current version has everything going against it. Also, the original creator got so much flack for his pedo-tendencies that many would rather see this show get all dusty and moldy on a shelf than giving him money. Meanwhile, many other viewers have absolutely no problem when supporting Mushoku Tensei whenever it does the exact opposite. Oh, and they also prefer a collar worker being all happy to see billions of innocent people dying horribly because that way he doesn’t have to go to work (Zom100), over a mature man who wants peace and helps the innocent whenever he can.

Despite being a reboot of a legendary franchise that was highly anticipated in Japan, very few people on MAL watched this one. Anitubers have largely gone out of their way to not talk about it. So why the ice-cold reception? You know why! If you’re a Zoomer, you probably only know Rurouni Kenshin as being “That one old anime that boomers overrated and then it turned the mangaka is…yeah…so now I’m never going to watch it or read it.” There is a LONG discussion that could be had on the...morality of making this reboot in the first place. Personally, I wouldn’t have made this anime if I were a producer. Unless maybe a large portion of the profits go to child abuse victims or combatting human trafficking. There’s also a long discussion that we could have about the morality of pirating this anime vs watching it legally. However, I’m not going to have either of those discussions in this review. The fact is the anime did get made and I’m going to cover what I liked about it, and what I didn’t like.Stuff I liked about the new Kenshin:1.\tI think Kenshin’s new voice actor fits the character much better than his 90s actress. Kenshin is a kindhearted goofball, so they went with an actress in the 90s anime to try be sort of like Masako Nozawa’s Goku, but…I watch 90s Kenshin dubbed for a reason. It’s NOT a perfect dub either. It’s Media Blasters and I still vastly prefer it over the 90s Japanese voice acting.2.\tThere are some very impressive action scenes in the new Kenshin. The old Kenshin is much more stylized, and it has a charm to it for older viewers like me, but they try as hard as they can to not actually animate during the fights. You see a LOT of action lines, recycled animation, and flashes of light to represent the clanging of swords. The 90s anime is Studio Deen, which is basically all I need to say. The new Kenshin actually looks like a modern anime and will be much easier for younger anime fans to stomach.3.\tAlmost no filler! Do you want a highly faithful adaptation of the Kenshin manga that follows it EXTREMELY accurately almost panel for panel? This is it. There is one little filler arc, but it was pretty charming, and I had fun with it. I was also happy to see that it was a brand-new story and not a rehash of the 90s filler.4.\tIt’s Kenshin! I probably shouldn’t be excited for this series given my strong antipathy for Mr. Watsuki, who unlike his manga protagonist has seemingly taken zero action to redeem himself and atone for his crimes. However, I REALLY like Kenshin as a work of art. I think that its beauty, artistic impact, and being a source of inspiration for an entire generation of anime fans is something independent from its scummy author.Things I didn’t like about the new Kenshin1.\tThe new OST is trash. It doesn’t help that the 90s Kenshin has my single favorite OST in ALL of anime. I’m not sure why they didn’t just use the 90s music but…who knows?2.\tManga and anime are different mediums of art. What works when you’re reading a manga and flipping pages isn’t necessarily what works best in an anime. That’s why I don’t think following the manga THIS closely is the ideal way of making a great adaptation. The 90s anime wasn’t afraid to put their own spin on things and make changes when they felt it would work better. The direction in the new anime feels timid and slavishly devoted.3.\tThe new character designs are very bland compared to the original. Megumi, Kaoru, and even Tsubame all look the freaking same! The character designer had an obsession with giving every character the exact same dark hair, blue eyes, and facial shape. When Sojiro showed up on screen in the final episode I wanted to throw something at the TV. Backgrounds are quite minimalistic in Kenshin 2023 and it feels like very little is moving or happening whenever our heroes are walking through the street. It really feels like they saved everything for the action scenes.4.\tThey followed the manga’s version of the Raijuta arc. An arc that even Watsuki himself admitted isn’t very good and that was massively improved by the 90s anime staff. I guess part of the appeal is that the new Kenshin really follows the manga, but if I wanted to see exactly what happens in the manga…I’d read manga. I own the entire manga series BTW. It’s one of the only manga series that I physically own.If you’ve never seen Rurouni Kenshin before and you greatly prefer the aesthetic of newer anime, I’d highly recommend this one. Kenshin is a phenomenal shonen with great characters, great action, and is just amazing all around. Personally, I still prefer the 90s anime…that we all know ended with the Kyoto Arc because season 3 didn’t happen. MAL says there’s a whole 3rd season of bad filler, but real Kenshin fans know it didn’t happen! Anyways, check this series out. I think it’s one of the sleeper hits of 2023 to be honest. If you don’t want to financially support an unrepentant nonce, the series is free to watch on Kissanime, gogoanime, WCO, and a number of other sites! morality of making this reboot in the first place. Personally, I wouldn’t have made this anime if I were a producer. Unless maybe a large portion of the profits go to child abuse victims or combatting human trafficking. There’s also a long discussion that we could have about the morality of pirating this anime vs watching it legally. However, I’m not going to have either of those discussions in this review. The fact is the anime did get made and I’m going to cover what I liked about it, and what I didn’t like.Stuff I liked about the new Kenshin:1.\tI think Kenshin’s new voice actor fits the character much better than his 90s actress. Kenshin is a kindhearted goofball, so they went with an actress in the 90s anime to try be sort of like Masako Nozawa’s Goku, but…I watch 90s Kenshin dubbed for a reason. It’s NOT a perfect dub either. It’s Media Blasters and I still vastly prefer it over the 90s Japanese voice acting.2.\tThere are some very impressive action scenes in the new Kenshin. The old Kenshin is much more stylized, and it has a charm to it for older viewers like me, but they try as hard as they can to not actually animate during the fights. You see a LOT of action lines, recycled animation, and flashes of light to represent the clanging of swords. The 90s anime is Studio Deen, which is basically all I need to say. The new Kenshin actually looks like a modern anime and will be much easier for younger anime fans to stomach.3.\tAlmost no filler! Do you want a highly faithful adaptation of the Kenshin manga that follows it EXTREMELY accurately almost panel for panel? This is it. There is one little filler arc, but it was pretty charming, and I had fun with it. I was also happy to see that it was a brand-new story and not a rehash of the 90s filler.4.\tIt’s Kenshin! I probably shouldn’t be excited for this series given my strong antipathy for Mr. Watsuki, who unlike his manga protagonist has seemingly taken zero action to redeem himself and atone for his crimes. However, I REALLY like Kenshin as a work of art. I think that its beauty, artistic impact, and being a source of inspiration for an entire generation of anime fans is something independent from its scummy author.Things I didn’t like about the new Kenshin1.\tThe new OST is trash. It doesn’t help that the 90s Kenshin has my single favorite OST in ALL of anime. I’m not sure why they didn’t just use the 90s music but…who knows?2.\tManga and anime are different mediums of art. What works when you’re reading a manga and flipping pages isn’t necessarily what works best in an anime. That’s why I don’t think following the manga THIS closely is the ideal way of making a great adaptation. The 90s anime wasn’t afraid to put their own spin on things and make changes when they felt it would work better. The direction in the new anime feels timid and slavishly devoted.3.\tThe new character designs are very bland compared to the original. Megumi, Kaoru, and even Tsubame all look the freaking same! The character designer had an obsession with giving every character the exact same dark hair, blue eyes, and facial shape. When Sojiro showed up on screen in the final episode I wanted to throw something at the TV. Backgrounds are quite minimalistic in Kenshin 2023 and it feels like very little is moving or happening whenever our heroes are walking through the street. It really feels like they saved everything for the action scenes.4.\tThey followed the manga’s version of the Raijuta arc. An arc that even Watsuki himself admitted isn’t very good and that was massively improved by the 90s anime staff. I guess part of the appeal is that the new Kenshin really follows the manga, but if I wanted to see exactly what happens in the manga…I’d read manga. I own the entire manga series BTW. It’s one of the only manga series that I physically own.If you’ve never seen Rurouni Kenshin before and you greatly prefer the aesthetic of newer anime, I’d highly recommend this one. Kenshin is a phenomenal shonen with great characters, great action, and is just amazing all around. Personally, I still prefer the 90s anime…that we all know ended with the Kyoto Arc because season 3 didn’t happen.

I was hoping that the fight scenes might be something I would like, but it's still the same, In essence, there is nothing that moves my heart to like this anime, not at all.Apart...from that, yes I praise it because the style is still the same as before, when I saw it it was like an old school anime but with good quality, However, maybe it's because of the differences in times, it just feels strange watching anime with voice actors that I've heard many times before in other anime.Maybe this is just a matter of taste, for the background of Japan's past with Samurai scattered around as the main weapon, the Katana, but I'm not too interested in that. from that, yes I praise it because the style is still the same as before, when I saw it it was like an old school anime but with good quality, However, maybe it's because of the differences in times, it just feels strange watching anime with voice actors that I've heard many times before in other anime.Maybe this is just a matter of taste, for the background of Japan's past with Samurai scattered around as the main weapon, the Katana, but I'm not too interested in that."", ""As a massive fan of both the original series and the manga, I was really looking forward to this remake and overall I am impressed. At first it was hard getting used to the new style with most of the humor gone and the soundtrack going electric, but it was done rightly so. The animation is wonderful to look at, with many bright colors and cool backgrounds. The fight scenes are also a bit faster paced here too but not over-choreographed. It feels much like the battles presented in the manga. I especially loved the gatling gun scene and Kenshin vs. Saito. Voice acting is...great with plenty of emotion in the actors' delivery. Considering the manga is long finished, it is a bit weird to have two filler episodes. I'm sure it was just to hit a standard 24 episode count without ending the season on a bizarre place, but they're not very interesting. Speaking of the ending, while it stays true to the manga and is the right place to end it, it is a bit underwhelming in execution. Compare Kenshin leaving Kaoru in the original series to the scene here, it doesn't hit the same. Playing it over the credits was distracting, and the ending theme didn't fit the sequence at all and didn't feel as emotional or hard-hitting as the original. I do kind of wish it remained a weekly anime instead of seasonal because Rurouni Kenshin has slightly drier and slower pace compared to most shonen. I feel this is why some people being introduced to the franchise with this anime seem a bit underwhelmed and not getting what makes it so great. However the Kyoto arc is what really counts so if the seasonal format is how we get an upgrade I'm all for it. And naturally since the original never adapted the final arc I'm assuming the third season will go there. I'm just really glad this season turned out good and am pumped to see this studio adapt the rest! great with plenty of emotion in the actors' delivery.

Kenshin was almost at the end of the episode to deal with some shit. Yeah the Female was kinda uninteresting and annoying and that young side Character was just a little bitch. honestly maybe when the anime stops airing i`ll probably binge through the whole anime but for now i wll just leave this Review. Its just i believe at this time period the Story is outdated and didn`t age well. Unlike One Piece or any of the two in the Big 3, The Manga...only had 255 chapters and didn`t last long. Having a long running series will benefit it by adding new elements  in each upcoming decades. But since Rurouni was only serialized in the 90s alot of stereotypical Shonen shit stays. The second i think its a bad time for the Reboot of the Anime is because of the Author of the Series. I will not go over on what he has done but with the Crimes he committed i bet no one is interested in the Manga or the Anime. Only like people with nostalgia glasses have interest. My last question is what is the point of the Reboot? I mean sure they can animate this series in better animation with more fluid in it but did someone ever asked that they want a Reboot? Like there is no good reason to make reboot unless its just the purpose of money. One good example of a Reboot i can think of is HUNTERXHUNTER. Because one HUNTERXHUNTER was still serializing, Two they can bring a whole new audience and Three they can adapt it well in Anime format. The way they Adapt Rurouni was kinda stiff to me like the action scenes were kinda slow and some of the scenes transitions were just weak. Anyway in Conclusion i will write a second review after the anime finishes airing which will be like in Winter nad i will give my secons opinion on it. only had 255 chapters and didn`t last long.

It had all the right pieces: a well written story, lovable characters, great animation, and atmospheric music. I’m thinking where it went wrong is in being a little too faithful to the manga. It could have been a period piece, but it would have needed to be significantly more dramatic, with harder hitting stakes. Since, however, it flirted with superhuman techniques and abilities, it ended up falling far short of the multitudes of Shonen anime that feature far more exciting concepts. Shonen has come a long way since this...was written, and I think it could have used some creative liberties with the fight choreography. Even with the updated animation, this anime is a victim of its age. Bottom line: this retelling is a fantastic, beautifully portrayed period piece that explores a pivotal time in Japan’s history, but ultimately does not manage to captivate the imagination, and comes off as being fairly bland. was written, and I think it could have used some creative liberties with the fight choreography.

This lackluster anime fails to surpass the original in terms of voice acting, intro and opening credits/music, proper dramatization of events and good comedy. There is soOooo many classic moments in the original that makes it worth watching more than once. Even though this stays more true to the source material, this anime series does not MOVE you as much. The animation is too brightly colored for how dark some moments are (much like in the remake of HunterXHunter). There is a lack of great background music that delivers that feeling when you know there is...a change of events and the hero triumphed over evil. The voice actor does not have as much range and you don\'t feel some moments are as funny when Kenshin yells, ""Ororororo"". There just isn\'t as much tension between the characters to make you care.Now, I don\'t blame the remake\'s creators too much because the original is a masterpiece in my eyes and will always be a classic.

Plus, the fact that an old show is still talked about made me intrigued because it usually means that a show did something really outstanding for its time. However, an anime I watched has nothing like that and either it is a bad adaptation or the show gets better after 40 episodes or maybe the fame of the franchise is the result of pure nostalgia.The story itself is too simple: the anime doesn't try to use the full potential of the themes it presents, the...characters don't undergo any changes, and it is episodic. These are properties of any simple story and what makes feel like a children story is a narrator that butts in and explains primitive stuff like what the opium is. The story was too primitive for me to be fully invested and the story structure didn't help. Episodic format is good for creating diverse situations and maintaining good pacing and Ruroni Kenshin partially succeeds in it but its every arc lasts only several episodes and it was underwhelming how every conflict was resolved. There is one character, who is really pissed on the government for what it did 10 years ago and he has been planning to overthrow it since then. And the only thing it took to stop him is to talk to him; it's cheep to think that you can really convince a person to stop doing something they've been doing for years. And every other arc concludes in the similar anticlimactic way.The show did a good job in portraying the early Meiji era. That was a significant period in Japanese history that led to drastic changes in law, culture, and politics. And seeing it all shown in the anime was the only thing I fully enjoyed. This setting also presents a great opportunity to create compelling villains, who would refuse to accept a new government and, thus, acknowledge only the old law. Nevertheless, the villains are still cartoonish as hell and even if sometime they are motivated by the political changes it never becomes the central part of a conflict. Every other character is also simple as villains with the exception of Kenshin Himura, who has a background of a successful warrior. In the end he becomes a pacifist but the anime doesn't give any details why it happened neither it provides any philosophical background for the decision.The animation outside the battles looks good in general and during the battles it can range from acceptable to just fine but never exceptional, so in comparison to modern shonen the animation looks dated. The ost again is good but none of the tracks is memorable. The OPs and EDs are worth skipping: uninspiring songs and even more uninspiring visuals.I don't see any reason to make a remake of the original Ruroni Kenshin, if the goal wasn't to put everything in animation. It has an episodic format, which was perfect for 2000s but not now; the fight scenes isn't on a par with modern shonen as well. It's still going to appeal to the fans of the og show and to people who wanted to watch RK for whatever reason and now the modern filler-free version is available. characters don't undergo any changes, and it is episodic.

So, I watched a few episodes, and I know I shouldn't only compare it to the original, but, especially when it comes to the fight scenes and relating what was happening in the anime to Japanese history, I was left wanting. The final nail in the coffin for me to drop it, though, was the manga creator's continued involvement in the series, even after being convicted for the possession of kiddie porn. That didn't affect my rating, I was already disappointed with the anime, but I just couldn't continue after I found out that my patronage could benefit someone who might spend his earnings...exploiting children. Besides the point, but it definitely affected whether or not I continued giving this anime a chance. exploiting children. Besides the point, but it definitely affected whether or not I continued giving this anime a chance."", 'I’ve seen many comparisons with the previous anime which I found a bit unfair so I thought why not write something about it? With my own take on said comparisons.In terms of visuals, this remake follows the same idea as the new Bastard!! which was also made by LIDENFILMS. Compared to the previous adaptation, the overall artwork here is more consistent and doesn’t have the same quality drops, and of course the characters look closer to what you can find somewhere else this day, instead of the typical 90s look they had in the 1996 anime. The models are also more consistent, as another decision...made with this series was to be more faithful to the source material, which means that this show has less comedy which in turn is not as exaggerated, and thus the characters don’t turn into chibis during the funny moments. Still, from what I’ve seen and read, even the manga has more comedy than this, so clearly there´s an idea of presenting an overall more serious story.With that said, at some point even the artwork begins to suffer from quality drops and being more inconsistent and with the character models going off.The coloring is also obviously different from how it was back then, and even the directing seems to focus more on showing the characters, with very little of the backgrounds and even less long shots. A good example of this is the scene where Kenshin closes the door of the dojo and goes towards Kaworu on the first episode. Which is also the reason why the backgrounds on this newer version are such a mixed bag, all the crowds besides the main characters talking and moving instead of just standing still is fine, but the buildings and environment look so…uninspired and unpolished, especially every time that grass and water are shown.The special effects are overall ok in both versions but don’t really make sense in either of them, as sparks and beams come out when swords clash or just move during an attack. Well, I guess not much can be done when the action is limited to just people jumping and fighting with swords. Also, just like the older series used negative colors at points, the newer show seems to have its own version, as you can see when Kurogasa paralyzes people on the sixth episode. I don’t know, this stuff looked cool to me when I was a kid but come off as silly to me now.As for the actual animation, the idea behind it is to present the stronger characters as being way faster than everyone else. The 90s anime did it with a few frames followed by speed lines, the newer goes for teleporting the likes of Kenshin or Kurogasa with some light beams here and there to represent the slashes of their swords while everyone else falls to the ground. Since this version is more faithful, Kenshin isn’t AS stronger as he was in the previous anime, and some of the more over the top moments have been changed, as you can notice with how he stuck a dude on the ceiling with his barely visible sword and not just his finger as he was shown doing it in 1996. Both versions have quite limited motions but the 90s version is slightly superior.As a whole, as a kid from the 90s and someone who watched the original Rurouni Kenshin as one of his first anime at, like, 13, I am biased towards the aesthetics of the previous version. The coloring and models may be more inconsistent, and the chibi bits unnecessary and clashing in tone, but there was a certain charm and warmth in it that the newer anime simply lacks, making it a bit more soulless. With that said, the highlights of the show are still left to be adapted in this version, so visuals and directing might surprise us all once the big arcs are adapted.What’s undeniably worse in the new version is the sound department. The original Rurouni Kenshin has one of the best and most iconic soundtrack in any fighting shounen anime, for some even in the medium as a whole. Personally I don’t rank it THAT high, but I consider it to be very very good. The remake has a serviceable music, nothing wrong with it, but it just can’t even begin to think of competing with the older one.Something I was never fond of in the original were both of its openings. I know they are some of the most cherished of all time, but to me that has to do more with nostalgia than anything else. The music in both is…acceptable, and the visuals and songs flow together really really well, but I just can’t stand the voice of the singer, which I rank among the worst I have heard in the whole medium. And I still prefer them to whatever the new anime went for in its first intro song, which not only do I think it sucks and skip every time, it doesn’t even fit the series, though to be honest, I thought the same thing with the classic ones. The second one is much better in my opinion, even if it’s still just fine.As I mentioned in my Ravages of Time and Oooku reviews, what pisses me off not only about the Kenshin remake but other series like Vinland Saga and Golden Kamuy is that they are historical series, yet don’t even try to mix some elements from their time periods and setting to their intros. Just look at the latest one from the third anime I mentioned, which is half rap and half English, for a series that happens during the Russian-Japanese war and a big part of it is showing the Ainu culture. But apparently none of that matters as long as the song hypes you up, even with series that are not supposed to hype you up.To me, openings and endings are not important nor do they reflect the quality of an anime in the least, but since they exist, they shouldn’t just promote an artist or sell on the product to be considered great, they should also reflect what the shows are like. Otherwise you end with the Death Parade situation, one of the most dramatic anime of all time about dead people, where the intro has one of the most unfitting upbeat songs ever while the characters dance like idiots to one of the silliest sounding voices I have heard in my life. If they don’t, they are just like those misleading trailers for movies and stuff, and since those are criticized, I don’t see the reason why these shouldn’t be as well.Something that I always preferred in the 90s anime where the ending songs, there were seven of them if I remember correctly, and although they didn’t fit the anime that well either, by themselves they were pretty good songs, and just like the openings, the directing in all of them was great. The new anime has a first outro so bad and unfitting I couldn’t even finish it the first time, and I proceeded to skip it every single time. The second isn’t as bad, but I still find it unfitting and nowhere near as good as the ones from the previous anime.The sound effects are…serviceable on both versions. The 90s one had good ones for its time that are outdated by now at times and surprisingly good at others. The most iconic fighting scenes and techniques haven’t been covered yet, so maybe this will change once that happens, but so far the adaptation from this year has presented some very stock sound effects. Again, not bad, but very generic and forgettable, and inconsistent in how impactful they are in different episodes. As a whole, this aspect is the one where both series are more on par with the other than anything else.As for the voice acting, I can’t help but think that no version is really good, and ultimately, deciding which is the best one comes down to personal preference. The 90s anime had a curious cast, where a big portion of the most important characters were voiced by people that either weren’t voice actors, or barely have had experience in the field at that moment. Yet at the same time, others were performed by people that were already veterans, or would become veterans just some years later. The end result ends up being a mixed bag by itself. The thing is, the newer one was well selected and the voices fit the characters well and their performances are good, it’s just that it has a huge legacy to face. As so-so as the original voice acting was, those people voiced the characters so many times across so many different products, they inevitably got better at it, and practically became the characters themselves for long time fans.To speak a little about the most noticeable changes, Kaoru sounds sweeter and younger now than she did back then, not just simply because Rie Takahashi sounds like that, at least when she uses her cute tone, but also because in the 90s anime, Kaoru was a lot more violent, a trait that many female leads had around that time for comical effect, that as a far as I remember from the little I read of the manga, she wasn’t like that in the source material, thus making her newer self to be more faithful to the original. In the end, both are good and fitting for the different takes on the character.I don’t know who voices Sanosuke now but he sounds like Yuuichi Nakamura to me, his voice sounds good and fitting to me, and frankly I prefer this voice actor to Yuji Ueda, who I never liked much. With that said, the new voice lost the raspiness of the original, again, it’s not bad, but this way the character lost a little of the aggressiveness and the idea of a “badass sounding guy” from back then.The biggest, most notorious and most divisive change was of course Kenshin, who now is voiced by a man and not by a woman. The thing is, the casting choice back then wasn’t just because, there was an in-story and directing reason for it. As he is supposed to be based around a supposed real samurai that was rumored to be a woman or a boy for how young he looked and sounded. Also, because that voice was simply funnier during the comical moments, which were drastically changed or removed in this anime. Since the new adaptation goes for a more serious approach and tone, the male voice fits better with the new take on the character, just like Kaoru. This way, the change from the normal Kenshin to the angry Kenshin or the Hitoriki Battousai may not be as impactful and noticeable as it was before, but eh, you gain some, and lose some.Tomokazu Sugita as Kurogasa. He is a good actor that always gives his best on every performance, but I just can’t take him completely seriously for some reason. He did very well with his character, who was remade to look and sound younger than he was in the previous version, but he is simply not in the same league as Akio Ohtsuka for me.Satoshi Hino as Saitou. I expected Ken Narita to take over what was once a role of the late Hirotaka Suzuoki and nailing the performance once more as his perfect replacement, but whenever this actor, Hino, uses his serious voice he isn’t bad, here he did a great job.As a whole, the sound department is overall better in the original anime, but the voice acting is on par on both versions because of the different takes on the characters and tone on each one, and if for some reason you must choose one over the other, it ends up coming down purely to personal preference.As for the writing, the plot revolves around a samurai from the Bakumatsu era reflecting on all the killings he did for achieving peace, and defending innocent common people in the Meiji era, as he is constantly challenged and faced by his past in one way or another. The show as a whole follows a very standard classic fighting shounen formula, in the first episodes Kenshin finds what comes to be the main group of characters, while he goes around saving folks from the corrupt authorities like Zorro, basically. Then a short arc establishes said group for good as well as his main rivals during the series, and then two (or three) big arcs follow, and then the series ends.This essentially means that at the beginning, the anime is rather slow moving, even more so if you only watch this version and are used to the pacing of newer action shounen. Still, in terms of writing and pacing, things that I consider are most important, the new anime beats the original as far as I’m concerned. This season decided to adapt a short prequel manga which wasn’t all that good, even if it served to explained a major aspect of the main character, before stopping at the beginning of a big arc, one of the most highly acclaimed in the whole medium, so its quality is affected because of that compared to the previous adaptation, but in its favor it removed all the filler present in that version.Not to say that fillers are bad by themselves, sometimes they can add more build up for a better pay off (Dragon Ball), rearrange events for the better (Hokuto no Ken), or show more fights that are completely skipped in the source material (Yu Yu Hakusho), but in the case of 90s Rurouni Kenshin, they were mostly used to stretch the duration with minor fights in between against clearly outclassed enemies, and then finishing the series with 32 episodes of original material that, before the so called big three, were considered to range from average to the worst filler arcs in all anime, before ending incomplete, with a sequel that was half recap and half rushed storylines, with a divisive original ending, which I personally found good and fitting. As good as the Kyoto arc may be, it can’t make up for so much inferior content.Even when taking differences from both anime aside, I still don’t consider the writing in any of them to be that good. Sure, the characters talk about the new and the old eras, there are clashing ideological and political views, which in turn serve to flesh out the cast and what not, but the dialogues themselves are quite simple and come down to preachy monologues, as you would expect from a politician during a speech, basically. Plus, on a series where Kenshin is faced and challenged about his ideas and past actions, and what they led to, it’s a bit of a flaw when he is clearly right all the time since, besides Hajime Saito and Aoshi Shinomori, every other guy he fights is presented as a psycho, while he is the only one that makes a real point, and has grown and matured over time.The exposition is awkward in both versions, since information and backdrops for the characters are presented in quite random ways and moments.Speaking of characters, since the anime is all about fleshing out Kenshin, he is hands down among the best protagonists in all fighting shounen and the medium in general, while everyone else fills their role just fine. Kaoru is an ok love interest, and despite her naivety, she brings him the peace he so much longed for, and serves as the representation of his ideal new era. Yahiko is an ok student of both, he begins as weak and very rude but grows consistently in later arcs, and Sanosuke goes from a brute that fights against everyone just because, to the biggest bro that ever broed as the series goes on, way before Roronoa Zoro. His backdrop story was changed a little in the original anime, but both are good on their own.Since the new adaptation took away all the filler of the previous one, that also means that the main cast no longer interacts with some recurring minor characters from the 90s anime, they added nothing on their own to be honest, but served to flavor the main ones during the relaxing moments and give the previous version that certain charm and warmth that the newer series lacks for the sake of plot progression, gain some, lose some.Aoshi and Saito like I said are the only decent rivals Kenshin has in the early episodes and arcs. The former for his code of honor, the latter for being the strongest not psycho opposition to the protagonist in both strength and ideals.As for what’s in for the future, the highly acclaimed Kyoto arc will present a whole new decent set of antagonists with strong backdrop stories and even different dynamics amongst them, while keeping all the themes from the series. If the remake adapts that arc with the same seriousness as this season, it will increase its overall quality by a lot. With that said, said arc will still have typical fighting shounen issues, such as characters fighting one against one while calling out their attacks and fighting styles as they already did so far, in unrealistic fights, especially for an historical series and setting, but at least all of that will lead to an epic and bittersweet finale.When comparing the value of both series, the new one is clearly at a disadvantage, as the 90s anime was one of the most famous and beloved from its era, with some of the most praised arcs and soundtracks in the medium that made it super memorable, and it didn’t have much competition out there, while the newer one, while I’d bet it was big in Japan, didn’t have nearly the same impact in the west, partly because of nostalgic bias in favor of the previous version, but also because of all the competition it has right now, as well as many refusing to watch a series made by a pedophile author.As for what is the version that I personally enjoyed the most, it’s the prequel ovas followed by the live action movies, but limiting it to these two, I have to go with the newer one by a little. As much as I prefer the aesthetics and the 90s feel of the previous anime, keeping the core story without all that inferior filler made it a more pleasing experience altogether for me.In the end, I give the edge to the original anime only by a little thanks to its aesthetics and legacy, and only compared with this particular season. If the following ones do a job as decent as this one, or even better improve it with more polished dressing, I will rate those ones higher, and place the remake altogether as better as the older series.Remake 6/10 for nowOriginal 6.5/10 made with this series was to be more faithful to the source material, which means that this show has less comedy which in turn is not as exaggerated, and thus the characters don’t turn into chibis during the funny moments. Still, from what I’ve seen and read, even the manga has more comedy than this, so clearly there´s an idea of presenting an overall more serious story.With that said, at some point even the artwork begins to suffer from quality drops and being more inconsistent and with the character models going off.The coloring is also obviously different from how it was back then, and even the directing seems to focus more on showing the characters, with very little of the backgrounds and even less long shots. A good example of this is the scene where Kenshin closes the door of the dojo and goes towards Kaworu on the first episode. Which is also the reason why the backgrounds on this newer version are such a mixed bag, all the crowds besides the main characters talking and moving instead of just standing still is fine, but the buildings and environment look so…uninspired and unpolished, especially every time that grass and water are shown.The special effects are overall ok in both versions but don’t really make sense in either of them, as sparks and beams come out when swords clash or just move during an attack. Well, I guess not much can be done when the action is limited to just people jumping and fighting with swords. Also, just like the older series used negative colors at points, the newer show seems to have its own version, as you can see when Kurogasa paralyzes people on the sixth episode. I don’t know, this stuff looked cool to me when I was a kid but come off as silly to me now.As for the actual animation, the idea behind it is to present the stronger characters as being way faster than everyone else. The 90s anime did it with a few frames followed by speed lines, the newer goes for teleporting the likes of Kenshin or Kurogasa with some light beams here and there to represent the slashes of their swords while everyone else falls to the ground. Since this version is more faithful, Kenshin isn’t AS stronger as he was in the previous anime, and some of the more over the top moments have been changed, as you can notice with how he stuck a dude on the ceiling with his barely visible sword and not just his finger as he was shown doing it in 1996. Both versions have quite limited motions but the 90s version is slightly superior.As a whole, as a kid from the 90s and someone who watched the original Rurouni Kenshin as one of his first anime at, like, 13, I am biased towards the aesthetics of the previous version. The coloring and models may be more inconsistent, and the chibi bits unnecessary and clashing in tone, but there was a certain charm and warmth in it that the newer anime simply lacks, making it a bit more soulless. With that said, the highlights of the show are still left to be adapted in this version, so visuals and directing might surprise us all once the big arcs are adapted.What’s undeniably worse in the new version is the sound department. The original Rurouni Kenshin has one of the best and most iconic soundtrack in any fighting shounen anime, for some even in the medium as a whole. Personally I don’t rank it THAT high, but I consider it to be very very good. The remake has a serviceable music, nothing wrong with it, but it just can’t even begin to think of competing with the older one.Something I was never fond of in the original were both of its openings. I know they are some of the most cherished of all time, but to me that has to do more with nostalgia than anything else. The music in both is…acceptable, and the visuals and songs flow together really really well, but I just can’t stand the voice of the singer, which I rank among the worst I have heard in the whole medium. And I still prefer them to whatever the new anime went for in its first intro song, which not only do I think it sucks and skip every time, it doesn’t even fit the series, though to be honest, I thought the same thing with the classic ones. The second one is much better in my opinion, even if it’s still just fine.As I mentioned in my Ravages of Time and Oooku reviews, what pisses me off not only about the Kenshin remake but other series like Vinland Saga and Golden Kamuy is that they are historical series, yet don’t even try to mix some elements from their time periods and setting to their intros. Just look at the latest one from the third anime I mentioned, which is half rap and half English, for a series that happens during the Russian-Japanese war and a big part of it is showing the Ainu culture. But apparently none of that matters as long as the song hypes you up, even with series that are not supposed to hype you up.To me, openings and endings are not important nor do they reflect the quality of an anime in the least, but since they exist, they shouldn’t just promote an artist or sell on the product to be considered great, they should also reflect what the shows are like. Otherwise you end with the Death Parade situation, one of the most dramatic anime of all time about dead people, where the intro has one of the most unfitting upbeat songs ever while the characters dance like idiots to one of the silliest sounding voices I have heard in my life. If they don’t, they are just like those misleading trailers for movies and stuff, and since those are criticized, I don’t see the reason why these shouldn’t be as well.Something that I always preferred in the 90s anime where the ending songs, there were seven of them if I remember correctly, and although they didn’t fit the anime that well either, by themselves they were pretty good songs, and just like the openings, the directing in all of them was great. The new anime has a first outro so bad and unfitting I couldn’t even finish it the first time, and I proceeded to skip it every single time. The second isn’t as bad, but I still find it unfitting and nowhere near as good as the ones from the previous anime.The sound effects are…serviceable on both versions. The 90s one had good ones for its time that are outdated by now at times and surprisingly good at others. The most iconic fighting scenes and techniques haven’t been covered yet, so maybe this will change once that happens, but so far the adaptation from this year has presented some very stock sound effects. Again, not bad, but very generic and forgettable, and inconsistent in how impactful they are in different episodes. As a whole, this aspect is the one where both series are more on par with the other than anything else.As for the voice acting, I can’t help but think that no version is really good, and ultimately, deciding which is the best one comes down to personal preference. The 90s anime had a curious cast, where a big portion of the most important characters were voiced by people that either weren’t voice actors, or barely have had experience in the field at that moment. Yet at the same time, others were performed by people that were already veterans, or would become veterans just some years later. The end result ends up being a mixed bag by itself. The thing is, the newer one was well selected and the voices fit the characters well and their performances are good, it’s just that it has a huge legacy to face. As so-so as the original voice acting was, those people voiced the characters so many times across so many different products, they inevitably got better at it, and practically became the characters themselves for long time fans.To speak a little about the most noticeable changes, Kaoru sounds sweeter and younger now than she did back then, not just simply because Rie Takahashi sounds like that, at least when she uses her cute tone, but also because in the 90s anime, Kaoru was a lot more violent, a trait that many female leads had around that time for comical effect, that as a far as I remember from the little I read of the manga, she wasn’t like that in the source material, thus making her newer self to be more faithful to the original. In the end, both are good and fitting for the different takes on the character.I don’t know who voices Sanosuke now but he sounds like Yuuichi Nakamura to me, his voice sounds good and fitting to me, and frankly I prefer this voice actor to Yuji Ueda, who I never liked much. With that said, the new voice lost the raspiness of the original, again, it’s not bad, but this way the character lost a little of the aggressiveness and the idea of a “badass sounding guy” from back then.The biggest, most notorious and most divisive change was of course Kenshin, who now is voiced by a man and not by a woman. The thing is, the casting choice back then wasn’t just because, there was an in-story and directing reason for it. As he is supposed to be based around a supposed real samurai that was rumored to be a woman or a boy for how young he looked and sounded. Also, because that voice was simply funnier during the comical moments, which were drastically changed or removed in this anime. Since the new adaptation goes for a more serious approach and tone, the male voice fits better with the new take on the character, just like Kaoru. This way, the change from the normal Kenshin to the angry Kenshin or the Hitoriki Battousai may not be as impactful and noticeable as it was before, but eh, you gain some, and lose some.Tomokazu Sugita as Kurogasa. He is a good actor that always gives his best on every performance, but I just can’t take him completely seriously for some reason. He did very well with his character, who was remade to look and sound younger than he was in the previous version, but he is simply not in the same league as Akio Ohtsuka for me.Satoshi Hino as Saitou. I expected Ken Narita to take over what was once a role of the late Hirotaka Suzuoki and nailing the performance once more as his perfect replacement, but whenever this actor, Hino, uses his serious voice he isn’t bad, here he did a great job.As a whole, the sound department is overall better in the original anime, but the voice acting is on par on both versions because of the different takes on the characters and tone on each one, and if for some reason you must choose one over the other, it ends up coming down purely to personal preference.As for the writing, the plot revolves around a samurai from the Bakumatsu era reflecting on all the killings he did for achieving peace, and defending innocent common people in the Meiji era, as he is constantly challenged and faced by his past in one way or another. The show as a whole follows a very standard classic fighting shounen formula, in the first episodes Kenshin finds what comes to be the main group of characters, while he goes around saving folks from the corrupt authorities like Zorro, basically. Then a short arc establishes said group for good as well as his main rivals during the series, and then two (or three) big arcs follow, and then the series ends.This essentially means that at the beginning, the anime is rather slow moving, even more so if you only watch this version and are used to the pacing of newer action shounen.

When I watched the original I was disappointed the art and animation didn\'t measure up to Samurai X\'s. That alone was my primary reason for wanting to watching this. Kenshin and his morale code and backstory make him a character you can understand even if you don\'t identify with him. It\'s a question we all have to deal with, ""Should you never kill people, even if they deserve it?"" This is combined with the villains and their motives giving us the viewers the chance to empathize or not with them. Always asking the...same question, do they deserve to die? Us the viewers and the characters have to ask this question every time. Also, I expected a more streamlined, less filler version this time.Speaking of the characters, the rest of the main cast are one note chard board cut outs. Yahiko is always yelling and defiant, Sannosuke is always brawling and drinking, the rest are even less memorable. My biggest issue is this show requires a desire to learn about Japanese history to be truly enjoyed; or at least an intimate awareness of it. If history isn\'t your thing, this might not be the series for you. My last issue is, if you genuinely enjoyed the original version, I can give you no real reason to watch this.In conclusion, I loved it for the visual upgrade from the original, but but it\'s a bit of a history lesson.

So it didn't happen much that I liked something but after years discorver that was bad, so i started to see some comparisons between this remake and the original and I understand that i really still like the original a lot. The problem is this remake is flat, it's the standard of the standard.There are some substantial changes and some are more faithful to the manga, but that's not the problem, the...problem is that the humor was capped, the scenes of impact and emotion were extremely reduced, the animation is more standard POSSIBLY the same for the soundtrack. So it's a story where things just happen, you're not impacted by anything, you don't care about anyone.It's still completely decent, especially compared to the atrocities that are currently being released, and for those who already know it, it's cool to see the changes and if they get there it will be really cool to see the last arc animated, but I definitely don't recommend it to anyone who's never seen Rurouni Kenshin.If you want to see this story, watch the original anime without the fillers or the manga.There is also an OVA tsuioku-hen which is the best thing ever done with Rurouni Kenshin, it is a 4-episode stand-alone that despite being a prequel has a completely different presentation.There are also films that I don't recommend starting with, they're cooler for those who already know the animes, but even they are still better than this remake... problem is that the humor was capped, the scenes of impact and emotion were extremely reduced, the animation is more standard POSSIBLY the same for the soundtrack.

The show contains both episodal content and overarching stories with deeper running plots.On its own this show is absolutely fine, good or maybe even great depending on your familiarity with Japanese history and high powered katana wielders that move impossibly fast.The story in very short summary is that Himura Kenshin is a wandering ronin, a samurai without a cause (master). Very early on we learn...that he was a 'manslayer' during the Boshi war (Japanese civil/revolutionary war where the country went from feudal to the Meiji era) on the side of the revolutionaries. They won.Skip forward to about a decade later and he's simply wandering around carrying a reverse edged sword, sharp on the inside, because he has resolved himself to never kill again. Swords at this time are illegal to carry, so he attracts a lot of undue attention and gets himself pulled into situations that force moral dilemmas on him and tempts him to return to his old self - Make of this what you will.The notable change in his life is that he has started picking up friends and is beginning to believe that his life is changing for the better, but now those people are put at risk.This remake does mostly a good job and in my view it eliminates some of the elements of the old show that did not age well, such as toning down Kenshin's constant 'ororororo' dumb-face moments, a lot of the slapstick (Kaoru constantly beating the shit out of anyone who annoys her even in the slightest) and the dialogue has been updated to a more modern standard that isn't as old fashioned (for better and worse).It mostly does keep the contrast of Kenshin's silly side and his unforgiving mass-murdering 'true self', but also the show neither goes light or dark enough to really punch that difference home. This may be on purpose and later seasons may go darker, but for now it's missing that edge.When Kenshin changes deameanor, his face lowers and he speaks in a tone that gives you no doubt that the person in front of him has made the biggest mistake of their life, you are supposed to get chills and realize how close he is to giving up on a peaceful life. Sadly that doesn't happen.It's a bit of a philosophical issue, because when fighters in this show let loose, they're supposed to be ultra violent in a 90's kind of way that horrifies you with how easily and painfully life is ended. The old TV show also didn't go that far, but that's what this needs to take the final step in becoming something truly great. At the very least it needs to be stylized and impressed well enough on the viewer and it just isn't, the old show did this better. The OVA is a good example of doing it tastefully and I'd say it needs to go further.So it sits at a 7 because if you've already seen it, you're just getting a prettier version done in a more mainstream way. I have hope for the future though, some of what they've done with say, Takeda Kanryu's character, is a lot more expressive. Might be that big bad Shishio gets a similar treatment and is more interesting this time around.If you're new to all of this then you might find it much more interesting or you may find it relies too much on old stories, Japanese history and context and find it boring. I think everyone should at least give it a shot. that he was a 'manslayer' during the Boshi war (Japanese civil/revolutionary war where the country went from feudal to the Meiji era) on the side of the revolutionaries.

Disgusting don’t support this persons work ever. Shameful. Story isn’t unique its just a rehash of the old show with nothing new added in.

Tegamibachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6444/Tegamibachi,"[""To be honest, I didn't think I would enjoy Tegami Bachi after I read the plot summary. A government employee delivers letters and fights monster bugs. Great. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.Story: 9/10Although Tegami Bachi may seem extraordinarily childish at first, the subtle, dark undertones are what make it very appealing.Amberground, the setting of the story, is divided into three sections based on social class: Yodaka, Yuusari and Akatsuki. The land is covered by darkness with the exception of the artificial sun with illuminates the capital (Akatsuki); therefore, the farther away you get from the capital, the darker it gets.Lag...Seeing, an orphan, was found by a Letter Bee, Gauche Suede, who realized that Lag was the package he had to deliver to Campbell Litus, a small town in the dark Yodaka District. To Lag, Gauche was like a hero - he had saved his life numerous times during the delivery. Gauche was also the one who taught him about how letters hold the hearts of those who write it, and how the gaichuu (giant insects) are out to steal those hearts. Overshadowed by his hero, Lag swears to become a Letter Bee when he grows up. Only, when he finally achieves his goal, he discovers that the person who inspired him is no longer working as a Bee. Desperate to see him again, he begins to search for Gauche during his deliveries. In the process, Lag learns of an underground organization plotting to overthrow the capital, and the price that the citizens of Amberground pay for the artificial sunlight.Art: 8/10Studio Pierrot has done a pretty good job with the animation. All the colours look very comfortable and eye-pleasing, with fabulous openings and endings.Sound: 10/10I really like the music in Tegami Bachi because it really adds to the story. Each piece of music was carefully planned out and they really suit the setting of the story.Character: 7/10This is where I really think the story is lacking. Lag is an annoying crybaby who really, is nothing more than annoying. Niche, Lag's dingo, does incomprehensible things almost every episode. Gauche is the only one who has a relatively deep character, that enables you to understand his thoughts and motivations. The occasional flashbacks do help explain Gauche's character, but in general, you can't really relate to the characters.Enjoyment: 8/10The light mood mixed with the dark undertones make a nice blend.Overall: 8/10 Seeing, an orphan, was found by a Letter Bee, Gauche Suede, who realized that Lag was the package he had to deliver to Campbell Litus, a small town in the dark Yodaka District.

A mail delivery service known as “Bee Hive” recruits young “Letter Bees” to travel near and far and deliver letters.  To make things difficult, the land on which they travel is teeming with monsters called “Gaichuu.”  The letter bees are equipped with special guns and a protective pet called a “dingo” to overcome such challenges.  Lag Seeing is our main letter bee with a special power and dingo, and he strives to become the top letter bee.With such an interesting and...original premise, was the story executed well?  I have to say that Letter Bee started out strong.  We first see Lag as a distressed, confused young child whose mother was taken away by the capital.  He is nothing more than a “letter” needing to be delivered to a person who will take care of him.  You follow Lag as he encounters an inspirational letter bee named Gauche, and upon being delivered safely, he swears to become a letter bee just like him.Eventually, Lag takes a letter bee exam, finds a dingo, and meets many other letter bees who will occasionally work alongside him.  Unfortunately, Gauche isn't among them because he suddenly goes missing before Lag arrives.  The series manages to develop a lot of mystery up to this point about his whereabouts, Lag's mother, and the strange events that occur in their world.  Letter Bee also becomes a bit political as we gain insight into Amberground's system of government.Just before midway of the series, all of the mysteries are temporarily forgotten, and filler episodes take over.  The majority of the show consists of Lag making deliveries to random people whose personal stories range from compelling to cheesy, looking at flashbacks, blasting up Gaichuu, getting sick with a fever, racing, celebrating Christmas, and so on.  After a while, these episodes feel like a waste of time.  I personally wanted the story to move back to the mystery, especially with the anime nearing its end so fast.The final few episodes actually grow darker in nature and return to the mystery that made this series so fascinating in the beginning.  My friend and I thought that this was what Letter Bee should have been all along.  In the end, the story leaves off with much to be desired; however, a second season has recently been announced which explains why we ended up watching so many fillers. Hopefully Letter Bee’s continuation will explore more of its dark mystery and answer some questions.To answer my own question, I would say that the story was not executed as well as it could have been, but I do look at this anime under a more positive light knowing that a second season is soon on its way. There is much potential left for Letter Bee to bring out.CharactersThe characters certainly drive the series and make it very interesting.  Lag Seeing, as I have so often mentioned already, is an innocent, determined child who possesses the power to look directly into people’s hearts upon shooting his gun.  He views himself as delivering the hearts of people rather than just mere letters.  However, his major drawback is that he is a crybaby in every single episode.  Every little thing seems to touch his heart and bring tears down his cheeks.  Either you like him or you don’t.  I found him to be quite likeable despite his drawback.  Lag travels with his dingo called Niche who is rather compulsive in attacking others and is protective of him.  It is very fun to watch them interact during their travels.We also get to really know the other letter bees and Bee Hive officers.  They each have their own personality, strength, motive, and unique dingo.  Their backgrounds are slowly revealed through flashbacks; however, a few of them have yet to receive proper development which I suspect has been saved for season two.  Nevertheless, they are strong and memorable characters.The rest of the cast consists of people whom Lag meets while delivering letters:  a lonely little girl, a pair of lovers, a worried mother, a con artist, you name it.  While a few of them are pretty interesting, it is hard to just care about them all and to see the show focused on them so much.  Their purpose more or less serves to give Lag and the other letter bees some character development.Animation, Setting, and MusicThe animation is a mixed bag.  The character designs are great, as well as the background scenery for the towns and such.  However, it has not been a thrill ride to watch the fights that occur during every delivery.  The animation there is so-so, and the monsters are a bit too CGI for my tastes.  They never feel like they fit quite right in the show.This season worked very hard on developing its setting and atmosphere.  They are simply Letter Bee’s strongest points as of right now.  The atmosphere can be rather haunting because the world is always dark and bleak beyond the lively, warm towns. The background music largely contributes to this with its gentle, spooky tunes and classical music.OverallLetter Bee is a very unique and atmospheric anime full of deep mysteries and strong characters.  Its story might have gotten a bit weak midway with all its fillers and flashbacks, but it has so much potential for the second season.  This season was all about building up the characters and atmosphere; the second one just might get straight to business.  With high anticipation for its continuation, I recommend this anime. original premise, was the story executed well?  I have to say that Letter Bee started out strong.

I will do my best not to write a lot of spoilers.Story 9/10: The story takes place in a country called Amberground, surrounded on all sides by the sea and is composed of three separated areas. There are the capital, Akatsuki where nobles live which is brightly lit by a man made sun, The second is the middle class, Yuusari and Yodoka the lowest city which is covered by darkness. In the whole story so far its always night time. The story begins about a boy named Lag Seeing chained to a postal...sign as he is a letter who was found by a Letter Bee (Specialist who travels around and deliver Letters and eliminate monsters called Gaichuu. Letter Bee uses weapons called Shindanjuu a spirit amber weapon that uses their heart in order to shoot) named  Gauche Suede there Lag\'s adventure begins. The story will have many emotional scenes, great adventures and many unexpected things to entertain you\'s.Art 10/10: The art is great as the characters eyes are more detailed then your average anime that you watch everyday. The art is really enjoyable to look at, some will find the monsters weird as it looks cg. But overall the character designs are very nice, the environment is quite detailed the sky has a lot of pretty stars. The colors on the characters are great nothing to bright or to dull.Sound 8/10: The OP & ED is enjoyable nothing disturbing I find it suited for the anime. The voice actors in this anime are quite good Gauche Suede who is voice by Fukuyama, Jun Yeah! you know it the awesome guy who voices Tama & Lelouch. Some may find the voice actor for Lag seeing Sawashiro, Miyuki quite disturbing or not suit the character but please note: that Lag is only 12 and haven\'t matured so might suit him a bit in my opinion.Characters 8/10: The main character Lag Seeing is a boy who might be spoiled at beginning but tends to be really friendly as he sees Gauche memories and becomes a great person in the future. Gauche may be cold at times but volunteered to deliver Lag and who is later becomes Lags goal he is a kind hearted person but only thinks of saving enough money for his sister and doesn\'t treat those around him as friends at times.Enjoyment 8/10: The story is quite slow paced at first and might bored many who enjoys fast paced anime. Fast paced animes tend to have rushed endings the animation follows the manga but has slight changes like removing minor characters from the story. There are many emotion scenes and unexpected situations at times which brings me to enjoyment. The weapons won\'t be as cool as you think they are so any weapon freaks out there might go ""lame"" when seeing the weapons they use.Overall Its a great anime who many will find to like.

Tegami Bachi for me, is one of my kind of secret favorites, or rather prized possessions that really hasn\'t been seen by that many people, unfortunately (I know not that well explained couldn\'t really say it in any other way). So what makes it so special? A lot of things really. For one, no Anime, none has really anything similar to this plot and setting. When have you ever seen an Anime that is based on delivering Letters to people, that also are memories, stories and many other assortments of things. Not to deny any credit to the amazing...setting, that is almost dream like in its conception, dark, cold and dangerous, yet filled with history and adventure. But lets get to the meat of the show, Lag Seeing, our main character. Lag had always wanted to be a Letter Bee, and after seeing a massive role model Gauche Suede, a Letter Bee who went missing and at a legendary cost as well. But wait, why? This is likely due to the fact that this amazing land, it is also filled with dangerous creatures ""Gaichu"" which are un-killable by traditional means. So therefore, you need a lot of heart to take them down, literally. That\'s right, to get your Letter to the destination, you have to make it through these monsters, and to do so, YOU GOTTA HAVE HEART. So cliche\' yet so good. Most of these scenes have a great dramatic aspect to them, and a pretty good scene of action. And on these escapades, most Letter Bees have a ""Dingo"" a assistant that travels along side the Bee on their adventures. Niche, your Loli that makes life so much better is fun, loyal and caring for Lag, a generally weak and young well, child. All in all, this show just has to be watched to be fully appreciated. Sure it may be a lot more lengthy than you may like, and with a good some of filler, but the ending and the show that it gives is so worth, and some genuinely meaningful moments. Please watch this show, and share it around, it deserves it. setting, that is almost dream like in its conception, dark, cold and dangerous, yet filled with history and adventure.

""Letter Bee"" is one of the absolute worst things I have ever had the displeasure of watching, for so many different reasons. The show is a lazy, uninspired, generic, piece of garbage that fails at anything it could\'ve had...going for it. The thing that makes this worse though, is it\'s not even so bad that you can sit and laugh at it; it\'s boring. I will try my best to breakdown why I feel this way.The CharactersThis show has one of the worst cast of characters in any show I have ever seen, and almost every major character aids in on being a problem for the show, the major offenders will get their own category but before anything goes further, this show has one of the most boring and lazy character naming convention ever. Nobody\'s name is clever or smart and almost all of them are lazy ranging from words like ""Lag Seeing"" and ""Niche"" to just the first name you get when you look up most popular baby names for boys like Connor. Anyone not mentioned is extremely one note, and the only character with a semblance of personality that gets actual screen time is Gauche.Lag SeeingThe star and protagonist of the show, Lag Seeing, the perfect place to begin. The first major problem with him is that almost everything that happens in the show is handed to him on a silver platter, and within the realm of the show he is incredibly overpowered and no problem is actually an issue for him. Now that doesn\'t sound bad; protagonists like Goku, Ainz Ooal Gown, and Rimuru Tempest all fall into being overpowered and solve things with almost no issue, and they\'re great protagonists, but Lag Seeing fails to do anything to make himself likable when it comes to these situations. Often times Lag will just start crying, his magical overpowered red eye starts glowing, and boom problem is over. Nothing more to it. No Kamehameha, no wits, no nothing. His red amber just starts glowing and the problem is gone. He\'s also a particularly bad crybaby, he responds to almost everything by crying and often feels like a frustrating protagonist more than anything. I really mean it when I say every solution is handed to him on a silver platter; there is a part where he doesn\'t have a partner dingo (which is essential to becoming a Letter Bee) and literally within the next 5 seconds he meets an overpowered dragon girl that has never listened to anyone before but now listens to him for some reason, we\'ll get more into her later. And even when he isn\'t crying, his personality is just boring and bland. His only motivation to become a Letter Bee is because he met some guy when he was like 4 years old and has spent his whole life obsessing over this singular guy. Even when he\'s finally becoming a Letter Bee after passing all the tests with flying colours, he is STILL crying about this guy he met when he was 5 years old. Let\'s not lag on this topic any longer, otherwise I\'ll begin repeating myself. Before we move on, he\'s also a bit of a nosy brat too, there\'s an episode where a man is writing letters to his mom that he fills with lies to not worry her, but the whole episode Lag keeps going WAH THIS LETTER IS FILLED WITH LIES THIS LETTER IS ALL LIES I CAN\'T DELIVER LIES despite some of his idol\'s first words to him being that he does not inquire about the letter whatsoever, he just delivers it.NicheThis might unironically be the worst character in the show. She is the previously mentioned dingo of Lag Seeing that is some kind of dragon hybrid thing with claws and has supposedly never listened to anyone aside Lag. There is nothing more to say other than the writers used this character to write all their fetishes into. That\'s it. She hates wearing panties, she has a kink for being treated like a dog or slave, and those two traits make up her entire existence outside of her being overpowered and beating up anything Lag needs help with, and by that I mean she hits someone once and then Lag blasts his red beam and wins. There\'s nothing more to say, she\'s the fetish character.The PlotThis shows plot is dumb. Lag Seeing is just obsessed with Gauche, and the plot quickly spirals into a horribly generic ""government is bad who would\'ve guessed"" plot that a million other things have done before and did it better too. Every single character interaction is Lag shooting something, memories and ""feelings of the heart"" are revealed, they all cry. If you want to watch a show with an overpowered main character obsessed with an older man they only knew as a baby where everyone\'s weapons absorb their life force that also eventually twists into a ""the government is evil"" plot, PLEASE do yourself a favour and go watch Kill la Kill instead.Setting, Music, VisualsAs for music, this show has a god awful opening and ending song while the music within the actual show is just forgettable. The setting is somewhat generic, and the pretty night skies looming over desert being every location starts to wear real fast. The actual animation is terribly mediocre and the CGI for the robot enemies are absolutely awful. To save your time, it\'s bland to look at and anything that did look nice either rarely gets used or will get stale fast. Worldbuilding is actually horrendous in this show even though they try to make it out as if the world they are in is an extremely important part. The show also has an obsession with raining konpeito all over the screen. Speaking of...FlashbacksThis show is obsessed with flashbacks, stuff that doesn\'t need to be flashbacks will still be put into flashbacks for no reason, and they always put a sepia/greyscale filter for them alongside raining konpeito all over the screen. In the Christmas episode, there was a scene that would\'ve flowed finely but they skipped to Lag and his friend on a train and then showed a flashback that occurred roughly 5 minutes ago in world. It gets annoying fast. Not much more to say on that.The Singular DiamondThere is one good thing I can say about this show. One singular good thing. Every episode ends with these funny yet strangely long chibi segments featuring Dr. Thunderland teaching at the ""Letter Bee Academy."" This is the sole thing that holds up the show. It\'s pure chaos in a jar trying to be held together by Dr. Thunderland alongside a lot of actually funny fourth wall breaking jokes, such as a character who hadn\'t shown up in the main show yet commented on the fact that he hasn\'t. Almost all focus is taken off any of the main characters and shifted onto Dr. Thunderland; even the segments that don\'t star him, the full focus of those segments is usually about him not being there. The strange thing though is that Letter Bee Academy segments almost always succeed at humour, while every attempt at humour in the main show is cringe worthy. Speaking of comparisons to the main show, the Dr. Thunderland segments do more world building than the actual show.Summary aka TL;DRCharacters annoying. Protagonist horrible. Plot generic. Too many flashbacks. Very forgettable overall. Dr. Thunderland Letter Bee Academy segments funny. Only watch Dr. Thunderland segments and enjoyment will be raised tenfold. going for it. The thing that makes this worse though, is it\'s not even so bad that you can sit and laugh at it; it\'s boring. I will try my best to breakdown why I feel this way.The CharactersThis show has one of the worst cast of characters in any show I have ever seen, and almost every major character aids in on being a problem for the show, the major offenders will get their own category but before anything goes further, this show has one of the most boring and lazy character naming convention ever. Nobody\'s name is clever or smart and almost all of them are lazy ranging from words like ""Lag Seeing"" and ""Niche"" to just the first name you get when you look up most popular baby names for boys like Connor. Anyone not mentioned is extremely one note, and the only character with a semblance of personality that gets actual screen time is Gauche.Lag SeeingThe star and protagonist of the show, Lag Seeing, the perfect place to begin. The first major problem with him is that almost everything that happens in the show is handed to him on a silver platter, and within the realm of the show he is incredibly overpowered and no problem is actually an issue for him. Now that doesn\'t sound bad; protagonists like Goku, Ainz Ooal Gown, and Rimuru Tempest all fall into being overpowered and solve things with almost no issue, and they\'re great protagonists, but Lag Seeing fails to do anything to make himself likable when it comes to these situations. Often times Lag will just start crying, his magical overpowered red eye starts glowing, and boom problem is over. Nothing more to it. No Kamehameha, no wits, no nothing. His red amber just starts glowing and the problem is gone. He\'s also a particularly bad crybaby, he responds to almost everything by crying and often feels like a frustrating protagonist more than anything. I really mean it when I say every solution is handed to him on a silver platter; there is a part where he doesn\'t have a partner dingo (which is essential to becoming a Letter Bee) and literally within the next 5 seconds he meets an overpowered dragon girl that has never listened to anyone before but now listens to him for some reason, we\'ll get more into her later. And even when he isn\'t crying, his personality is just boring and bland. His only motivation to become a Letter Bee is because he met some guy when he was like 4 years old and has spent his whole life obsessing over this singular guy. Even when he\'s finally becoming a Letter Bee after passing all the tests with flying colours, he is STILL crying about this guy he met when he was 5 years old. Let\'s not lag on this topic any longer, otherwise I\'ll begin repeating myself. Before we move on, he\'s also a bit of a nosy brat too, there\'s an episode where a man is writing letters to his mom that he fills with lies to not worry her, but the whole episode Lag keeps going WAH THIS LETTER IS FILLED WITH LIES THIS LETTER IS ALL LIES I CAN\'T DELIVER LIES despite some of his idol\'s first words to him being that he does not inquire about the letter whatsoever, he just delivers it.NicheThis might unironically be the worst character in the show. She is the previously mentioned dingo of Lag Seeing that is some kind of dragon hybrid thing with claws and has supposedly never listened to anyone aside Lag. There is nothing more to say other than the writers used this character to write all their fetishes into. That\'s it. She hates wearing panties, she has a kink for being treated like a dog or slave, and those two traits make up her entire existence outside of her being overpowered and beating up anything Lag needs help with, and by that I mean she hits someone once and then Lag blasts his red beam and wins. There\'s nothing more to say, she\'s the fetish character.The PlotThis shows plot is dumb. Lag Seeing is just obsessed with Gauche, and the plot quickly spirals into a horribly generic ""government is bad who would\'ve guessed"" plot that a million other things have done before and did it better too. Every single character interaction is Lag shooting something, memories and ""feelings of the heart"" are revealed, they all cry. If you want to watch a show with an overpowered main character obsessed with an older man they only knew as a baby where everyone\'s weapons absorb their life force that also eventually twists into a ""the government is evil"" plot, PLEASE do yourself a favour and go watch Kill la Kill instead.Setting, Music, VisualsAs for music, this show has a god awful opening and ending song while the music within the actual show is just forgettable. The setting is somewhat generic, and the pretty night skies looming over desert being every location starts to wear real fast. The actual animation is terribly mediocre and the CGI for the robot enemies are absolutely awful. To save your time, it\'s bland to look at and anything that did look nice either rarely gets used or will get stale fast. Worldbuilding is actually horrendous in this show even though they try to make it out as if the world they are in is an extremely important part. The show also has an obsession with raining konpeito all over the screen. Speaking of...FlashbacksThis show is obsessed with flashbacks, stuff that doesn\'t need to be flashbacks will still be put into flashbacks for no reason, and they always put a sepia/greyscale filter for them alongside raining konpeito all over the screen. In the Christmas episode, there was a scene that would\'ve flowed finely but they skipped to Lag and his friend on a train and then showed a flashback that occurred roughly 5 minutes ago in world. It gets annoying fast. Not much more to say on that.The Singular DiamondThere is one good thing I can say about this show. One singular good thing.

It's about an ugly sh*ta stalking some man he met years ago, stalking his sister just because they're related, destroying the mail he delivers and then getting praised for it, etc. Not to mention the author is most certainly attracted to minors, given how many weird, uncomfortable scenes there are of actual children with extensive talk of their underwear habits. This show legitimately made me uncomfortable numerous times and I think nobody should watch this.

Goddamn AMAZING.Well, perhaps not, it\'s not the crunchiest peanut in the turd, but it holds it\'s own above many of todays moe moe anime.The biggest fault with this series is that nothing happened, or very little.You can get away with watching perhaps the first 3 episodes, and the last, as the entirety of the middle eps are all very filler, but this doesn\'t take away from the fun of the show, and the ending at very least, does hint towards a more fleshed out season two.The animation is great, twilight skies etc and has a vibrant lovely...colour palet that makes me squirt rainbows of happiness, i mean take one look, and try to argue it\'s not beautiful, i dare you.The main outcome of most of these ""filler"" episodes is more or less LAG WILL CRY.Yes, LAG CRIES, ALOT. But it\'s adorable because he is adorable and stuff.The girls are all adorable too though probably not as much so as Lag, but despite this there is no fanservice which is always a nice change of pace.Overall it is a good watch and i reccomend it to anyone who enjoys nice unique artwork and setting, but perhaps this isn\'t for you if you seek the worlds most gripping plot and DEEP characters. colour palet that makes me squirt rainbows of happiness, i mean take one look, and try to argue it\'s not beautiful, i dare you.The main outcome of most of these ""filler"" episodes is more or less LAG WILL CRY.Yes, LAG CRIES, ALOT.

Lag Seeing works as a ""Letter Bee"" (delivery boy) at the ""Bee Hive"" (a delivery service), with his Dingo, Niche, and her ""pet"", Steak, traveling with him. As a Letter Bee, Lag\'s job is entrusted to deliver letters and packages from town to town while avoiding Amberground\'s deadliest hazard — a species of giant armored insect known as Gaichuu, who attempt to feed off the ""heart"" that reside within these letters and packages.""~Source WIKIPEDIAWhen I first heard the plot for this series, I...wasn\'t very impressed. How in the world could a story about MAILMEN, of all things, be interesting in any way, shape, or form? Regardless of these fore-feelings, I decided to look into this series, and I must say, I am very glad that I did.The story is kinda simple: ""boy meets older boy, older boy goes missing, boy must find older boy."" Seen it a hundred times before, so why should it be any different this time? Well, throw in some magical Amber, giant metallic insects, a little girl with swords for hair, and letters that carry peoples\' hearts... and you\'ve got a smash hit recipe for success! The plot moves a little slow at first, but it quickly gains momentum after a few episodes, which is just plain lovely.Overall the story is very unique, despite how many things within it are from other pre-existing ideas and series. It can be very heart-wrenching at certain points, but it\'s also got its funny moments, which makes for a good and easy watch.Originality level is very high.ART 10/10The thing that caught my eye the most was the art. I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen anything quite like it before. While the story is an obvious shounen, the art reflects more of an aesthetic view of something that would be shoujo. It\'s, in a word, beautiful. The art of the anime does not reflect the detail and colouring of the manga, but both are just gorgeous in their own right.Definitely eye candy.The openings, by the way, are AWESOME!SOUND 10/10Mixing was fantastic. Soundtrack was beautiful. Loved the openings and endings.CHARACTERS 8/10The biggest issue with the characterization was the names. They\'re original and unique, YES. BUT... seriously? It\'s names like JIGGY PEPPER that just make me sit back and go ""WTF?!""The other issue was Lag. DO NOT GET ME WRONG. I love the little boy to death, and he has many many great qualities to him! On the other hand, he does come off as being a crybaby. At times, this can be a bit more than annoying. Take into consideration, though, that this boy is ONLY 12. It\'s completely natural for 12-year-olds to cry a lot. Especially when they\'ve had hard trauma. Once I came to that realization, it was easier for me to sympathize with him. I hate crybaby characters, but Lag is one that I simply adore.Niche was one of my favourites throughout the serie. She\'s so weird! She shows various animal-like qualities, such as licking wounds and sniffing the air for scents, which are quite amusing from a third-person view. All-in-all he is alittle slow on things, but she is loyal and adorable, not to mention the epic ability to stab people with her hair. I mean, come on! AWESOME.There are cheery characters like Lag and Niche, but this series is not without it twisted and darker personalities. Gauche Suede, Aria Link, and Lawrence are prime examples of this. When you take a look at them, it\'s as if they almost don\'t fit, considering how the main character is, but they blend perfectly.ENJOYMENT 10/10There was not a moment I did not enjoy this. It was fun all the way through. Each episode left me begging for more.OVERALL 9/10A good solid series, but alas, many ideas and plot points were unclear, therefore I can only give this series a 9.Do I recommend it? YES. I cannot stress this enough. I think everyone should watch this series. It\'s definitely worth it.

The way it tells it story is amazing and the story is pretty damn good too. The story is not about save the world or anything like that.The first 2 episodes of Tegami Bachi is a introduction so you must se them and the 3 episode to understand the serie.Tegami Bachi is about Lag Seeing who in the first episode gets saved by Gauche Suede. Gauche Suede is a Tegami Bachi (Letter bee), they deliver...letters or any kind of package. This time Lag is the package.So he finds and save Lag and in the end of the second episode delivers him.Lag and Gauche becomes really good friends and form a strong bond.A letter bee has a weapon, a spirit amber who uses the power of ones heart and with that power a letter bee destroys monsters that lurks out in the wastelands. The world is pretty big so there is a lot of wastelands between the towns / cities and that’s the road a letter bee must take. For some reason the world is always dark but there is an artificial sun but that sun is only were the capital is, the rest of the country is dark.When a person uses spirit amber it can reveals what’s in a persons heart and when Gauche save Lag he sees what’s in his heart. Gauche want to go till the capital to become the head bee and earn a lot of money so he could make his sisters life better (She is in a wheelchair).When Gauche delivers Lag he sets off back to his place and Lag promise him that he will also become a Letter bee.And then there is a time skip. 2 years later the cry-baby Lag (Yes, he cries all the damn time) sets off from his new hometown to become a letter bee and find Gauche. And this Is where to story begins. Gauche is no longer a bee and no one knows where he his. People are saying he died of using his spirit amber too much. Every time you use it a fragment of your heart disappears. So he moves in with his sister and promise her to find Gauche.The music is surprisingly good. There are many animes out there who has some good songs in the soundtrack but Tegami Bachi is one of them who only have awesome songs.The songs are everything from piano, violin to orchestral scores.The animation is wonderful and very detailed. Tegami Bachi has one of the most amazing animation ever if you asked me. Its not because of the details but mostly because of the colours. And due to that this serie will give you an amazing feeling that you only can achieve by watching Tegami Bachi.Characters are also amazingly good. One of the best series in this department.

It’s very slow paced, fairly episodic and stuffed full of filler for being only 25 episodes – but it’s hard not to like the show. Some episodes are wonderful; others are among the worst single episodes I’ve ever seen. Some characters are excellently put together and developed, others are paper bags or extremely irritating. However despite its rather inconsistent nature, my overall impression of Letter Bee is very good.The world setting and concept are what drew me to the series to start with –...and the sense of mystery that surrounds the central plot is what kept me interested throughout. It’s slow, but there’s enough hints dropped that you don’t lose interest. The end of this season is a cliffhanger though – you have been warned!  There us a sequel though, so the vast majority of this series is scene setting and character development. Letter Bee makes good use of its filler episodes to further establish the world and develop some of the characters further (although there are a few fillers that are just godawful!). Saying that, when Letter Bee is good, it’s very good – the highs of this show are characterised by a melancholic atmosphere and some very touching scenes that just warm the heart.In terms of characters, Lag is a complete cry-baby. Not a single episode goes by where he doesn’t cry about something. It’s annoying sometimes, but Lag really got lots of development over the run and his cry-baby nature is part and parcel of his identity. Niche turned out to be a really fun character – her innocent presence kept the mood from being too heavy or melancholy and she’s both the source of comedy and action. Some of the side characters could do with a bit more fleshing out, but overall they’re quite well done and provide a solid support for the main characters.ANIMATION: The character design and colour palate is the other thing that attracted me to Letter Bee in the 1st place and Studio Pierrot turned out a very attractive show. The animation is wonderfully consistent and everything is just pretty! Amberground is a world of perpetual twilight, and the primary colours used in the series are purples, blues and white – it’s striking and very visually appealing. The use of CGI on the Gaichuu was a bit obvious, but not distracting.MUSIC & VOICE ACTING: The soundtrack to this series is wonderful. Both OPs & EDs were excellent (the 1st OP & ED in particular made it onto my most played lists) and the score itself is also very well produced. The voice acting was also excellent – although Miyuki Sawashiro’s portrayal of Lag could be a touch on the whiney side occasionally. The supporting cast is peppered with great names who brought a lot of personality to their characters.Overall I’d recommend Letter Bee, but would also have to warn you of its inconsistent nature too. It would probably be less annoying to anyone marathoning it though, watching it weekly just seemed to highlight the fact some episodes were rubbish! and the sense of mystery that surrounds the central plot is what kept me interested throughout.

I am still overwhelmed with emotion at this point. Well, Tegami Bachi or Letter Bee is a beautiful anime much, much more than the simple letter-delivering. I had wanted to watch this anime for a long, long time, falling in love with the concept, artwork and when I had finally had the time to watch it all my previous expectations were blown away by the standards of the anime; which are absolutely amazing. I watched all 50 episodes for...two days straight. Me, who has severe commitment problems was so capivated by the essence of the anime as it challenged everything that life meant for me.STORY: At initial glance, it doesn't seem very original, NOT CLICHE either, but hardly something very unique. Letter-delivering. Very mundane. Not so in this anime. Letter Bees go on very dangerous missions, transversing many miles through the flickering light of Amberground, they face the constant threat of 'gaichuu'. This particular story follows Lag Seeing- the world's most adorable/lovable protagonist, a letter bee searching for his idol and his saviour - Gauche Suede; in the most basic, basic terms.The first season has very llttle plot development in terms of the previously mentioned concept, IN fact, it is safe to say the first season really just 'sets the scene' in 25 episodes, so by the time you reached the finale, you have a very thorough understanding of what being a letter bee entails, their impact on the lives of the civilians, the huge social divisionsof Amberground, basic knowledge on all the characters encountered so far, etc.etc.The Second season is when the plot really gets moving. Don't get me wrong, the first season was absolutely beautiful exhibition of the greatness of the human spirit. Beautiful and extremely moving. However, the second season is so extremely addictive and exciting because you are immersed in the journeys of all the protagonists and all their successes and failures are amplified tenfold for you, and in the most basic terms, season 2 retains little episodic elements of season 1 and is also much more exciting because there is significant plot movement.ART AND ANIMATION: I've combined these two because there isn't much I can say about them as I'm not an expert, but the art is beautiful and the animation is excellent. While watching this anime the last thing you'll be unhappy with is the art, (which is actually pallettable ART), and the animation, (which is smooth, non-jittery and enjoyable to watch, I.E. looks like it's done by ACTUAL professionals)  0o0SOUND: WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUl.... Music that is actually music, voice-acting that is actually done with emotion, openings and endings you actually want to watch, all in all, very impressive.CHARACTER; Ahhh, the characters/ protagonists were most definitely a hiighlight of the anime. On a general note, every single character of the series is an actual character, with emotions, development, (however small), history (however much touched on), hopes, dreams, and aspirations, NOT 2 dimensional stereotypes, which many animes have succumbed to. Not this one. The main character - Lag Seeing,  is the biggest crybaby I have ever come across. EVER. But in a weird warp he is also the most endearing and moving and emotionally sensitive soul I have also come across in all fiction, and the real world. He is type of character you wish you knew because he would be the greatest friend that would always be loyal to you and love you. AND FOR ONCE THE PROTAGONIST IS NOT A PERVERTED TWAT. AND you LOVE HIM FOR IT. Also, Lag Seeing, from the very first episode undergoes a huge emotional journey. Wrenched away from everything ever known, he grows a great deal in only the first few episodes; he learns the meaning of the words 'friendship, love, and journey.' Understanding first hand the experience of being a letter, it inspires him to able to give what Gauche Suede, (the letter bee that delivered Lag) gave him. This character development does not stop for one second in the duration of the both series.His dingo - Niche is an equally interesting character. Adorable, but equally deadly, in many ways, she is the polar opposite of Lag, but in another weird warp they make an unbeatable team. The relationship entails many hardships, as all realtionship do, but also triumphs through them, which really contributes to not only the likability of these two characters, but the whole series.THEMES: I could write a whole essay on this one. And I would. Happily. But for review purposes I will TRY to keep it succint. :P Sorry reader. OKK... Tegami Bachi is chocablock filled with themes. In fact, I don't think the word 'themes' quite entails what this show offers intellectually. Obviously, it can be interpreted very differently, but this is just my personal opinion. But Tegami Bachi is most definitely about communication. Duh. Delivering letters is just the front. In Tegami Bachi, letters are communication devices that allow addressers and addressees to read into one another's innermost feelings and wishes. It is a portal into one's heart, where people can really use time to think carefully and articulate what they really want to say ONTO paper. And it is the letter bees job to carry all that emotion and 'heart' emanating from that flimsy bit of paper that could have so much significance on someone's life, safely to their destination. This immortal secret is what (I think) the series tries to teach us. Unlike many deep meaningful series it doesn't preach right behaviour or good morals. It TEACHES. Yes, teaches. Teaches about friendship, explored through the interaction and the community of all the letter bees, and the friendships between letter bees and their dingos, that immortal bond so overlooked, prime examples constantly dotted throughout the series. (I'm trying not to spoil it). It also teaches, about respecting others, and in not the way you'd expect. That particular lesson broke my heart to pieces. It really exemplifies the meaning of sacrifice, and what true friends do for one another. Another major theme explored is 'good and evil'. Suprisingly I felt absolutely no enmity for the villian of the second season. I did hate a particular someone for the atrocious betrayal of trust but I won't specify who. Watch if you want to find out. :D Anyway, the series goes back deep enough into a character's history that I was able to emphasize enough with the villain to understand the reasonings behind their actions. weird....On a smaller note, the one thing that I wish that some important questions were answered. It seems like, while the series is absolutely great, the producers/directors forget about a few aspects of the Lag's history, and while it touches on it lightly is not nearly enough for fans to draw respectable conlcusions from it. Which is extremely unfortunate.ENJOYMENT: I think it's pretty clear from the rest of my review how much I LOVED LOVED LOVED this series. There has been a couple of negative reviews and what I really plead to you is to give this anime a chance. This anime really changed what I thought of anime as a whole, it was a refreshing, touching, at times heart-breaking series, forever immortalised in my heart, and I believe with every inch of my soul that it'll have some place in yours too.If you found this review unhelpful could you please tell how I could improve it for future reviews?

Thanks!!"", ""Have you ever wanted to post your child through the mail? xDFor an anime that I never thought I'd enjoy as much as I did, Tegami Bachi is a heartwarming yet sorrowful adventure anime that plays with your heart whenever it possibly can. Lag, being the 7-year-old that he was at the start of the anime, was absolutely adorable. I could repeat myself because it's the most adorable thing you could ever get. He's so pure of heart that I wish kids, in reality, could be like that too.Story 10/10The first episode starts where Gauche, a Letter Bee, brings Lag back to his aunt after...the despair of his mother's disappearance. At first, the two didn't get along and Lag started to gain hatred towards Gauche due to his foul-tasting meals and not thinking of him as a person and just a letter to be delivered, but then after Gauche saving his life and thinking of him as a friend, Lag becomes inspired along Gauche's footsteps to become a Letter Bee himself. Tegami Bachi is the epitome of the journey mattering more than the destination, and we have to judge it that way.I love the idea and symbolism where shindans are made from the heart and that other people are able to see what's inside of something's heart after one is used, whether it be a letter, object, or person. It's a very unique way of explaining character's pasts without anyone having to mention it. It has some wonderful world building. The story never shifts anywhere else and only sticks to the symbolism of hearts, so basically, after a few episodes everything is repeated, but they way they do it is unique and creative as they meet new people and learn about their hearts and motives. It makes you feel warm inside... and sometimes upset. So many creative and unique things happen around the work of a Letter Bee and I love how each character is meant to be misinterpreted to the watcher, only to notice what they felt in their heart. The ending of the anime is so depressing at its best and the mysteries that we discovered throughout the anime really built up to that well.Art 9/10It's a very pretty anime, and no, I'm not just talking about the art, I'm talking about the atmosphere.The anime comes off as very calming, especially with the blue and white colours that compliment each other. I'm always a fan of that. There's almost no anger or fear in the anime, and when that happens it normally would end with something soothing and beautiful anyway such as the snowflakes.Lag basically looks like a younger version of Gauche. At first, I thought that it'd be confusing to tell the difference between them, but it's actually there for a reason. Lag is basically 'replacing' Gauche in the story as he's walking in Gauche's steps, and then alongside everything else mentioned in the anime... it's beautiful.Sound 9/10The anime has a really beautiful soundtrack. All of the OST is relaxing and soothing and completely matches up with the anime. It makes everything feel much warmer and endearing. I'm not really a fan of ballads, but the second opening and the endings are absolutely beautiful. It makes there feel like a sense of brilliant friendship between everyone and an adventure, whilst being calming.Character 10/10They portrayed the characters well, making even the side characters have very beautiful meanings to melt at your heart.Lag acts like a child would which is a good sign as some children in anime don't even act like children. Lag stays almost exactly the same after 5 years pass, only really just maturing. He still stays his pure, emotional and caring self throughout the anime that needs viewer protection and literally carries people much older than him to safety. We really need people as sweet as Lag in real life. I need him as a friend. Every time Lag cries, my heart can't take it and I end up crying too, and that's like every episode. I don't hate his character one bit, in fact, it's my favourite.The same happens with Gauche, and every memory about him develops his character so great that it's captivating. The backstory that we discover in sections is what I love about character building instead of it all being told to us in one huge section. There's more than just one episode or character for its main purpose to develop Gauche's character, and with the shindan idea, it just makes everything feel acceptable and unique.As for Niche, she's expected to be a tsundere, but there's a perfect balance and she doesn't seem cliche in any way. She's strong-willed but inexperienced when it comes to basic tasks, and the show doesn't make it seem patronising when she is as she's only a child, only making her a well-developed character that puts her faith and trust in Lag. Steak and her are a weird duo, but it's adorably frightening nonetheless.Exclude Lag and I'd probably say that Zazie is my favourite; his tough but kind persona is amazing and his backstory is the most upsetting in my opinion for whatever reason. Even though it's not the most developed, the thing mentioning him making soup gave a lot of caring meaning to his character. The whole premise of the story is extremely deep and upsetting.Enjoyment 10/10Tegami Bachi is a story about a young boy that delivers hearts. I'm so grateful that there are 25 episodes for this first season. At first I never really took interest for the first two episodes even though I loved certain parts of them to pieces, and I was going to rate it an 8 or 9 until I realised that the anime was more beautiful and creative than I thought it was. Around 1/4 into the first season, I absolutely loved it, giving me hope for what the next 3/4 of the anime would be, and it sure did not disappoint me the slightest. The anime improves the further you watch it, and its unique memorable story will be put in a special place in my heart.Overall 10/10 the despair of his mother's disappearance.

Makes something annoying humorous and tolerable which is something very difficult to do, all credits are to the Protagonist of course.Enjoyment: 7- Not the first thing I wanted to go to when I had the chance to watch anything- Never really bored me, although I skipped a few filler minutes to the end to speed things up, to be honest I never lost anything important in the middle so all is well- Gets really interesting at the end, leaves you anticipating the next season- You 'like' the characters. Yep, just like. You might love Lag and Niche however.By all means, if you have some spare time check it out. If you have a decent attention span, you'll be able to swallow it (and enjoy it). Check it out for the second season, I think it's worth investing your time. Don't expect yourself to go out of your way to watch it when time is thin and anime is plenty.Overall: 7 Sound: 8- Excellent voice acting (I am a Jun Fukuyama fanboy thus giving every anime with him as a voice role a +1 point in sound.)- OP and ED songs do not stick out to me, they were not bad at all- Never remembered any BGMs to this anime, thus I come to the conclusion that it isn't anything special- I have found Steak's animal sounds slightly irritating...Character: 8- Most of the mains are nicely built stable characters, side characters come and go- Protagonist might cry too much for some viewers but it is forgivable.

Ok yea they deliver letters and kill monsters. After a few episodes I was hooked. This anime is quickly becoming one of my all time favorites.Story: I think the sheer emotion in Tegami Bachi is what makes it so interesting. Some parts are filled with happiness and joy and others filled with sadness and sorrow. They do a great job of projecting exactly what each character is feeling at that moment. It's one of the few animes that actually brought me to tears. Lag is...such a cry baby that sometimes it's impossible not to cry along with him.Art: The animation is absolutely stunning. Towns,characters, setting..everything is made to look realistic. You don't have scenery that repeats itself, it's very original. It's some of the best I've ever seen. Despite the dark atmosphere, they do a good job at showing you every emotion through the animation. TBLB's animation is absolutely amazing.Music: Most of the music is slow,sad, sort of gives you a bitter-sweet kind of feeling.They usually play something that is appropriate for each situation. The only thing I think Tegami Bachi was lacking was some up-beat music. Slow/sad music is great but when you have an action scene, or someone comes to the rescue, they should play music with a faster beat to it. That's my only complaint as far as music goes.Characters: The protaganist Lag Seeing, brings a new,fresh, exciting feeling to this anime. He may be overly-sensitive but, I feel that he isn't so cliche. He inevitably causes the viewers to feel the same pain,sadness, or happiness that he experiences. As for other characters, they are also very well made. Specifically Gauche Suede, he is a character that every body adores. He's very hard to dislike, and the heart-wrenching twists that come with him keep you watching until the last episode.Overall: I was impressed and surprised. I never expected so much out of Tegami Bachi. I was expecting a childish cliche anime but instead I got an emotional,heartfelt, stunning story. I've come to respect Tegami Bachi, due to it's grasp of reflecting the characters personal feelings and emotions. It has an entirely different focus then most animes and is definitely worth watching. such a cry baby that sometimes it's impossible not to cry along with him.Art: The animation is absolutely stunning.

It is truly a unique, virtually unheard of, totally underestimated anime.ThoughtsAll jokes aside, this anime is personally one of my Favorites. Although this anime lacks an English dub and a decent fan base I feel this is definitively one of the better animes to come out in the last 15 years. Besides the ending; this anime has a very well thought through plot. The Art in this series is absolutely some of the best I've ever seen in an anime Ever. It's to be noted though, that the...Gaichuu look really bad in comparison; but on the flip side this weird combination of beautiful artwork contrasted by the fake looking Gaichuu makes for a very unique and eerie feel. That being said I definitely wouldn't watch this anime for the occasional fight scenes; not that they're bad or anything. I do however do give major props to the writers who thought up these characters.Unlike more serious animes such as Neon gensis or welcome to the N.H.K. this anime has a lighter, more positive feel. Although this anime does have its moments; it presents some pretty cool ideas pertaining to what memories and what a person really is.

People just looks at the summary (which doesnt do justice) and think: ""Anime about mailmans who shoots giant bugs and the characters are little people, nope."" It is WAYYY more than that. It is an emotional and action packed anime and despite the bright colors used, it has an omninous, dark background.The first 3 episodes...I cried. Three times. Each epsiode. The story is really sad, and some peopl say the protagonist, Lag Seeing is a annoying crybaby. Ok, he is a crybaby, but he has a good reason.

Anyways, anyone who is having doubts about watching it, i promise, you wont be dissapointed and it will be above your expectations. I cried. Three times. Each epsiode. The story is really sad, and some peopl say the protagonist, Lag Seeing is a annoying crybaby. Ok, he is a crybaby, but he has a good reason.

While yes the MC is the most crybaby MC I have ever encountered, it's kinda justifiable if you read the manga. The OPs and EDs are definitely superb and compliment the story.Tegami Bachi world setting is definitely one of the most out-of-the-box I've seen. A Sunless world, where the Sun is a mere fairytale. A world of cat-eyed humans who seek to get closer to the artificial Sun. A world where memories and emotion matter the most. Also big insect monsters?! I'm sold.While it looks like a simple or childish story,...its depth is good and shows us how precious the work of Letter Bee. its depth is good and shows us how precious the work of Letter Bee."", ""this anime made me cry a lot but i gain a lot of happiness and i've learned a lot of lessons through watching it. i can somehow relate to some parts of the story. it touched my heart deeply coz im also a crybaby, reall a crybaby! T^Ti love this anime that's all i can say. "", ""Hands down, was surprised how much I love this anime series. When I started to watch it, it remind me of Violet Evergarden with postal service. I love how this show was great adventure story/ scientific with little of slice of life mix into it, meaning that it had a lot of heart with the characters and story-line.That being say the story-line was very unoriginal meaning it wasn't just a boy going to postal service to deliver letters. It had alot of mystery around the main character Lae Seeeing and the whole Letter Bee service.Hands down I love this series and highly recommend to...any one who loves slice of life mix with adventure. any one who loves slice of life mix with adventure."", 'I did not expect to get invested in this like I did...Story (7.5/10)Upon originally reading the synopsis I had no particular interest in watching this, but I\'m so glad that I gave it a chance. Reviewing this at the half way point of the story, I have to keep in mind that there are still a lot of questions to be answered regarding various part of the story and characters, motivations, details, etc. That being said, the prologue and set up combined with the atmosphere of this fantasy world, along with the concept of letter bees is fairly intriguing. It\'s like if Violet Evergarden was...set in fantasy world and functioned under shounen-esque rules. The overarching narrative is not completed in this first season, however the direction is clear. My only concern is the speed in which we are getting there, as this first season was 25 episodes and it feels like we haven\'t gotten very far. That\'s partly due to the episodic nature after the opening arc, but I hope this doesn\'t come back to hurt the overarching plot later on.Art (6.5/10)The character designs (7) and backgrounds (8) of this show are quite good, especially the backgrounds. My only real complaint is with the action sequences, they can be a little stiff and the use of CG for the gaichuu (monsters) is somewhat jarring and doesn\'t look all that great (4.5). But overall, considering the time this came out, it\'s pretty decent.Sound (8/10)Both OPs and EDs are really good. The classical OST is very appropriate for this setting, it helps with creating the dark/mysterious atmosphere about the whole show. That being said, I wish that the soundtrack was larger. I felt like I kept hearing a lot of the same tunes over and over again, and while that\'s not necessarily a bad thing, I just wish there was more of it to enjoy.Character (5.5/10)It\'s unfortunate to say this about a shounen but I found the characters to be the weakest part of this production (par the CGI). Lag is typical idealistic kid, and a bit of a crybaby, and he doesn\'t have much that defines him outside of being a pure little angel. However, that isn\'t to say that he does grow up and learn a lot through his journey and deliveries. Then we have Niche who has about 2 brain cells (yes I know she\'s a kid) and is the comic relief character and is pretty much solely defined by her dedication to Lag. The people Lag meets throughout the show usually end up with more development than him by the end of it (a bit of an exaggeration). Gauche is the character who probably has the most interesting story and yet he doesn\'t get nearly as much screen time, at least in this first season.Enjoyment (7.5/10)My enjoyment varied of the show waned during the middle when it started becoming episodic during the ""letter of the week"" portion of the story, but the final few episodes and particularly the first half had me engrossed, curious to see how this is managed in the second season (as it appears to be a direction continuation of the first with no real resolution in this first season). What really captured my attention was the vibe of the setting, largely enhanced by the music and the dark backgrounds. From what I gather, this series was made before the completion of the manga so I expect the second season to contain either an original ending or just leave me on a complete cliffhanger...we shall see.Overall (7/10)If you\'re a fan of older anime series (I consider anything over 10 years old as old) and want to check out something a little out of the way, I highly recommend you at least give this a go. It\'s a slightly unconventional fantasy story that can totally absorb you if you let it. The episodes run at about 20 min a piece which is slightly shorter than the normal 22-25 min and it feels like it too. As this is another older series I\'m writing about I doubt anybody is reading this, or have read to this point of the review, but if you just so happen to be reading this, please give this series a chance.Thanks for reading! set in fantasy world and functioned under shounen-esque rules.

Nothing really that stood out.The Series is set in steampunk world where the Chads are Mailmans. In this world they are called Letter Bee, or Tegami Bachi. They go around delivering Letters which carry people's hearts. Each Letter Bee has 2 main components. Their Gun which is capable of shooting there *metaphorical* heart and there Dingo which is like a sidekick. The story follows our main character who wants to find his hero who saved 7 years before we begin our story. So alongside his trusty Dingo who is an underage girl who refuses to wear underwear...because this is Japan and we have no choice in the matter.So When I say I found the series Middling I did lie a little bit. The setting of this series is very interesting. The desert is unironically kind of peaceful too look at. Until the Gaichu show up. Which are basically sand monsters. But Victorian style buildings and locations. As well as the outfits really add an immersion to the series you don't really see. If you guys think I'm praising something small and trying to make it much bigger than I should. That's because I am. Nonetheless good setting.Now the action is pretty hit or miss. Mostly due to how it was handled. The action is a one hit finisher type thing. Where the Letter Bee's charge up there attack to hit the single weak point of the Gaichu. Some are fun, most are ok, some are shit. Its not really anything tbh. The Dingo here is meant to be capable of revealing the Gaichu's weak point so the Letter Bee's can attack. This is basically all of the fight scenes in the series.Now the main character is... quite annoying. His hero that helped him 7 years ago was more charismatic then him. The main reason for that is because this guy cries so fucking much. Every Episode its the same shit. He just crying over and over and over again. Now I get it, he's 12, he's not supposed to be strong or whatever. But realism doesn't mean its enjoyable. If i wanted to watch a bunch of kids whine like little shits I'd go to the park or look in the mirror or hang around r/anime.I actually quite like the Dingo character. She is honestly adorable however. The, I'm not wearing underwear joke, was funny the first time. But Not subsequently.... I do hope this isn't a major problem continuing the series.Really the only episode that actually felt fresh was the last episode. Where not only the story moved forward but we got to see something different or something unique. I didn't hate the previous episodes either. But they just felt mundane. I don't mean to use the word boring but maybe redundant would be better.The series also has quite some filler. Do Note you don't have to watch the OVA that came before the series. As a remake of that OVA is made into Episode 17. So don't make the same mistake I did. The filler episodes themselves were actually fine. They kept in tone with the theme, the main characters. In the end the fillers weren't the problem. I honestly wouldn't be able to discern the quality of the filler episodes from the canon episodes.As far as Season 1 goes. I'm disappointed. Not angry, just disappointed. Considering how the series ended though I am interested in watching Season 2. I was told that it actually shifts from the manga entirely so lets see how the anime handles the ending.Overall. 5/10. Its fine. No strong opinions on this one so far. because this is Japan and we have no choice in the matter.So When I say I found the series Middling I did lie a little bit.

As stated in Rule 34 of the laws of the internet, ""If it\'s on the internet, there\'s porn of it"". There needs to be a new rule added that states ""If it exists, there\'s anime of it"" because there is literally an anime of almost everything these days.If you wanna know whatever the hell this anime is actually about, just call up the creator and have him send a letter bee to deliver the manga to you.But in...a thinly sliced nutshell, Tegami Bacci is about a little white boi named Lag Seeing. What, were his parents SEEING too much Crunchyroll LAG?!? One day his mom is kidnapped...? Or maybe she had a hot date in another country. Idfk, but basically this Lag kid is a letter that SHOULDVE BEEN EMAILED TO HIS AUNT\'S GMAIL, but computers don\'t exist in this miraculous world so.... rip to the interwebs that never came to reality. This one sexy man named Gauche delivers the little white boi, which for whatever reason inspires him to work for the United States Postal Service. However, he waits 5 years to actually do anything with his life. Long story long, heeeeeeeeee becomes a U.S. Postal Serviceman, delivering letters with a smile!While these characters aren\'t the next Fullmetal Alchemist cast or anything, they\'re pretty enjoyable. But god Lag, seeing that he is 12 he sure is a damn crybaby. Back when I was 12 I may have been an emo little prick but it doesn\'t even COMPARE to Lag. Niche is an alright character, but gets REALLY annoying fast. She just kinda wears off. I wish Steak didn\'t sound like he was being molested while taped up, but some people may consider those sound effects to be quite refreshing. Connor is probably the most relatable character in the show honestly. He looks a lot like my 3D form, much to my horror. Zazie, the epic little pussycat who makes me meow. And OH MY GOD DO I LOVE SYLVETTE!! Seriously, how come only 19 people have Sylvette in their favorites list? Last but not least (not rlly there are way more characters) you have Gauche, basically the Kamina of this series. Pretty good cast, no characters really develop at all but that\'s okay, we\'re not gonna get a Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood every time a new anime comes along. Calm your titties, college graduates.The art is overall pretty niiiii!iice. The character designs look destinguishible enough without looking too average or too over the top. But the design for Sylvette though, SO ADORABLE. I particularly like the designs for Aria Link and Zazie, and Connor because he resembles me somewhat. The animation is a mixed bag, sometimes looking really nice and fluid and other times being as choppy as Jackie Chan. But the CGI though, is SO BAD that whenever a Gaichuu pops up on screen, all I can do is laugh. A f00k!n toddler could do CGI better than the creators behind TEgAMiBAcHi can. When it comes down to music, some tracks sound surprisingly good. The first opening always got me excited, while the first ending got me excited for the next episode. Sadly, the second opening and ending fail to do that for me but they aren\'t bad songs.To conclude it all, Tegami Bachi is an anime that I find pretty dern entertainin. I feel there is much potential within this series, it just needs to use the force. If they just improve the animation and make some of the episodes more unique then I will likely enjoy season 2 much more. Overall if you want an anime that will keep you entertained with some g00d st0ries then check this out. I will write a review for season 2 when I finish that.

Farewell my fellow Walruses.8/10', ""Disclaimer: I am going to review Tegamibachi as a whole, which means that I will cover its 2nd season as well (Reverse).✪ Genre: action (gunfights, swordplay), adventure, drama, high fantasy, shounen, superpower✔ Positive Aspects ✔◧ Excellent animation, with very clear character designs (not allowing room for the viewing audience to confuse one character for another), with very elaborate and majestic physical structures, with some wonderfully melancholic and vast landscapes, on high saturated and very vibrant colors. The end result is very similar to another work by the same studio (Pierrot Plus), Tokyo Ghoul (a phenomenal anime, at least its 1st season), and to another outstanding...anime by TMS entertainment, D-Gray Man. In my view, comparatively, Tegamibachi is more akin to the latter.◧ Very creative choices for a soundtrack, ranging from Asia-influenced folk music, new age with various kinds of instruments, music suited to video-games, to more 'classical' kind of stuff (sort of). Overall, the editing team did a wonderful job using tracks that were very suitable for their respective circumstances.◧ The series's character development is, by far, its best attribute. Due to the series's unique concept (at least for the action/adventure/shounen genre), the use of the flashback device was narratively necessary. This has allowed for the portrayal of most characters' personal histories, motivations, and intentions (protagonists and deuteragonists alike), which, in turn, has allowed for a very cohesive and balanced unfolding of the plot.◧ As I alluded to in the previous paragraph, the series's concept is very unique and quite beautiful at that. The story takes place in a high-fantasy world which does not resemble our world in any substantive way, besides the existence of an artificial sun. While this world does appear to be heliocentric, we have no clue about whether or not this is the case for the planetary system that this planet belongs to (assuming that it is a part of one). Both aided by the perpetual night that engulfs this world, and the themes of sadness and nostalgia that frequently take center stage, this work feels very similar to D-Gray Man's atmosphere but without being as dark, because of its emphasis on attachment and solidarity, even among people with conflicting interests.✘ Negative Aspects ✘◧ It is genuinely rare for me, when critiquing an anime, to not stumble across multiple shortcomings. Yet, as far as Tegamibachi as a whole goes, I can only think of (3) minor ones:1) action scenes →  they could have been more drawn out and more challenging, especially as the plot was moving forward, at least for my taste2) skills development → the main character (and the protagonists in general) did not seem to grow with regard to combat in a consistent and explicit manner, as is expected of the genre itself3) fillers → the 1st season contained 10-12 filler episodesOverall: In my view, this anime belongs in the rare shounen class of 9-10 level rankings, which up until now had only one member, D.Gray Man. Highly recommended! anime by TMS entertainment, D-Gray Man.

Highly recommended!"", 'This series was like refreshment for our usual taste.The story was about a young boy who was delivered as a letter for unknown reason. He was inspired by the postman-like person who delivered him and so he dreamed to become a TEGAMI BACHI like that person. A tegami bachi was like a postman in the story with a post-apocalyptic setting where the world was engulfed with complete darkness except for one city where they have an artificial sun and only with the high class status resided. 5 years later, he finally achieved his goal but found out that his inspiration was no longer a...tegami bachi and was missing. The story was all about the protagonist journey on becoming a full-pledge tegami bachi and his mission to find his long lost friend and bring him back home to the people who love him.The series was so original, story wise, because it’s not every day you encounter an anime with a postman as a protagonist with a plot of delivering letters. In fact, I even don’t remember ever watching an anime with this type of story. It was very refreshing. You may think it would be a boring story but you will experience a lot of drama, action, and somewhat comedic relief with this series. It was amazing how they managed to make the story so interesting even with the simple type of story it had. It’s not your everyday anime with stories about adventures that deals with superhuman powers. They story was about the strength of the heart and the journey of delivering it to people.The main character was the cutest and the most crybaby in any animes in the history. In fact, he was crying in every episode of the story. He would cry for every little thing. He was so kind-hearted and very chivalrous for his age. He struggled to fulfill his dream even with his sad past and would always think positively. Though he can be very hypocrite at times because he was so pure and naïve. With the dark and sad settings, his naivety was his strength but most of the times his weakness. The most interesting character was his dingo, Niche. Niche was a rare species human being from a strong bloodline which gave her superhuman strengths considering she was so small but she can be so cute with her naivety of the world. She cared a lot for Lag and would always protect him from harm. She swore to be the best and only dingo for Lag. To add it up, the seiyus’ voice were perfectly match to the personality of every character. Especially, Niche’s seiyu! Her voice acting for Niche was just so cute and perhaps one of the reasons why Niche was so unique and cute among the characters.One of the strong points of the series was its animation. Well, that’s to be expected considering it was made lately. Even though it has a dark background the whole settings was beautifully made. The characters and landscapes were amazingly created.If you’re fed up with the usual stories of animes today then watch this one. Though the ending was so much of a cliffhanger, you don’t have to worry because it would be continued in the second season. In fact, it’s as if the two seasons is really one series cut in the middle so they can create a second season. tegami bachi and was missing.

Though the ending was so much of a cliffhanger, you don’t have to worry because it would be continued in the second season. In fact, it’s as if the two seasons is really one series cut in the middle so they can create a second season.', ""STORY:This series focuses around Lag Seeing, a young boy living in the world of Amberground. While weaving a very interesting tale of Letter Bees, who deliver letters for a living, and fight off Gaichuu with the help of their dingos and soul shooting pistols. Inspired as a child by Gauche Saude, who delivers Lag as a letter, he becomes determined to become a Letter Bee, just like Gauche was. When he reaches this goal, he finds out that Gauche is no longer a Letter Bee, even though he was one of the best ever. And so the mystery sets in.With such a great premise,...the series seems set for greatness. Unfortunately, for about 2/3 of the series, they pretty much forgo this story and just have random slice of life, monster of the week delivers that Lag goes on. The ending strongly hints at a sequel, however, and, hopefully, the sequel will do more for the series.Since this is the case, I have split the story score in two: The actual story of Lag and Gauche, being amazing and original, getting 9 out of 10 and the crappy slice of life stuff that takes up a large part of the series, getting a 5/10.ANIMATION:The animation in The Letter Bee is great, the characters are all original, the sceneries are gorgeous. There isn't much more to be said about the visuals other than they are well done, getting a score of 8/10.SOUND:Many great Voice actors are put throughout this series, doing a good job of making the characters sound like they should. Although about 3 out of 4 sounds that come out of Lag's mouth are crying of some sort, Sawashiro Miyuki  still manages to let the viewer be able to tell a difference in each sob, be them happy, sad, or pain. Also, the first OP is awesome. Other than that, the sound generally fits how it should be, getting an 7/10.CHARACTERS:There is a wide range of characters in this series, many being fairly original, and many being great overall. Unfortunately, the main character... pretty much cries more than anything else. Despite this, I think the characters are, overall, pretty good, getting a 7/10.OVERALL: This series has some of the greatest and most original material I have seen recently along with great visuals and voice actors... but it falls into a very slice of life monster of the week form... completely killing itself for the majority of the series. That being said, overall, the series is somewhat good. This earns it a 7/10 overall from me. the series seems set for greatness.

Rozen Maiden: Träumend,https://myanimelist.net/anime/65/Rozen_Maiden__Träumend,"[""Anime: Tr&Atilde;&curren;umend was animated by the same stuido as the first season (Studio Nomad), directed by the same director (Kou Matsuo), and ran on Japanese TV from October 5th, 2005 to January 5th, 2006.  Probably corresponds to some point in the Rozen Maiden manga, not sure which, though.Story: Tr&Atilde;&curren;umend picks up an unspecified amount of time after the first season.  All the dolls are still living at Jun's house, and he's definitely better than he was, but still not going to school (though there's good reason for it ' he's playing catch-up).  Shinku is having guilt-related nightmares, and after one of these,...she and Jun end up being drawn back into the mirror in his attic (why haven't they gotten rid of that yet?!) and meeting the seventh doll, whose appearance basically means that Father wants them to get on with the Alice Game, already.This season is everything I wanted last season to be, and more.  There's not so much filler as there was before ' and when there is, it actually advances the plot! --, and there's actually an overarching plot/urgency that wasn't there last season.  And moreover, we get to see the darker tones that were only hinted at in the last season.  There are so many more standout episodes, and the writers really show their talent by making you feel for characters you might not have necessarily liked last season.However, it's not perfect.  There is a character who turns into a bad running joke for most of the series.  And it looked like it was going to resolve things up till the last minute, but in the second half of the last episode, there's a nasty plot twist that leaves things open for a third season and several mysteries in its wake.Art: I don't know why, but the colors seem richer this season.  Maybe it's because there are so many scenes where they can use certain color schemes/tones.  Either way, it looks like it did last season, but better.Music: Again, about the same as last season.  The background music has its instantly recognizable songs (some that carry over from last season, too, which is really nice).  Didn't like the OP as much as last season's (ALI Project, again), but it grew on me.  Liked the ED instantly, though, as it's done by the same group who did Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament's OP, which is one of my favorites (kukui).Length: No real issues with length, this time.  Length is the same as last season's (twelve episodes), but it definitely goes by quicker.  When there was filler, as I said before, it ended up advancing the plot, so that was good, and there was an overarching plot/urgency to drive things forward.  However, the eleventh-hour plot twist in the episode, while it leaves things open for a second season, leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, because they were this close to resolving things, and they've only bought up more mysteries.Seiyuu: I recognize Enju's seiyuu from TmoHS (Koizumi) and Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ (Asuta), and Suigin Tou's seiyuu continues to rawq (Leandra from Nishi no Yoki Majo ' Astraea Testament and Lula from Red Garden!), but no other standout roles.  Decent seiyuu all around.Dub: N/A, has not been licensed as of yet.Overall: A definite improvement on the first season, but still has its flaws.  The ending leaves things more than open and ready for a third season, so Nomad should follow up on the implied promise and fix what few problems there are, kthnxbye.Story: 8/10Art: 8/10Music: 7/10Length: 8/10Seiyuu: 8/10Overall: 39/50; 78% (C) she and Jun end up being drawn back into the mirror in his attic (why haven't they gotten rid of that yet?!) and meeting the seventh doll, whose appearance basically means that Father wants them to get on with the Alice Game, already.This season is everything I wanted last season to be, and more.

Although I do not want to give out alot of info this series is about a young boy named jun who is locked up in his room because of cracking under pressure on entrance exams, we do not find out about that until later on in the series, so as a result he is a...hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer. Then he gets possesion of Shinku, a wind up doll in search of Alice (the perfect doll) for his creator or ""Father"" to be happy, and for that to happen she has to defeat all the other dolls known as ""Rozen Maidens"" and take there life which is called a ""Rozen Mystica"" Now as the story goes on you see the characters unique personalities and powers. I believe that this series is a great recommendation to people who are interested in mystical and almost sci-fi\'sh anime. The story was overall good and had me wondering what would happen next although I thought that the ending was a little weak because it doesn\'t explain what happened to everyone else but gives an idea.The Art in this Anime is absolutely amazing. For the most part when I watched this I felt like there was a normal feel (as in the regular japanese home and life) with a little class into it. there is detail in every background although the characters do stick out more. There is one scene I absolutely adored the art and that was when one of the Rozen Maidens (Suigin Tou) goes to her world and it is snowing with Crystals all around. I really did love that the backgrounds fit the characters nature and personalilty for the fighting scenes and the comedy scenes.now the music was great, I loved the opening for this anime so much, it was creepy and yet energetic and was so well done. I love that the ending was great too because it was classy and modern at the same time , with a fast beat but still had that classy feel. I also loved the background music for this anime. the Orchestra was great for the serious scenes and the not so serious scenes. I really did enjoy the musicNow I know in this review I talk alot about the characters but I cannot help it they were great. The way they acted was amazing to the outfits they wore. As a person who thought I\'d never watch this anime due to the fact that I am personally afraid of dolls, felt like these characters were real with every step they took. Each personality was different in there own way and that is why I fell so in love with them. I especially fell head over heels for Shinku. She may act serious at times, but there have been times I felt that she was funny and overall the most beautiful of the Rozen maidens. the costumes fit each of the personalities with different colors on everyone\'s costume, and the fact that each is very unique made my heart jump. I also loved the supporting characters too as they were very great at there personalities and expressions, plus their designs fit their personalities greatly.my overall enjoyment for this anime is splendid. The only problem I had with it was probably the design of barasusishou because the other designs of all the characters were amazing and detailed while her design felt like it did not belong, though I did enjoy this character repeating what everyone said, I did not like how she look because she stood out too much. I also as I said earlier did not really like the ending because I wanted to see what happened to the other characters in the story that got there Rozen Mystica\'s taken away, but it was an overall 9.5 out of 10 hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer.

However, the story still has flaws. This time, more dolls appear and the &quot;true&quot; Alice game really begins.The story this time is more interesting, is a little bit more original and the plot advances faster. However, it lacks some details about the story that i think werent very well explained.Still, is better than first season, so i pass from 7 to 8.art (7.3) - Not much difference in this aspect..i really didnt notice any change at all, still an average aspect.Sound (8.0) - Sound is a little better than...first season, however, is not enough for a 9. Background music this time fits better with the plot, the ed and op are about the same opinion i&acute;ve had in the first season, just acceptable.Character (8.0) - (read my review in the first series, so you will understand) Again, its what i said in the first season. My opinion didnt change much with the new story and with the new characters. However, with more action it gets a little better, but not enough to give a 9.Enjoyment (8.0) - This time, there is more action, more mystery. There is improvement in this aspect, this time i will give it an 8.overall (8) - Second series of rozen maiden is definitevely better than the first. However, there are still flaws, and even with this improvement, i still say that this is what i call an average anime. However, if you have a lot of spare time, you can check it, maybe you will like it. first season, however, is not enough for a 9.

Where the first season followed an agoraphobic boy as he learned to overcome his fears and demons in order to help those he loved, the second gives center stage to the Rozen maidens and their enigmatic Father. Where once Jun broke the Alice Game and repaired what was thought to be beyond repair, he is now swept to the side offering little more than moral support. This shift in narrative focus had potential. After all, Jun’s story arc was neatly completed by the end of the first season while the dolls were ripe for development. How long...have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun. As the show progresses, so too do the characters: Shinku struggles to deal with the consequences of the first season, the twin sisters find their intentions drifting apart, even the (mostly insufferable) comic relief character Hina-Ichigo concludes a surprisingly emotional character arc. Several new characters are introduced, such as the (completely insufferable) comic relief character Kanaria and the fabled seventh Rozen maiden, Barasuishou, as well as an inscrutable trickster rabbit and a mysterious dollmaker. Far and away, however, the breakout character is Suigintou, who develops into an equal parts sympathetic and badass anti-hero as she and some of the other maidens seek out mediums in order to attain an edge in the Game.The stakes continue to rise and a series of frustrating, yet justifiable decisions are made, investing one emotionally as the plot starts to heat up. Philosophies regarding the Game and the dolls’ involvement in it clash as characters arrive at different conclusions concerning what is right. I, for one, was rivetted to the screen by the later episodes as they steamed ahead towards their uncertain conclusion.And then episode 12 hits.I have never seen a more abortive climax than the one that waits in episode 12. The momentum the show has built collapses in just a few minutes as the ending is rewritten, live, before your very eyes! The writers make a bold statement about the futility of resisting fate and the insignificance of our main character in the grand scheme, and then change their minds 30 seconds later as one is left to weep over the corpse of the last several wasted hours. It isn’t a bitter, sweet, or bittersweet ending, it’s just junk.It is difficult to get further into this review without spoilers, so I will leave you with this: Rozen Maiden Traumend is a lot of buildup for very little payoff. There are other flaws, such as Jun’s consistent inaction in the face of major events and Kanaria’s entire existence, but these pale in comparison to the ending. If a bad ending spoils a show for you, don’t bother watching, or maybe just watch up to episode 11 and imagine your own ending under the influence of whatever drug/drugs you have on hand. have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun.

I chose to watch it, after seeing the ""desu"" memes all over the internet. The characters in this series are really enjoyable. You kind of get attached to them (which i hate when that happens because theres not that much episodes >.>) One thing i fell in love with was hina ichigos voice. (im a sucker for kawaii things like that.) I also really enjoyed how Jun went from being a shut in to falling in love with shinku. I really wish they would of ended the series better though. I hope they make a 3rd season. Withouth it ill...never know who became alice! never know who became alice!', ""STORY:I was very impressed with the story overall, I thought it was pretty unique. There were some great plot twist thrown in that took me by surprise, I was glad to see that things were not as obvious as they seemed. The story moved at a great pace and had no filler episodes.ANIMATION:The art is the same as the previous season although it seems a bit better this time around, the animation during the ending song was particularly beautiful.SOUND:I have to say I was extremely impressed with the voice acting, Mona Marshals performance as Jun was no less then outstanding, the same goes...for Mela Lee as Shinku and everyone else.The music is the same style used in season 1. It fits very well and there wasn't any song I disliked.CHARACTERS:I loved all the characters aside from the true  antagonist, they were all very interesting and I ended up rooting for most of them. I enjoyed Jun and Shinkus development the most. For me the characters are the main draw of the show.ENJOYMENT:Rozen Maiden is a truly unique show that should not be missed   I ended up enjoying the show even more then I'd hoped I would, none of the episodes were boring or unsatisfying.

I saw exactly where this one was headed early. The series reeked of a tear jerker from almost the very beginning. Right off the bat, the writers attempted to continue the character development concerning the dolls, with the intentions of establishing an emotional link with the viewer by over exploiting the dolls cute antics. This isn\'t a full blow against the series at all, because the driving force behind any work is the characters, and the viewer should feel for them. My only gripe is that because of this, the possible events were too spelled out in...light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas. The entire first half is a serious mixed bag, and can be looked at in a number of ways. At times, it can almost come off as complete filler, but there are things going on such as character and light plot development. The first seven episodes is drowned in its comedy which is hit most of the time; but those whom were used to the action scenes of the first season will be bored most of the time. Others whom enjoy the dolls very presence will be thoroughly entertained.My biggest problem with this season is that the writers try too hard to establish an emotional connection. They simply just didn\'t let the characters work and everything has to be pushed more. This will be the very first time I have an issue with character development. There was too much focus on the main dolls antics, and even their feelings to the point were Jun is almost left out completely. Adding to this, there were pacing issues as well that heavily effected the plot this time around. Even the two new characters whom were introduced weren\'t very well developed, and they felt more like cheap carbon copies.The drama in the series is also heavily over done but don\'t get me wrong here; when it\'s time for the drama to work, it does work. There are some good moments that will provide a few tears for those whom are attached to certain characters. However, at one time, a scene already achieved its desired and full effect, but would be heavily damaged due to its length. This worked against the series for me, and when someone else bit the dust it had that ""oh well"" feeling to me. The series eventually shifts to a darker side, but I think it was introduced a bit too late and simply didn\'t mesh right. Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas.

However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems', 'Rozen Maiden Traumend is the follow up to the original. Due to the lack of a proper interpretation of it\'s plot in the parent series of Rozen Maiden, for that reason I started watching this second season(also for more Suigintou) and since the first wasn\'t too bad, there\'s still hopes for development in this sequel.Traumend starts off from where the first series stopped; after the victorious battle with Suigintou, Shinku starts to feel the guilt of eliminating one of her sisters, all because of the Alice Game. In fact, Shinku simply made her into a ""piece of junk"". Is it wrong to feel sad for...an enemy you\'ve just defeated?Anyway, after completing Traumend, it\'s an improvement(but not massively) on the series, if you compare it to the original. Focusing more into the story, providing adequate explanation and reducing the number of trivial episodes. The story can be quite unpredictable sometimes; just when I thought THAT ""Father"" was the REAL ""Father"", turns that he isn\'t. There\'s also a considerable amount of drama with some fighting sequences and comedy going on. Final episode was more intense and better than in the original. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the results of the Alice Game.Why climb when you can fly? - the characters\' actions can be amusing. So, these dolls have the ability to fly(depends on the location or perhaps their mood). When I noticed that few of the them were ""climbing their way out of danger"", only for the enemy to catch up with them because she simply flew. You can sit there, relax and be amused by some their actions.Episodes 3, 5 and 7 are mostly just filler episodes, haphazardly placing keypoints of it\'s story that only lasts few minutes(sometimes mere seconds) and most of time, near the end. But hey, they\'re fairly watchable. It does focus on the story from time to time but at least 1/3 of the anime consist of very, slice-of-life-ish episodes. Like the original, pacing is slow as a snail.Traumend also introduces new characters and most of them play a major role in the story. First thing\'s first, Traumend has a new antagonist, the seventh and youngest Rozen Maiden doll, Barasuishou. Nevertheless, even with the new bunch of people, Suigintou remains as my number one character in the entire series and will always be.Comparing the original and Traumend and there\'s no enhancement on visuals.  After all, Traumend retains the whole same old visuals; colors are dull; not bright but Rozen Maiden dolls still look beautiful as ever, just like in the first. The visuals are sometimes inconsistent - characters faces differ from scene to scene. Just the same old, same old.ALI PROJECT performs the OP for this one too. Sadly, the majority of her songs including this is just not for me. Listened to the ED, and it was  actually quite good. But it gets old pretty quickly. BGM ranges from rock music(sadly the epic rock music is very rarely played) to same orchestral music pieces back in the original.To sum up, there\'s improvement in the overall storytelling, but even with that, I still wouldn\'t recommend it to everyone. After watching both seasons in the franchise, I must say that this is more recommended to the casual viewers. In any case, this is one series you have to see for yourself.

Less boring casual fillers (and empty space at all - first season was very, very emty, so that it could be cut to 8-9 episode without any harm to the plot). More reflection and philosophy (we even see them talk about God on the example of Master Rozen). Briefly, the story of Traumend is just smarter. Although, the illnesses of past times did not vanish utterly, and some episodes are still rather sleepy. And in plot there appear time after time illogical or rude lines that freak me out and spoil the enjoyment greatly.Art...- 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands. Rozen Maiden style remained stable and good.Sound - 9What is undoubtedly perfect in Rozen Maiden series is its breathtaking soundtrack. Piano and violon plays suit lolita-fashion so well that any action is exciting with this music playing. Opening is not great but alright, ending is dull, but at least you may skip it. What really doesn\'t let 10 to be set is the invariability. OST melodies are not to criticize but they are less, and after 20+ episodes of non-stop watching they don\'t please one\'s ears as much as in the beginning.Character - 9Rozen Maiden dolls are the collection. The collection of faces, haircuts, dresses, and psychological types. Of course, it should not be considered as serious ""panorama of social types"" or some that way. But this variety helps the comedy action a lot. Besides, some characters\' personalities are not as primitive as in season 1 (Suigintou, for example, turned in flesh-and-blood girl (if it can be said this way of talking doll) from Ominous-Villain-Demon-With-Non-Stopping-Nasty-Laugh), Shinku kicks Jun no more (annoyed me a lot) and, in general, became the most ample character in anime (she is principal char so that is natural, but I couldn\'t see it clearly before). All Maidens became more amiable and cute, I love them all after this season. And it\'s not because of their lowened agressiveness... they just got more alive.Enjoyment - 8,5Greatly spoiled by shortcomings of story, it is still high... I can make a conclusion in five words: I Would Rewatch This Anime.Overall - 8,5Rozen Maiden is original and outstanding yet using classical comedy-drama-system, and this is anime for everyone (no nudity, no violence, no profanity, purely platonic love storyline), so it is undoubtedly worth watching. It may please more or less depending on what to pay attention to most in general picture, but I think there are less people who watched RM and considered it a class-B shounen anime or so.I Would Rewatch This Anime.Would You Join Me? - 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands.

We have Jun not afraid to go outside anymore, and is actually trying to get into school again. There isn’t much development in the dolls but I guess that’s to be expected slightly. I have a small feeling that their artificial spirits are made to have a certain personality. I’m going to talk more about my theory later on in this review about that. We don’t really see much of the other human characters and so their personalities seem slightly the same. Jun’s sister...is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou. I have different feelings on both these new characters. Where as the fact I love Bara-Suishou as sort of a new antagonist for the dolls in light of what happen to Suigintou (Spoilers for the first series, sorry), I do not really like the addition of Kanaria. Kanaria felt like she was only there for comic relief. Her personality seemed to be similar to Suiseiseki in that she would get into trouble a lot and trying to sneak into the house. She also seemed slightly like Hinaichigo in how childish she is sometimes.With how deep the story gets, that doesn’t stop them from still doing the slice of life type of story arcs. They do end up making me annoyed slightly because there is so much story that can be given to the main idea of the Alice Game, the story behind the dolls and so on but what do we actually do get? Suiseiseki stealing Hinaichigo’s snack again, Shinku sitting reading or watching Detective Kun Kun, and Kanaria’s comedic attempts at going after the other girls. I can understand they are trying to give the characters more personality and show the personal growth of each of them but sometimes there is no growth at all. Then we are left with a kind of pointless run around with the story.Besides the slice of life stuff, the story does get a bit deep and sad. If I told you any more about that, then it would just be spoilers but there were times that tears did fall from my eyes.I said I was going to talk about my theory about the spirits. If you keep watching each of the dolls, it seems they have a bit of a collective soul. What I mean when I say this is that the personalities of each girl don’t always feel whole. Shinku is very proper; almost princess like where as Hinaichigo is very childish. Suiseiseki is a very mischievous girl who likes to tease others while her ‘twin’ sister Souseiseki is a bit more tomboyish. Suigintou is jealousy, and Kanaria is… I’m not fully sure but I think her personality is a bit of the sneaky planner. Sort of the personality of a girl who will sneak around someone to get what she wants or two get back at someone. If you look at all these dolls as personalities, it would seem that if all of them were put together, they would be the perfect being, the perfect ‘Alice.’ My theory of them and of the game they play is the idea that Rozen, their father, wanted to make the perfect daughter he named Alice and that the dolls must collect each part of Alice’s soul in order to become her. I do have another theory though, a back up theory if you want to take it as such… one that might be a very surprising turn of advents if this actually were to be true. My theory is that there is actually no real Alice Game. That the Alice Game was made up by someone to explain why they were ‘abandoned’ by their father. Their spirits though are pieces of their father’s daughter Alice who died at some point in time. In order to save her spirit, he placed parts of it into the dolls. It’s a large grasp at straws here but it’s another idea that I have from watching this series.The artwork is very beautiful when it wants to be and then it can also feel like they didn’t try. It’s much the same as the first series in both aspects. I still get the feeling that there are two different art styles from slice of life to occult in one show. The dolls are still rather detailed when not making funny faces or in a really comedic scene while the human characters feel a little lack luster. I am not sold on the face of Shirosaki, the salesperson at the doll shop in the show. I understand who he is from the moment I saw him (Not spoiling it though) but his face does not look like a humans. In fact, I really thought he might have been a doll himself with the way his eyes were and how his face was. It just looked way to flat and white to be real.The music is something I forgot to talk about in my review before that I will touch here. Both the first and this one have amazing music, most of it orchestra related. My favorite pieces are when the dolls are in some serious mode. That’s when the beautiful and yet haunting melody seems to come out that sounds slightly like a music box. I can’t help but get chills up my spine hearing that beautiful haunting melody. The English dub is basically the same so what I said before goes for this. I’m still not to keen on Hinaichigo’s or Suiseiseki’s voices much. Again, Hinaichigo’s high pitched childish whine is annoying and I really don’t understand why Suiseiseki’s voice has to be that high as well. They did grow on me more though since the first series which I guess works out. As for the newcomer, Kanaria is about as annoying as Hinaichigo’s voice. It’s high pitched and the way she talks reminds me of Naga the Serpent from Slayers. It’s that snarky little announcing voice that will say everything she is thinking no matter what. She hasn’t really had a chance to grow on me as much as the other characters though and maybe that’s why I can’t stand her right now.The story was actually really done and I liked how they dove more into the Alice Game and the story behind it but again they left more questions then answers. They had a very open ended ending that makes me wonder exactly what they mean by it. I still love the story and can’t wait to watch the rest of the seasons. is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou.

It really picks up, more characters are introduced, and rather than focusing on the main character of the last season, the focus turns to the dolls, themselves.

There really isn\'t a single character that I hated. Even the ""bad guy"" had my sympathy.This is a very good anime for anybody who appreciates dolls.

In the first season it was established that Jun had some special magical ability to ""bring back what was lost"" as demonstrated with the clown doll and with fixing Shinku\'s arm during her battle with Suigintou. The ending would have worked a lot better if this power was built upon / explained and then he used that power to restore all of the dolls after he found out they had been tricked - including Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki, instead of having a Deus Ex Machina moment with the...appearance of Rozen.And for some absolutely pointless reason, Rozen decides to leave Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki dead, again just to create cheap sadness with no logic. There is no reason Rozen or Jun should not be able to restore all of them.This ending is a huge disappointment because I really loved the unique concept of this show and the characters were very special, as I felt a real connection with all of them.

I like that certain obvious questions we had about the nature of the dolls was answered in a sensitive and fulfilling way (trying to be vague here to avoid spoilers!).What I don't like is the end. It was rushed and unfulfilling. It really felt like the writers had written themselves into a...corner and had to find a way to keep the action going until the end without leaving us on a sad note. I will chalk this up to trying to appeal to much to the action side of the anime (which was ALWAYS an afterthought). Unfortunately, the way in which they chose to do this robbed the most important characters of agency. And seeing these characters exercise that agency is what makes Rozen Maiden great in the first place (apropos that it is a franchise about ostensibly inanimate objects with animacy!).Nevertheless, the characters were treated with such respect and their personalities depicted well that I can forgive the very end of the story.

In my review of the first season I mentioned how the narrative is centered on the theme of ""trauma,"" but this does not seem to be the case for this sequel, which more deeply explores the conflicts of the story, although it does leaves many things open-ended, especially one of the major questions of the series, ""what does it mean to be Alice?"", so it is not conclusive for the series.One of the things...that is noticeable from the beginning is how the dolls and their personalities have more focus and are developed to make us more attach to them before they meet their tragic(quite tragic) ends. This is well done with all the dolls, but especially those who have benefited most from it are Shinzu, who needed motivation for her character, and Suigintou, who received such a good story that if nothing else, it\'s worth watching this anime just for her.In technical terms, this season has better animation and a better soundtrack. The piano in the background songs manages to convey the perfect tone for each scene, not to mention the opening played by Ali Project, which is always a pleasure to listen to.Not everything is perfect, though. The anime is very focused on the characters of the dolls, but the other characters are not explored much. The protagonist of the first season is sidelined, the protagonist\'s sister is super sidelined, and the new character, Laplace\'s Demon, is completely only used as a plot device.But in the end, this anime is a great continuation of the first one, with more comedy, action, and drama.

Trust me, you'll be lost.While Rozen Maiden was more about evolving characters, Traumend makes the jump right into action and keeps things moving at a fast pace throughout. There are still some fights between the dolls, however, it is more related to drama and action rather than...comedy.The new character Kanaria gives some laughs and eventually wears on the audience. But, Traumend is a bit darker than its predecessor and the dolls have to go through some hard times. There are even sacrifices, broken dolls and deaths.The darker tone suits well for character development and we see important changes in the main characters. The ending was somewhat surprising, but perhaps some would mention that it lacked something – turned out as a bit of a cop-out. Nevertheless, it is a satisfying end to the series.Traumend, overall a highly recommendable watch for fans of Rozen Maiden.

It was gearing up to be, in my opinion, better than the first season. However, the last episode left much to be desired. It's as if the writers did not know how to properly resolve all the conflicts, or perhaps they were confident in getting a third season and figured they would resolve them then. Sadly, this second season is the end for this version of RM. For this reason, I am left with many, many unanswered questions. For instance, why didn't Father tell...the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning? During the whole season, Father is made to look like a tyrant who wishes to see his creations fight to the death in order for his ideal doll to come to life. That is fine; I agree he is a bad man. But then at the end Father comes to the rescue?! And suddenly the fights are not necessary? Who was the Rabbit? What was his purpose and why does he get to possess Rosa Mysticas? I feel like this is cheating. And poor Jun had no character development. Seeing him be helpless and useless in the last episode did not sit well with me. I can understand that the first season was all about Jun, and this second one was going to be focused more on the various dolls. But in that case, it would've been better to leave Jun out of the finale. All in all, the season is great... except the last episode. It's not terribly bad, but it does ruin it if your expectations were higher, in accordance with what was set up in the previous episodes. So, I'd recommend, but be forewarned that the ending will probably not satisfy you. the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning?

Probably corresponds to some point in the Rozen Maiden manga, not sure which, though.Story: Tr&Atilde;&curren;umend picks up an unspecified amount of time after the first season.  All the dolls are still living at Jun's house, and he's definitely better than he was, but still not going to school (though there's good reason for it ' he's playing catch-up).  Shinku is having guilt-related nightmares, and after one of these,...she and Jun end up being drawn back into the mirror in his attic (why haven't they gotten rid of that yet?!) and meeting the seventh doll, whose appearance basically means that Father wants them to get on with the Alice Game, already.This season is everything I wanted last season to be, and more.  There's not so much filler as there was before ' and when there is, it actually advances the plot! --, and there's actually an overarching plot/urgency that wasn't there last season.  And moreover, we get to see the darker tones that were only hinted at in the last season.  There are so many more standout episodes, and the writers really show their talent by making you feel for characters you might not have necessarily liked last season.However, it's not perfect.  There is a character who turns into a bad running joke for most of the series.  And it looked like it was going to resolve things up till the last minute, but in the second half of the last episode, there's a nasty plot twist that leaves things open for a third season and several mysteries in its wake.Art: I don't know why, but the colors seem richer this season.  Maybe it's because there are so many scenes where they can use certain color schemes/tones.  Either way, it looks like it did last season, but better.Music: Again, about the same as last season.  The background music has its instantly recognizable songs (some that carry over from last season, too, which is really nice).  Didn't like the OP as much as last season's (ALI Project, again), but it grew on me.  Liked the ED instantly, though, as it's done by the same group who did Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament's OP, which is one of my favorites (kukui).Length: No real issues with length, this time.  Length is the same as last season's (twelve episodes), but it definitely goes by quicker.  When there was filler, as I said before, it ended up advancing the plot, so that was good, and there was an overarching plot/urgency to drive things forward.  However, the eleventh-hour plot twist in the episode, while it leaves things open for a second season, leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, because they were this close to resolving things, and they've only bought up more mysteries.Seiyuu: I recognize Enju's seiyuu from TmoHS (Koizumi) and Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ (Asuta), and Suigin Tou's seiyuu continues to rawq (Leandra from Nishi no Yoki Majo ' Astraea Testament and Lula from Red Garden!), but no other standout roles.  Decent seiyuu all around.Dub: N/A, has not been licensed as of yet.Overall: A definite improvement on the first season, but still has its flaws.

Although I do not want to give out alot of info this series is about a young boy named jun who is locked up in his room because of cracking under pressure on entrance exams, we do not find out about that until later on in the series, so as a result he is a...hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer. Then he gets possesion of Shinku, a wind up doll in search of Alice (the perfect doll) for his creator or ""Father"" to be happy, and for that to happen she has to defeat all the other dolls known as ""Rozen Maidens"" and take there life which is called a ""Rozen Mystica"" Now as the story goes on you see the characters unique personalities and powers. I believe that this series is a great recommendation to people who are interested in mystical and almost sci-fi\'sh anime. The story was overall good and had me wondering what would happen next although I thought that the ending was a little weak because it doesn\'t explain what happened to everyone else but gives an idea.The Art in this Anime is absolutely amazing. For the most part when I watched this I felt like there was a normal feel (as in the regular japanese home and life) with a little class into it. there is detail in every background although the characters do stick out more. There is one scene I absolutely adored the art and that was when one of the Rozen Maidens (Suigin Tou) goes to her world and it is snowing with Crystals all around. I really did love that the backgrounds fit the characters nature and personalilty for the fighting scenes and the comedy scenes.now the music was great, I loved the opening for this anime so much, it was creepy and yet energetic and was so well done. I love that the ending was great too because it was classy and modern at the same time , with a fast beat but still had that classy feel. I also loved the background music for this anime. the Orchestra was great for the serious scenes and the not so serious scenes. I really did enjoy the musicNow I know in this review I talk alot about the characters but I cannot help it they were great. The way they acted was amazing to the outfits they wore. As a person who thought I\'d never watch this anime due to the fact that I am personally afraid of dolls, felt like these characters were real with every step they took. Each personality was different in there own way and that is why I fell so in love with them. I especially fell head over heels for Shinku. She may act serious at times, but there have been times I felt that she was funny and overall the most beautiful of the Rozen maidens. the costumes fit each of the personalities with different colors on everyone\'s costume, and the fact that each is very unique made my heart jump. I also loved the supporting characters too as they were very great at there personalities and expressions, plus their designs fit their personalities greatly.my overall enjoyment for this anime is splendid. The only problem I had with it was probably the design of barasusishou because the other designs of all the characters were amazing and detailed while her design felt like it did not belong, though I did enjoy this character repeating what everyone said, I did not like how she look because she stood out too much. I also as I said earlier did not really like the ending because I wanted to see what happened to the other characters in the story that got there Rozen Mystica\'s taken away, but it was an overall 9.5 out of 10 hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer.

Where the first season followed an agoraphobic boy as he learned to overcome his fears and demons in order to help those he loved, the second gives center stage to the Rozen maidens and their enigmatic Father. Where once Jun broke the Alice Game and repaired what was thought to be beyond repair, he is now swept to the side offering little more than moral support. This shift in narrative focus had potential. After all, Jun’s story arc was neatly completed by the end of the first season while the dolls were ripe for development. How long...have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun. As the show progresses, so too do the characters: Shinku struggles to deal with the consequences of the first season, the twin sisters find their intentions drifting apart, even the (mostly insufferable) comic relief character Hina-Ichigo concludes a surprisingly emotional character arc. Several new characters are introduced, such as the (completely insufferable) comic relief character Kanaria and the fabled seventh Rozen maiden, Barasuishou, as well as an inscrutable trickster rabbit and a mysterious dollmaker. Far and away, however, the breakout character is Suigintou, who develops into an equal parts sympathetic and badass anti-hero as she and some of the other maidens seek out mediums in order to attain an edge in the Game.The stakes continue to rise and a series of frustrating, yet justifiable decisions are made, investing one emotionally as the plot starts to heat up. Philosophies regarding the Game and the dolls’ involvement in it clash as characters arrive at different conclusions concerning what is right. I, for one, was rivetted to the screen by the later episodes as they steamed ahead towards their uncertain conclusion.And then episode 12 hits.I have never seen a more abortive climax than the one that waits in episode 12. The momentum the show has built collapses in just a few minutes as the ending is rewritten, live, before your very eyes! The writers make a bold statement about the futility of resisting fate and the insignificance of our main character in the grand scheme, and then change their minds 30 seconds later as one is left to weep over the corpse of the last several wasted hours. It isn’t a bitter, sweet, or bittersweet ending, it’s just junk.It is difficult to get further into this review without spoilers, so I will leave you with this: Rozen Maiden Traumend is a lot of buildup for very little payoff. There are other flaws, such as Jun’s consistent inaction in the face of major events and Kanaria’s entire existence, but these pale in comparison to the ending. If a bad ending spoils a show for you, don’t bother watching, or maybe just watch up to episode 11 and imagine your own ending under the influence of whatever drug/drugs you have on hand. have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun.

I chose to watch it, after seeing the ""desu"" memes all over the internet. The characters in this series are really enjoyable. You kind of get attached to them (which i hate when that happens because theres not that much episodes >.>) One thing i fell in love with was hina ichigos voice. (im a sucker for kawaii things like that.) I also really enjoyed how Jun went from being a shut in to falling in love with shinku. I really wish they would of ended the series better though. I hope they make a 3rd season. Withouth it ill...never know who became alice! never know who became alice!', ""STORY:I was very impressed with the story overall, I thought it was pretty unique. There were some great plot twist thrown in that took me by surprise, I was glad to see that things were not as obvious as they seemed. The story moved at a great pace and had no filler episodes.ANIMATION:The art is the same as the previous season although it seems a bit better this time around, the animation during the ending song was particularly beautiful.SOUND:I have to say I was extremely impressed with the voice acting, Mona Marshals performance as Jun was no less then outstanding, the same goes...for Mela Lee as Shinku and everyone else.The music is the same style used in season 1. It fits very well and there wasn't any song I disliked.CHARACTERS:I loved all the characters aside from the true  antagonist, they were all very interesting and I ended up rooting for most of them. I enjoyed Jun and Shinkus development the most. For me the characters are the main draw of the show.ENJOYMENT:Rozen Maiden is a truly unique show that should not be missed   I ended up enjoying the show even more then I'd hoped I would, none of the episodes were boring or unsatisfying.

I saw exactly where this one was headed early. The series reeked of a tear jerker from almost the very beginning. Right off the bat, the writers attempted to continue the character development concerning the dolls, with the intentions of establishing an emotional link with the viewer by over exploiting the dolls cute antics. This isn\'t a full blow against the series at all, because the driving force behind any work is the characters, and the viewer should feel for them. My only gripe is that because of this, the possible events were too spelled out in...light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas. The entire first half is a serious mixed bag, and can be looked at in a number of ways. At times, it can almost come off as complete filler, but there are things going on such as character and light plot development. The first seven episodes is drowned in its comedy which is hit most of the time; but those whom were used to the action scenes of the first season will be bored most of the time. Others whom enjoy the dolls very presence will be thoroughly entertained.My biggest problem with this season is that the writers try too hard to establish an emotional connection. They simply just didn\'t let the characters work and everything has to be pushed more. This will be the very first time I have an issue with character development. There was too much focus on the main dolls antics, and even their feelings to the point were Jun is almost left out completely. Adding to this, there were pacing issues as well that heavily effected the plot this time around. Even the two new characters whom were introduced weren\'t very well developed, and they felt more like cheap carbon copies.The drama in the series is also heavily over done but don\'t get me wrong here; when it\'s time for the drama to work, it does work. There are some good moments that will provide a few tears for those whom are attached to certain characters. However, at one time, a scene already achieved its desired and full effect, but would be heavily damaged due to its length. This worked against the series for me, and when someone else bit the dust it had that ""oh well"" feeling to me. The series eventually shifts to a darker side, but I think it was introduced a bit too late and simply didn\'t mesh right. Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas.

Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems', 'Rozen Maiden Traumend is the follow up to the original. Due to the lack of a proper interpretation of it\'s plot in the parent series of Rozen Maiden, for that reason I started watching this second season(also for more Suigintou) and since the first wasn\'t too bad, there\'s still hopes for development in this sequel.Traumend starts off from where the first series stopped; after the victorious battle with Suigintou, Shinku starts to feel the guilt of eliminating one of her sisters, all because of the Alice Game. In fact, Shinku simply made her into a ""piece of junk"". Is it wrong to feel sad for...an enemy you\'ve just defeated?Anyway, after completing Traumend, it\'s an improvement(but not massively) on the series, if you compare it to the original. Focusing more into the story, providing adequate explanation and reducing the number of trivial episodes. The story can be quite unpredictable sometimes; just when I thought THAT ""Father"" was the REAL ""Father"", turns that he isn\'t. There\'s also a considerable amount of drama with some fighting sequences and comedy going on. Final episode was more intense and better than in the original. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the results of the Alice Game.Why climb when you can fly? - the characters\' actions can be amusing. So, these dolls have the ability to fly(depends on the location or perhaps their mood). When I noticed that few of the them were ""climbing their way out of danger"", only for the enemy to catch up with them because she simply flew. You can sit there, relax and be amused by some their actions.Episodes 3, 5 and 7 are mostly just filler episodes, haphazardly placing keypoints of it\'s story that only lasts few minutes(sometimes mere seconds) and most of time, near the end. But hey, they\'re fairly watchable. It does focus on the story from time to time but at least 1/3 of the anime consist of very, slice-of-life-ish episodes. Like the original, pacing is slow as a snail.Traumend also introduces new characters and most of them play a major role in the story. First thing\'s first, Traumend has a new antagonist, the seventh and youngest Rozen Maiden doll, Barasuishou. Nevertheless, even with the new bunch of people, Suigintou remains as my number one character in the entire series and will always be.Comparing the original and Traumend and there\'s no enhancement on visuals.  After all, Traumend retains the whole same old visuals; colors are dull; not bright but Rozen Maiden dolls still look beautiful as ever, just like in the first. The visuals are sometimes inconsistent - characters faces differ from scene to scene. Just the same old, same old.ALI PROJECT performs the OP for this one too. Sadly, the majority of her songs including this is just not for me. Listened to the ED, and it was  actually quite good. But it gets old pretty quickly. BGM ranges from rock music(sadly the epic rock music is very rarely played) to same orchestral music pieces back in the original.To sum up, there\'s improvement in the overall storytelling, but even with that, I still wouldn\'t recommend it to everyone. After watching both seasons in the franchise, I must say that this is more recommended to the casual viewers. In any case, this is one series you have to see for yourself.

Less boring casual fillers (and empty space at all - first season was very, very emty, so that it could be cut to 8-9 episode without any harm to the plot). More reflection and philosophy (we even see them talk about God on the example of Master Rozen). Briefly, the story of Traumend is just smarter. Although, the illnesses of past times did not vanish utterly, and some episodes are still rather sleepy. And in plot there appear time after time illogical or rude lines that freak me out and spoil the enjoyment greatly.Art...- 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands. Rozen Maiden style remained stable and good.Sound - 9What is undoubtedly perfect in Rozen Maiden series is its breathtaking soundtrack. Piano and violon plays suit lolita-fashion so well that any action is exciting with this music playing. Opening is not great but alright, ending is dull, but at least you may skip it. What really doesn\'t let 10 to be set is the invariability. OST melodies are not to criticize but they are less, and after 20+ episodes of non-stop watching they don\'t please one\'s ears as much as in the beginning.Character - 9Rozen Maiden dolls are the collection. The collection of faces, haircuts, dresses, and psychological types. Of course, it should not be considered as serious ""panorama of social types"" or some that way. But this variety helps the comedy action a lot. Besides, some characters\' personalities are not as primitive as in season 1 (Suigintou, for example, turned in flesh-and-blood girl (if it can be said this way of talking doll) from Ominous-Villain-Demon-With-Non-Stopping-Nasty-Laugh), Shinku kicks Jun no more (annoyed me a lot) and, in general, became the most ample character in anime (she is principal char so that is natural, but I couldn\'t see it clearly before). All Maidens became more amiable and cute, I love them all after this season. And it\'s not because of their lowened agressiveness... they just got more alive.Enjoyment - 8,5Greatly spoiled by shortcomings of story, it is still high... I can make a conclusion in five words: I Would Rewatch This Anime.Overall - 8,5Rozen Maiden is original and outstanding yet using classical comedy-drama-system, and this is anime for everyone (no nudity, no violence, no profanity, purely platonic love storyline), so it is undoubtedly worth watching. It may please more or less depending on what to pay attention to most in general picture, but I think there are less people who watched RM and considered it a class-B shounen anime or so.I Would Rewatch This Anime.Would You Join Me? - 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands.

We have Jun not afraid to go outside anymore, and is actually trying to get into school again. There isn’t much development in the dolls but I guess that’s to be expected slightly. I have a small feeling that their artificial spirits are made to have a certain personality. I’m going to talk more about my theory later on in this review about that. We don’t really see much of the other human characters and so their personalities seem slightly the same. Jun’s sister...is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou. I have different feelings on both these new characters. Where as the fact I love Bara-Suishou as sort of a new antagonist for the dolls in light of what happen to Suigintou (Spoilers for the first series, sorry), I do not really like the addition of Kanaria. Kanaria felt like she was only there for comic relief. Her personality seemed to be similar to Suiseiseki in that she would get into trouble a lot and trying to sneak into the house. She also seemed slightly like Hinaichigo in how childish she is sometimes.With how deep the story gets, that doesn’t stop them from still doing the slice of life type of story arcs. They do end up making me annoyed slightly because there is so much story that can be given to the main idea of the Alice Game, the story behind the dolls and so on but what do we actually do get? Suiseiseki stealing Hinaichigo’s snack again, Shinku sitting reading or watching Detective Kun Kun, and Kanaria’s comedic attempts at going after the other girls. I can understand they are trying to give the characters more personality and show the personal growth of each of them but sometimes there is no growth at all. Then we are left with a kind of pointless run around with the story.Besides the slice of life stuff, the story does get a bit deep and sad. If I told you any more about that, then it would just be spoilers but there were times that tears did fall from my eyes.I said I was going to talk about my theory about the spirits. If you keep watching each of the dolls, it seems they have a bit of a collective soul. What I mean when I say this is that the personalities of each girl don’t always feel whole. Shinku is very proper; almost princess like where as Hinaichigo is very childish. Suiseiseki is a very mischievous girl who likes to tease others while her ‘twin’ sister Souseiseki is a bit more tomboyish. Suigintou is jealousy, and Kanaria is… I’m not fully sure but I think her personality is a bit of the sneaky planner. Sort of the personality of a girl who will sneak around someone to get what she wants or two get back at someone. If you look at all these dolls as personalities, it would seem that if all of them were put together, they would be the perfect being, the perfect ‘Alice.’ My theory of them and of the game they play is the idea that Rozen, their father, wanted to make the perfect daughter he named Alice and that the dolls must collect each part of Alice’s soul in order to become her. I do have another theory though, a back up theory if you want to take it as such… one that might be a very surprising turn of advents if this actually were to be true. My theory is that there is actually no real Alice Game. That the Alice Game was made up by someone to explain why they were ‘abandoned’ by their father. Their spirits though are pieces of their father’s daughter Alice who died at some point in time. In order to save her spirit, he placed parts of it into the dolls. It’s a large grasp at straws here but it’s another idea that I have from watching this series.The artwork is very beautiful when it wants to be and then it can also feel like they didn’t try. It’s much the same as the first series in both aspects. I still get the feeling that there are two different art styles from slice of life to occult in one show. The dolls are still rather detailed when not making funny faces or in a really comedic scene while the human characters feel a little lack luster. I am not sold on the face of Shirosaki, the salesperson at the doll shop in the show. I understand who he is from the moment I saw him (Not spoiling it though) but his face does not look like a humans. In fact, I really thought he might have been a doll himself with the way his eyes were and how his face was. It just looked way to flat and white to be real.The music is something I forgot to talk about in my review before that I will touch here. Both the first and this one have amazing music, most of it orchestra related. My favorite pieces are when the dolls are in some serious mode. That’s when the beautiful and yet haunting melody seems to come out that sounds slightly like a music box. I can’t help but get chills up my spine hearing that beautiful haunting melody. The English dub is basically the same so what I said before goes for this. I’m still not to keen on Hinaichigo’s or Suiseiseki’s voices much. Again, Hinaichigo’s high pitched childish whine is annoying and I really don’t understand why Suiseiseki’s voice has to be that high as well. They did grow on me more though since the first series which I guess works out. As for the newcomer, Kanaria is about as annoying as Hinaichigo’s voice. It’s high pitched and the way she talks reminds me of Naga the Serpent from Slayers. It’s that snarky little announcing voice that will say everything she is thinking no matter what. She hasn’t really had a chance to grow on me as much as the other characters though and maybe that’s why I can’t stand her right now.The story was actually really done and I liked how they dove more into the Alice Game and the story behind it but again they left more questions then answers. They had a very open ended ending that makes me wonder exactly what they mean by it. I still love the story and can’t wait to watch the rest of the seasons. is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou.

There really isn\'t a single character that I hated. Even the ""bad guy"" had my sympathy.This is a very good anime for anybody who appreciates dolls.

In the first season it was established that Jun had some special magical ability to ""bring back what was lost"" as demonstrated with the clown doll and with fixing Shinku\'s arm during her battle with Suigintou. The ending would have worked a lot better if this power was built upon / explained and then he used that power to restore all of the dolls after he found out they had been tricked - including Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki, instead of having a Deus Ex Machina moment with the...appearance of Rozen.And for some absolutely pointless reason, Rozen decides to leave Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki dead, again just to create cheap sadness with no logic. There is no reason Rozen or Jun should not be able to restore all of them.This ending is a huge disappointment because I really loved the unique concept of this show and the characters were very special, as I felt a real connection with all of them.

I like that certain obvious questions we had about the nature of the dolls was answered in a sensitive and fulfilling way (trying to be vague here to avoid spoilers!).What I don't like is the end. It was rushed and unfulfilling. It really felt like the writers had written themselves into a...corner and had to find a way to keep the action going until the end without leaving us on a sad note. I will chalk this up to trying to appeal to much to the action side of the anime (which was ALWAYS an afterthought). Unfortunately, the way in which they chose to do this robbed the most important characters of agency. And seeing these characters exercise that agency is what makes Rozen Maiden great in the first place (apropos that it is a franchise about ostensibly inanimate objects with animacy!).Nevertheless, the characters were treated with such respect and their personalities depicted well that I can forgive the very end of the story.

In my review of the first season I mentioned how the narrative is centered on the theme of ""trauma,"" but this does not seem to be the case for this sequel, which more deeply explores the conflicts of the story, although it does leaves many things open-ended, especially one of the major questions of the series, ""what does it mean to be Alice?"", so it is not conclusive for the series.One of the things...that is noticeable from the beginning is how the dolls and their personalities have more focus and are developed to make us more attach to them before they meet their tragic(quite tragic) ends. This is well done with all the dolls, but especially those who have benefited most from it are Shinzu, who needed motivation for her character, and Suigintou, who received such a good story that if nothing else, it\'s worth watching this anime just for her.In technical terms, this season has better animation and a better soundtrack. The piano in the background songs manages to convey the perfect tone for each scene, not to mention the opening played by Ali Project, which is always a pleasure to listen to.Not everything is perfect, though. The anime is very focused on the characters of the dolls, but the other characters are not explored much. The protagonist of the first season is sidelined, the protagonist\'s sister is super sidelined, and the new character, Laplace\'s Demon, is completely only used as a plot device.But in the end, this anime is a great continuation of the first one, with more comedy, action, and drama.

Trust me, you'll be lost.While Rozen Maiden was more about evolving characters, Traumend makes the jump right into action and keeps things moving at a fast pace throughout. There are still some fights between the dolls, however, it is more related to drama and action rather than...comedy.The new character Kanaria gives some laughs and eventually wears on the audience. But, Traumend is a bit darker than its predecessor and the dolls have to go through some hard times. There are even sacrifices, broken dolls and deaths.The darker tone suits well for character development and we see important changes in the main characters. The ending was somewhat surprising, but perhaps some would mention that it lacked something – turned out as a bit of a cop-out. Nevertheless, it is a satisfying end to the series.Traumend, overall a highly recommendable watch for fans of Rozen Maiden.

It was gearing up to be, in my opinion, better than the first season. However, the last episode left much to be desired. It's as if the writers did not know how to properly resolve all the conflicts, or perhaps they were confident in getting a third season and figured they would resolve them then. Sadly, this second season is the end for this version of RM. For this reason, I am left with many, many unanswered questions. For instance, why didn't Father tell...the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning? During the whole season, Father is made to look like a tyrant who wishes to see his creations fight to the death in order for his ideal doll to come to life. That is fine; I agree he is a bad man. But then at the end Father comes to the rescue?! And suddenly the fights are not necessary? Who was the Rabbit? What was his purpose and why does he get to possess Rosa Mysticas? I feel like this is cheating. And poor Jun had no character development. Seeing him be helpless and useless in the last episode did not sit well with me. I can understand that the first season was all about Jun, and this second one was going to be focused more on the various dolls. But in that case, it would've been better to leave Jun out of the finale. All in all, the season is great... except the last episode. It's not terribly bad, but it does ruin it if your expectations were higher, in accordance with what was set up in the previous episodes. So, I'd recommend, but be forewarned that the ending will probably not satisfy you. the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning?

Probably corresponds to some point in the Rozen Maiden manga, not sure which, though.Story: Tr&Atilde;&curren;umend picks up an unspecified amount of time after the first season.  All the dolls are still living at Jun's house, and he's definitely better than he was, but still not going to school (though there's good reason for it ' he's playing catch-up).  Shinku is having guilt-related nightmares, and after one of these,...she and Jun end up being drawn back into the mirror in his attic (why haven't they gotten rid of that yet?!) and meeting the seventh doll, whose appearance basically means that Father wants them to get on with the Alice Game, already.This season is everything I wanted last season to be, and more.  There's not so much filler as there was before ' and when there is, it actually advances the plot! --, and there's actually an overarching plot/urgency that wasn't there last season.  And moreover, we get to see the darker tones that were only hinted at in the last season.  There are so many more standout episodes, and the writers really show their talent by making you feel for characters you might not have necessarily liked last season.However, it's not perfect.  There is a character who turns into a bad running joke for most of the series.  And it looked like it was going to resolve things up till the last minute, but in the second half of the last episode, there's a nasty plot twist that leaves things open for a third season and several mysteries in its wake.Art: I don't know why, but the colors seem richer this season.  Maybe it's because there are so many scenes where they can use certain color schemes/tones.  Either way, it looks like it did last season, but better.Music: Again, about the same as last season.  The background music has its instantly recognizable songs (some that carry over from last season, too, which is really nice).  Didn't like the OP as much as last season's (ALI Project, again), but it grew on me.  Liked the ED instantly, though, as it's done by the same group who did Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament's OP, which is one of my favorites (kukui).Length: No real issues with length, this time.  Length is the same as last season's (twelve episodes), but it definitely goes by quicker.  When there was filler, as I said before, it ended up advancing the plot, so that was good, and there was an overarching plot/urgency to drive things forward.  However, the eleventh-hour plot twist in the episode, while it leaves things open for a second season, leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, because they were this close to resolving things, and they've only bought up more mysteries.Seiyuu: I recognize Enju's seiyuu from TmoHS (Koizumi) and Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ (Asuta), and Suigin Tou's seiyuu continues to rawq (Leandra from Nishi no Yoki Majo ' Astraea Testament and Lula from Red Garden!), but no other standout roles.  Decent seiyuu all around.Dub: N/A, has not been licensed as of yet.Overall: A definite improvement on the first season, but still has its flaws.

Although I do not want to give out alot of info this series is about a young boy named jun who is locked up in his room because of cracking under pressure on entrance exams, we do not find out about that until later on in the series, so as a result he is a...hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer. Then he gets possesion of Shinku, a wind up doll in search of Alice (the perfect doll) for his creator or ""Father"" to be happy, and for that to happen she has to defeat all the other dolls known as ""Rozen Maidens"" and take there life which is called a ""Rozen Mystica"" Now as the story goes on you see the characters unique personalities and powers. I believe that this series is a great recommendation to people who are interested in mystical and almost sci-fi\'sh anime. The story was overall good and had me wondering what would happen next although I thought that the ending was a little weak because it doesn\'t explain what happened to everyone else but gives an idea.The Art in this Anime is absolutely amazing. For the most part when I watched this I felt like there was a normal feel (as in the regular japanese home and life) with a little class into it. there is detail in every background although the characters do stick out more. There is one scene I absolutely adored the art and that was when one of the Rozen Maidens (Suigin Tou) goes to her world and it is snowing with Crystals all around. I really did love that the backgrounds fit the characters nature and personalilty for the fighting scenes and the comedy scenes.now the music was great, I loved the opening for this anime so much, it was creepy and yet energetic and was so well done. I love that the ending was great too because it was classy and modern at the same time , with a fast beat but still had that classy feel. I also loved the background music for this anime. the Orchestra was great for the serious scenes and the not so serious scenes. I really did enjoy the musicNow I know in this review I talk alot about the characters but I cannot help it they were great. The way they acted was amazing to the outfits they wore. As a person who thought I\'d never watch this anime due to the fact that I am personally afraid of dolls, felt like these characters were real with every step they took. Each personality was different in there own way and that is why I fell so in love with them. I especially fell head over heels for Shinku. She may act serious at times, but there have been times I felt that she was funny and overall the most beautiful of the Rozen maidens. the costumes fit each of the personalities with different colors on everyone\'s costume, and the fact that each is very unique made my heart jump. I also loved the supporting characters too as they were very great at there personalities and expressions, plus their designs fit their personalities greatly.my overall enjoyment for this anime is splendid. The only problem I had with it was probably the design of barasusishou because the other designs of all the characters were amazing and detailed while her design felt like it did not belong, though I did enjoy this character repeating what everyone said, I did not like how she look because she stood out too much. I also as I said earlier did not really like the ending because I wanted to see what happened to the other characters in the story that got there Rozen Mystica\'s taken away, but it was an overall 9.5 out of 10 hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer.

Where the first season followed an agoraphobic boy as he learned to overcome his fears and demons in order to help those he loved, the second gives center stage to the Rozen maidens and their enigmatic Father. Where once Jun broke the Alice Game and repaired what was thought to be beyond repair, he is now swept to the side offering little more than moral support. This shift in narrative focus had potential. After all, Jun’s story arc was neatly completed by the end of the first season while the dolls were ripe for development. How long...have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun. As the show progresses, so too do the characters: Shinku struggles to deal with the consequences of the first season, the twin sisters find their intentions drifting apart, even the (mostly insufferable) comic relief character Hina-Ichigo concludes a surprisingly emotional character arc. Several new characters are introduced, such as the (completely insufferable) comic relief character Kanaria and the fabled seventh Rozen maiden, Barasuishou, as well as an inscrutable trickster rabbit and a mysterious dollmaker. Far and away, however, the breakout character is Suigintou, who develops into an equal parts sympathetic and badass anti-hero as she and some of the other maidens seek out mediums in order to attain an edge in the Game.The stakes continue to rise and a series of frustrating, yet justifiable decisions are made, investing one emotionally as the plot starts to heat up. Philosophies regarding the Game and the dolls’ involvement in it clash as characters arrive at different conclusions concerning what is right. I, for one, was rivetted to the screen by the later episodes as they steamed ahead towards their uncertain conclusion.And then episode 12 hits.I have never seen a more abortive climax than the one that waits in episode 12. The momentum the show has built collapses in just a few minutes as the ending is rewritten, live, before your very eyes! The writers make a bold statement about the futility of resisting fate and the insignificance of our main character in the grand scheme, and then change their minds 30 seconds later as one is left to weep over the corpse of the last several wasted hours. It isn’t a bitter, sweet, or bittersweet ending, it’s just junk.It is difficult to get further into this review without spoilers, so I will leave you with this: Rozen Maiden Traumend is a lot of buildup for very little payoff. There are other flaws, such as Jun’s consistent inaction in the face of major events and Kanaria’s entire existence, but these pale in comparison to the ending. If a bad ending spoils a show for you, don’t bother watching, or maybe just watch up to episode 11 and imagine your own ending under the influence of whatever drug/drugs you have on hand. have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun.

I chose to watch it, after seeing the ""desu"" memes all over the internet. The characters in this series are really enjoyable. You kind of get attached to them (which i hate when that happens because theres not that much episodes >.>) One thing i fell in love with was hina ichigos voice. (im a sucker for kawaii things like that.) I also really enjoyed how Jun went from being a shut in to falling in love with shinku. I really wish they would of ended the series better though. I hope they make a 3rd season. Withouth it ill...never know who became alice! never know who became alice!', ""STORY:I was very impressed with the story overall, I thought it was pretty unique. There were some great plot twist thrown in that took me by surprise, I was glad to see that things were not as obvious as they seemed. The story moved at a great pace and had no filler episodes.ANIMATION:The art is the same as the previous season although it seems a bit better this time around, the animation during the ending song was particularly beautiful.SOUND:I have to say I was extremely impressed with the voice acting, Mona Marshals performance as Jun was no less then outstanding, the same goes...for Mela Lee as Shinku and everyone else.The music is the same style used in season 1. It fits very well and there wasn't any song I disliked.CHARACTERS:I loved all the characters aside from the true  antagonist, they were all very interesting and I ended up rooting for most of them. I enjoyed Jun and Shinkus development the most. For me the characters are the main draw of the show.ENJOYMENT:Rozen Maiden is a truly unique show that should not be missed   I ended up enjoying the show even more then I'd hoped I would, none of the episodes were boring or unsatisfying.

I saw exactly where this one was headed early. The series reeked of a tear jerker from almost the very beginning. Right off the bat, the writers attempted to continue the character development concerning the dolls, with the intentions of establishing an emotional link with the viewer by over exploiting the dolls cute antics. This isn\'t a full blow against the series at all, because the driving force behind any work is the characters, and the viewer should feel for them. My only gripe is that because of this, the possible events were too spelled out in...light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas. The entire first half is a serious mixed bag, and can be looked at in a number of ways. At times, it can almost come off as complete filler, but there are things going on such as character and light plot development. The first seven episodes is drowned in its comedy which is hit most of the time; but those whom were used to the action scenes of the first season will be bored most of the time. Others whom enjoy the dolls very presence will be thoroughly entertained.My biggest problem with this season is that the writers try too hard to establish an emotional connection. They simply just didn\'t let the characters work and everything has to be pushed more. This will be the very first time I have an issue with character development. There was too much focus on the main dolls antics, and even their feelings to the point were Jun is almost left out completely. Adding to this, there were pacing issues as well that heavily effected the plot this time around. Even the two new characters whom were introduced weren\'t very well developed, and they felt more like cheap carbon copies.The drama in the series is also heavily over done but don\'t get me wrong here; when it\'s time for the drama to work, it does work. There are some good moments that will provide a few tears for those whom are attached to certain characters. However, at one time, a scene already achieved its desired and full effect, but would be heavily damaged due to its length. This worked against the series for me, and when someone else bit the dust it had that ""oh well"" feeling to me. The series eventually shifts to a darker side, but I think it was introduced a bit too late and simply didn\'t mesh right. Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas.

Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems', 'Rozen Maiden Traumend is the follow up to the original. Due to the lack of a proper interpretation of it\'s plot in the parent series of Rozen Maiden, for that reason I started watching this second season(also for more Suigintou) and since the first wasn\'t too bad, there\'s still hopes for development in this sequel.Traumend starts off from where the first series stopped; after the victorious battle with Suigintou, Shinku starts to feel the guilt of eliminating one of her sisters, all because of the Alice Game. In fact, Shinku simply made her into a ""piece of junk"". Is it wrong to feel sad for...an enemy you\'ve just defeated?Anyway, after completing Traumend, it\'s an improvement(but not massively) on the series, if you compare it to the original. Focusing more into the story, providing adequate explanation and reducing the number of trivial episodes. The story can be quite unpredictable sometimes; just when I thought THAT ""Father"" was the REAL ""Father"", turns that he isn\'t. There\'s also a considerable amount of drama with some fighting sequences and comedy going on. Final episode was more intense and better than in the original. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the results of the Alice Game.Why climb when you can fly? - the characters\' actions can be amusing. So, these dolls have the ability to fly(depends on the location or perhaps their mood). When I noticed that few of the them were ""climbing their way out of danger"", only for the enemy to catch up with them because she simply flew. You can sit there, relax and be amused by some their actions.Episodes 3, 5 and 7 are mostly just filler episodes, haphazardly placing keypoints of it\'s story that only lasts few minutes(sometimes mere seconds) and most of time, near the end. But hey, they\'re fairly watchable. It does focus on the story from time to time but at least 1/3 of the anime consist of very, slice-of-life-ish episodes. Like the original, pacing is slow as a snail.Traumend also introduces new characters and most of them play a major role in the story. First thing\'s first, Traumend has a new antagonist, the seventh and youngest Rozen Maiden doll, Barasuishou. Nevertheless, even with the new bunch of people, Suigintou remains as my number one character in the entire series and will always be.Comparing the original and Traumend and there\'s no enhancement on visuals.  After all, Traumend retains the whole same old visuals; colors are dull; not bright but Rozen Maiden dolls still look beautiful as ever, just like in the first. The visuals are sometimes inconsistent - characters faces differ from scene to scene. Just the same old, same old.ALI PROJECT performs the OP for this one too. Sadly, the majority of her songs including this is just not for me. Listened to the ED, and it was  actually quite good. But it gets old pretty quickly. BGM ranges from rock music(sadly the epic rock music is very rarely played) to same orchestral music pieces back in the original.To sum up, there\'s improvement in the overall storytelling, but even with that, I still wouldn\'t recommend it to everyone. After watching both seasons in the franchise, I must say that this is more recommended to the casual viewers. In any case, this is one series you have to see for yourself.

Less boring casual fillers (and empty space at all - first season was very, very emty, so that it could be cut to 8-9 episode without any harm to the plot). More reflection and philosophy (we even see them talk about God on the example of Master Rozen). Briefly, the story of Traumend is just smarter. Although, the illnesses of past times did not vanish utterly, and some episodes are still rather sleepy. And in plot there appear time after time illogical or rude lines that freak me out and spoil the enjoyment greatly.Art...- 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands. Rozen Maiden style remained stable and good.Sound - 9What is undoubtedly perfect in Rozen Maiden series is its breathtaking soundtrack. Piano and violon plays suit lolita-fashion so well that any action is exciting with this music playing. Opening is not great but alright, ending is dull, but at least you may skip it. What really doesn\'t let 10 to be set is the invariability. OST melodies are not to criticize but they are less, and after 20+ episodes of non-stop watching they don\'t please one\'s ears as much as in the beginning.Character - 9Rozen Maiden dolls are the collection. The collection of faces, haircuts, dresses, and psychological types. Of course, it should not be considered as serious ""panorama of social types"" or some that way. But this variety helps the comedy action a lot. Besides, some characters\' personalities are not as primitive as in season 1 (Suigintou, for example, turned in flesh-and-blood girl (if it can be said this way of talking doll) from Ominous-Villain-Demon-With-Non-Stopping-Nasty-Laugh), Shinku kicks Jun no more (annoyed me a lot) and, in general, became the most ample character in anime (she is principal char so that is natural, but I couldn\'t see it clearly before). All Maidens became more amiable and cute, I love them all after this season. And it\'s not because of their lowened agressiveness... they just got more alive.Enjoyment - 8,5Greatly spoiled by shortcomings of story, it is still high... I can make a conclusion in five words: I Would Rewatch This Anime.Overall - 8,5Rozen Maiden is original and outstanding yet using classical comedy-drama-system, and this is anime for everyone (no nudity, no violence, no profanity, purely platonic love storyline), so it is undoubtedly worth watching. It may please more or less depending on what to pay attention to most in general picture, but I think there are less people who watched RM and considered it a class-B shounen anime or so.I Would Rewatch This Anime.Would You Join Me? - 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands.

We have Jun not afraid to go outside anymore, and is actually trying to get into school again. There isn’t much development in the dolls but I guess that’s to be expected slightly. I have a small feeling that their artificial spirits are made to have a certain personality. I’m going to talk more about my theory later on in this review about that. We don’t really see much of the other human characters and so their personalities seem slightly the same. Jun’s sister...is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou. I have different feelings on both these new characters. Where as the fact I love Bara-Suishou as sort of a new antagonist for the dolls in light of what happen to Suigintou (Spoilers for the first series, sorry), I do not really like the addition of Kanaria. Kanaria felt like she was only there for comic relief. Her personality seemed to be similar to Suiseiseki in that she would get into trouble a lot and trying to sneak into the house. She also seemed slightly like Hinaichigo in how childish she is sometimes.With how deep the story gets, that doesn’t stop them from still doing the slice of life type of story arcs. They do end up making me annoyed slightly because there is so much story that can be given to the main idea of the Alice Game, the story behind the dolls and so on but what do we actually do get? Suiseiseki stealing Hinaichigo’s snack again, Shinku sitting reading or watching Detective Kun Kun, and Kanaria’s comedic attempts at going after the other girls. I can understand they are trying to give the characters more personality and show the personal growth of each of them but sometimes there is no growth at all. Then we are left with a kind of pointless run around with the story.Besides the slice of life stuff, the story does get a bit deep and sad. If I told you any more about that, then it would just be spoilers but there were times that tears did fall from my eyes.I said I was going to talk about my theory about the spirits. If you keep watching each of the dolls, it seems they have a bit of a collective soul. What I mean when I say this is that the personalities of each girl don’t always feel whole. Shinku is very proper; almost princess like where as Hinaichigo is very childish. Suiseiseki is a very mischievous girl who likes to tease others while her ‘twin’ sister Souseiseki is a bit more tomboyish. Suigintou is jealousy, and Kanaria is… I’m not fully sure but I think her personality is a bit of the sneaky planner. Sort of the personality of a girl who will sneak around someone to get what she wants or two get back at someone. If you look at all these dolls as personalities, it would seem that if all of them were put together, they would be the perfect being, the perfect ‘Alice.’ My theory of them and of the game they play is the idea that Rozen, their father, wanted to make the perfect daughter he named Alice and that the dolls must collect each part of Alice’s soul in order to become her. I do have another theory though, a back up theory if you want to take it as such… one that might be a very surprising turn of advents if this actually were to be true. My theory is that there is actually no real Alice Game. That the Alice Game was made up by someone to explain why they were ‘abandoned’ by their father. Their spirits though are pieces of their father’s daughter Alice who died at some point in time. In order to save her spirit, he placed parts of it into the dolls. It’s a large grasp at straws here but it’s another idea that I have from watching this series.The artwork is very beautiful when it wants to be and then it can also feel like they didn’t try. It’s much the same as the first series in both aspects. I still get the feeling that there are two different art styles from slice of life to occult in one show. The dolls are still rather detailed when not making funny faces or in a really comedic scene while the human characters feel a little lack luster. I am not sold on the face of Shirosaki, the salesperson at the doll shop in the show. I understand who he is from the moment I saw him (Not spoiling it though) but his face does not look like a humans. In fact, I really thought he might have been a doll himself with the way his eyes were and how his face was. It just looked way to flat and white to be real.The music is something I forgot to talk about in my review before that I will touch here. Both the first and this one have amazing music, most of it orchestra related. My favorite pieces are when the dolls are in some serious mode. That’s when the beautiful and yet haunting melody seems to come out that sounds slightly like a music box. I can’t help but get chills up my spine hearing that beautiful haunting melody. The English dub is basically the same so what I said before goes for this. I’m still not to keen on Hinaichigo’s or Suiseiseki’s voices much. Again, Hinaichigo’s high pitched childish whine is annoying and I really don’t understand why Suiseiseki’s voice has to be that high as well. They did grow on me more though since the first series which I guess works out. As for the newcomer, Kanaria is about as annoying as Hinaichigo’s voice. It’s high pitched and the way she talks reminds me of Naga the Serpent from Slayers. It’s that snarky little announcing voice that will say everything she is thinking no matter what. She hasn’t really had a chance to grow on me as much as the other characters though and maybe that’s why I can’t stand her right now.The story was actually really done and I liked how they dove more into the Alice Game and the story behind it but again they left more questions then answers. They had a very open ended ending that makes me wonder exactly what they mean by it. I still love the story and can’t wait to watch the rest of the seasons. is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou.

There really isn\'t a single character that I hated. Even the ""bad guy"" had my sympathy.This is a very good anime for anybody who appreciates dolls.

In the first season it was established that Jun had some special magical ability to ""bring back what was lost"" as demonstrated with the clown doll and with fixing Shinku\'s arm during her battle with Suigintou. The ending would have worked a lot better if this power was built upon / explained and then he used that power to restore all of the dolls after he found out they had been tricked - including Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki, instead of having a Deus Ex Machina moment with the...appearance of Rozen.And for some absolutely pointless reason, Rozen decides to leave Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki dead, again just to create cheap sadness with no logic. There is no reason Rozen or Jun should not be able to restore all of them.This ending is a huge disappointment because I really loved the unique concept of this show and the characters were very special, as I felt a real connection with all of them.

I like that certain obvious questions we had about the nature of the dolls was answered in a sensitive and fulfilling way (trying to be vague here to avoid spoilers!).What I don't like is the end. It was rushed and unfulfilling. It really felt like the writers had written themselves into a...corner and had to find a way to keep the action going until the end without leaving us on a sad note. I will chalk this up to trying to appeal to much to the action side of the anime (which was ALWAYS an afterthought). Unfortunately, the way in which they chose to do this robbed the most important characters of agency. And seeing these characters exercise that agency is what makes Rozen Maiden great in the first place (apropos that it is a franchise about ostensibly inanimate objects with animacy!).Nevertheless, the characters were treated with such respect and their personalities depicted well that I can forgive the very end of the story.

In my review of the first season I mentioned how the narrative is centered on the theme of ""trauma,"" but this does not seem to be the case for this sequel, which more deeply explores the conflicts of the story, although it does leaves many things open-ended, especially one of the major questions of the series, ""what does it mean to be Alice?"", so it is not conclusive for the series.One of the things...that is noticeable from the beginning is how the dolls and their personalities have more focus and are developed to make us more attach to them before they meet their tragic(quite tragic) ends. This is well done with all the dolls, but especially those who have benefited most from it are Shinzu, who needed motivation for her character, and Suigintou, who received such a good story that if nothing else, it\'s worth watching this anime just for her.In technical terms, this season has better animation and a better soundtrack. The piano in the background songs manages to convey the perfect tone for each scene, not to mention the opening played by Ali Project, which is always a pleasure to listen to.Not everything is perfect, though. The anime is very focused on the characters of the dolls, but the other characters are not explored much. The protagonist of the first season is sidelined, the protagonist\'s sister is super sidelined, and the new character, Laplace\'s Demon, is completely only used as a plot device.But in the end, this anime is a great continuation of the first one, with more comedy, action, and drama.

Trust me, you'll be lost.While Rozen Maiden was more about evolving characters, Traumend makes the jump right into action and keeps things moving at a fast pace throughout. There are still some fights between the dolls, however, it is more related to drama and action rather than...comedy.The new character Kanaria gives some laughs and eventually wears on the audience. But, Traumend is a bit darker than its predecessor and the dolls have to go through some hard times. There are even sacrifices, broken dolls and deaths.The darker tone suits well for character development and we see important changes in the main characters. The ending was somewhat surprising, but perhaps some would mention that it lacked something – turned out as a bit of a cop-out. Nevertheless, it is a satisfying end to the series.Traumend, overall a highly recommendable watch for fans of Rozen Maiden.

It was gearing up to be, in my opinion, better than the first season. However, the last episode left much to be desired. It's as if the writers did not know how to properly resolve all the conflicts, or perhaps they were confident in getting a third season and figured they would resolve them then. Sadly, this second season is the end for this version of RM. For this reason, I am left with many, many unanswered questions. For instance, why didn't Father tell...the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning? During the whole season, Father is made to look like a tyrant who wishes to see his creations fight to the death in order for his ideal doll to come to life. That is fine; I agree he is a bad man. But then at the end Father comes to the rescue?! And suddenly the fights are not necessary? Who was the Rabbit? What was his purpose and why does he get to possess Rosa Mysticas? I feel like this is cheating. And poor Jun had no character development. Seeing him be helpless and useless in the last episode did not sit well with me. I can understand that the first season was all about Jun, and this second one was going to be focused more on the various dolls. But in that case, it would've been better to leave Jun out of the finale. All in all, the season is great... except the last episode. It's not terribly bad, but it does ruin it if your expectations were higher, in accordance with what was set up in the previous episodes. So, I'd recommend, but be forewarned that the ending will probably not satisfy you. the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning?

Probably corresponds to some point in the Rozen Maiden manga, not sure which, though.Story: Tr&Atilde;&curren;umend picks up an unspecified amount of time after the first season.  All the dolls are still living at Jun's house, and he's definitely better than he was, but still not going to school (though there's good reason for it ' he's playing catch-up).  Shinku is having guilt-related nightmares, and after one of these,...she and Jun end up being drawn back into the mirror in his attic (why haven't they gotten rid of that yet?!) and meeting the seventh doll, whose appearance basically means that Father wants them to get on with the Alice Game, already.This season is everything I wanted last season to be, and more.  There's not so much filler as there was before ' and when there is, it actually advances the plot! --, and there's actually an overarching plot/urgency that wasn't there last season.  And moreover, we get to see the darker tones that were only hinted at in the last season.  There are so many more standout episodes, and the writers really show their talent by making you feel for characters you might not have necessarily liked last season.However, it's not perfect.  There is a character who turns into a bad running joke for most of the series.  And it looked like it was going to resolve things up till the last minute, but in the second half of the last episode, there's a nasty plot twist that leaves things open for a third season and several mysteries in its wake.Art: I don't know why, but the colors seem richer this season.  Maybe it's because there are so many scenes where they can use certain color schemes/tones.  Either way, it looks like it did last season, but better.Music: Again, about the same as last season.  The background music has its instantly recognizable songs (some that carry over from last season, too, which is really nice).  Didn't like the OP as much as last season's (ALI Project, again), but it grew on me.  Liked the ED instantly, though, as it's done by the same group who did Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament's OP, which is one of my favorites (kukui).Length: No real issues with length, this time.  Length is the same as last season's (twelve episodes), but it definitely goes by quicker.  When there was filler, as I said before, it ended up advancing the plot, so that was good, and there was an overarching plot/urgency to drive things forward.  However, the eleventh-hour plot twist in the episode, while it leaves things open for a second season, leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, because they were this close to resolving things, and they've only bought up more mysteries.Seiyuu: I recognize Enju's seiyuu from TmoHS (Koizumi) and Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ (Asuta), and Suigin Tou's seiyuu continues to rawq (Leandra from Nishi no Yoki Majo ' Astraea Testament and Lula from Red Garden!), but no other standout roles.  Decent seiyuu all around.Dub: N/A, has not been licensed as of yet.Overall: A definite improvement on the first season, but still has its flaws.

Although I do not want to give out alot of info this series is about a young boy named jun who is locked up in his room because of cracking under pressure on entrance exams, we do not find out about that until later on in the series, so as a result he is a...hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer. Then he gets possesion of Shinku, a wind up doll in search of Alice (the perfect doll) for his creator or ""Father"" to be happy, and for that to happen she has to defeat all the other dolls known as ""Rozen Maidens"" and take there life which is called a ""Rozen Mystica"" Now as the story goes on you see the characters unique personalities and powers. I believe that this series is a great recommendation to people who are interested in mystical and almost sci-fi\'sh anime. The story was overall good and had me wondering what would happen next although I thought that the ending was a little weak because it doesn\'t explain what happened to everyone else but gives an idea.The Art in this Anime is absolutely amazing. For the most part when I watched this I felt like there was a normal feel (as in the regular japanese home and life) with a little class into it. there is detail in every background although the characters do stick out more. There is one scene I absolutely adored the art and that was when one of the Rozen Maidens (Suigin Tou) goes to her world and it is snowing with Crystals all around. I really did love that the backgrounds fit the characters nature and personalilty for the fighting scenes and the comedy scenes.now the music was great, I loved the opening for this anime so much, it was creepy and yet energetic and was so well done. I love that the ending was great too because it was classy and modern at the same time , with a fast beat but still had that classy feel. I also loved the background music for this anime. the Orchestra was great for the serious scenes and the not so serious scenes. I really did enjoy the musicNow I know in this review I talk alot about the characters but I cannot help it they were great. The way they acted was amazing to the outfits they wore. As a person who thought I\'d never watch this anime due to the fact that I am personally afraid of dolls, felt like these characters were real with every step they took. Each personality was different in there own way and that is why I fell so in love with them. I especially fell head over heels for Shinku. She may act serious at times, but there have been times I felt that she was funny and overall the most beautiful of the Rozen maidens. the costumes fit each of the personalities with different colors on everyone\'s costume, and the fact that each is very unique made my heart jump. I also loved the supporting characters too as they were very great at there personalities and expressions, plus their designs fit their personalities greatly.my overall enjoyment for this anime is splendid. The only problem I had with it was probably the design of barasusishou because the other designs of all the characters were amazing and detailed while her design felt like it did not belong, though I did enjoy this character repeating what everyone said, I did not like how she look because she stood out too much. I also as I said earlier did not really like the ending because I wanted to see what happened to the other characters in the story that got there Rozen Mystica\'s taken away, but it was an overall 9.5 out of 10 hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer.

Where the first season followed an agoraphobic boy as he learned to overcome his fears and demons in order to help those he loved, the second gives center stage to the Rozen maidens and their enigmatic Father. Where once Jun broke the Alice Game and repaired what was thought to be beyond repair, he is now swept to the side offering little more than moral support. This shift in narrative focus had potential. After all, Jun’s story arc was neatly completed by the end of the first season while the dolls were ripe for development. How long...have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun. As the show progresses, so too do the characters: Shinku struggles to deal with the consequences of the first season, the twin sisters find their intentions drifting apart, even the (mostly insufferable) comic relief character Hina-Ichigo concludes a surprisingly emotional character arc. Several new characters are introduced, such as the (completely insufferable) comic relief character Kanaria and the fabled seventh Rozen maiden, Barasuishou, as well as an inscrutable trickster rabbit and a mysterious dollmaker. Far and away, however, the breakout character is Suigintou, who develops into an equal parts sympathetic and badass anti-hero as she and some of the other maidens seek out mediums in order to attain an edge in the Game.The stakes continue to rise and a series of frustrating, yet justifiable decisions are made, investing one emotionally as the plot starts to heat up. Philosophies regarding the Game and the dolls’ involvement in it clash as characters arrive at different conclusions concerning what is right. I, for one, was rivetted to the screen by the later episodes as they steamed ahead towards their uncertain conclusion.And then episode 12 hits.I have never seen a more abortive climax than the one that waits in episode 12. The momentum the show has built collapses in just a few minutes as the ending is rewritten, live, before your very eyes! The writers make a bold statement about the futility of resisting fate and the insignificance of our main character in the grand scheme, and then change their minds 30 seconds later as one is left to weep over the corpse of the last several wasted hours. It isn’t a bitter, sweet, or bittersweet ending, it’s just junk.It is difficult to get further into this review without spoilers, so I will leave you with this: Rozen Maiden Traumend is a lot of buildup for very little payoff. There are other flaws, such as Jun’s consistent inaction in the face of major events and Kanaria’s entire existence, but these pale in comparison to the ending. If a bad ending spoils a show for you, don’t bother watching, or maybe just watch up to episode 11 and imagine your own ending under the influence of whatever drug/drugs you have on hand. have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun.

I chose to watch it, after seeing the ""desu"" memes all over the internet. The characters in this series are really enjoyable. You kind of get attached to them (which i hate when that happens because theres not that much episodes >.>) One thing i fell in love with was hina ichigos voice. (im a sucker for kawaii things like that.) I also really enjoyed how Jun went from being a shut in to falling in love with shinku. I really wish they would of ended the series better though. I hope they make a 3rd season. Withouth it ill...never know who became alice! never know who became alice!', ""STORY:I was very impressed with the story overall, I thought it was pretty unique. There were some great plot twist thrown in that took me by surprise, I was glad to see that things were not as obvious as they seemed. The story moved at a great pace and had no filler episodes.ANIMATION:The art is the same as the previous season although it seems a bit better this time around, the animation during the ending song was particularly beautiful.SOUND:I have to say I was extremely impressed with the voice acting, Mona Marshals performance as Jun was no less then outstanding, the same goes...for Mela Lee as Shinku and everyone else.The music is the same style used in season 1. It fits very well and there wasn't any song I disliked.CHARACTERS:I loved all the characters aside from the true  antagonist, they were all very interesting and I ended up rooting for most of them. I enjoyed Jun and Shinkus development the most. For me the characters are the main draw of the show.ENJOYMENT:Rozen Maiden is a truly unique show that should not be missed   I ended up enjoying the show even more then I'd hoped I would, none of the episodes were boring or unsatisfying.

I saw exactly where this one was headed early. The series reeked of a tear jerker from almost the very beginning. Right off the bat, the writers attempted to continue the character development concerning the dolls, with the intentions of establishing an emotional link with the viewer by over exploiting the dolls cute antics. This isn\'t a full blow against the series at all, because the driving force behind any work is the characters, and the viewer should feel for them. My only gripe is that because of this, the possible events were too spelled out in...light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas. The entire first half is a serious mixed bag, and can be looked at in a number of ways. At times, it can almost come off as complete filler, but there are things going on such as character and light plot development. The first seven episodes is drowned in its comedy which is hit most of the time; but those whom were used to the action scenes of the first season will be bored most of the time. Others whom enjoy the dolls very presence will be thoroughly entertained.My biggest problem with this season is that the writers try too hard to establish an emotional connection. They simply just didn\'t let the characters work and everything has to be pushed more. This will be the very first time I have an issue with character development. There was too much focus on the main dolls antics, and even their feelings to the point were Jun is almost left out completely. Adding to this, there were pacing issues as well that heavily effected the plot this time around. Even the two new characters whom were introduced weren\'t very well developed, and they felt more like cheap carbon copies.The drama in the series is also heavily over done but don\'t get me wrong here; when it\'s time for the drama to work, it does work. There are some good moments that will provide a few tears for those whom are attached to certain characters. However, at one time, a scene already achieved its desired and full effect, but would be heavily damaged due to its length. This worked against the series for me, and when someone else bit the dust it had that ""oh well"" feeling to me. The series eventually shifts to a darker side, but I think it was introduced a bit too late and simply didn\'t mesh right. Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas.

Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems', 'Rozen Maiden Traumend is the follow up to the original. Due to the lack of a proper interpretation of it\'s plot in the parent series of Rozen Maiden, for that reason I started watching this second season(also for more Suigintou) and since the first wasn\'t too bad, there\'s still hopes for development in this sequel.Traumend starts off from where the first series stopped; after the victorious battle with Suigintou, Shinku starts to feel the guilt of eliminating one of her sisters, all because of the Alice Game. In fact, Shinku simply made her into a ""piece of junk"". Is it wrong to feel sad for...an enemy you\'ve just defeated?Anyway, after completing Traumend, it\'s an improvement(but not massively) on the series, if you compare it to the original. Focusing more into the story, providing adequate explanation and reducing the number of trivial episodes. The story can be quite unpredictable sometimes; just when I thought THAT ""Father"" was the REAL ""Father"", turns that he isn\'t. There\'s also a considerable amount of drama with some fighting sequences and comedy going on. Final episode was more intense and better than in the original. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the results of the Alice Game.Why climb when you can fly? - the characters\' actions can be amusing. So, these dolls have the ability to fly(depends on the location or perhaps their mood). When I noticed that few of the them were ""climbing their way out of danger"", only for the enemy to catch up with them because she simply flew. You can sit there, relax and be amused by some their actions.Episodes 3, 5 and 7 are mostly just filler episodes, haphazardly placing keypoints of it\'s story that only lasts few minutes(sometimes mere seconds) and most of time, near the end. But hey, they\'re fairly watchable. It does focus on the story from time to time but at least 1/3 of the anime consist of very, slice-of-life-ish episodes. Like the original, pacing is slow as a snail.Traumend also introduces new characters and most of them play a major role in the story. First thing\'s first, Traumend has a new antagonist, the seventh and youngest Rozen Maiden doll, Barasuishou. Nevertheless, even with the new bunch of people, Suigintou remains as my number one character in the entire series and will always be.Comparing the original and Traumend and there\'s no enhancement on visuals.  After all, Traumend retains the whole same old visuals; colors are dull; not bright but Rozen Maiden dolls still look beautiful as ever, just like in the first. The visuals are sometimes inconsistent - characters faces differ from scene to scene. Just the same old, same old.ALI PROJECT performs the OP for this one too. Sadly, the majority of her songs including this is just not for me. Listened to the ED, and it was  actually quite good. But it gets old pretty quickly. BGM ranges from rock music(sadly the epic rock music is very rarely played) to same orchestral music pieces back in the original.To sum up, there\'s improvement in the overall storytelling, but even with that, I still wouldn\'t recommend it to everyone. After watching both seasons in the franchise, I must say that this is more recommended to the casual viewers. In any case, this is one series you have to see for yourself.

Less boring casual fillers (and empty space at all - first season was very, very emty, so that it could be cut to 8-9 episode without any harm to the plot). More reflection and philosophy (we even see them talk about God on the example of Master Rozen). Briefly, the story of Traumend is just smarter. Although, the illnesses of past times did not vanish utterly, and some episodes are still rather sleepy. And in plot there appear time after time illogical or rude lines that freak me out and spoil the enjoyment greatly.Art...- 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands. Rozen Maiden style remained stable and good.Sound - 9What is undoubtedly perfect in Rozen Maiden series is its breathtaking soundtrack. Piano and violon plays suit lolita-fashion so well that any action is exciting with this music playing. Opening is not great but alright, ending is dull, but at least you may skip it. What really doesn\'t let 10 to be set is the invariability. OST melodies are not to criticize but they are less, and after 20+ episodes of non-stop watching they don\'t please one\'s ears as much as in the beginning.Character - 9Rozen Maiden dolls are the collection. The collection of faces, haircuts, dresses, and psychological types. Of course, it should not be considered as serious ""panorama of social types"" or some that way. But this variety helps the comedy action a lot. Besides, some characters\' personalities are not as primitive as in season 1 (Suigintou, for example, turned in flesh-and-blood girl (if it can be said this way of talking doll) from Ominous-Villain-Demon-With-Non-Stopping-Nasty-Laugh), Shinku kicks Jun no more (annoyed me a lot) and, in general, became the most ample character in anime (she is principal char so that is natural, but I couldn\'t see it clearly before). All Maidens became more amiable and cute, I love them all after this season. And it\'s not because of their lowened agressiveness... they just got more alive.Enjoyment - 8,5Greatly spoiled by shortcomings of story, it is still high... I can make a conclusion in five words: I Would Rewatch This Anime.Overall - 8,5Rozen Maiden is original and outstanding yet using classical comedy-drama-system, and this is anime for everyone (no nudity, no violence, no profanity, purely platonic love storyline), so it is undoubtedly worth watching. It may please more or less depending on what to pay attention to most in general picture, but I think there are less people who watched RM and considered it a class-B shounen anime or so.I Would Rewatch This Anime.Would You Join Me? - 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands.

We have Jun not afraid to go outside anymore, and is actually trying to get into school again. There isn’t much development in the dolls but I guess that’s to be expected slightly. I have a small feeling that their artificial spirits are made to have a certain personality. I’m going to talk more about my theory later on in this review about that. We don’t really see much of the other human characters and so their personalities seem slightly the same. Jun’s sister...is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou. I have different feelings on both these new characters. Where as the fact I love Bara-Suishou as sort of a new antagonist for the dolls in light of what happen to Suigintou (Spoilers for the first series, sorry), I do not really like the addition of Kanaria. Kanaria felt like she was only there for comic relief. Her personality seemed to be similar to Suiseiseki in that she would get into trouble a lot and trying to sneak into the house. She also seemed slightly like Hinaichigo in how childish she is sometimes.With how deep the story gets, that doesn’t stop them from still doing the slice of life type of story arcs. They do end up making me annoyed slightly because there is so much story that can be given to the main idea of the Alice Game, the story behind the dolls and so on but what do we actually do get? Suiseiseki stealing Hinaichigo’s snack again, Shinku sitting reading or watching Detective Kun Kun, and Kanaria’s comedic attempts at going after the other girls. I can understand they are trying to give the characters more personality and show the personal growth of each of them but sometimes there is no growth at all. Then we are left with a kind of pointless run around with the story.Besides the slice of life stuff, the story does get a bit deep and sad. If I told you any more about that, then it would just be spoilers but there were times that tears did fall from my eyes.I said I was going to talk about my theory about the spirits. If you keep watching each of the dolls, it seems they have a bit of a collective soul. What I mean when I say this is that the personalities of each girl don’t always feel whole. Shinku is very proper; almost princess like where as Hinaichigo is very childish. Suiseiseki is a very mischievous girl who likes to tease others while her ‘twin’ sister Souseiseki is a bit more tomboyish. Suigintou is jealousy, and Kanaria is… I’m not fully sure but I think her personality is a bit of the sneaky planner. Sort of the personality of a girl who will sneak around someone to get what she wants or two get back at someone. If you look at all these dolls as personalities, it would seem that if all of them were put together, they would be the perfect being, the perfect ‘Alice.’ My theory of them and of the game they play is the idea that Rozen, their father, wanted to make the perfect daughter he named Alice and that the dolls must collect each part of Alice’s soul in order to become her. I do have another theory though, a back up theory if you want to take it as such… one that might be a very surprising turn of advents if this actually were to be true. My theory is that there is actually no real Alice Game. That the Alice Game was made up by someone to explain why they were ‘abandoned’ by their father. Their spirits though are pieces of their father’s daughter Alice who died at some point in time. In order to save her spirit, he placed parts of it into the dolls. It’s a large grasp at straws here but it’s another idea that I have from watching this series.The artwork is very beautiful when it wants to be and then it can also feel like they didn’t try. It’s much the same as the first series in both aspects. I still get the feeling that there are two different art styles from slice of life to occult in one show. The dolls are still rather detailed when not making funny faces or in a really comedic scene while the human characters feel a little lack luster. I am not sold on the face of Shirosaki, the salesperson at the doll shop in the show. I understand who he is from the moment I saw him (Not spoiling it though) but his face does not look like a humans. In fact, I really thought he might have been a doll himself with the way his eyes were and how his face was. It just looked way to flat and white to be real.The music is something I forgot to talk about in my review before that I will touch here. Both the first and this one have amazing music, most of it orchestra related. My favorite pieces are when the dolls are in some serious mode. That’s when the beautiful and yet haunting melody seems to come out that sounds slightly like a music box. I can’t help but get chills up my spine hearing that beautiful haunting melody. The English dub is basically the same so what I said before goes for this. I’m still not to keen on Hinaichigo’s or Suiseiseki’s voices much. Again, Hinaichigo’s high pitched childish whine is annoying and I really don’t understand why Suiseiseki’s voice has to be that high as well. They did grow on me more though since the first series which I guess works out. As for the newcomer, Kanaria is about as annoying as Hinaichigo’s voice. It’s high pitched and the way she talks reminds me of Naga the Serpent from Slayers. It’s that snarky little announcing voice that will say everything she is thinking no matter what. She hasn’t really had a chance to grow on me as much as the other characters though and maybe that’s why I can’t stand her right now.The story was actually really done and I liked how they dove more into the Alice Game and the story behind it but again they left more questions then answers. They had a very open ended ending that makes me wonder exactly what they mean by it. I still love the story and can’t wait to watch the rest of the seasons. is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou.

There really isn\'t a single character that I hated. Even the ""bad guy"" had my sympathy.This is a very good anime for anybody who appreciates dolls.

In the first season it was established that Jun had some special magical ability to ""bring back what was lost"" as demonstrated with the clown doll and with fixing Shinku\'s arm during her battle with Suigintou. The ending would have worked a lot better if this power was built upon / explained and then he used that power to restore all of the dolls after he found out they had been tricked - including Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki, instead of having a Deus Ex Machina moment with the...appearance of Rozen.And for some absolutely pointless reason, Rozen decides to leave Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki dead, again just to create cheap sadness with no logic. There is no reason Rozen or Jun should not be able to restore all of them.This ending is a huge disappointment because I really loved the unique concept of this show and the characters were very special, as I felt a real connection with all of them.

I like that certain obvious questions we had about the nature of the dolls was answered in a sensitive and fulfilling way (trying to be vague here to avoid spoilers!).What I don't like is the end. It was rushed and unfulfilling. It really felt like the writers had written themselves into a...corner and had to find a way to keep the action going until the end without leaving us on a sad note. I will chalk this up to trying to appeal to much to the action side of the anime (which was ALWAYS an afterthought). Unfortunately, the way in which they chose to do this robbed the most important characters of agency. And seeing these characters exercise that agency is what makes Rozen Maiden great in the first place (apropos that it is a franchise about ostensibly inanimate objects with animacy!).Nevertheless, the characters were treated with such respect and their personalities depicted well that I can forgive the very end of the story.

In my review of the first season I mentioned how the narrative is centered on the theme of ""trauma,"" but this does not seem to be the case for this sequel, which more deeply explores the conflicts of the story, although it does leaves many things open-ended, especially one of the major questions of the series, ""what does it mean to be Alice?"", so it is not conclusive for the series.One of the things...that is noticeable from the beginning is how the dolls and their personalities have more focus and are developed to make us more attach to them before they meet their tragic(quite tragic) ends. This is well done with all the dolls, but especially those who have benefited most from it are Shinzu, who needed motivation for her character, and Suigintou, who received such a good story that if nothing else, it\'s worth watching this anime just for her.In technical terms, this season has better animation and a better soundtrack. The piano in the background songs manages to convey the perfect tone for each scene, not to mention the opening played by Ali Project, which is always a pleasure to listen to.Not everything is perfect, though. The anime is very focused on the characters of the dolls, but the other characters are not explored much. The protagonist of the first season is sidelined, the protagonist\'s sister is super sidelined, and the new character, Laplace\'s Demon, is completely only used as a plot device.But in the end, this anime is a great continuation of the first one, with more comedy, action, and drama.

Trust me, you'll be lost.While Rozen Maiden was more about evolving characters, Traumend makes the jump right into action and keeps things moving at a fast pace throughout. There are still some fights between the dolls, however, it is more related to drama and action rather than...comedy.The new character Kanaria gives some laughs and eventually wears on the audience. But, Traumend is a bit darker than its predecessor and the dolls have to go through some hard times. There are even sacrifices, broken dolls and deaths.The darker tone suits well for character development and we see important changes in the main characters. The ending was somewhat surprising, but perhaps some would mention that it lacked something – turned out as a bit of a cop-out. Nevertheless, it is a satisfying end to the series.Traumend, overall a highly recommendable watch for fans of Rozen Maiden.

It was gearing up to be, in my opinion, better than the first season. However, the last episode left much to be desired. It's as if the writers did not know how to properly resolve all the conflicts, or perhaps they were confident in getting a third season and figured they would resolve them then. Sadly, this second season is the end for this version of RM. For this reason, I am left with many, many unanswered questions. For instance, why didn't Father tell...the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning? During the whole season, Father is made to look like a tyrant who wishes to see his creations fight to the death in order for his ideal doll to come to life. That is fine; I agree he is a bad man. But then at the end Father comes to the rescue?! And suddenly the fights are not necessary? Who was the Rabbit? What was his purpose and why does he get to possess Rosa Mysticas? I feel like this is cheating. And poor Jun had no character development. Seeing him be helpless and useless in the last episode did not sit well with me. I can understand that the first season was all about Jun, and this second one was going to be focused more on the various dolls. But in that case, it would've been better to leave Jun out of the finale. All in all, the season is great... except the last episode. It's not terribly bad, but it does ruin it if your expectations were higher, in accordance with what was set up in the previous episodes. So, I'd recommend, but be forewarned that the ending will probably not satisfy you. the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning?

Probably corresponds to some point in the Rozen Maiden manga, not sure which, though.Story: Tr&Atilde;&curren;umend picks up an unspecified amount of time after the first season.  All the dolls are still living at Jun's house, and he's definitely better than he was, but still not going to school (though there's good reason for it ' he's playing catch-up).  Shinku is having guilt-related nightmares, and after one of these,...she and Jun end up being drawn back into the mirror in his attic (why haven't they gotten rid of that yet?!) and meeting the seventh doll, whose appearance basically means that Father wants them to get on with the Alice Game, already.This season is everything I wanted last season to be, and more.  There's not so much filler as there was before ' and when there is, it actually advances the plot! --, and there's actually an overarching plot/urgency that wasn't there last season.  And moreover, we get to see the darker tones that were only hinted at in the last season.  There are so many more standout episodes, and the writers really show their talent by making you feel for characters you might not have necessarily liked last season.However, it's not perfect.  There is a character who turns into a bad running joke for most of the series.  And it looked like it was going to resolve things up till the last minute, but in the second half of the last episode, there's a nasty plot twist that leaves things open for a third season and several mysteries in its wake.Art: I don't know why, but the colors seem richer this season.  Maybe it's because there are so many scenes where they can use certain color schemes/tones.  Either way, it looks like it did last season, but better.Music: Again, about the same as last season.  The background music has its instantly recognizable songs (some that carry over from last season, too, which is really nice).  Didn't like the OP as much as last season's (ALI Project, again), but it grew on me.  Liked the ED instantly, though, as it's done by the same group who did Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament's OP, which is one of my favorites (kukui).Length: No real issues with length, this time.  Length is the same as last season's (twelve episodes), but it definitely goes by quicker.  When there was filler, as I said before, it ended up advancing the plot, so that was good, and there was an overarching plot/urgency to drive things forward.  However, the eleventh-hour plot twist in the episode, while it leaves things open for a second season, leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, because they were this close to resolving things, and they've only bought up more mysteries.Seiyuu: I recognize Enju's seiyuu from TmoHS (Koizumi) and Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ (Asuta), and Suigin Tou's seiyuu continues to rawq (Leandra from Nishi no Yoki Majo ' Astraea Testament and Lula from Red Garden!), but no other standout roles.  Decent seiyuu all around.Dub: N/A, has not been licensed as of yet.Overall: A definite improvement on the first season, but still has its flaws.

Although I do not want to give out alot of info this series is about a young boy named jun who is locked up in his room because of cracking under pressure on entrance exams, we do not find out about that until later on in the series, so as a result he is a...hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer. Then he gets possesion of Shinku, a wind up doll in search of Alice (the perfect doll) for his creator or ""Father"" to be happy, and for that to happen she has to defeat all the other dolls known as ""Rozen Maidens"" and take there life which is called a ""Rozen Mystica"" Now as the story goes on you see the characters unique personalities and powers. I believe that this series is a great recommendation to people who are interested in mystical and almost sci-fi\'sh anime. The story was overall good and had me wondering what would happen next although I thought that the ending was a little weak because it doesn\'t explain what happened to everyone else but gives an idea.The Art in this Anime is absolutely amazing. For the most part when I watched this I felt like there was a normal feel (as in the regular japanese home and life) with a little class into it. there is detail in every background although the characters do stick out more. There is one scene I absolutely adored the art and that was when one of the Rozen Maidens (Suigin Tou) goes to her world and it is snowing with Crystals all around. I really did love that the backgrounds fit the characters nature and personalilty for the fighting scenes and the comedy scenes.now the music was great, I loved the opening for this anime so much, it was creepy and yet energetic and was so well done. I love that the ending was great too because it was classy and modern at the same time , with a fast beat but still had that classy feel. I also loved the background music for this anime. the Orchestra was great for the serious scenes and the not so serious scenes. I really did enjoy the musicNow I know in this review I talk alot about the characters but I cannot help it they were great. The way they acted was amazing to the outfits they wore. As a person who thought I\'d never watch this anime due to the fact that I am personally afraid of dolls, felt like these characters were real with every step they took. Each personality was different in there own way and that is why I fell so in love with them. I especially fell head over heels for Shinku. She may act serious at times, but there have been times I felt that she was funny and overall the most beautiful of the Rozen maidens. the costumes fit each of the personalities with different colors on everyone\'s costume, and the fact that each is very unique made my heart jump. I also loved the supporting characters too as they were very great at there personalities and expressions, plus their designs fit their personalities greatly.my overall enjoyment for this anime is splendid. The only problem I had with it was probably the design of barasusishou because the other designs of all the characters were amazing and detailed while her design felt like it did not belong, though I did enjoy this character repeating what everyone said, I did not like how she look because she stood out too much. I also as I said earlier did not really like the ending because I wanted to see what happened to the other characters in the story that got there Rozen Mystica\'s taken away, but it was an overall 9.5 out of 10 hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer.

Where the first season followed an agoraphobic boy as he learned to overcome his fears and demons in order to help those he loved, the second gives center stage to the Rozen maidens and their enigmatic Father. Where once Jun broke the Alice Game and repaired what was thought to be beyond repair, he is now swept to the side offering little more than moral support. This shift in narrative focus had potential. After all, Jun’s story arc was neatly completed by the end of the first season while the dolls were ripe for development. How long...have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun. As the show progresses, so too do the characters: Shinku struggles to deal with the consequences of the first season, the twin sisters find their intentions drifting apart, even the (mostly insufferable) comic relief character Hina-Ichigo concludes a surprisingly emotional character arc. Several new characters are introduced, such as the (completely insufferable) comic relief character Kanaria and the fabled seventh Rozen maiden, Barasuishou, as well as an inscrutable trickster rabbit and a mysterious dollmaker. Far and away, however, the breakout character is Suigintou, who develops into an equal parts sympathetic and badass anti-hero as she and some of the other maidens seek out mediums in order to attain an edge in the Game.The stakes continue to rise and a series of frustrating, yet justifiable decisions are made, investing one emotionally as the plot starts to heat up. Philosophies regarding the Game and the dolls’ involvement in it clash as characters arrive at different conclusions concerning what is right. I, for one, was rivetted to the screen by the later episodes as they steamed ahead towards their uncertain conclusion.And then episode 12 hits.I have never seen a more abortive climax than the one that waits in episode 12. The momentum the show has built collapses in just a few minutes as the ending is rewritten, live, before your very eyes! The writers make a bold statement about the futility of resisting fate and the insignificance of our main character in the grand scheme, and then change their minds 30 seconds later as one is left to weep over the corpse of the last several wasted hours. It isn’t a bitter, sweet, or bittersweet ending, it’s just junk.It is difficult to get further into this review without spoilers, so I will leave you with this: Rozen Maiden Traumend is a lot of buildup for very little payoff. There are other flaws, such as Jun’s consistent inaction in the face of major events and Kanaria’s entire existence, but these pale in comparison to the ending. If a bad ending spoils a show for you, don’t bother watching, or maybe just watch up to episode 11 and imagine your own ending under the influence of whatever drug/drugs you have on hand. have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun.

I chose to watch it, after seeing the ""desu"" memes all over the internet. The characters in this series are really enjoyable. You kind of get attached to them (which i hate when that happens because theres not that much episodes >.>) One thing i fell in love with was hina ichigos voice. (im a sucker for kawaii things like that.) I also really enjoyed how Jun went from being a shut in to falling in love with shinku. I really wish they would of ended the series better though. I hope they make a 3rd season. Withouth it ill...never know who became alice! never know who became alice!', ""STORY:I was very impressed with the story overall, I thought it was pretty unique. There were some great plot twist thrown in that took me by surprise, I was glad to see that things were not as obvious as they seemed. The story moved at a great pace and had no filler episodes.ANIMATION:The art is the same as the previous season although it seems a bit better this time around, the animation during the ending song was particularly beautiful.SOUND:I have to say I was extremely impressed with the voice acting, Mona Marshals performance as Jun was no less then outstanding, the same goes...for Mela Lee as Shinku and everyone else.The music is the same style used in season 1. It fits very well and there wasn't any song I disliked.CHARACTERS:I loved all the characters aside from the true  antagonist, they were all very interesting and I ended up rooting for most of them. I enjoyed Jun and Shinkus development the most. For me the characters are the main draw of the show.ENJOYMENT:Rozen Maiden is a truly unique show that should not be missed   I ended up enjoying the show even more then I'd hoped I would, none of the episodes were boring or unsatisfying.

I saw exactly where this one was headed early. The series reeked of a tear jerker from almost the very beginning. Right off the bat, the writers attempted to continue the character development concerning the dolls, with the intentions of establishing an emotional link with the viewer by over exploiting the dolls cute antics. This isn\'t a full blow against the series at all, because the driving force behind any work is the characters, and the viewer should feel for them. My only gripe is that because of this, the possible events were too spelled out in...light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas. The entire first half is a serious mixed bag, and can be looked at in a number of ways. At times, it can almost come off as complete filler, but there are things going on such as character and light plot development. The first seven episodes is drowned in its comedy which is hit most of the time; but those whom were used to the action scenes of the first season will be bored most of the time. Others whom enjoy the dolls very presence will be thoroughly entertained.My biggest problem with this season is that the writers try too hard to establish an emotional connection. They simply just didn\'t let the characters work and everything has to be pushed more. This will be the very first time I have an issue with character development. There was too much focus on the main dolls antics, and even their feelings to the point were Jun is almost left out completely. Adding to this, there were pacing issues as well that heavily effected the plot this time around. Even the two new characters whom were introduced weren\'t very well developed, and they felt more like cheap carbon copies.The drama in the series is also heavily over done but don\'t get me wrong here; when it\'s time for the drama to work, it does work. There are some good moments that will provide a few tears for those whom are attached to certain characters. However, at one time, a scene already achieved its desired and full effect, but would be heavily damaged due to its length. This worked against the series for me, and when someone else bit the dust it had that ""oh well"" feeling to me. The series eventually shifts to a darker side, but I think it was introduced a bit too late and simply didn\'t mesh right. Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas.

Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems', 'Rozen Maiden Traumend is the follow up to the original. Due to the lack of a proper interpretation of it\'s plot in the parent series of Rozen Maiden, for that reason I started watching this second season(also for more Suigintou) and since the first wasn\'t too bad, there\'s still hopes for development in this sequel.Traumend starts off from where the first series stopped; after the victorious battle with Suigintou, Shinku starts to feel the guilt of eliminating one of her sisters, all because of the Alice Game. In fact, Shinku simply made her into a ""piece of junk"". Is it wrong to feel sad for...an enemy you\'ve just defeated?Anyway, after completing Traumend, it\'s an improvement(but not massively) on the series, if you compare it to the original. Focusing more into the story, providing adequate explanation and reducing the number of trivial episodes. The story can be quite unpredictable sometimes; just when I thought THAT ""Father"" was the REAL ""Father"", turns that he isn\'t. There\'s also a considerable amount of drama with some fighting sequences and comedy going on. Final episode was more intense and better than in the original. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the results of the Alice Game.Why climb when you can fly? - the characters\' actions can be amusing. So, these dolls have the ability to fly(depends on the location or perhaps their mood). When I noticed that few of the them were ""climbing their way out of danger"", only for the enemy to catch up with them because she simply flew. You can sit there, relax and be amused by some their actions.Episodes 3, 5 and 7 are mostly just filler episodes, haphazardly placing keypoints of it\'s story that only lasts few minutes(sometimes mere seconds) and most of time, near the end. But hey, they\'re fairly watchable. It does focus on the story from time to time but at least 1/3 of the anime consist of very, slice-of-life-ish episodes. Like the original, pacing is slow as a snail.Traumend also introduces new characters and most of them play a major role in the story. First thing\'s first, Traumend has a new antagonist, the seventh and youngest Rozen Maiden doll, Barasuishou. Nevertheless, even with the new bunch of people, Suigintou remains as my number one character in the entire series and will always be.Comparing the original and Traumend and there\'s no enhancement on visuals.  After all, Traumend retains the whole same old visuals; colors are dull; not bright but Rozen Maiden dolls still look beautiful as ever, just like in the first. The visuals are sometimes inconsistent - characters faces differ from scene to scene. Just the same old, same old.ALI PROJECT performs the OP for this one too. Sadly, the majority of her songs including this is just not for me. Listened to the ED, and it was  actually quite good. But it gets old pretty quickly. BGM ranges from rock music(sadly the epic rock music is very rarely played) to same orchestral music pieces back in the original.To sum up, there\'s improvement in the overall storytelling, but even with that, I still wouldn\'t recommend it to everyone. After watching both seasons in the franchise, I must say that this is more recommended to the casual viewers. In any case, this is one series you have to see for yourself.

Less boring casual fillers (and empty space at all - first season was very, very emty, so that it could be cut to 8-9 episode without any harm to the plot). More reflection and philosophy (we even see them talk about God on the example of Master Rozen). Briefly, the story of Traumend is just smarter. Although, the illnesses of past times did not vanish utterly, and some episodes are still rather sleepy. And in plot there appear time after time illogical or rude lines that freak me out and spoil the enjoyment greatly.Art...- 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands. Rozen Maiden style remained stable and good.Sound - 9What is undoubtedly perfect in Rozen Maiden series is its breathtaking soundtrack. Piano and violon plays suit lolita-fashion so well that any action is exciting with this music playing. Opening is not great but alright, ending is dull, but at least you may skip it. What really doesn\'t let 10 to be set is the invariability. OST melodies are not to criticize but they are less, and after 20+ episodes of non-stop watching they don\'t please one\'s ears as much as in the beginning.Character - 9Rozen Maiden dolls are the collection. The collection of faces, haircuts, dresses, and psychological types. Of course, it should not be considered as serious ""panorama of social types"" or some that way. But this variety helps the comedy action a lot. Besides, some characters\' personalities are not as primitive as in season 1 (Suigintou, for example, turned in flesh-and-blood girl (if it can be said this way of talking doll) from Ominous-Villain-Demon-With-Non-Stopping-Nasty-Laugh), Shinku kicks Jun no more (annoyed me a lot) and, in general, became the most ample character in anime (she is principal char so that is natural, but I couldn\'t see it clearly before). All Maidens became more amiable and cute, I love them all after this season. And it\'s not because of their lowened agressiveness... they just got more alive.Enjoyment - 8,5Greatly spoiled by shortcomings of story, it is still high... I can make a conclusion in five words: I Would Rewatch This Anime.Overall - 8,5Rozen Maiden is original and outstanding yet using classical comedy-drama-system, and this is anime for everyone (no nudity, no violence, no profanity, purely platonic love storyline), so it is undoubtedly worth watching. It may please more or less depending on what to pay attention to most in general picture, but I think there are less people who watched RM and considered it a class-B shounen anime or so.I Would Rewatch This Anime.Would You Join Me? - 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands.

We have Jun not afraid to go outside anymore, and is actually trying to get into school again. There isn’t much development in the dolls but I guess that’s to be expected slightly. I have a small feeling that their artificial spirits are made to have a certain personality. I’m going to talk more about my theory later on in this review about that. We don’t really see much of the other human characters and so their personalities seem slightly the same. Jun’s sister...is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou. I have different feelings on both these new characters. Where as the fact I love Bara-Suishou as sort of a new antagonist for the dolls in light of what happen to Suigintou (Spoilers for the first series, sorry), I do not really like the addition of Kanaria. Kanaria felt like she was only there for comic relief. Her personality seemed to be similar to Suiseiseki in that she would get into trouble a lot and trying to sneak into the house. She also seemed slightly like Hinaichigo in how childish she is sometimes.With how deep the story gets, that doesn’t stop them from still doing the slice of life type of story arcs. They do end up making me annoyed slightly because there is so much story that can be given to the main idea of the Alice Game, the story behind the dolls and so on but what do we actually do get? Suiseiseki stealing Hinaichigo’s snack again, Shinku sitting reading or watching Detective Kun Kun, and Kanaria’s comedic attempts at going after the other girls. I can understand they are trying to give the characters more personality and show the personal growth of each of them but sometimes there is no growth at all. Then we are left with a kind of pointless run around with the story.Besides the slice of life stuff, the story does get a bit deep and sad. If I told you any more about that, then it would just be spoilers but there were times that tears did fall from my eyes.I said I was going to talk about my theory about the spirits. If you keep watching each of the dolls, it seems they have a bit of a collective soul. What I mean when I say this is that the personalities of each girl don’t always feel whole. Shinku is very proper; almost princess like where as Hinaichigo is very childish. Suiseiseki is a very mischievous girl who likes to tease others while her ‘twin’ sister Souseiseki is a bit more tomboyish. Suigintou is jealousy, and Kanaria is… I’m not fully sure but I think her personality is a bit of the sneaky planner. Sort of the personality of a girl who will sneak around someone to get what she wants or two get back at someone. If you look at all these dolls as personalities, it would seem that if all of them were put together, they would be the perfect being, the perfect ‘Alice.’ My theory of them and of the game they play is the idea that Rozen, their father, wanted to make the perfect daughter he named Alice and that the dolls must collect each part of Alice’s soul in order to become her. I do have another theory though, a back up theory if you want to take it as such… one that might be a very surprising turn of advents if this actually were to be true. My theory is that there is actually no real Alice Game. That the Alice Game was made up by someone to explain why they were ‘abandoned’ by their father. Their spirits though are pieces of their father’s daughter Alice who died at some point in time. In order to save her spirit, he placed parts of it into the dolls. It’s a large grasp at straws here but it’s another idea that I have from watching this series.The artwork is very beautiful when it wants to be and then it can also feel like they didn’t try. It’s much the same as the first series in both aspects. I still get the feeling that there are two different art styles from slice of life to occult in one show. The dolls are still rather detailed when not making funny faces or in a really comedic scene while the human characters feel a little lack luster. I am not sold on the face of Shirosaki, the salesperson at the doll shop in the show. I understand who he is from the moment I saw him (Not spoiling it though) but his face does not look like a humans. In fact, I really thought he might have been a doll himself with the way his eyes were and how his face was. It just looked way to flat and white to be real.The music is something I forgot to talk about in my review before that I will touch here. Both the first and this one have amazing music, most of it orchestra related. My favorite pieces are when the dolls are in some serious mode. That’s when the beautiful and yet haunting melody seems to come out that sounds slightly like a music box. I can’t help but get chills up my spine hearing that beautiful haunting melody. The English dub is basically the same so what I said before goes for this. I’m still not to keen on Hinaichigo’s or Suiseiseki’s voices much. Again, Hinaichigo’s high pitched childish whine is annoying and I really don’t understand why Suiseiseki’s voice has to be that high as well. They did grow on me more though since the first series which I guess works out. As for the newcomer, Kanaria is about as annoying as Hinaichigo’s voice. It’s high pitched and the way she talks reminds me of Naga the Serpent from Slayers. It’s that snarky little announcing voice that will say everything she is thinking no matter what. She hasn’t really had a chance to grow on me as much as the other characters though and maybe that’s why I can’t stand her right now.The story was actually really done and I liked how they dove more into the Alice Game and the story behind it but again they left more questions then answers. They had a very open ended ending that makes me wonder exactly what they mean by it. I still love the story and can’t wait to watch the rest of the seasons. is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou.

There really isn\'t a single character that I hated. Even the ""bad guy"" had my sympathy.This is a very good anime for anybody who appreciates dolls.

In the first season it was established that Jun had some special magical ability to ""bring back what was lost"" as demonstrated with the clown doll and with fixing Shinku\'s arm during her battle with Suigintou. The ending would have worked a lot better if this power was built upon / explained and then he used that power to restore all of the dolls after he found out they had been tricked - including Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki, instead of having a Deus Ex Machina moment with the...appearance of Rozen.And for some absolutely pointless reason, Rozen decides to leave Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki dead, again just to create cheap sadness with no logic. There is no reason Rozen or Jun should not be able to restore all of them.This ending is a huge disappointment because I really loved the unique concept of this show and the characters were very special, as I felt a real connection with all of them.

I like that certain obvious questions we had about the nature of the dolls was answered in a sensitive and fulfilling way (trying to be vague here to avoid spoilers!).What I don't like is the end. It was rushed and unfulfilling. It really felt like the writers had written themselves into a...corner and had to find a way to keep the action going until the end without leaving us on a sad note. I will chalk this up to trying to appeal to much to the action side of the anime (which was ALWAYS an afterthought). Unfortunately, the way in which they chose to do this robbed the most important characters of agency. And seeing these characters exercise that agency is what makes Rozen Maiden great in the first place (apropos that it is a franchise about ostensibly inanimate objects with animacy!).Nevertheless, the characters were treated with such respect and their personalities depicted well that I can forgive the very end of the story.

In my review of the first season I mentioned how the narrative is centered on the theme of ""trauma,"" but this does not seem to be the case for this sequel, which more deeply explores the conflicts of the story, although it does leaves many things open-ended, especially one of the major questions of the series, ""what does it mean to be Alice?"", so it is not conclusive for the series.One of the things...that is noticeable from the beginning is how the dolls and their personalities have more focus and are developed to make us more attach to them before they meet their tragic(quite tragic) ends. This is well done with all the dolls, but especially those who have benefited most from it are Shinzu, who needed motivation for her character, and Suigintou, who received such a good story that if nothing else, it\'s worth watching this anime just for her.In technical terms, this season has better animation and a better soundtrack. The piano in the background songs manages to convey the perfect tone for each scene, not to mention the opening played by Ali Project, which is always a pleasure to listen to.Not everything is perfect, though. The anime is very focused on the characters of the dolls, but the other characters are not explored much. The protagonist of the first season is sidelined, the protagonist\'s sister is super sidelined, and the new character, Laplace\'s Demon, is completely only used as a plot device.But in the end, this anime is a great continuation of the first one, with more comedy, action, and drama.

Trust me, you'll be lost.While Rozen Maiden was more about evolving characters, Traumend makes the jump right into action and keeps things moving at a fast pace throughout. There are still some fights between the dolls, however, it is more related to drama and action rather than...comedy.The new character Kanaria gives some laughs and eventually wears on the audience. But, Traumend is a bit darker than its predecessor and the dolls have to go through some hard times. There are even sacrifices, broken dolls and deaths.The darker tone suits well for character development and we see important changes in the main characters. The ending was somewhat surprising, but perhaps some would mention that it lacked something – turned out as a bit of a cop-out. Nevertheless, it is a satisfying end to the series.Traumend, overall a highly recommendable watch for fans of Rozen Maiden.

It was gearing up to be, in my opinion, better than the first season. However, the last episode left much to be desired. It's as if the writers did not know how to properly resolve all the conflicts, or perhaps they were confident in getting a third season and figured they would resolve them then. Sadly, this second season is the end for this version of RM. For this reason, I am left with many, many unanswered questions. For instance, why didn't Father tell...the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning? During the whole season, Father is made to look like a tyrant who wishes to see his creations fight to the death in order for his ideal doll to come to life. That is fine; I agree he is a bad man. But then at the end Father comes to the rescue?! And suddenly the fights are not necessary? Who was the Rabbit? What was his purpose and why does he get to possess Rosa Mysticas? I feel like this is cheating. And poor Jun had no character development. Seeing him be helpless and useless in the last episode did not sit well with me. I can understand that the first season was all about Jun, and this second one was going to be focused more on the various dolls. But in that case, it would've been better to leave Jun out of the finale. All in all, the season is great... except the last episode. It's not terribly bad, but it does ruin it if your expectations were higher, in accordance with what was set up in the previous episodes. So, I'd recommend, but be forewarned that the ending will probably not satisfy you. the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning?

Probably corresponds to some point in the Rozen Maiden manga, not sure which, though.Story: Tr&Atilde;&curren;umend picks up an unspecified amount of time after the first season.  All the dolls are still living at Jun's house, and he's definitely better than he was, but still not going to school (though there's good reason for it ' he's playing catch-up).  Shinku is having guilt-related nightmares, and after one of these,...she and Jun end up being drawn back into the mirror in his attic (why haven't they gotten rid of that yet?!) and meeting the seventh doll, whose appearance basically means that Father wants them to get on with the Alice Game, already.This season is everything I wanted last season to be, and more.  There's not so much filler as there was before ' and when there is, it actually advances the plot! --, and there's actually an overarching plot/urgency that wasn't there last season.  And moreover, we get to see the darker tones that were only hinted at in the last season.  There are so many more standout episodes, and the writers really show their talent by making you feel for characters you might not have necessarily liked last season.However, it's not perfect.  There is a character who turns into a bad running joke for most of the series.  And it looked like it was going to resolve things up till the last minute, but in the second half of the last episode, there's a nasty plot twist that leaves things open for a third season and several mysteries in its wake.Art: I don't know why, but the colors seem richer this season.  Maybe it's because there are so many scenes where they can use certain color schemes/tones.  Either way, it looks like it did last season, but better.Music: Again, about the same as last season.  The background music has its instantly recognizable songs (some that carry over from last season, too, which is really nice).  Didn't like the OP as much as last season's (ALI Project, again), but it grew on me.  Liked the ED instantly, though, as it's done by the same group who did Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament's OP, which is one of my favorites (kukui).Length: No real issues with length, this time.  Length is the same as last season's (twelve episodes), but it definitely goes by quicker.  When there was filler, as I said before, it ended up advancing the plot, so that was good, and there was an overarching plot/urgency to drive things forward.  However, the eleventh-hour plot twist in the episode, while it leaves things open for a second season, leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, because they were this close to resolving things, and they've only bought up more mysteries.Seiyuu: I recognize Enju's seiyuu from TmoHS (Koizumi) and Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ (Asuta), and Suigin Tou's seiyuu continues to rawq (Leandra from Nishi no Yoki Majo ' Astraea Testament and Lula from Red Garden!), but no other standout roles.  Decent seiyuu all around.Dub: N/A, has not been licensed as of yet.Overall: A definite improvement on the first season, but still has its flaws.

Although I do not want to give out alot of info this series is about a young boy named jun who is locked up in his room because of cracking under pressure on entrance exams, we do not find out about that until later on in the series, so as a result he is a...hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer. Then he gets possesion of Shinku, a wind up doll in search of Alice (the perfect doll) for his creator or ""Father"" to be happy, and for that to happen she has to defeat all the other dolls known as ""Rozen Maidens"" and take there life which is called a ""Rozen Mystica"" Now as the story goes on you see the characters unique personalities and powers. I believe that this series is a great recommendation to people who are interested in mystical and almost sci-fi\'sh anime. The story was overall good and had me wondering what would happen next although I thought that the ending was a little weak because it doesn\'t explain what happened to everyone else but gives an idea.The Art in this Anime is absolutely amazing. For the most part when I watched this I felt like there was a normal feel (as in the regular japanese home and life) with a little class into it. there is detail in every background although the characters do stick out more. There is one scene I absolutely adored the art and that was when one of the Rozen Maidens (Suigin Tou) goes to her world and it is snowing with Crystals all around. I really did love that the backgrounds fit the characters nature and personalilty for the fighting scenes and the comedy scenes.now the music was great, I loved the opening for this anime so much, it was creepy and yet energetic and was so well done. I love that the ending was great too because it was classy and modern at the same time , with a fast beat but still had that classy feel. I also loved the background music for this anime. the Orchestra was great for the serious scenes and the not so serious scenes. I really did enjoy the musicNow I know in this review I talk alot about the characters but I cannot help it they were great. The way they acted was amazing to the outfits they wore. As a person who thought I\'d never watch this anime due to the fact that I am personally afraid of dolls, felt like these characters were real with every step they took. Each personality was different in there own way and that is why I fell so in love with them. I especially fell head over heels for Shinku. She may act serious at times, but there have been times I felt that she was funny and overall the most beautiful of the Rozen maidens. the costumes fit each of the personalities with different colors on everyone\'s costume, and the fact that each is very unique made my heart jump. I also loved the supporting characters too as they were very great at there personalities and expressions, plus their designs fit their personalities greatly.my overall enjoyment for this anime is splendid. The only problem I had with it was probably the design of barasusishou because the other designs of all the characters were amazing and detailed while her design felt like it did not belong, though I did enjoy this character repeating what everyone said, I did not like how she look because she stood out too much. I also as I said earlier did not really like the ending because I wanted to see what happened to the other characters in the story that got there Rozen Mystica\'s taken away, but it was an overall 9.5 out of 10 hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer.

Where the first season followed an agoraphobic boy as he learned to overcome his fears and demons in order to help those he loved, the second gives center stage to the Rozen maidens and their enigmatic Father. Where once Jun broke the Alice Game and repaired what was thought to be beyond repair, he is now swept to the side offering little more than moral support. This shift in narrative focus had potential. After all, Jun’s story arc was neatly completed by the end of the first season while the dolls were ripe for development. How long...have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun. As the show progresses, so too do the characters: Shinku struggles to deal with the consequences of the first season, the twin sisters find their intentions drifting apart, even the (mostly insufferable) comic relief character Hina-Ichigo concludes a surprisingly emotional character arc. Several new characters are introduced, such as the (completely insufferable) comic relief character Kanaria and the fabled seventh Rozen maiden, Barasuishou, as well as an inscrutable trickster rabbit and a mysterious dollmaker. Far and away, however, the breakout character is Suigintou, who develops into an equal parts sympathetic and badass anti-hero as she and some of the other maidens seek out mediums in order to attain an edge in the Game.The stakes continue to rise and a series of frustrating, yet justifiable decisions are made, investing one emotionally as the plot starts to heat up. Philosophies regarding the Game and the dolls’ involvement in it clash as characters arrive at different conclusions concerning what is right. I, for one, was rivetted to the screen by the later episodes as they steamed ahead towards their uncertain conclusion.And then episode 12 hits.I have never seen a more abortive climax than the one that waits in episode 12. The momentum the show has built collapses in just a few minutes as the ending is rewritten, live, before your very eyes! The writers make a bold statement about the futility of resisting fate and the insignificance of our main character in the grand scheme, and then change their minds 30 seconds later as one is left to weep over the corpse of the last several wasted hours. It isn’t a bitter, sweet, or bittersweet ending, it’s just junk.It is difficult to get further into this review without spoilers, so I will leave you with this: Rozen Maiden Traumend is a lot of buildup for very little payoff. There are other flaws, such as Jun’s consistent inaction in the face of major events and Kanaria’s entire existence, but these pale in comparison to the ending. If a bad ending spoils a show for you, don’t bother watching, or maybe just watch up to episode 11 and imagine your own ending under the influence of whatever drug/drugs you have on hand. have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun.

I chose to watch it, after seeing the ""desu"" memes all over the internet. The characters in this series are really enjoyable. You kind of get attached to them (which i hate when that happens because theres not that much episodes >.>) One thing i fell in love with was hina ichigos voice. (im a sucker for kawaii things like that.) I also really enjoyed how Jun went from being a shut in to falling in love with shinku. I really wish they would of ended the series better though. I hope they make a 3rd season. Withouth it ill...never know who became alice! never know who became alice!', ""STORY:I was very impressed with the story overall, I thought it was pretty unique. There were some great plot twist thrown in that took me by surprise, I was glad to see that things were not as obvious as they seemed. The story moved at a great pace and had no filler episodes.ANIMATION:The art is the same as the previous season although it seems a bit better this time around, the animation during the ending song was particularly beautiful.SOUND:I have to say I was extremely impressed with the voice acting, Mona Marshals performance as Jun was no less then outstanding, the same goes...for Mela Lee as Shinku and everyone else.The music is the same style used in season 1. It fits very well and there wasn't any song I disliked.CHARACTERS:I loved all the characters aside from the true  antagonist, they were all very interesting and I ended up rooting for most of them. I enjoyed Jun and Shinkus development the most. For me the characters are the main draw of the show.ENJOYMENT:Rozen Maiden is a truly unique show that should not be missed   I ended up enjoying the show even more then I'd hoped I would, none of the episodes were boring or unsatisfying.

I saw exactly where this one was headed early. The series reeked of a tear jerker from almost the very beginning. Right off the bat, the writers attempted to continue the character development concerning the dolls, with the intentions of establishing an emotional link with the viewer by over exploiting the dolls cute antics. This isn\'t a full blow against the series at all, because the driving force behind any work is the characters, and the viewer should feel for them. My only gripe is that because of this, the possible events were too spelled out in...light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas. The entire first half is a serious mixed bag, and can be looked at in a number of ways. At times, it can almost come off as complete filler, but there are things going on such as character and light plot development. The first seven episodes is drowned in its comedy which is hit most of the time; but those whom were used to the action scenes of the first season will be bored most of the time. Others whom enjoy the dolls very presence will be thoroughly entertained.My biggest problem with this season is that the writers try too hard to establish an emotional connection. They simply just didn\'t let the characters work and everything has to be pushed more. This will be the very first time I have an issue with character development. There was too much focus on the main dolls antics, and even their feelings to the point were Jun is almost left out completely. Adding to this, there were pacing issues as well that heavily effected the plot this time around. Even the two new characters whom were introduced weren\'t very well developed, and they felt more like cheap carbon copies.The drama in the series is also heavily over done but don\'t get me wrong here; when it\'s time for the drama to work, it does work. There are some good moments that will provide a few tears for those whom are attached to certain characters. However, at one time, a scene already achieved its desired and full effect, but would be heavily damaged due to its length. This worked against the series for me, and when someone else bit the dust it had that ""oh well"" feeling to me. The series eventually shifts to a darker side, but I think it was introduced a bit too late and simply didn\'t mesh right. Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas.

Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems', 'Rozen Maiden Traumend is the follow up to the original. Due to the lack of a proper interpretation of it\'s plot in the parent series of Rozen Maiden, for that reason I started watching this second season(also for more Suigintou) and since the first wasn\'t too bad, there\'s still hopes for development in this sequel.Traumend starts off from where the first series stopped; after the victorious battle with Suigintou, Shinku starts to feel the guilt of eliminating one of her sisters, all because of the Alice Game. In fact, Shinku simply made her into a ""piece of junk"". Is it wrong to feel sad for...an enemy you\'ve just defeated?Anyway, after completing Traumend, it\'s an improvement(but not massively) on the series, if you compare it to the original. Focusing more into the story, providing adequate explanation and reducing the number of trivial episodes. The story can be quite unpredictable sometimes; just when I thought THAT ""Father"" was the REAL ""Father"", turns that he isn\'t. There\'s also a considerable amount of drama with some fighting sequences and comedy going on. Final episode was more intense and better than in the original. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the results of the Alice Game.Why climb when you can fly? - the characters\' actions can be amusing. So, these dolls have the ability to fly(depends on the location or perhaps their mood). When I noticed that few of the them were ""climbing their way out of danger"", only for the enemy to catch up with them because she simply flew. You can sit there, relax and be amused by some their actions.Episodes 3, 5 and 7 are mostly just filler episodes, haphazardly placing keypoints of it\'s story that only lasts few minutes(sometimes mere seconds) and most of time, near the end. But hey, they\'re fairly watchable. It does focus on the story from time to time but at least 1/3 of the anime consist of very, slice-of-life-ish episodes. Like the original, pacing is slow as a snail.Traumend also introduces new characters and most of them play a major role in the story. First thing\'s first, Traumend has a new antagonist, the seventh and youngest Rozen Maiden doll, Barasuishou. Nevertheless, even with the new bunch of people, Suigintou remains as my number one character in the entire series and will always be.Comparing the original and Traumend and there\'s no enhancement on visuals.  After all, Traumend retains the whole same old visuals; colors are dull; not bright but Rozen Maiden dolls still look beautiful as ever, just like in the first. The visuals are sometimes inconsistent - characters faces differ from scene to scene. Just the same old, same old.ALI PROJECT performs the OP for this one too. Sadly, the majority of her songs including this is just not for me. Listened to the ED, and it was  actually quite good. But it gets old pretty quickly. BGM ranges from rock music(sadly the epic rock music is very rarely played) to same orchestral music pieces back in the original.To sum up, there\'s improvement in the overall storytelling, but even with that, I still wouldn\'t recommend it to everyone. After watching both seasons in the franchise, I must say that this is more recommended to the casual viewers. In any case, this is one series you have to see for yourself.

Less boring casual fillers (and empty space at all - first season was very, very emty, so that it could be cut to 8-9 episode without any harm to the plot). More reflection and philosophy (we even see them talk about God on the example of Master Rozen). Briefly, the story of Traumend is just smarter. Although, the illnesses of past times did not vanish utterly, and some episodes are still rather sleepy. And in plot there appear time after time illogical or rude lines that freak me out and spoil the enjoyment greatly.Art...- 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands. Rozen Maiden style remained stable and good.Sound - 9What is undoubtedly perfect in Rozen Maiden series is its breathtaking soundtrack. Piano and violon plays suit lolita-fashion so well that any action is exciting with this music playing. Opening is not great but alright, ending is dull, but at least you may skip it. What really doesn\'t let 10 to be set is the invariability. OST melodies are not to criticize but they are less, and after 20+ episodes of non-stop watching they don\'t please one\'s ears as much as in the beginning.Character - 9Rozen Maiden dolls are the collection. The collection of faces, haircuts, dresses, and psychological types. Of course, it should not be considered as serious ""panorama of social types"" or some that way. But this variety helps the comedy action a lot. Besides, some characters\' personalities are not as primitive as in season 1 (Suigintou, for example, turned in flesh-and-blood girl (if it can be said this way of talking doll) from Ominous-Villain-Demon-With-Non-Stopping-Nasty-Laugh), Shinku kicks Jun no more (annoyed me a lot) and, in general, became the most ample character in anime (she is principal char so that is natural, but I couldn\'t see it clearly before). All Maidens became more amiable and cute, I love them all after this season. And it\'s not because of their lowened agressiveness... they just got more alive.Enjoyment - 8,5Greatly spoiled by shortcomings of story, it is still high... I can make a conclusion in five words: I Would Rewatch This Anime.Overall - 8,5Rozen Maiden is original and outstanding yet using classical comedy-drama-system, and this is anime for everyone (no nudity, no violence, no profanity, purely platonic love storyline), so it is undoubtedly worth watching. It may please more or less depending on what to pay attention to most in general picture, but I think there are less people who watched RM and considered it a class-B shounen anime or so.I Would Rewatch This Anime.Would You Join Me? - 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands.

We have Jun not afraid to go outside anymore, and is actually trying to get into school again. There isn’t much development in the dolls but I guess that’s to be expected slightly. I have a small feeling that their artificial spirits are made to have a certain personality. I’m going to talk more about my theory later on in this review about that. We don’t really see much of the other human characters and so their personalities seem slightly the same. Jun’s sister...is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou. I have different feelings on both these new characters. Where as the fact I love Bara-Suishou as sort of a new antagonist for the dolls in light of what happen to Suigintou (Spoilers for the first series, sorry), I do not really like the addition of Kanaria. Kanaria felt like she was only there for comic relief. Her personality seemed to be similar to Suiseiseki in that she would get into trouble a lot and trying to sneak into the house. She also seemed slightly like Hinaichigo in how childish she is sometimes.With how deep the story gets, that doesn’t stop them from still doing the slice of life type of story arcs. They do end up making me annoyed slightly because there is so much story that can be given to the main idea of the Alice Game, the story behind the dolls and so on but what do we actually do get? Suiseiseki stealing Hinaichigo’s snack again, Shinku sitting reading or watching Detective Kun Kun, and Kanaria’s comedic attempts at going after the other girls. I can understand they are trying to give the characters more personality and show the personal growth of each of them but sometimes there is no growth at all. Then we are left with a kind of pointless run around with the story.Besides the slice of life stuff, the story does get a bit deep and sad. If I told you any more about that, then it would just be spoilers but there were times that tears did fall from my eyes.I said I was going to talk about my theory about the spirits. If you keep watching each of the dolls, it seems they have a bit of a collective soul. What I mean when I say this is that the personalities of each girl don’t always feel whole. Shinku is very proper; almost princess like where as Hinaichigo is very childish. Suiseiseki is a very mischievous girl who likes to tease others while her ‘twin’ sister Souseiseki is a bit more tomboyish. Suigintou is jealousy, and Kanaria is… I’m not fully sure but I think her personality is a bit of the sneaky planner. Sort of the personality of a girl who will sneak around someone to get what she wants or two get back at someone. If you look at all these dolls as personalities, it would seem that if all of them were put together, they would be the perfect being, the perfect ‘Alice.’ My theory of them and of the game they play is the idea that Rozen, their father, wanted to make the perfect daughter he named Alice and that the dolls must collect each part of Alice’s soul in order to become her. I do have another theory though, a back up theory if you want to take it as such… one that might be a very surprising turn of advents if this actually were to be true. My theory is that there is actually no real Alice Game. That the Alice Game was made up by someone to explain why they were ‘abandoned’ by their father. Their spirits though are pieces of their father’s daughter Alice who died at some point in time. In order to save her spirit, he placed parts of it into the dolls. It’s a large grasp at straws here but it’s another idea that I have from watching this series.The artwork is very beautiful when it wants to be and then it can also feel like they didn’t try. It’s much the same as the first series in both aspects. I still get the feeling that there are two different art styles from slice of life to occult in one show. The dolls are still rather detailed when not making funny faces or in a really comedic scene while the human characters feel a little lack luster. I am not sold on the face of Shirosaki, the salesperson at the doll shop in the show. I understand who he is from the moment I saw him (Not spoiling it though) but his face does not look like a humans. In fact, I really thought he might have been a doll himself with the way his eyes were and how his face was. It just looked way to flat and white to be real.The music is something I forgot to talk about in my review before that I will touch here. Both the first and this one have amazing music, most of it orchestra related. My favorite pieces are when the dolls are in some serious mode. That’s when the beautiful and yet haunting melody seems to come out that sounds slightly like a music box. I can’t help but get chills up my spine hearing that beautiful haunting melody. The English dub is basically the same so what I said before goes for this. I’m still not to keen on Hinaichigo’s or Suiseiseki’s voices much. Again, Hinaichigo’s high pitched childish whine is annoying and I really don’t understand why Suiseiseki’s voice has to be that high as well. They did grow on me more though since the first series which I guess works out. As for the newcomer, Kanaria is about as annoying as Hinaichigo’s voice. It’s high pitched and the way she talks reminds me of Naga the Serpent from Slayers. It’s that snarky little announcing voice that will say everything she is thinking no matter what. She hasn’t really had a chance to grow on me as much as the other characters though and maybe that’s why I can’t stand her right now.The story was actually really done and I liked how they dove more into the Alice Game and the story behind it but again they left more questions then answers. They had a very open ended ending that makes me wonder exactly what they mean by it. I still love the story and can’t wait to watch the rest of the seasons. is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou.

There really isn\'t a single character that I hated. Even the ""bad guy"" had my sympathy.This is a very good anime for anybody who appreciates dolls.

In the first season it was established that Jun had some special magical ability to ""bring back what was lost"" as demonstrated with the clown doll and with fixing Shinku\'s arm during her battle with Suigintou. The ending would have worked a lot better if this power was built upon / explained and then he used that power to restore all of the dolls after he found out they had been tricked - including Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki, instead of having a Deus Ex Machina moment with the...appearance of Rozen.And for some absolutely pointless reason, Rozen decides to leave Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki dead, again just to create cheap sadness with no logic. There is no reason Rozen or Jun should not be able to restore all of them.This ending is a huge disappointment because I really loved the unique concept of this show and the characters were very special, as I felt a real connection with all of them.

I like that certain obvious questions we had about the nature of the dolls was answered in a sensitive and fulfilling way (trying to be vague here to avoid spoilers!).What I don't like is the end. It was rushed and unfulfilling. It really felt like the writers had written themselves into a...corner and had to find a way to keep the action going until the end without leaving us on a sad note. I will chalk this up to trying to appeal to much to the action side of the anime (which was ALWAYS an afterthought). Unfortunately, the way in which they chose to do this robbed the most important characters of agency. And seeing these characters exercise that agency is what makes Rozen Maiden great in the first place (apropos that it is a franchise about ostensibly inanimate objects with animacy!).Nevertheless, the characters were treated with such respect and their personalities depicted well that I can forgive the very end of the story.

In my review of the first season I mentioned how the narrative is centered on the theme of ""trauma,"" but this does not seem to be the case for this sequel, which more deeply explores the conflicts of the story, although it does leaves many things open-ended, especially one of the major questions of the series, ""what does it mean to be Alice?"", so it is not conclusive for the series.One of the things...that is noticeable from the beginning is how the dolls and their personalities have more focus and are developed to make us more attach to them before they meet their tragic(quite tragic) ends. This is well done with all the dolls, but especially those who have benefited most from it are Shinzu, who needed motivation for her character, and Suigintou, who received such a good story that if nothing else, it\'s worth watching this anime just for her.In technical terms, this season has better animation and a better soundtrack. The piano in the background songs manages to convey the perfect tone for each scene, not to mention the opening played by Ali Project, which is always a pleasure to listen to.Not everything is perfect, though. The anime is very focused on the characters of the dolls, but the other characters are not explored much. The protagonist of the first season is sidelined, the protagonist\'s sister is super sidelined, and the new character, Laplace\'s Demon, is completely only used as a plot device.But in the end, this anime is a great continuation of the first one, with more comedy, action, and drama.

Trust me, you'll be lost.While Rozen Maiden was more about evolving characters, Traumend makes the jump right into action and keeps things moving at a fast pace throughout. There are still some fights between the dolls, however, it is more related to drama and action rather than...comedy.The new character Kanaria gives some laughs and eventually wears on the audience. But, Traumend is a bit darker than its predecessor and the dolls have to go through some hard times. There are even sacrifices, broken dolls and deaths.The darker tone suits well for character development and we see important changes in the main characters. The ending was somewhat surprising, but perhaps some would mention that it lacked something – turned out as a bit of a cop-out. Nevertheless, it is a satisfying end to the series.Traumend, overall a highly recommendable watch for fans of Rozen Maiden.

It was gearing up to be, in my opinion, better than the first season. However, the last episode left much to be desired. It's as if the writers did not know how to properly resolve all the conflicts, or perhaps they were confident in getting a third season and figured they would resolve them then. Sadly, this second season is the end for this version of RM. For this reason, I am left with many, many unanswered questions. For instance, why didn't Father tell...the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning? During the whole season, Father is made to look like a tyrant who wishes to see his creations fight to the death in order for his ideal doll to come to life. That is fine; I agree he is a bad man. But then at the end Father comes to the rescue?! And suddenly the fights are not necessary? Who was the Rabbit? What was his purpose and why does he get to possess Rosa Mysticas? I feel like this is cheating. And poor Jun had no character development. Seeing him be helpless and useless in the last episode did not sit well with me. I can understand that the first season was all about Jun, and this second one was going to be focused more on the various dolls. But in that case, it would've been better to leave Jun out of the finale. All in all, the season is great... except the last episode. It's not terribly bad, but it does ruin it if your expectations were higher, in accordance with what was set up in the previous episodes. So, I'd recommend, but be forewarned that the ending will probably not satisfy you. the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning?

Probably corresponds to some point in the Rozen Maiden manga, not sure which, though.Story: Tr&Atilde;&curren;umend picks up an unspecified amount of time after the first season.  All the dolls are still living at Jun's house, and he's definitely better than he was, but still not going to school (though there's good reason for it ' he's playing catch-up).  Shinku is having guilt-related nightmares, and after one of these,...she and Jun end up being drawn back into the mirror in his attic (why haven't they gotten rid of that yet?!) and meeting the seventh doll, whose appearance basically means that Father wants them to get on with the Alice Game, already.This season is everything I wanted last season to be, and more.  There's not so much filler as there was before ' and when there is, it actually advances the plot! --, and there's actually an overarching plot/urgency that wasn't there last season.  And moreover, we get to see the darker tones that were only hinted at in the last season.  There are so many more standout episodes, and the writers really show their talent by making you feel for characters you might not have necessarily liked last season.However, it's not perfect.  There is a character who turns into a bad running joke for most of the series.  And it looked like it was going to resolve things up till the last minute, but in the second half of the last episode, there's a nasty plot twist that leaves things open for a third season and several mysteries in its wake.Art: I don't know why, but the colors seem richer this season.  Maybe it's because there are so many scenes where they can use certain color schemes/tones.  Either way, it looks like it did last season, but better.Music: Again, about the same as last season.  The background music has its instantly recognizable songs (some that carry over from last season, too, which is really nice).  Didn't like the OP as much as last season's (ALI Project, again), but it grew on me.  Liked the ED instantly, though, as it's done by the same group who did Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament's OP, which is one of my favorites (kukui).Length: No real issues with length, this time.  Length is the same as last season's (twelve episodes), but it definitely goes by quicker.  When there was filler, as I said before, it ended up advancing the plot, so that was good, and there was an overarching plot/urgency to drive things forward.  However, the eleventh-hour plot twist in the episode, while it leaves things open for a second season, leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, because they were this close to resolving things, and they've only bought up more mysteries.Seiyuu: I recognize Enju's seiyuu from TmoHS (Koizumi) and Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ (Asuta), and Suigin Tou's seiyuu continues to rawq (Leandra from Nishi no Yoki Majo ' Astraea Testament and Lula from Red Garden!), but no other standout roles.  Decent seiyuu all around.Dub: N/A, has not been licensed as of yet.Overall: A definite improvement on the first season, but still has its flaws.

Although I do not want to give out alot of info this series is about a young boy named jun who is locked up in his room because of cracking under pressure on entrance exams, we do not find out about that until later on in the series, so as a result he is a...hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer. Then he gets possesion of Shinku, a wind up doll in search of Alice (the perfect doll) for his creator or ""Father"" to be happy, and for that to happen she has to defeat all the other dolls known as ""Rozen Maidens"" and take there life which is called a ""Rozen Mystica"" Now as the story goes on you see the characters unique personalities and powers. I believe that this series is a great recommendation to people who are interested in mystical and almost sci-fi\'sh anime. The story was overall good and had me wondering what would happen next although I thought that the ending was a little weak because it doesn\'t explain what happened to everyone else but gives an idea.The Art in this Anime is absolutely amazing. For the most part when I watched this I felt like there was a normal feel (as in the regular japanese home and life) with a little class into it. there is detail in every background although the characters do stick out more. There is one scene I absolutely adored the art and that was when one of the Rozen Maidens (Suigin Tou) goes to her world and it is snowing with Crystals all around. I really did love that the backgrounds fit the characters nature and personalilty for the fighting scenes and the comedy scenes.now the music was great, I loved the opening for this anime so much, it was creepy and yet energetic and was so well done. I love that the ending was great too because it was classy and modern at the same time , with a fast beat but still had that classy feel. I also loved the background music for this anime. the Orchestra was great for the serious scenes and the not so serious scenes. I really did enjoy the musicNow I know in this review I talk alot about the characters but I cannot help it they were great. The way they acted was amazing to the outfits they wore. As a person who thought I\'d never watch this anime due to the fact that I am personally afraid of dolls, felt like these characters were real with every step they took. Each personality was different in there own way and that is why I fell so in love with them. I especially fell head over heels for Shinku. She may act serious at times, but there have been times I felt that she was funny and overall the most beautiful of the Rozen maidens. the costumes fit each of the personalities with different colors on everyone\'s costume, and the fact that each is very unique made my heart jump. I also loved the supporting characters too as they were very great at there personalities and expressions, plus their designs fit their personalities greatly.my overall enjoyment for this anime is splendid. The only problem I had with it was probably the design of barasusishou because the other designs of all the characters were amazing and detailed while her design felt like it did not belong, though I did enjoy this character repeating what everyone said, I did not like how she look because she stood out too much. I also as I said earlier did not really like the ending because I wanted to see what happened to the other characters in the story that got there Rozen Mystica\'s taken away, but it was an overall 9.5 out of 10 hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer.

Where the first season followed an agoraphobic boy as he learned to overcome his fears and demons in order to help those he loved, the second gives center stage to the Rozen maidens and their enigmatic Father. Where once Jun broke the Alice Game and repaired what was thought to be beyond repair, he is now swept to the side offering little more than moral support. This shift in narrative focus had potential. After all, Jun’s story arc was neatly completed by the end of the first season while the dolls were ripe for development. How long...have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun. As the show progresses, so too do the characters: Shinku struggles to deal with the consequences of the first season, the twin sisters find their intentions drifting apart, even the (mostly insufferable) comic relief character Hina-Ichigo concludes a surprisingly emotional character arc. Several new characters are introduced, such as the (completely insufferable) comic relief character Kanaria and the fabled seventh Rozen maiden, Barasuishou, as well as an inscrutable trickster rabbit and a mysterious dollmaker. Far and away, however, the breakout character is Suigintou, who develops into an equal parts sympathetic and badass anti-hero as she and some of the other maidens seek out mediums in order to attain an edge in the Game.The stakes continue to rise and a series of frustrating, yet justifiable decisions are made, investing one emotionally as the plot starts to heat up. Philosophies regarding the Game and the dolls’ involvement in it clash as characters arrive at different conclusions concerning what is right. I, for one, was rivetted to the screen by the later episodes as they steamed ahead towards their uncertain conclusion.And then episode 12 hits.I have never seen a more abortive climax than the one that waits in episode 12. The momentum the show has built collapses in just a few minutes as the ending is rewritten, live, before your very eyes! The writers make a bold statement about the futility of resisting fate and the insignificance of our main character in the grand scheme, and then change their minds 30 seconds later as one is left to weep over the corpse of the last several wasted hours. It isn’t a bitter, sweet, or bittersweet ending, it’s just junk.It is difficult to get further into this review without spoilers, so I will leave you with this: Rozen Maiden Traumend is a lot of buildup for very little payoff. There are other flaws, such as Jun’s consistent inaction in the face of major events and Kanaria’s entire existence, but these pale in comparison to the ending. If a bad ending spoils a show for you, don’t bother watching, or maybe just watch up to episode 11 and imagine your own ending under the influence of whatever drug/drugs you have on hand. have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun.

I chose to watch it, after seeing the ""desu"" memes all over the internet. The characters in this series are really enjoyable. You kind of get attached to them (which i hate when that happens because theres not that much episodes >.>) One thing i fell in love with was hina ichigos voice. (im a sucker for kawaii things like that.) I also really enjoyed how Jun went from being a shut in to falling in love with shinku. I really wish they would of ended the series better though. I hope they make a 3rd season. Withouth it ill...never know who became alice! never know who became alice!', ""STORY:I was very impressed with the story overall, I thought it was pretty unique. There were some great plot twist thrown in that took me by surprise, I was glad to see that things were not as obvious as they seemed. The story moved at a great pace and had no filler episodes.ANIMATION:The art is the same as the previous season although it seems a bit better this time around, the animation during the ending song was particularly beautiful.SOUND:I have to say I was extremely impressed with the voice acting, Mona Marshals performance as Jun was no less then outstanding, the same goes...for Mela Lee as Shinku and everyone else.The music is the same style used in season 1. It fits very well and there wasn't any song I disliked.CHARACTERS:I loved all the characters aside from the true  antagonist, they were all very interesting and I ended up rooting for most of them. I enjoyed Jun and Shinkus development the most. For me the characters are the main draw of the show.ENJOYMENT:Rozen Maiden is a truly unique show that should not be missed   I ended up enjoying the show even more then I'd hoped I would, none of the episodes were boring or unsatisfying.

I saw exactly where this one was headed early. The series reeked of a tear jerker from almost the very beginning. Right off the bat, the writers attempted to continue the character development concerning the dolls, with the intentions of establishing an emotional link with the viewer by over exploiting the dolls cute antics. This isn\'t a full blow against the series at all, because the driving force behind any work is the characters, and the viewer should feel for them. My only gripe is that because of this, the possible events were too spelled out in...light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas. The entire first half is a serious mixed bag, and can be looked at in a number of ways. At times, it can almost come off as complete filler, but there are things going on such as character and light plot development. The first seven episodes is drowned in its comedy which is hit most of the time; but those whom were used to the action scenes of the first season will be bored most of the time. Others whom enjoy the dolls very presence will be thoroughly entertained.My biggest problem with this season is that the writers try too hard to establish an emotional connection. They simply just didn\'t let the characters work and everything has to be pushed more. This will be the very first time I have an issue with character development. There was too much focus on the main dolls antics, and even their feelings to the point were Jun is almost left out completely. Adding to this, there were pacing issues as well that heavily effected the plot this time around. Even the two new characters whom were introduced weren\'t very well developed, and they felt more like cheap carbon copies.The drama in the series is also heavily over done but don\'t get me wrong here; when it\'s time for the drama to work, it does work. There are some good moments that will provide a few tears for those whom are attached to certain characters. However, at one time, a scene already achieved its desired and full effect, but would be heavily damaged due to its length. This worked against the series for me, and when someone else bit the dust it had that ""oh well"" feeling to me. The series eventually shifts to a darker side, but I think it was introduced a bit too late and simply didn\'t mesh right. Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas.

Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems', 'Rozen Maiden Traumend is the follow up to the original. Due to the lack of a proper interpretation of it\'s plot in the parent series of Rozen Maiden, for that reason I started watching this second season(also for more Suigintou) and since the first wasn\'t too bad, there\'s still hopes for development in this sequel.Traumend starts off from where the first series stopped; after the victorious battle with Suigintou, Shinku starts to feel the guilt of eliminating one of her sisters, all because of the Alice Game. In fact, Shinku simply made her into a ""piece of junk"". Is it wrong to feel sad for...an enemy you\'ve just defeated?Anyway, after completing Traumend, it\'s an improvement(but not massively) on the series, if you compare it to the original. Focusing more into the story, providing adequate explanation and reducing the number of trivial episodes. The story can be quite unpredictable sometimes; just when I thought THAT ""Father"" was the REAL ""Father"", turns that he isn\'t. There\'s also a considerable amount of drama with some fighting sequences and comedy going on. Final episode was more intense and better than in the original. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the results of the Alice Game.Why climb when you can fly? - the characters\' actions can be amusing. So, these dolls have the ability to fly(depends on the location or perhaps their mood). When I noticed that few of the them were ""climbing their way out of danger"", only for the enemy to catch up with them because she simply flew. You can sit there, relax and be amused by some their actions.Episodes 3, 5 and 7 are mostly just filler episodes, haphazardly placing keypoints of it\'s story that only lasts few minutes(sometimes mere seconds) and most of time, near the end. But hey, they\'re fairly watchable. It does focus on the story from time to time but at least 1/3 of the anime consist of very, slice-of-life-ish episodes. Like the original, pacing is slow as a snail.Traumend also introduces new characters and most of them play a major role in the story. First thing\'s first, Traumend has a new antagonist, the seventh and youngest Rozen Maiden doll, Barasuishou. Nevertheless, even with the new bunch of people, Suigintou remains as my number one character in the entire series and will always be.Comparing the original and Traumend and there\'s no enhancement on visuals.  After all, Traumend retains the whole same old visuals; colors are dull; not bright but Rozen Maiden dolls still look beautiful as ever, just like in the first. The visuals are sometimes inconsistent - characters faces differ from scene to scene. Just the same old, same old.ALI PROJECT performs the OP for this one too. Sadly, the majority of her songs including this is just not for me. Listened to the ED, and it was  actually quite good. But it gets old pretty quickly. BGM ranges from rock music(sadly the epic rock music is very rarely played) to same orchestral music pieces back in the original.To sum up, there\'s improvement in the overall storytelling, but even with that, I still wouldn\'t recommend it to everyone. After watching both seasons in the franchise, I must say that this is more recommended to the casual viewers. In any case, this is one series you have to see for yourself.

Less boring casual fillers (and empty space at all - first season was very, very emty, so that it could be cut to 8-9 episode without any harm to the plot). More reflection and philosophy (we even see them talk about God on the example of Master Rozen). Briefly, the story of Traumend is just smarter. Although, the illnesses of past times did not vanish utterly, and some episodes are still rather sleepy. And in plot there appear time after time illogical or rude lines that freak me out and spoil the enjoyment greatly.Art...- 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands. Rozen Maiden style remained stable and good.Sound - 9What is undoubtedly perfect in Rozen Maiden series is its breathtaking soundtrack. Piano and violon plays suit lolita-fashion so well that any action is exciting with this music playing. Opening is not great but alright, ending is dull, but at least you may skip it. What really doesn\'t let 10 to be set is the invariability. OST melodies are not to criticize but they are less, and after 20+ episodes of non-stop watching they don\'t please one\'s ears as much as in the beginning.Character - 9Rozen Maiden dolls are the collection. The collection of faces, haircuts, dresses, and psychological types. Of course, it should not be considered as serious ""panorama of social types"" or some that way. But this variety helps the comedy action a lot. Besides, some characters\' personalities are not as primitive as in season 1 (Suigintou, for example, turned in flesh-and-blood girl (if it can be said this way of talking doll) from Ominous-Villain-Demon-With-Non-Stopping-Nasty-Laugh), Shinku kicks Jun no more (annoyed me a lot) and, in general, became the most ample character in anime (she is principal char so that is natural, but I couldn\'t see it clearly before). All Maidens became more amiable and cute, I love them all after this season. And it\'s not because of their lowened agressiveness... they just got more alive.Enjoyment - 8,5Greatly spoiled by shortcomings of story, it is still high... I can make a conclusion in five words: I Would Rewatch This Anime.Overall - 8,5Rozen Maiden is original and outstanding yet using classical comedy-drama-system, and this is anime for everyone (no nudity, no violence, no profanity, purely platonic love storyline), so it is undoubtedly worth watching. It may please more or less depending on what to pay attention to most in general picture, but I think there are less people who watched RM and considered it a class-B shounen anime or so.I Would Rewatch This Anime.Would You Join Me? - 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands.

We have Jun not afraid to go outside anymore, and is actually trying to get into school again. There isn’t much development in the dolls but I guess that’s to be expected slightly. I have a small feeling that their artificial spirits are made to have a certain personality. I’m going to talk more about my theory later on in this review about that. We don’t really see much of the other human characters and so their personalities seem slightly the same. Jun’s sister...is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou. I have different feelings on both these new characters. Where as the fact I love Bara-Suishou as sort of a new antagonist for the dolls in light of what happen to Suigintou (Spoilers for the first series, sorry), I do not really like the addition of Kanaria. Kanaria felt like she was only there for comic relief. Her personality seemed to be similar to Suiseiseki in that she would get into trouble a lot and trying to sneak into the house. She also seemed slightly like Hinaichigo in how childish she is sometimes.With how deep the story gets, that doesn’t stop them from still doing the slice of life type of story arcs. They do end up making me annoyed slightly because there is so much story that can be given to the main idea of the Alice Game, the story behind the dolls and so on but what do we actually do get? Suiseiseki stealing Hinaichigo’s snack again, Shinku sitting reading or watching Detective Kun Kun, and Kanaria’s comedic attempts at going after the other girls. I can understand they are trying to give the characters more personality and show the personal growth of each of them but sometimes there is no growth at all. Then we are left with a kind of pointless run around with the story.Besides the slice of life stuff, the story does get a bit deep and sad. If I told you any more about that, then it would just be spoilers but there were times that tears did fall from my eyes.I said I was going to talk about my theory about the spirits. If you keep watching each of the dolls, it seems they have a bit of a collective soul. What I mean when I say this is that the personalities of each girl don’t always feel whole. Shinku is very proper; almost princess like where as Hinaichigo is very childish. Suiseiseki is a very mischievous girl who likes to tease others while her ‘twin’ sister Souseiseki is a bit more tomboyish. Suigintou is jealousy, and Kanaria is… I’m not fully sure but I think her personality is a bit of the sneaky planner. Sort of the personality of a girl who will sneak around someone to get what she wants or two get back at someone. If you look at all these dolls as personalities, it would seem that if all of them were put together, they would be the perfect being, the perfect ‘Alice.’ My theory of them and of the game they play is the idea that Rozen, their father, wanted to make the perfect daughter he named Alice and that the dolls must collect each part of Alice’s soul in order to become her. I do have another theory though, a back up theory if you want to take it as such… one that might be a very surprising turn of advents if this actually were to be true. My theory is that there is actually no real Alice Game. That the Alice Game was made up by someone to explain why they were ‘abandoned’ by their father. Their spirits though are pieces of their father’s daughter Alice who died at some point in time. In order to save her spirit, he placed parts of it into the dolls. It’s a large grasp at straws here but it’s another idea that I have from watching this series.The artwork is very beautiful when it wants to be and then it can also feel like they didn’t try. It’s much the same as the first series in both aspects. I still get the feeling that there are two different art styles from slice of life to occult in one show. The dolls are still rather detailed when not making funny faces or in a really comedic scene while the human characters feel a little lack luster. I am not sold on the face of Shirosaki, the salesperson at the doll shop in the show. I understand who he is from the moment I saw him (Not spoiling it though) but his face does not look like a humans. In fact, I really thought he might have been a doll himself with the way his eyes were and how his face was. It just looked way to flat and white to be real.The music is something I forgot to talk about in my review before that I will touch here. Both the first and this one have amazing music, most of it orchestra related. My favorite pieces are when the dolls are in some serious mode. That’s when the beautiful and yet haunting melody seems to come out that sounds slightly like a music box. I can’t help but get chills up my spine hearing that beautiful haunting melody. The English dub is basically the same so what I said before goes for this. I’m still not to keen on Hinaichigo’s or Suiseiseki’s voices much. Again, Hinaichigo’s high pitched childish whine is annoying and I really don’t understand why Suiseiseki’s voice has to be that high as well. They did grow on me more though since the first series which I guess works out. As for the newcomer, Kanaria is about as annoying as Hinaichigo’s voice. It’s high pitched and the way she talks reminds me of Naga the Serpent from Slayers. It’s that snarky little announcing voice that will say everything she is thinking no matter what. She hasn’t really had a chance to grow on me as much as the other characters though and maybe that’s why I can’t stand her right now.The story was actually really done and I liked how they dove more into the Alice Game and the story behind it but again they left more questions then answers. They had a very open ended ending that makes me wonder exactly what they mean by it. I still love the story and can’t wait to watch the rest of the seasons. is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou.

There really isn\'t a single character that I hated. Even the ""bad guy"" had my sympathy.This is a very good anime for anybody who appreciates dolls.

In the first season it was established that Jun had some special magical ability to ""bring back what was lost"" as demonstrated with the clown doll and with fixing Shinku\'s arm during her battle with Suigintou. The ending would have worked a lot better if this power was built upon / explained and then he used that power to restore all of the dolls after he found out they had been tricked - including Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki, instead of having a Deus Ex Machina moment with the...appearance of Rozen.And for some absolutely pointless reason, Rozen decides to leave Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki dead, again just to create cheap sadness with no logic. There is no reason Rozen or Jun should not be able to restore all of them.This ending is a huge disappointment because I really loved the unique concept of this show and the characters were very special, as I felt a real connection with all of them.

I like that certain obvious questions we had about the nature of the dolls was answered in a sensitive and fulfilling way (trying to be vague here to avoid spoilers!).What I don't like is the end. It was rushed and unfulfilling. It really felt like the writers had written themselves into a...corner and had to find a way to keep the action going until the end without leaving us on a sad note. I will chalk this up to trying to appeal to much to the action side of the anime (which was ALWAYS an afterthought). Unfortunately, the way in which they chose to do this robbed the most important characters of agency. And seeing these characters exercise that agency is what makes Rozen Maiden great in the first place (apropos that it is a franchise about ostensibly inanimate objects with animacy!).Nevertheless, the characters were treated with such respect and their personalities depicted well that I can forgive the very end of the story.

In my review of the first season I mentioned how the narrative is centered on the theme of ""trauma,"" but this does not seem to be the case for this sequel, which more deeply explores the conflicts of the story, although it does leaves many things open-ended, especially one of the major questions of the series, ""what does it mean to be Alice?"", so it is not conclusive for the series.One of the things...that is noticeable from the beginning is how the dolls and their personalities have more focus and are developed to make us more attach to them before they meet their tragic(quite tragic) ends. This is well done with all the dolls, but especially those who have benefited most from it are Shinzu, who needed motivation for her character, and Suigintou, who received such a good story that if nothing else, it\'s worth watching this anime just for her.In technical terms, this season has better animation and a better soundtrack. The piano in the background songs manages to convey the perfect tone for each scene, not to mention the opening played by Ali Project, which is always a pleasure to listen to.Not everything is perfect, though. The anime is very focused on the characters of the dolls, but the other characters are not explored much. The protagonist of the first season is sidelined, the protagonist\'s sister is super sidelined, and the new character, Laplace\'s Demon, is completely only used as a plot device.But in the end, this anime is a great continuation of the first one, with more comedy, action, and drama.

Trust me, you'll be lost.While Rozen Maiden was more about evolving characters, Traumend makes the jump right into action and keeps things moving at a fast pace throughout. There are still some fights between the dolls, however, it is more related to drama and action rather than...comedy.The new character Kanaria gives some laughs and eventually wears on the audience. But, Traumend is a bit darker than its predecessor and the dolls have to go through some hard times. There are even sacrifices, broken dolls and deaths.The darker tone suits well for character development and we see important changes in the main characters. The ending was somewhat surprising, but perhaps some would mention that it lacked something – turned out as a bit of a cop-out. Nevertheless, it is a satisfying end to the series.Traumend, overall a highly recommendable watch for fans of Rozen Maiden.

It was gearing up to be, in my opinion, better than the first season. However, the last episode left much to be desired. It's as if the writers did not know how to properly resolve all the conflicts, or perhaps they were confident in getting a third season and figured they would resolve them then. Sadly, this second season is the end for this version of RM. For this reason, I am left with many, many unanswered questions. For instance, why didn't Father tell...the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning? During the whole season, Father is made to look like a tyrant who wishes to see his creations fight to the death in order for his ideal doll to come to life. That is fine; I agree he is a bad man. But then at the end Father comes to the rescue?! And suddenly the fights are not necessary? Who was the Rabbit? What was his purpose and why does he get to possess Rosa Mysticas? I feel like this is cheating. And poor Jun had no character development. Seeing him be helpless and useless in the last episode did not sit well with me. I can understand that the first season was all about Jun, and this second one was going to be focused more on the various dolls. But in that case, it would've been better to leave Jun out of the finale. All in all, the season is great... except the last episode. It's not terribly bad, but it does ruin it if your expectations were higher, in accordance with what was set up in the previous episodes. So, I'd recommend, but be forewarned that the ending will probably not satisfy you. the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning?

Probably corresponds to some point in the Rozen Maiden manga, not sure which, though.Story: Tr&Atilde;&curren;umend picks up an unspecified amount of time after the first season.  All the dolls are still living at Jun's house, and he's definitely better than he was, but still not going to school (though there's good reason for it ' he's playing catch-up).  Shinku is having guilt-related nightmares, and after one of these,...she and Jun end up being drawn back into the mirror in his attic (why haven't they gotten rid of that yet?!) and meeting the seventh doll, whose appearance basically means that Father wants them to get on with the Alice Game, already.This season is everything I wanted last season to be, and more.  There's not so much filler as there was before ' and when there is, it actually advances the plot! --, and there's actually an overarching plot/urgency that wasn't there last season.  And moreover, we get to see the darker tones that were only hinted at in the last season.  There are so many more standout episodes, and the writers really show their talent by making you feel for characters you might not have necessarily liked last season.However, it's not perfect.  There is a character who turns into a bad running joke for most of the series.  And it looked like it was going to resolve things up till the last minute, but in the second half of the last episode, there's a nasty plot twist that leaves things open for a third season and several mysteries in its wake.Art: I don't know why, but the colors seem richer this season.  Maybe it's because there are so many scenes where they can use certain color schemes/tones.  Either way, it looks like it did last season, but better.Music: Again, about the same as last season.  The background music has its instantly recognizable songs (some that carry over from last season, too, which is really nice).  Didn't like the OP as much as last season's (ALI Project, again), but it grew on me.  Liked the ED instantly, though, as it's done by the same group who did Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament's OP, which is one of my favorites (kukui).Length: No real issues with length, this time.  Length is the same as last season's (twelve episodes), but it definitely goes by quicker.  When there was filler, as I said before, it ended up advancing the plot, so that was good, and there was an overarching plot/urgency to drive things forward.  However, the eleventh-hour plot twist in the episode, while it leaves things open for a second season, leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, because they were this close to resolving things, and they've only bought up more mysteries.Seiyuu: I recognize Enju's seiyuu from TmoHS (Koizumi) and Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ (Asuta), and Suigin Tou's seiyuu continues to rawq (Leandra from Nishi no Yoki Majo ' Astraea Testament and Lula from Red Garden!), but no other standout roles.  Decent seiyuu all around.Dub: N/A, has not been licensed as of yet.Overall: A definite improvement on the first season, but still has its flaws.

Although I do not want to give out alot of info this series is about a young boy named jun who is locked up in his room because of cracking under pressure on entrance exams, we do not find out about that until later on in the series, so as a result he is a...hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer. Then he gets possesion of Shinku, a wind up doll in search of Alice (the perfect doll) for his creator or ""Father"" to be happy, and for that to happen she has to defeat all the other dolls known as ""Rozen Maidens"" and take there life which is called a ""Rozen Mystica"" Now as the story goes on you see the characters unique personalities and powers. I believe that this series is a great recommendation to people who are interested in mystical and almost sci-fi\'sh anime. The story was overall good and had me wondering what would happen next although I thought that the ending was a little weak because it doesn\'t explain what happened to everyone else but gives an idea.The Art in this Anime is absolutely amazing. For the most part when I watched this I felt like there was a normal feel (as in the regular japanese home and life) with a little class into it. there is detail in every background although the characters do stick out more. There is one scene I absolutely adored the art and that was when one of the Rozen Maidens (Suigin Tou) goes to her world and it is snowing with Crystals all around. I really did love that the backgrounds fit the characters nature and personalilty for the fighting scenes and the comedy scenes.now the music was great, I loved the opening for this anime so much, it was creepy and yet energetic and was so well done. I love that the ending was great too because it was classy and modern at the same time , with a fast beat but still had that classy feel. I also loved the background music for this anime. the Orchestra was great for the serious scenes and the not so serious scenes. I really did enjoy the musicNow I know in this review I talk alot about the characters but I cannot help it they were great. The way they acted was amazing to the outfits they wore. As a person who thought I\'d never watch this anime due to the fact that I am personally afraid of dolls, felt like these characters were real with every step they took. Each personality was different in there own way and that is why I fell so in love with them. I especially fell head over heels for Shinku. She may act serious at times, but there have been times I felt that she was funny and overall the most beautiful of the Rozen maidens. the costumes fit each of the personalities with different colors on everyone\'s costume, and the fact that each is very unique made my heart jump. I also loved the supporting characters too as they were very great at there personalities and expressions, plus their designs fit their personalities greatly.my overall enjoyment for this anime is splendid. The only problem I had with it was probably the design of barasusishou because the other designs of all the characters were amazing and detailed while her design felt like it did not belong, though I did enjoy this character repeating what everyone said, I did not like how she look because she stood out too much. I also as I said earlier did not really like the ending because I wanted to see what happened to the other characters in the story that got there Rozen Mystica\'s taken away, but it was an overall 9.5 out of 10 hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer.

Where the first season followed an agoraphobic boy as he learned to overcome his fears and demons in order to help those he loved, the second gives center stage to the Rozen maidens and their enigmatic Father. Where once Jun broke the Alice Game and repaired what was thought to be beyond repair, he is now swept to the side offering little more than moral support. This shift in narrative focus had potential. After all, Jun’s story arc was neatly completed by the end of the first season while the dolls were ripe for development. How long...have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun. As the show progresses, so too do the characters: Shinku struggles to deal with the consequences of the first season, the twin sisters find their intentions drifting apart, even the (mostly insufferable) comic relief character Hina-Ichigo concludes a surprisingly emotional character arc. Several new characters are introduced, such as the (completely insufferable) comic relief character Kanaria and the fabled seventh Rozen maiden, Barasuishou, as well as an inscrutable trickster rabbit and a mysterious dollmaker. Far and away, however, the breakout character is Suigintou, who develops into an equal parts sympathetic and badass anti-hero as she and some of the other maidens seek out mediums in order to attain an edge in the Game.The stakes continue to rise and a series of frustrating, yet justifiable decisions are made, investing one emotionally as the plot starts to heat up. Philosophies regarding the Game and the dolls’ involvement in it clash as characters arrive at different conclusions concerning what is right. I, for one, was rivetted to the screen by the later episodes as they steamed ahead towards their uncertain conclusion.And then episode 12 hits.I have never seen a more abortive climax than the one that waits in episode 12. The momentum the show has built collapses in just a few minutes as the ending is rewritten, live, before your very eyes! The writers make a bold statement about the futility of resisting fate and the insignificance of our main character in the grand scheme, and then change their minds 30 seconds later as one is left to weep over the corpse of the last several wasted hours. It isn’t a bitter, sweet, or bittersweet ending, it’s just junk.It is difficult to get further into this review without spoilers, so I will leave you with this: Rozen Maiden Traumend is a lot of buildup for very little payoff. There are other flaws, such as Jun’s consistent inaction in the face of major events and Kanaria’s entire existence, but these pale in comparison to the ending. If a bad ending spoils a show for you, don’t bother watching, or maybe just watch up to episode 11 and imagine your own ending under the influence of whatever drug/drugs you have on hand. have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun.

I chose to watch it, after seeing the ""desu"" memes all over the internet. The characters in this series are really enjoyable. You kind of get attached to them (which i hate when that happens because theres not that much episodes >.>) One thing i fell in love with was hina ichigos voice. (im a sucker for kawaii things like that.) I also really enjoyed how Jun went from being a shut in to falling in love with shinku. I really wish they would of ended the series better though. I hope they make a 3rd season. Withouth it ill...never know who became alice! never know who became alice!', ""STORY:I was very impressed with the story overall, I thought it was pretty unique. There were some great plot twist thrown in that took me by surprise, I was glad to see that things were not as obvious as they seemed. The story moved at a great pace and had no filler episodes.ANIMATION:The art is the same as the previous season although it seems a bit better this time around, the animation during the ending song was particularly beautiful.SOUND:I have to say I was extremely impressed with the voice acting, Mona Marshals performance as Jun was no less then outstanding, the same goes...for Mela Lee as Shinku and everyone else.The music is the same style used in season 1. It fits very well and there wasn't any song I disliked.CHARACTERS:I loved all the characters aside from the true  antagonist, they were all very interesting and I ended up rooting for most of them. I enjoyed Jun and Shinkus development the most. For me the characters are the main draw of the show.ENJOYMENT:Rozen Maiden is a truly unique show that should not be missed   I ended up enjoying the show even more then I'd hoped I would, none of the episodes were boring or unsatisfying.

I saw exactly where this one was headed early. The series reeked of a tear jerker from almost the very beginning. Right off the bat, the writers attempted to continue the character development concerning the dolls, with the intentions of establishing an emotional link with the viewer by over exploiting the dolls cute antics. This isn\'t a full blow against the series at all, because the driving force behind any work is the characters, and the viewer should feel for them. My only gripe is that because of this, the possible events were too spelled out in...light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas. The entire first half is a serious mixed bag, and can be looked at in a number of ways. At times, it can almost come off as complete filler, but there are things going on such as character and light plot development. The first seven episodes is drowned in its comedy which is hit most of the time; but those whom were used to the action scenes of the first season will be bored most of the time. Others whom enjoy the dolls very presence will be thoroughly entertained.My biggest problem with this season is that the writers try too hard to establish an emotional connection. They simply just didn\'t let the characters work and everything has to be pushed more. This will be the very first time I have an issue with character development. There was too much focus on the main dolls antics, and even their feelings to the point were Jun is almost left out completely. Adding to this, there were pacing issues as well that heavily effected the plot this time around. Even the two new characters whom were introduced weren\'t very well developed, and they felt more like cheap carbon copies.The drama in the series is also heavily over done but don\'t get me wrong here; when it\'s time for the drama to work, it does work. There are some good moments that will provide a few tears for those whom are attached to certain characters. However, at one time, a scene already achieved its desired and full effect, but would be heavily damaged due to its length. This worked against the series for me, and when someone else bit the dust it had that ""oh well"" feeling to me. The series eventually shifts to a darker side, but I think it was introduced a bit too late and simply didn\'t mesh right. Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas.

Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems', 'Rozen Maiden Traumend is the follow up to the original. Due to the lack of a proper interpretation of it\'s plot in the parent series of Rozen Maiden, for that reason I started watching this second season(also for more Suigintou) and since the first wasn\'t too bad, there\'s still hopes for development in this sequel.Traumend starts off from where the first series stopped; after the victorious battle with Suigintou, Shinku starts to feel the guilt of eliminating one of her sisters, all because of the Alice Game. In fact, Shinku simply made her into a ""piece of junk"". Is it wrong to feel sad for...an enemy you\'ve just defeated?Anyway, after completing Traumend, it\'s an improvement(but not massively) on the series, if you compare it to the original. Focusing more into the story, providing adequate explanation and reducing the number of trivial episodes. The story can be quite unpredictable sometimes; just when I thought THAT ""Father"" was the REAL ""Father"", turns that he isn\'t. There\'s also a considerable amount of drama with some fighting sequences and comedy going on. Final episode was more intense and better than in the original. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the results of the Alice Game.Why climb when you can fly? - the characters\' actions can be amusing. So, these dolls have the ability to fly(depends on the location or perhaps their mood). When I noticed that few of the them were ""climbing their way out of danger"", only for the enemy to catch up with them because she simply flew. You can sit there, relax and be amused by some their actions.Episodes 3, 5 and 7 are mostly just filler episodes, haphazardly placing keypoints of it\'s story that only lasts few minutes(sometimes mere seconds) and most of time, near the end. But hey, they\'re fairly watchable. It does focus on the story from time to time but at least 1/3 of the anime consist of very, slice-of-life-ish episodes. Like the original, pacing is slow as a snail.Traumend also introduces new characters and most of them play a major role in the story. First thing\'s first, Traumend has a new antagonist, the seventh and youngest Rozen Maiden doll, Barasuishou. Nevertheless, even with the new bunch of people, Suigintou remains as my number one character in the entire series and will always be.Comparing the original and Traumend and there\'s no enhancement on visuals.  After all, Traumend retains the whole same old visuals; colors are dull; not bright but Rozen Maiden dolls still look beautiful as ever, just like in the first. The visuals are sometimes inconsistent - characters faces differ from scene to scene. Just the same old, same old.ALI PROJECT performs the OP for this one too. Sadly, the majority of her songs including this is just not for me. Listened to the ED, and it was  actually quite good. But it gets old pretty quickly. BGM ranges from rock music(sadly the epic rock music is very rarely played) to same orchestral music pieces back in the original.To sum up, there\'s improvement in the overall storytelling, but even with that, I still wouldn\'t recommend it to everyone. After watching both seasons in the franchise, I must say that this is more recommended to the casual viewers. In any case, this is one series you have to see for yourself.

Less boring casual fillers (and empty space at all - first season was very, very emty, so that it could be cut to 8-9 episode without any harm to the plot). More reflection and philosophy (we even see them talk about God on the example of Master Rozen). Briefly, the story of Traumend is just smarter. Although, the illnesses of past times did not vanish utterly, and some episodes are still rather sleepy. And in plot there appear time after time illogical or rude lines that freak me out and spoil the enjoyment greatly.Art...- 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands. Rozen Maiden style remained stable and good.Sound - 9What is undoubtedly perfect in Rozen Maiden series is its breathtaking soundtrack. Piano and violon plays suit lolita-fashion so well that any action is exciting with this music playing. Opening is not great but alright, ending is dull, but at least you may skip it. What really doesn\'t let 10 to be set is the invariability. OST melodies are not to criticize but they are less, and after 20+ episodes of non-stop watching they don\'t please one\'s ears as much as in the beginning.Character - 9Rozen Maiden dolls are the collection. The collection of faces, haircuts, dresses, and psychological types. Of course, it should not be considered as serious ""panorama of social types"" or some that way. But this variety helps the comedy action a lot. Besides, some characters\' personalities are not as primitive as in season 1 (Suigintou, for example, turned in flesh-and-blood girl (if it can be said this way of talking doll) from Ominous-Villain-Demon-With-Non-Stopping-Nasty-Laugh), Shinku kicks Jun no more (annoyed me a lot) and, in general, became the most ample character in anime (she is principal char so that is natural, but I couldn\'t see it clearly before). All Maidens became more amiable and cute, I love them all after this season. And it\'s not because of their lowened agressiveness... they just got more alive.Enjoyment - 8,5Greatly spoiled by shortcomings of story, it is still high... I can make a conclusion in five words: I Would Rewatch This Anime.Overall - 8,5Rozen Maiden is original and outstanding yet using classical comedy-drama-system, and this is anime for everyone (no nudity, no violence, no profanity, purely platonic love storyline), so it is undoubtedly worth watching. It may please more or less depending on what to pay attention to most in general picture, but I think there are less people who watched RM and considered it a class-B shounen anime or so.I Would Rewatch This Anime.Would You Join Me? - 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands.

We have Jun not afraid to go outside anymore, and is actually trying to get into school again. There isn’t much development in the dolls but I guess that’s to be expected slightly. I have a small feeling that their artificial spirits are made to have a certain personality. I’m going to talk more about my theory later on in this review about that. We don’t really see much of the other human characters and so their personalities seem slightly the same. Jun’s sister...is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou. I have different feelings on both these new characters. Where as the fact I love Bara-Suishou as sort of a new antagonist for the dolls in light of what happen to Suigintou (Spoilers for the first series, sorry), I do not really like the addition of Kanaria. Kanaria felt like she was only there for comic relief. Her personality seemed to be similar to Suiseiseki in that she would get into trouble a lot and trying to sneak into the house. She also seemed slightly like Hinaichigo in how childish she is sometimes.With how deep the story gets, that doesn’t stop them from still doing the slice of life type of story arcs. They do end up making me annoyed slightly because there is so much story that can be given to the main idea of the Alice Game, the story behind the dolls and so on but what do we actually do get? Suiseiseki stealing Hinaichigo’s snack again, Shinku sitting reading or watching Detective Kun Kun, and Kanaria’s comedic attempts at going after the other girls. I can understand they are trying to give the characters more personality and show the personal growth of each of them but sometimes there is no growth at all. Then we are left with a kind of pointless run around with the story.Besides the slice of life stuff, the story does get a bit deep and sad. If I told you any more about that, then it would just be spoilers but there were times that tears did fall from my eyes.I said I was going to talk about my theory about the spirits. If you keep watching each of the dolls, it seems they have a bit of a collective soul. What I mean when I say this is that the personalities of each girl don’t always feel whole. Shinku is very proper; almost princess like where as Hinaichigo is very childish. Suiseiseki is a very mischievous girl who likes to tease others while her ‘twin’ sister Souseiseki is a bit more tomboyish. Suigintou is jealousy, and Kanaria is… I’m not fully sure but I think her personality is a bit of the sneaky planner. Sort of the personality of a girl who will sneak around someone to get what she wants or two get back at someone. If you look at all these dolls as personalities, it would seem that if all of them were put together, they would be the perfect being, the perfect ‘Alice.’ My theory of them and of the game they play is the idea that Rozen, their father, wanted to make the perfect daughter he named Alice and that the dolls must collect each part of Alice’s soul in order to become her. I do have another theory though, a back up theory if you want to take it as such… one that might be a very surprising turn of advents if this actually were to be true. My theory is that there is actually no real Alice Game. That the Alice Game was made up by someone to explain why they were ‘abandoned’ by their father. Their spirits though are pieces of their father’s daughter Alice who died at some point in time. In order to save her spirit, he placed parts of it into the dolls. It’s a large grasp at straws here but it’s another idea that I have from watching this series.The artwork is very beautiful when it wants to be and then it can also feel like they didn’t try. It’s much the same as the first series in both aspects. I still get the feeling that there are two different art styles from slice of life to occult in one show. The dolls are still rather detailed when not making funny faces or in a really comedic scene while the human characters feel a little lack luster. I am not sold on the face of Shirosaki, the salesperson at the doll shop in the show. I understand who he is from the moment I saw him (Not spoiling it though) but his face does not look like a humans. In fact, I really thought he might have been a doll himself with the way his eyes were and how his face was. It just looked way to flat and white to be real.The music is something I forgot to talk about in my review before that I will touch here. Both the first and this one have amazing music, most of it orchestra related. My favorite pieces are when the dolls are in some serious mode. That’s when the beautiful and yet haunting melody seems to come out that sounds slightly like a music box. I can’t help but get chills up my spine hearing that beautiful haunting melody. The English dub is basically the same so what I said before goes for this. I’m still not to keen on Hinaichigo’s or Suiseiseki’s voices much. Again, Hinaichigo’s high pitched childish whine is annoying and I really don’t understand why Suiseiseki’s voice has to be that high as well. They did grow on me more though since the first series which I guess works out. As for the newcomer, Kanaria is about as annoying as Hinaichigo’s voice. It’s high pitched and the way she talks reminds me of Naga the Serpent from Slayers. It’s that snarky little announcing voice that will say everything she is thinking no matter what. She hasn’t really had a chance to grow on me as much as the other characters though and maybe that’s why I can’t stand her right now.The story was actually really done and I liked how they dove more into the Alice Game and the story behind it but again they left more questions then answers. They had a very open ended ending that makes me wonder exactly what they mean by it. I still love the story and can’t wait to watch the rest of the seasons. is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou.

There really isn\'t a single character that I hated. Even the ""bad guy"" had my sympathy.This is a very good anime for anybody who appreciates dolls.

In the first season it was established that Jun had some special magical ability to ""bring back what was lost"" as demonstrated with the clown doll and with fixing Shinku\'s arm during her battle with Suigintou. The ending would have worked a lot better if this power was built upon / explained and then he used that power to restore all of the dolls after he found out they had been tricked - including Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki, instead of having a Deus Ex Machina moment with the...appearance of Rozen.And for some absolutely pointless reason, Rozen decides to leave Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki dead, again just to create cheap sadness with no logic. There is no reason Rozen or Jun should not be able to restore all of them.This ending is a huge disappointment because I really loved the unique concept of this show and the characters were very special, as I felt a real connection with all of them.

I like that certain obvious questions we had about the nature of the dolls was answered in a sensitive and fulfilling way (trying to be vague here to avoid spoilers!).What I don't like is the end. It was rushed and unfulfilling. It really felt like the writers had written themselves into a...corner and had to find a way to keep the action going until the end without leaving us on a sad note. I will chalk this up to trying to appeal to much to the action side of the anime (which was ALWAYS an afterthought). Unfortunately, the way in which they chose to do this robbed the most important characters of agency. And seeing these characters exercise that agency is what makes Rozen Maiden great in the first place (apropos that it is a franchise about ostensibly inanimate objects with animacy!).Nevertheless, the characters were treated with such respect and their personalities depicted well that I can forgive the very end of the story.

In my review of the first season I mentioned how the narrative is centered on the theme of ""trauma,"" but this does not seem to be the case for this sequel, which more deeply explores the conflicts of the story, although it does leaves many things open-ended, especially one of the major questions of the series, ""what does it mean to be Alice?"", so it is not conclusive for the series.One of the things...that is noticeable from the beginning is how the dolls and their personalities have more focus and are developed to make us more attach to them before they meet their tragic(quite tragic) ends. This is well done with all the dolls, but especially those who have benefited most from it are Shinzu, who needed motivation for her character, and Suigintou, who received such a good story that if nothing else, it\'s worth watching this anime just for her.In technical terms, this season has better animation and a better soundtrack. The piano in the background songs manages to convey the perfect tone for each scene, not to mention the opening played by Ali Project, which is always a pleasure to listen to.Not everything is perfect, though. The anime is very focused on the characters of the dolls, but the other characters are not explored much. The protagonist of the first season is sidelined, the protagonist\'s sister is super sidelined, and the new character, Laplace\'s Demon, is completely only used as a plot device.But in the end, this anime is a great continuation of the first one, with more comedy, action, and drama.

Trust me, you'll be lost.While Rozen Maiden was more about evolving characters, Traumend makes the jump right into action and keeps things moving at a fast pace throughout. There are still some fights between the dolls, however, it is more related to drama and action rather than...comedy.The new character Kanaria gives some laughs and eventually wears on the audience. But, Traumend is a bit darker than its predecessor and the dolls have to go through some hard times. There are even sacrifices, broken dolls and deaths.The darker tone suits well for character development and we see important changes in the main characters. The ending was somewhat surprising, but perhaps some would mention that it lacked something – turned out as a bit of a cop-out. Nevertheless, it is a satisfying end to the series.Traumend, overall a highly recommendable watch for fans of Rozen Maiden.

It was gearing up to be, in my opinion, better than the first season. However, the last episode left much to be desired. It's as if the writers did not know how to properly resolve all the conflicts, or perhaps they were confident in getting a third season and figured they would resolve them then. Sadly, this second season is the end for this version of RM. For this reason, I am left with many, many unanswered questions. For instance, why didn't Father tell...the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning? During the whole season, Father is made to look like a tyrant who wishes to see his creations fight to the death in order for his ideal doll to come to life. That is fine; I agree he is a bad man. But then at the end Father comes to the rescue?! And suddenly the fights are not necessary? Who was the Rabbit? What was his purpose and why does he get to possess Rosa Mysticas? I feel like this is cheating. And poor Jun had no character development. Seeing him be helpless and useless in the last episode did not sit well with me. I can understand that the first season was all about Jun, and this second one was going to be focused more on the various dolls. But in that case, it would've been better to leave Jun out of the finale. All in all, the season is great... except the last episode. It's not terribly bad, but it does ruin it if your expectations were higher, in accordance with what was set up in the previous episodes. So, I'd recommend, but be forewarned that the ending will probably not satisfy you. the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning?

Probably corresponds to some point in the Rozen Maiden manga, not sure which, though.Story: Tr&Atilde;&curren;umend picks up an unspecified amount of time after the first season.  All the dolls are still living at Jun's house, and he's definitely better than he was, but still not going to school (though there's good reason for it ' he's playing catch-up).  Shinku is having guilt-related nightmares, and after one of these,...she and Jun end up being drawn back into the mirror in his attic (why haven't they gotten rid of that yet?!) and meeting the seventh doll, whose appearance basically means that Father wants them to get on with the Alice Game, already.This season is everything I wanted last season to be, and more.  There's not so much filler as there was before ' and when there is, it actually advances the plot! --, and there's actually an overarching plot/urgency that wasn't there last season.  And moreover, we get to see the darker tones that were only hinted at in the last season.  There are so many more standout episodes, and the writers really show their talent by making you feel for characters you might not have necessarily liked last season.However, it's not perfect.  There is a character who turns into a bad running joke for most of the series.  And it looked like it was going to resolve things up till the last minute, but in the second half of the last episode, there's a nasty plot twist that leaves things open for a third season and several mysteries in its wake.Art: I don't know why, but the colors seem richer this season.  Maybe it's because there are so many scenes where they can use certain color schemes/tones.  Either way, it looks like it did last season, but better.Music: Again, about the same as last season.  The background music has its instantly recognizable songs (some that carry over from last season, too, which is really nice).  Didn't like the OP as much as last season's (ALI Project, again), but it grew on me.  Liked the ED instantly, though, as it's done by the same group who did Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament's OP, which is one of my favorites (kukui).Length: No real issues with length, this time.  Length is the same as last season's (twelve episodes), but it definitely goes by quicker.  When there was filler, as I said before, it ended up advancing the plot, so that was good, and there was an overarching plot/urgency to drive things forward.  However, the eleventh-hour plot twist in the episode, while it leaves things open for a second season, leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, because they were this close to resolving things, and they've only bought up more mysteries.Seiyuu: I recognize Enju's seiyuu from TmoHS (Koizumi) and Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ (Asuta), and Suigin Tou's seiyuu continues to rawq (Leandra from Nishi no Yoki Majo ' Astraea Testament and Lula from Red Garden!), but no other standout roles.  Decent seiyuu all around.Dub: N/A, has not been licensed as of yet.Overall: A definite improvement on the first season, but still has its flaws.

Although I do not want to give out alot of info this series is about a young boy named jun who is locked up in his room because of cracking under pressure on entrance exams, we do not find out about that until later on in the series, so as a result he is a...hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer. Then he gets possesion of Shinku, a wind up doll in search of Alice (the perfect doll) for his creator or ""Father"" to be happy, and for that to happen she has to defeat all the other dolls known as ""Rozen Maidens"" and take there life which is called a ""Rozen Mystica"" Now as the story goes on you see the characters unique personalities and powers. I believe that this series is a great recommendation to people who are interested in mystical and almost sci-fi\'sh anime. The story was overall good and had me wondering what would happen next although I thought that the ending was a little weak because it doesn\'t explain what happened to everyone else but gives an idea.The Art in this Anime is absolutely amazing. For the most part when I watched this I felt like there was a normal feel (as in the regular japanese home and life) with a little class into it. there is detail in every background although the characters do stick out more. There is one scene I absolutely adored the art and that was when one of the Rozen Maidens (Suigin Tou) goes to her world and it is snowing with Crystals all around. I really did love that the backgrounds fit the characters nature and personalilty for the fighting scenes and the comedy scenes.now the music was great, I loved the opening for this anime so much, it was creepy and yet energetic and was so well done. I love that the ending was great too because it was classy and modern at the same time , with a fast beat but still had that classy feel. I also loved the background music for this anime. the Orchestra was great for the serious scenes and the not so serious scenes. I really did enjoy the musicNow I know in this review I talk alot about the characters but I cannot help it they were great. The way they acted was amazing to the outfits they wore. As a person who thought I\'d never watch this anime due to the fact that I am personally afraid of dolls, felt like these characters were real with every step they took. Each personality was different in there own way and that is why I fell so in love with them. I especially fell head over heels for Shinku. She may act serious at times, but there have been times I felt that she was funny and overall the most beautiful of the Rozen maidens. the costumes fit each of the personalities with different colors on everyone\'s costume, and the fact that each is very unique made my heart jump. I also loved the supporting characters too as they were very great at there personalities and expressions, plus their designs fit their personalities greatly.my overall enjoyment for this anime is splendid. The only problem I had with it was probably the design of barasusishou because the other designs of all the characters were amazing and detailed while her design felt like it did not belong, though I did enjoy this character repeating what everyone said, I did not like how she look because she stood out too much. I also as I said earlier did not really like the ending because I wanted to see what happened to the other characters in the story that got there Rozen Mystica\'s taken away, but it was an overall 9.5 out of 10 hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer.

Where the first season followed an agoraphobic boy as he learned to overcome his fears and demons in order to help those he loved, the second gives center stage to the Rozen maidens and their enigmatic Father. Where once Jun broke the Alice Game and repaired what was thought to be beyond repair, he is now swept to the side offering little more than moral support. This shift in narrative focus had potential. After all, Jun’s story arc was neatly completed by the end of the first season while the dolls were ripe for development. How long...have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun. As the show progresses, so too do the characters: Shinku struggles to deal with the consequences of the first season, the twin sisters find their intentions drifting apart, even the (mostly insufferable) comic relief character Hina-Ichigo concludes a surprisingly emotional character arc. Several new characters are introduced, such as the (completely insufferable) comic relief character Kanaria and the fabled seventh Rozen maiden, Barasuishou, as well as an inscrutable trickster rabbit and a mysterious dollmaker. Far and away, however, the breakout character is Suigintou, who develops into an equal parts sympathetic and badass anti-hero as she and some of the other maidens seek out mediums in order to attain an edge in the Game.The stakes continue to rise and a series of frustrating, yet justifiable decisions are made, investing one emotionally as the plot starts to heat up. Philosophies regarding the Game and the dolls’ involvement in it clash as characters arrive at different conclusions concerning what is right. I, for one, was rivetted to the screen by the later episodes as they steamed ahead towards their uncertain conclusion.And then episode 12 hits.I have never seen a more abortive climax than the one that waits in episode 12. The momentum the show has built collapses in just a few minutes as the ending is rewritten, live, before your very eyes! The writers make a bold statement about the futility of resisting fate and the insignificance of our main character in the grand scheme, and then change their minds 30 seconds later as one is left to weep over the corpse of the last several wasted hours. It isn’t a bitter, sweet, or bittersweet ending, it’s just junk.It is difficult to get further into this review without spoilers, so I will leave you with this: Rozen Maiden Traumend is a lot of buildup for very little payoff. There are other flaws, such as Jun’s consistent inaction in the face of major events and Kanaria’s entire existence, but these pale in comparison to the ending. If a bad ending spoils a show for you, don’t bother watching, or maybe just watch up to episode 11 and imagine your own ending under the influence of whatever drug/drugs you have on hand. have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun.

I chose to watch it, after seeing the ""desu"" memes all over the internet. The characters in this series are really enjoyable. You kind of get attached to them (which i hate when that happens because theres not that much episodes >.>) One thing i fell in love with was hina ichigos voice. (im a sucker for kawaii things like that.) I also really enjoyed how Jun went from being a shut in to falling in love with shinku. I really wish they would of ended the series better though. I hope they make a 3rd season. Withouth it ill...never know who became alice! never know who became alice!', ""STORY:I was very impressed with the story overall, I thought it was pretty unique. There were some great plot twist thrown in that took me by surprise, I was glad to see that things were not as obvious as they seemed. The story moved at a great pace and had no filler episodes.ANIMATION:The art is the same as the previous season although it seems a bit better this time around, the animation during the ending song was particularly beautiful.SOUND:I have to say I was extremely impressed with the voice acting, Mona Marshals performance as Jun was no less then outstanding, the same goes...for Mela Lee as Shinku and everyone else.The music is the same style used in season 1. It fits very well and there wasn't any song I disliked.CHARACTERS:I loved all the characters aside from the true  antagonist, they were all very interesting and I ended up rooting for most of them. I enjoyed Jun and Shinkus development the most. For me the characters are the main draw of the show.ENJOYMENT:Rozen Maiden is a truly unique show that should not be missed   I ended up enjoying the show even more then I'd hoped I would, none of the episodes were boring or unsatisfying.

I saw exactly where this one was headed early. The series reeked of a tear jerker from almost the very beginning. Right off the bat, the writers attempted to continue the character development concerning the dolls, with the intentions of establishing an emotional link with the viewer by over exploiting the dolls cute antics. This isn\'t a full blow against the series at all, because the driving force behind any work is the characters, and the viewer should feel for them. My only gripe is that because of this, the possible events were too spelled out in...light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas. The entire first half is a serious mixed bag, and can be looked at in a number of ways. At times, it can almost come off as complete filler, but there are things going on such as character and light plot development. The first seven episodes is drowned in its comedy which is hit most of the time; but those whom were used to the action scenes of the first season will be bored most of the time. Others whom enjoy the dolls very presence will be thoroughly entertained.My biggest problem with this season is that the writers try too hard to establish an emotional connection. They simply just didn\'t let the characters work and everything has to be pushed more. This will be the very first time I have an issue with character development. There was too much focus on the main dolls antics, and even their feelings to the point were Jun is almost left out completely. Adding to this, there were pacing issues as well that heavily effected the plot this time around. Even the two new characters whom were introduced weren\'t very well developed, and they felt more like cheap carbon copies.The drama in the series is also heavily over done but don\'t get me wrong here; when it\'s time for the drama to work, it does work. There are some good moments that will provide a few tears for those whom are attached to certain characters. However, at one time, a scene already achieved its desired and full effect, but would be heavily damaged due to its length. This worked against the series for me, and when someone else bit the dust it had that ""oh well"" feeling to me. The series eventually shifts to a darker side, but I think it was introduced a bit too late and simply didn\'t mesh right. Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas.

Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems', 'Rozen Maiden Traumend is the follow up to the original. Due to the lack of a proper interpretation of it\'s plot in the parent series of Rozen Maiden, for that reason I started watching this second season(also for more Suigintou) and since the first wasn\'t too bad, there\'s still hopes for development in this sequel.Traumend starts off from where the first series stopped; after the victorious battle with Suigintou, Shinku starts to feel the guilt of eliminating one of her sisters, all because of the Alice Game. In fact, Shinku simply made her into a ""piece of junk"". Is it wrong to feel sad for...an enemy you\'ve just defeated?Anyway, after completing Traumend, it\'s an improvement(but not massively) on the series, if you compare it to the original. Focusing more into the story, providing adequate explanation and reducing the number of trivial episodes. The story can be quite unpredictable sometimes; just when I thought THAT ""Father"" was the REAL ""Father"", turns that he isn\'t. There\'s also a considerable amount of drama with some fighting sequences and comedy going on. Final episode was more intense and better than in the original. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the results of the Alice Game.Why climb when you can fly? - the characters\' actions can be amusing. So, these dolls have the ability to fly(depends on the location or perhaps their mood). When I noticed that few of the them were ""climbing their way out of danger"", only for the enemy to catch up with them because she simply flew. You can sit there, relax and be amused by some their actions.Episodes 3, 5 and 7 are mostly just filler episodes, haphazardly placing keypoints of it\'s story that only lasts few minutes(sometimes mere seconds) and most of time, near the end. But hey, they\'re fairly watchable. It does focus on the story from time to time but at least 1/3 of the anime consist of very, slice-of-life-ish episodes. Like the original, pacing is slow as a snail.Traumend also introduces new characters and most of them play a major role in the story. First thing\'s first, Traumend has a new antagonist, the seventh and youngest Rozen Maiden doll, Barasuishou. Nevertheless, even with the new bunch of people, Suigintou remains as my number one character in the entire series and will always be.Comparing the original and Traumend and there\'s no enhancement on visuals.  After all, Traumend retains the whole same old visuals; colors are dull; not bright but Rozen Maiden dolls still look beautiful as ever, just like in the first. The visuals are sometimes inconsistent - characters faces differ from scene to scene. Just the same old, same old.ALI PROJECT performs the OP for this one too. Sadly, the majority of her songs including this is just not for me. Listened to the ED, and it was  actually quite good. But it gets old pretty quickly. BGM ranges from rock music(sadly the epic rock music is very rarely played) to same orchestral music pieces back in the original.To sum up, there\'s improvement in the overall storytelling, but even with that, I still wouldn\'t recommend it to everyone. After watching both seasons in the franchise, I must say that this is more recommended to the casual viewers. In any case, this is one series you have to see for yourself.

Less boring casual fillers (and empty space at all - first season was very, very emty, so that it could be cut to 8-9 episode without any harm to the plot). More reflection and philosophy (we even see them talk about God on the example of Master Rozen). Briefly, the story of Traumend is just smarter. Although, the illnesses of past times did not vanish utterly, and some episodes are still rather sleepy. And in plot there appear time after time illogical or rude lines that freak me out and spoil the enjoyment greatly.Art...- 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands. Rozen Maiden style remained stable and good.Sound - 9What is undoubtedly perfect in Rozen Maiden series is its breathtaking soundtrack. Piano and violon plays suit lolita-fashion so well that any action is exciting with this music playing. Opening is not great but alright, ending is dull, but at least you may skip it. What really doesn\'t let 10 to be set is the invariability. OST melodies are not to criticize but they are less, and after 20+ episodes of non-stop watching they don\'t please one\'s ears as much as in the beginning.Character - 9Rozen Maiden dolls are the collection. The collection of faces, haircuts, dresses, and psychological types. Of course, it should not be considered as serious ""panorama of social types"" or some that way. But this variety helps the comedy action a lot. Besides, some characters\' personalities are not as primitive as in season 1 (Suigintou, for example, turned in flesh-and-blood girl (if it can be said this way of talking doll) from Ominous-Villain-Demon-With-Non-Stopping-Nasty-Laugh), Shinku kicks Jun no more (annoyed me a lot) and, in general, became the most ample character in anime (she is principal char so that is natural, but I couldn\'t see it clearly before). All Maidens became more amiable and cute, I love them all after this season. And it\'s not because of their lowened agressiveness... they just got more alive.Enjoyment - 8,5Greatly spoiled by shortcomings of story, it is still high... I can make a conclusion in five words: I Would Rewatch This Anime.Overall - 8,5Rozen Maiden is original and outstanding yet using classical comedy-drama-system, and this is anime for everyone (no nudity, no violence, no profanity, purely platonic love storyline), so it is undoubtedly worth watching. It may please more or less depending on what to pay attention to most in general picture, but I think there are less people who watched RM and considered it a class-B shounen anime or so.I Would Rewatch This Anime.Would You Join Me? - 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands.

We have Jun not afraid to go outside anymore, and is actually trying to get into school again. There isn’t much development in the dolls but I guess that’s to be expected slightly. I have a small feeling that their artificial spirits are made to have a certain personality. I’m going to talk more about my theory later on in this review about that. We don’t really see much of the other human characters and so their personalities seem slightly the same. Jun’s sister...is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou. I have different feelings on both these new characters. Where as the fact I love Bara-Suishou as sort of a new antagonist for the dolls in light of what happen to Suigintou (Spoilers for the first series, sorry), I do not really like the addition of Kanaria. Kanaria felt like she was only there for comic relief. Her personality seemed to be similar to Suiseiseki in that she would get into trouble a lot and trying to sneak into the house. She also seemed slightly like Hinaichigo in how childish she is sometimes.With how deep the story gets, that doesn’t stop them from still doing the slice of life type of story arcs. They do end up making me annoyed slightly because there is so much story that can be given to the main idea of the Alice Game, the story behind the dolls and so on but what do we actually do get? Suiseiseki stealing Hinaichigo’s snack again, Shinku sitting reading or watching Detective Kun Kun, and Kanaria’s comedic attempts at going after the other girls. I can understand they are trying to give the characters more personality and show the personal growth of each of them but sometimes there is no growth at all. Then we are left with a kind of pointless run around with the story.Besides the slice of life stuff, the story does get a bit deep and sad. If I told you any more about that, then it would just be spoilers but there were times that tears did fall from my eyes.I said I was going to talk about my theory about the spirits. If you keep watching each of the dolls, it seems they have a bit of a collective soul. What I mean when I say this is that the personalities of each girl don’t always feel whole. Shinku is very proper; almost princess like where as Hinaichigo is very childish. Suiseiseki is a very mischievous girl who likes to tease others while her ‘twin’ sister Souseiseki is a bit more tomboyish. Suigintou is jealousy, and Kanaria is… I’m not fully sure but I think her personality is a bit of the sneaky planner. Sort of the personality of a girl who will sneak around someone to get what she wants or two get back at someone. If you look at all these dolls as personalities, it would seem that if all of them were put together, they would be the perfect being, the perfect ‘Alice.’ My theory of them and of the game they play is the idea that Rozen, their father, wanted to make the perfect daughter he named Alice and that the dolls must collect each part of Alice’s soul in order to become her. I do have another theory though, a back up theory if you want to take it as such… one that might be a very surprising turn of advents if this actually were to be true. My theory is that there is actually no real Alice Game. That the Alice Game was made up by someone to explain why they were ‘abandoned’ by their father. Their spirits though are pieces of their father’s daughter Alice who died at some point in time. In order to save her spirit, he placed parts of it into the dolls. It’s a large grasp at straws here but it’s another idea that I have from watching this series.The artwork is very beautiful when it wants to be and then it can also feel like they didn’t try. It’s much the same as the first series in both aspects. I still get the feeling that there are two different art styles from slice of life to occult in one show. The dolls are still rather detailed when not making funny faces or in a really comedic scene while the human characters feel a little lack luster. I am not sold on the face of Shirosaki, the salesperson at the doll shop in the show. I understand who he is from the moment I saw him (Not spoiling it though) but his face does not look like a humans. In fact, I really thought he might have been a doll himself with the way his eyes were and how his face was. It just looked way to flat and white to be real.The music is something I forgot to talk about in my review before that I will touch here. Both the first and this one have amazing music, most of it orchestra related. My favorite pieces are when the dolls are in some serious mode. That’s when the beautiful and yet haunting melody seems to come out that sounds slightly like a music box. I can’t help but get chills up my spine hearing that beautiful haunting melody. The English dub is basically the same so what I said before goes for this. I’m still not to keen on Hinaichigo’s or Suiseiseki’s voices much. Again, Hinaichigo’s high pitched childish whine is annoying and I really don’t understand why Suiseiseki’s voice has to be that high as well. They did grow on me more though since the first series which I guess works out. As for the newcomer, Kanaria is about as annoying as Hinaichigo’s voice. It’s high pitched and the way she talks reminds me of Naga the Serpent from Slayers. It’s that snarky little announcing voice that will say everything she is thinking no matter what. She hasn’t really had a chance to grow on me as much as the other characters though and maybe that’s why I can’t stand her right now.The story was actually really done and I liked how they dove more into the Alice Game and the story behind it but again they left more questions then answers. They had a very open ended ending that makes me wonder exactly what they mean by it. I still love the story and can’t wait to watch the rest of the seasons. is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou.

There really isn\'t a single character that I hated. Even the ""bad guy"" had my sympathy.This is a very good anime for anybody who appreciates dolls.

In the first season it was established that Jun had some special magical ability to ""bring back what was lost"" as demonstrated with the clown doll and with fixing Shinku\'s arm during her battle with Suigintou. The ending would have worked a lot better if this power was built upon / explained and then he used that power to restore all of the dolls after he found out they had been tricked - including Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki, instead of having a Deus Ex Machina moment with the...appearance of Rozen.And for some absolutely pointless reason, Rozen decides to leave Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki dead, again just to create cheap sadness with no logic. There is no reason Rozen or Jun should not be able to restore all of them.This ending is a huge disappointment because I really loved the unique concept of this show and the characters were very special, as I felt a real connection with all of them.

I like that certain obvious questions we had about the nature of the dolls was answered in a sensitive and fulfilling way (trying to be vague here to avoid spoilers!).What I don't like is the end. It was rushed and unfulfilling. It really felt like the writers had written themselves into a...corner and had to find a way to keep the action going until the end without leaving us on a sad note. I will chalk this up to trying to appeal to much to the action side of the anime (which was ALWAYS an afterthought). Unfortunately, the way in which they chose to do this robbed the most important characters of agency. And seeing these characters exercise that agency is what makes Rozen Maiden great in the first place (apropos that it is a franchise about ostensibly inanimate objects with animacy!).Nevertheless, the characters were treated with such respect and their personalities depicted well that I can forgive the very end of the story.

In my review of the first season I mentioned how the narrative is centered on the theme of ""trauma,"" but this does not seem to be the case for this sequel, which more deeply explores the conflicts of the story, although it does leaves many things open-ended, especially one of the major questions of the series, ""what does it mean to be Alice?"", so it is not conclusive for the series.One of the things...that is noticeable from the beginning is how the dolls and their personalities have more focus and are developed to make us more attach to them before they meet their tragic(quite tragic) ends. This is well done with all the dolls, but especially those who have benefited most from it are Shinzu, who needed motivation for her character, and Suigintou, who received such a good story that if nothing else, it\'s worth watching this anime just for her.In technical terms, this season has better animation and a better soundtrack. The piano in the background songs manages to convey the perfect tone for each scene, not to mention the opening played by Ali Project, which is always a pleasure to listen to.Not everything is perfect, though. The anime is very focused on the characters of the dolls, but the other characters are not explored much. The protagonist of the first season is sidelined, the protagonist\'s sister is super sidelined, and the new character, Laplace\'s Demon, is completely only used as a plot device.But in the end, this anime is a great continuation of the first one, with more comedy, action, and drama.

Trust me, you'll be lost.While Rozen Maiden was more about evolving characters, Traumend makes the jump right into action and keeps things moving at a fast pace throughout. There are still some fights between the dolls, however, it is more related to drama and action rather than...comedy.The new character Kanaria gives some laughs and eventually wears on the audience. But, Traumend is a bit darker than its predecessor and the dolls have to go through some hard times. There are even sacrifices, broken dolls and deaths.The darker tone suits well for character development and we see important changes in the main characters. The ending was somewhat surprising, but perhaps some would mention that it lacked something – turned out as a bit of a cop-out. Nevertheless, it is a satisfying end to the series.Traumend, overall a highly recommendable watch for fans of Rozen Maiden.

It was gearing up to be, in my opinion, better than the first season. However, the last episode left much to be desired. It's as if the writers did not know how to properly resolve all the conflicts, or perhaps they were confident in getting a third season and figured they would resolve them then. Sadly, this second season is the end for this version of RM. For this reason, I am left with many, many unanswered questions. For instance, why didn't Father tell...the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning? During the whole season, Father is made to look like a tyrant who wishes to see his creations fight to the death in order for his ideal doll to come to life. That is fine; I agree he is a bad man. But then at the end Father comes to the rescue?! And suddenly the fights are not necessary? Who was the Rabbit? What was his purpose and why does he get to possess Rosa Mysticas? I feel like this is cheating. And poor Jun had no character development. Seeing him be helpless and useless in the last episode did not sit well with me. I can understand that the first season was all about Jun, and this second one was going to be focused more on the various dolls. But in that case, it would've been better to leave Jun out of the finale. All in all, the season is great... except the last episode. It's not terribly bad, but it does ruin it if your expectations were higher, in accordance with what was set up in the previous episodes. So, I'd recommend, but be forewarned that the ending will probably not satisfy you. the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning?

Probably corresponds to some point in the Rozen Maiden manga, not sure which, though.Story: Tr&Atilde;&curren;umend picks up an unspecified amount of time after the first season.  All the dolls are still living at Jun's house, and he's definitely better than he was, but still not going to school (though there's good reason for it ' he's playing catch-up).  Shinku is having guilt-related nightmares, and after one of these,...she and Jun end up being drawn back into the mirror in his attic (why haven't they gotten rid of that yet?!) and meeting the seventh doll, whose appearance basically means that Father wants them to get on with the Alice Game, already.This season is everything I wanted last season to be, and more.  There's not so much filler as there was before ' and when there is, it actually advances the plot! --, and there's actually an overarching plot/urgency that wasn't there last season.  And moreover, we get to see the darker tones that were only hinted at in the last season.  There are so many more standout episodes, and the writers really show their talent by making you feel for characters you might not have necessarily liked last season.However, it's not perfect.  There is a character who turns into a bad running joke for most of the series.  And it looked like it was going to resolve things up till the last minute, but in the second half of the last episode, there's a nasty plot twist that leaves things open for a third season and several mysteries in its wake.Art: I don't know why, but the colors seem richer this season.  Maybe it's because there are so many scenes where they can use certain color schemes/tones.  Either way, it looks like it did last season, but better.Music: Again, about the same as last season.  The background music has its instantly recognizable songs (some that carry over from last season, too, which is really nice).  Didn't like the OP as much as last season's (ALI Project, again), but it grew on me.  Liked the ED instantly, though, as it's done by the same group who did Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament's OP, which is one of my favorites (kukui).Length: No real issues with length, this time.  Length is the same as last season's (twelve episodes), but it definitely goes by quicker.  When there was filler, as I said before, it ended up advancing the plot, so that was good, and there was an overarching plot/urgency to drive things forward.  However, the eleventh-hour plot twist in the episode, while it leaves things open for a second season, leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, because they were this close to resolving things, and they've only bought up more mysteries.Seiyuu: I recognize Enju's seiyuu from TmoHS (Koizumi) and Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ (Asuta), and Suigin Tou's seiyuu continues to rawq (Leandra from Nishi no Yoki Majo ' Astraea Testament and Lula from Red Garden!), but no other standout roles.  Decent seiyuu all around.Dub: N/A, has not been licensed as of yet.Overall: A definite improvement on the first season, but still has its flaws.

Although I do not want to give out alot of info this series is about a young boy named jun who is locked up in his room because of cracking under pressure on entrance exams, we do not find out about that until later on in the series, so as a result he is a...hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer. Then he gets possesion of Shinku, a wind up doll in search of Alice (the perfect doll) for his creator or ""Father"" to be happy, and for that to happen she has to defeat all the other dolls known as ""Rozen Maidens"" and take there life which is called a ""Rozen Mystica"" Now as the story goes on you see the characters unique personalities and powers. I believe that this series is a great recommendation to people who are interested in mystical and almost sci-fi\'sh anime. The story was overall good and had me wondering what would happen next although I thought that the ending was a little weak because it doesn\'t explain what happened to everyone else but gives an idea.The Art in this Anime is absolutely amazing. For the most part when I watched this I felt like there was a normal feel (as in the regular japanese home and life) with a little class into it. there is detail in every background although the characters do stick out more. There is one scene I absolutely adored the art and that was when one of the Rozen Maidens (Suigin Tou) goes to her world and it is snowing with Crystals all around. I really did love that the backgrounds fit the characters nature and personalilty for the fighting scenes and the comedy scenes.now the music was great, I loved the opening for this anime so much, it was creepy and yet energetic and was so well done. I love that the ending was great too because it was classy and modern at the same time , with a fast beat but still had that classy feel. I also loved the background music for this anime. the Orchestra was great for the serious scenes and the not so serious scenes. I really did enjoy the musicNow I know in this review I talk alot about the characters but I cannot help it they were great. The way they acted was amazing to the outfits they wore. As a person who thought I\'d never watch this anime due to the fact that I am personally afraid of dolls, felt like these characters were real with every step they took. Each personality was different in there own way and that is why I fell so in love with them. I especially fell head over heels for Shinku. She may act serious at times, but there have been times I felt that she was funny and overall the most beautiful of the Rozen maidens. the costumes fit each of the personalities with different colors on everyone\'s costume, and the fact that each is very unique made my heart jump. I also loved the supporting characters too as they were very great at there personalities and expressions, plus their designs fit their personalities greatly.my overall enjoyment for this anime is splendid. The only problem I had with it was probably the design of barasusishou because the other designs of all the characters were amazing and detailed while her design felt like it did not belong, though I did enjoy this character repeating what everyone said, I did not like how she look because she stood out too much. I also as I said earlier did not really like the ending because I wanted to see what happened to the other characters in the story that got there Rozen Mystica\'s taken away, but it was an overall 9.5 out of 10 hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer.

Where the first season followed an agoraphobic boy as he learned to overcome his fears and demons in order to help those he loved, the second gives center stage to the Rozen maidens and their enigmatic Father. Where once Jun broke the Alice Game and repaired what was thought to be beyond repair, he is now swept to the side offering little more than moral support. This shift in narrative focus had potential. After all, Jun’s story arc was neatly completed by the end of the first season while the dolls were ripe for development. How long...have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun. As the show progresses, so too do the characters: Shinku struggles to deal with the consequences of the first season, the twin sisters find their intentions drifting apart, even the (mostly insufferable) comic relief character Hina-Ichigo concludes a surprisingly emotional character arc. Several new characters are introduced, such as the (completely insufferable) comic relief character Kanaria and the fabled seventh Rozen maiden, Barasuishou, as well as an inscrutable trickster rabbit and a mysterious dollmaker. Far and away, however, the breakout character is Suigintou, who develops into an equal parts sympathetic and badass anti-hero as she and some of the other maidens seek out mediums in order to attain an edge in the Game.The stakes continue to rise and a series of frustrating, yet justifiable decisions are made, investing one emotionally as the plot starts to heat up. Philosophies regarding the Game and the dolls’ involvement in it clash as characters arrive at different conclusions concerning what is right. I, for one, was rivetted to the screen by the later episodes as they steamed ahead towards their uncertain conclusion.And then episode 12 hits.I have never seen a more abortive climax than the one that waits in episode 12. The momentum the show has built collapses in just a few minutes as the ending is rewritten, live, before your very eyes! The writers make a bold statement about the futility of resisting fate and the insignificance of our main character in the grand scheme, and then change their minds 30 seconds later as one is left to weep over the corpse of the last several wasted hours. It isn’t a bitter, sweet, or bittersweet ending, it’s just junk.It is difficult to get further into this review without spoilers, so I will leave you with this: Rozen Maiden Traumend is a lot of buildup for very little payoff. There are other flaws, such as Jun’s consistent inaction in the face of major events and Kanaria’s entire existence, but these pale in comparison to the ending. If a bad ending spoils a show for you, don’t bother watching, or maybe just watch up to episode 11 and imagine your own ending under the influence of whatever drug/drugs you have on hand. have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun.

I chose to watch it, after seeing the ""desu"" memes all over the internet. The characters in this series are really enjoyable. You kind of get attached to them (which i hate when that happens because theres not that much episodes >.>) One thing i fell in love with was hina ichigos voice. (im a sucker for kawaii things like that.) I also really enjoyed how Jun went from being a shut in to falling in love with shinku. I really wish they would of ended the series better though. I hope they make a 3rd season. Withouth it ill...never know who became alice! never know who became alice!', ""STORY:I was very impressed with the story overall, I thought it was pretty unique. There were some great plot twist thrown in that took me by surprise, I was glad to see that things were not as obvious as they seemed. The story moved at a great pace and had no filler episodes.ANIMATION:The art is the same as the previous season although it seems a bit better this time around, the animation during the ending song was particularly beautiful.SOUND:I have to say I was extremely impressed with the voice acting, Mona Marshals performance as Jun was no less then outstanding, the same goes...for Mela Lee as Shinku and everyone else.The music is the same style used in season 1. It fits very well and there wasn't any song I disliked.CHARACTERS:I loved all the characters aside from the true  antagonist, they were all very interesting and I ended up rooting for most of them. I enjoyed Jun and Shinkus development the most. For me the characters are the main draw of the show.ENJOYMENT:Rozen Maiden is a truly unique show that should not be missed   I ended up enjoying the show even more then I'd hoped I would, none of the episodes were boring or unsatisfying.

I saw exactly where this one was headed early. The series reeked of a tear jerker from almost the very beginning. Right off the bat, the writers attempted to continue the character development concerning the dolls, with the intentions of establishing an emotional link with the viewer by over exploiting the dolls cute antics. This isn\'t a full blow against the series at all, because the driving force behind any work is the characters, and the viewer should feel for them. My only gripe is that because of this, the possible events were too spelled out in...light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas. The entire first half is a serious mixed bag, and can be looked at in a number of ways. At times, it can almost come off as complete filler, but there are things going on such as character and light plot development. The first seven episodes is drowned in its comedy which is hit most of the time; but those whom were used to the action scenes of the first season will be bored most of the time. Others whom enjoy the dolls very presence will be thoroughly entertained.My biggest problem with this season is that the writers try too hard to establish an emotional connection. They simply just didn\'t let the characters work and everything has to be pushed more. This will be the very first time I have an issue with character development. There was too much focus on the main dolls antics, and even their feelings to the point were Jun is almost left out completely. Adding to this, there were pacing issues as well that heavily effected the plot this time around. Even the two new characters whom were introduced weren\'t very well developed, and they felt more like cheap carbon copies.The drama in the series is also heavily over done but don\'t get me wrong here; when it\'s time for the drama to work, it does work. There are some good moments that will provide a few tears for those whom are attached to certain characters. However, at one time, a scene already achieved its desired and full effect, but would be heavily damaged due to its length. This worked against the series for me, and when someone else bit the dust it had that ""oh well"" feeling to me. The series eventually shifts to a darker side, but I think it was introduced a bit too late and simply didn\'t mesh right. Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas.

Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems', 'Rozen Maiden Traumend is the follow up to the original. Due to the lack of a proper interpretation of it\'s plot in the parent series of Rozen Maiden, for that reason I started watching this second season(also for more Suigintou) and since the first wasn\'t too bad, there\'s still hopes for development in this sequel.Traumend starts off from where the first series stopped; after the victorious battle with Suigintou, Shinku starts to feel the guilt of eliminating one of her sisters, all because of the Alice Game. In fact, Shinku simply made her into a ""piece of junk"". Is it wrong to feel sad for...an enemy you\'ve just defeated?Anyway, after completing Traumend, it\'s an improvement(but not massively) on the series, if you compare it to the original. Focusing more into the story, providing adequate explanation and reducing the number of trivial episodes. The story can be quite unpredictable sometimes; just when I thought THAT ""Father"" was the REAL ""Father"", turns that he isn\'t. There\'s also a considerable amount of drama with some fighting sequences and comedy going on. Final episode was more intense and better than in the original. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the results of the Alice Game.Why climb when you can fly? - the characters\' actions can be amusing. So, these dolls have the ability to fly(depends on the location or perhaps their mood). When I noticed that few of the them were ""climbing their way out of danger"", only for the enemy to catch up with them because she simply flew. You can sit there, relax and be amused by some their actions.Episodes 3, 5 and 7 are mostly just filler episodes, haphazardly placing keypoints of it\'s story that only lasts few minutes(sometimes mere seconds) and most of time, near the end. But hey, they\'re fairly watchable. It does focus on the story from time to time but at least 1/3 of the anime consist of very, slice-of-life-ish episodes. Like the original, pacing is slow as a snail.Traumend also introduces new characters and most of them play a major role in the story. First thing\'s first, Traumend has a new antagonist, the seventh and youngest Rozen Maiden doll, Barasuishou. Nevertheless, even with the new bunch of people, Suigintou remains as my number one character in the entire series and will always be.Comparing the original and Traumend and there\'s no enhancement on visuals.  After all, Traumend retains the whole same old visuals; colors are dull; not bright but Rozen Maiden dolls still look beautiful as ever, just like in the first. The visuals are sometimes inconsistent - characters faces differ from scene to scene. Just the same old, same old.ALI PROJECT performs the OP for this one too. Sadly, the majority of her songs including this is just not for me. Listened to the ED, and it was  actually quite good. But it gets old pretty quickly. BGM ranges from rock music(sadly the epic rock music is very rarely played) to same orchestral music pieces back in the original.To sum up, there\'s improvement in the overall storytelling, but even with that, I still wouldn\'t recommend it to everyone. After watching both seasons in the franchise, I must say that this is more recommended to the casual viewers. In any case, this is one series you have to see for yourself.

Less boring casual fillers (and empty space at all - first season was very, very emty, so that it could be cut to 8-9 episode without any harm to the plot). More reflection and philosophy (we even see them talk about God on the example of Master Rozen). Briefly, the story of Traumend is just smarter. Although, the illnesses of past times did not vanish utterly, and some episodes are still rather sleepy. And in plot there appear time after time illogical or rude lines that freak me out and spoil the enjoyment greatly.Art...- 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands. Rozen Maiden style remained stable and good.Sound - 9What is undoubtedly perfect in Rozen Maiden series is its breathtaking soundtrack. Piano and violon plays suit lolita-fashion so well that any action is exciting with this music playing. Opening is not great but alright, ending is dull, but at least you may skip it. What really doesn\'t let 10 to be set is the invariability. OST melodies are not to criticize but they are less, and after 20+ episodes of non-stop watching they don\'t please one\'s ears as much as in the beginning.Character - 9Rozen Maiden dolls are the collection. The collection of faces, haircuts, dresses, and psychological types. Of course, it should not be considered as serious ""panorama of social types"" or some that way. But this variety helps the comedy action a lot. Besides, some characters\' personalities are not as primitive as in season 1 (Suigintou, for example, turned in flesh-and-blood girl (if it can be said this way of talking doll) from Ominous-Villain-Demon-With-Non-Stopping-Nasty-Laugh), Shinku kicks Jun no more (annoyed me a lot) and, in general, became the most ample character in anime (she is principal char so that is natural, but I couldn\'t see it clearly before). All Maidens became more amiable and cute, I love them all after this season. And it\'s not because of their lowened agressiveness... they just got more alive.Enjoyment - 8,5Greatly spoiled by shortcomings of story, it is still high... I can make a conclusion in five words: I Would Rewatch This Anime.Overall - 8,5Rozen Maiden is original and outstanding yet using classical comedy-drama-system, and this is anime for everyone (no nudity, no violence, no profanity, purely platonic love storyline), so it is undoubtedly worth watching. It may please more or less depending on what to pay attention to most in general picture, but I think there are less people who watched RM and considered it a class-B shounen anime or so.I Would Rewatch This Anime.Would You Join Me? - 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands.

We have Jun not afraid to go outside anymore, and is actually trying to get into school again. There isn’t much development in the dolls but I guess that’s to be expected slightly. I have a small feeling that their artificial spirits are made to have a certain personality. I’m going to talk more about my theory later on in this review about that. We don’t really see much of the other human characters and so their personalities seem slightly the same. Jun’s sister...is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou. I have different feelings on both these new characters. Where as the fact I love Bara-Suishou as sort of a new antagonist for the dolls in light of what happen to Suigintou (Spoilers for the first series, sorry), I do not really like the addition of Kanaria. Kanaria felt like she was only there for comic relief. Her personality seemed to be similar to Suiseiseki in that she would get into trouble a lot and trying to sneak into the house. She also seemed slightly like Hinaichigo in how childish she is sometimes.With how deep the story gets, that doesn’t stop them from still doing the slice of life type of story arcs. They do end up making me annoyed slightly because there is so much story that can be given to the main idea of the Alice Game, the story behind the dolls and so on but what do we actually do get? Suiseiseki stealing Hinaichigo’s snack again, Shinku sitting reading or watching Detective Kun Kun, and Kanaria’s comedic attempts at going after the other girls. I can understand they are trying to give the characters more personality and show the personal growth of each of them but sometimes there is no growth at all. Then we are left with a kind of pointless run around with the story.Besides the slice of life stuff, the story does get a bit deep and sad. If I told you any more about that, then it would just be spoilers but there were times that tears did fall from my eyes.I said I was going to talk about my theory about the spirits. If you keep watching each of the dolls, it seems they have a bit of a collective soul. What I mean when I say this is that the personalities of each girl don’t always feel whole. Shinku is very proper; almost princess like where as Hinaichigo is very childish. Suiseiseki is a very mischievous girl who likes to tease others while her ‘twin’ sister Souseiseki is a bit more tomboyish. Suigintou is jealousy, and Kanaria is… I’m not fully sure but I think her personality is a bit of the sneaky planner. Sort of the personality of a girl who will sneak around someone to get what she wants or two get back at someone. If you look at all these dolls as personalities, it would seem that if all of them were put together, they would be the perfect being, the perfect ‘Alice.’ My theory of them and of the game they play is the idea that Rozen, their father, wanted to make the perfect daughter he named Alice and that the dolls must collect each part of Alice’s soul in order to become her. I do have another theory though, a back up theory if you want to take it as such… one that might be a very surprising turn of advents if this actually were to be true. My theory is that there is actually no real Alice Game. That the Alice Game was made up by someone to explain why they were ‘abandoned’ by their father. Their spirits though are pieces of their father’s daughter Alice who died at some point in time. In order to save her spirit, he placed parts of it into the dolls. It’s a large grasp at straws here but it’s another idea that I have from watching this series.The artwork is very beautiful when it wants to be and then it can also feel like they didn’t try. It’s much the same as the first series in both aspects. I still get the feeling that there are two different art styles from slice of life to occult in one show. The dolls are still rather detailed when not making funny faces or in a really comedic scene while the human characters feel a little lack luster. I am not sold on the face of Shirosaki, the salesperson at the doll shop in the show. I understand who he is from the moment I saw him (Not spoiling it though) but his face does not look like a humans. In fact, I really thought he might have been a doll himself with the way his eyes were and how his face was. It just looked way to flat and white to be real.The music is something I forgot to talk about in my review before that I will touch here. Both the first and this one have amazing music, most of it orchestra related. My favorite pieces are when the dolls are in some serious mode. That’s when the beautiful and yet haunting melody seems to come out that sounds slightly like a music box. I can’t help but get chills up my spine hearing that beautiful haunting melody. The English dub is basically the same so what I said before goes for this. I’m still not to keen on Hinaichigo’s or Suiseiseki’s voices much. Again, Hinaichigo’s high pitched childish whine is annoying and I really don’t understand why Suiseiseki’s voice has to be that high as well. They did grow on me more though since the first series which I guess works out. As for the newcomer, Kanaria is about as annoying as Hinaichigo’s voice. It’s high pitched and the way she talks reminds me of Naga the Serpent from Slayers. It’s that snarky little announcing voice that will say everything she is thinking no matter what. She hasn’t really had a chance to grow on me as much as the other characters though and maybe that’s why I can’t stand her right now.The story was actually really done and I liked how they dove more into the Alice Game and the story behind it but again they left more questions then answers. They had a very open ended ending that makes me wonder exactly what they mean by it. I still love the story and can’t wait to watch the rest of the seasons. is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou.

There really isn\'t a single character that I hated. Even the ""bad guy"" had my sympathy.This is a very good anime for anybody who appreciates dolls.

In the first season it was established that Jun had some special magical ability to ""bring back what was lost"" as demonstrated with the clown doll and with fixing Shinku\'s arm during her battle with Suigintou. The ending would have worked a lot better if this power was built upon / explained and then he used that power to restore all of the dolls after he found out they had been tricked - including Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki, instead of having a Deus Ex Machina moment with the...appearance of Rozen.And for some absolutely pointless reason, Rozen decides to leave Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki dead, again just to create cheap sadness with no logic. There is no reason Rozen or Jun should not be able to restore all of them.This ending is a huge disappointment because I really loved the unique concept of this show and the characters were very special, as I felt a real connection with all of them.

I like that certain obvious questions we had about the nature of the dolls was answered in a sensitive and fulfilling way (trying to be vague here to avoid spoilers!).What I don't like is the end. It was rushed and unfulfilling. It really felt like the writers had written themselves into a...corner and had to find a way to keep the action going until the end without leaving us on a sad note. I will chalk this up to trying to appeal to much to the action side of the anime (which was ALWAYS an afterthought). Unfortunately, the way in which they chose to do this robbed the most important characters of agency. And seeing these characters exercise that agency is what makes Rozen Maiden great in the first place (apropos that it is a franchise about ostensibly inanimate objects with animacy!).Nevertheless, the characters were treated with such respect and their personalities depicted well that I can forgive the very end of the story.

In my review of the first season I mentioned how the narrative is centered on the theme of ""trauma,"" but this does not seem to be the case for this sequel, which more deeply explores the conflicts of the story, although it does leaves many things open-ended, especially one of the major questions of the series, ""what does it mean to be Alice?"", so it is not conclusive for the series.One of the things...that is noticeable from the beginning is how the dolls and their personalities have more focus and are developed to make us more attach to them before they meet their tragic(quite tragic) ends. This is well done with all the dolls, but especially those who have benefited most from it are Shinzu, who needed motivation for her character, and Suigintou, who received such a good story that if nothing else, it\'s worth watching this anime just for her.In technical terms, this season has better animation and a better soundtrack. The piano in the background songs manages to convey the perfect tone for each scene, not to mention the opening played by Ali Project, which is always a pleasure to listen to.Not everything is perfect, though. The anime is very focused on the characters of the dolls, but the other characters are not explored much. The protagonist of the first season is sidelined, the protagonist\'s sister is super sidelined, and the new character, Laplace\'s Demon, is completely only used as a plot device.But in the end, this anime is a great continuation of the first one, with more comedy, action, and drama.

Trust me, you'll be lost.While Rozen Maiden was more about evolving characters, Traumend makes the jump right into action and keeps things moving at a fast pace throughout. There are still some fights between the dolls, however, it is more related to drama and action rather than...comedy.The new character Kanaria gives some laughs and eventually wears on the audience. But, Traumend is a bit darker than its predecessor and the dolls have to go through some hard times. There are even sacrifices, broken dolls and deaths.The darker tone suits well for character development and we see important changes in the main characters. The ending was somewhat surprising, but perhaps some would mention that it lacked something – turned out as a bit of a cop-out. Nevertheless, it is a satisfying end to the series.Traumend, overall a highly recommendable watch for fans of Rozen Maiden.

It was gearing up to be, in my opinion, better than the first season. However, the last episode left much to be desired. It's as if the writers did not know how to properly resolve all the conflicts, or perhaps they were confident in getting a third season and figured they would resolve them then. Sadly, this second season is the end for this version of RM. For this reason, I am left with many, many unanswered questions. For instance, why didn't Father tell...the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning? During the whole season, Father is made to look like a tyrant who wishes to see his creations fight to the death in order for his ideal doll to come to life. That is fine; I agree he is a bad man. But then at the end Father comes to the rescue?! And suddenly the fights are not necessary? Who was the Rabbit? What was his purpose and why does he get to possess Rosa Mysticas? I feel like this is cheating. And poor Jun had no character development. Seeing him be helpless and useless in the last episode did not sit well with me. I can understand that the first season was all about Jun, and this second one was going to be focused more on the various dolls. But in that case, it would've been better to leave Jun out of the finale. All in all, the season is great... except the last episode. It's not terribly bad, but it does ruin it if your expectations were higher, in accordance with what was set up in the previous episodes. So, I'd recommend, but be forewarned that the ending will probably not satisfy you. the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning?

Probably corresponds to some point in the Rozen Maiden manga, not sure which, though.Story: Tr&Atilde;&curren;umend picks up an unspecified amount of time after the first season.  All the dolls are still living at Jun's house, and he's definitely better than he was, but still not going to school (though there's good reason for it ' he's playing catch-up).  Shinku is having guilt-related nightmares, and after one of these,...she and Jun end up being drawn back into the mirror in his attic (why haven't they gotten rid of that yet?!) and meeting the seventh doll, whose appearance basically means that Father wants them to get on with the Alice Game, already.This season is everything I wanted last season to be, and more.  There's not so much filler as there was before ' and when there is, it actually advances the plot! --, and there's actually an overarching plot/urgency that wasn't there last season.  And moreover, we get to see the darker tones that were only hinted at in the last season.  There are so many more standout episodes, and the writers really show their talent by making you feel for characters you might not have necessarily liked last season.However, it's not perfect.  There is a character who turns into a bad running joke for most of the series.  And it looked like it was going to resolve things up till the last minute, but in the second half of the last episode, there's a nasty plot twist that leaves things open for a third season and several mysteries in its wake.Art: I don't know why, but the colors seem richer this season.  Maybe it's because there are so many scenes where they can use certain color schemes/tones.  Either way, it looks like it did last season, but better.Music: Again, about the same as last season.  The background music has its instantly recognizable songs (some that carry over from last season, too, which is really nice).  Didn't like the OP as much as last season's (ALI Project, again), but it grew on me.  Liked the ED instantly, though, as it's done by the same group who did Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament's OP, which is one of my favorites (kukui).Length: No real issues with length, this time.  Length is the same as last season's (twelve episodes), but it definitely goes by quicker.  When there was filler, as I said before, it ended up advancing the plot, so that was good, and there was an overarching plot/urgency to drive things forward.  However, the eleventh-hour plot twist in the episode, while it leaves things open for a second season, leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, because they were this close to resolving things, and they've only bought up more mysteries.Seiyuu: I recognize Enju's seiyuu from TmoHS (Koizumi) and Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ (Asuta), and Suigin Tou's seiyuu continues to rawq (Leandra from Nishi no Yoki Majo ' Astraea Testament and Lula from Red Garden!), but no other standout roles.  Decent seiyuu all around.Dub: N/A, has not been licensed as of yet.Overall: A definite improvement on the first season, but still has its flaws.

Although I do not want to give out alot of info this series is about a young boy named jun who is locked up in his room because of cracking under pressure on entrance exams, we do not find out about that until later on in the series, so as a result he is a...hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer. Then he gets possesion of Shinku, a wind up doll in search of Alice (the perfect doll) for his creator or ""Father"" to be happy, and for that to happen she has to defeat all the other dolls known as ""Rozen Maidens"" and take there life which is called a ""Rozen Mystica"" Now as the story goes on you see the characters unique personalities and powers. I believe that this series is a great recommendation to people who are interested in mystical and almost sci-fi\'sh anime. The story was overall good and had me wondering what would happen next although I thought that the ending was a little weak because it doesn\'t explain what happened to everyone else but gives an idea.The Art in this Anime is absolutely amazing. For the most part when I watched this I felt like there was a normal feel (as in the regular japanese home and life) with a little class into it. there is detail in every background although the characters do stick out more. There is one scene I absolutely adored the art and that was when one of the Rozen Maidens (Suigin Tou) goes to her world and it is snowing with Crystals all around. I really did love that the backgrounds fit the characters nature and personalilty for the fighting scenes and the comedy scenes.now the music was great, I loved the opening for this anime so much, it was creepy and yet energetic and was so well done. I love that the ending was great too because it was classy and modern at the same time , with a fast beat but still had that classy feel. I also loved the background music for this anime. the Orchestra was great for the serious scenes and the not so serious scenes. I really did enjoy the musicNow I know in this review I talk alot about the characters but I cannot help it they were great. The way they acted was amazing to the outfits they wore. As a person who thought I\'d never watch this anime due to the fact that I am personally afraid of dolls, felt like these characters were real with every step they took. Each personality was different in there own way and that is why I fell so in love with them. I especially fell head over heels for Shinku. She may act serious at times, but there have been times I felt that she was funny and overall the most beautiful of the Rozen maidens. the costumes fit each of the personalities with different colors on everyone\'s costume, and the fact that each is very unique made my heart jump. I also loved the supporting characters too as they were very great at there personalities and expressions, plus their designs fit their personalities greatly.my overall enjoyment for this anime is splendid. The only problem I had with it was probably the design of barasusishou because the other designs of all the characters were amazing and detailed while her design felt like it did not belong, though I did enjoy this character repeating what everyone said, I did not like how she look because she stood out too much. I also as I said earlier did not really like the ending because I wanted to see what happened to the other characters in the story that got there Rozen Mystica\'s taken away, but it was an overall 9.5 out of 10 hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer.

Where the first season followed an agoraphobic boy as he learned to overcome his fears and demons in order to help those he loved, the second gives center stage to the Rozen maidens and their enigmatic Father. Where once Jun broke the Alice Game and repaired what was thought to be beyond repair, he is now swept to the side offering little more than moral support. This shift in narrative focus had potential. After all, Jun’s story arc was neatly completed by the end of the first season while the dolls were ripe for development. How long...have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun. As the show progresses, so too do the characters: Shinku struggles to deal with the consequences of the first season, the twin sisters find their intentions drifting apart, even the (mostly insufferable) comic relief character Hina-Ichigo concludes a surprisingly emotional character arc. Several new characters are introduced, such as the (completely insufferable) comic relief character Kanaria and the fabled seventh Rozen maiden, Barasuishou, as well as an inscrutable trickster rabbit and a mysterious dollmaker. Far and away, however, the breakout character is Suigintou, who develops into an equal parts sympathetic and badass anti-hero as she and some of the other maidens seek out mediums in order to attain an edge in the Game.The stakes continue to rise and a series of frustrating, yet justifiable decisions are made, investing one emotionally as the plot starts to heat up. Philosophies regarding the Game and the dolls’ involvement in it clash as characters arrive at different conclusions concerning what is right. I, for one, was rivetted to the screen by the later episodes as they steamed ahead towards their uncertain conclusion.And then episode 12 hits.I have never seen a more abortive climax than the one that waits in episode 12. The momentum the show has built collapses in just a few minutes as the ending is rewritten, live, before your very eyes! The writers make a bold statement about the futility of resisting fate and the insignificance of our main character in the grand scheme, and then change their minds 30 seconds later as one is left to weep over the corpse of the last several wasted hours. It isn’t a bitter, sweet, or bittersweet ending, it’s just junk.It is difficult to get further into this review without spoilers, so I will leave you with this: Rozen Maiden Traumend is a lot of buildup for very little payoff. There are other flaws, such as Jun’s consistent inaction in the face of major events and Kanaria’s entire existence, but these pale in comparison to the ending. If a bad ending spoils a show for you, don’t bother watching, or maybe just watch up to episode 11 and imagine your own ending under the influence of whatever drug/drugs you have on hand. have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun.

I chose to watch it, after seeing the ""desu"" memes all over the internet. The characters in this series are really enjoyable. You kind of get attached to them (which i hate when that happens because theres not that much episodes >.>) One thing i fell in love with was hina ichigos voice. (im a sucker for kawaii things like that.) I also really enjoyed how Jun went from being a shut in to falling in love with shinku. I really wish they would of ended the series better though. I hope they make a 3rd season. Withouth it ill...never know who became alice! never know who became alice!', ""STORY:I was very impressed with the story overall, I thought it was pretty unique. There were some great plot twist thrown in that took me by surprise, I was glad to see that things were not as obvious as they seemed. The story moved at a great pace and had no filler episodes.ANIMATION:The art is the same as the previous season although it seems a bit better this time around, the animation during the ending song was particularly beautiful.SOUND:I have to say I was extremely impressed with the voice acting, Mona Marshals performance as Jun was no less then outstanding, the same goes...for Mela Lee as Shinku and everyone else.The music is the same style used in season 1. It fits very well and there wasn't any song I disliked.CHARACTERS:I loved all the characters aside from the true  antagonist, they were all very interesting and I ended up rooting for most of them. I enjoyed Jun and Shinkus development the most. For me the characters are the main draw of the show.ENJOYMENT:Rozen Maiden is a truly unique show that should not be missed   I ended up enjoying the show even more then I'd hoped I would, none of the episodes were boring or unsatisfying.

I saw exactly where this one was headed early. The series reeked of a tear jerker from almost the very beginning. Right off the bat, the writers attempted to continue the character development concerning the dolls, with the intentions of establishing an emotional link with the viewer by over exploiting the dolls cute antics. This isn\'t a full blow against the series at all, because the driving force behind any work is the characters, and the viewer should feel for them. My only gripe is that because of this, the possible events were too spelled out in...light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas. The entire first half is a serious mixed bag, and can be looked at in a number of ways. At times, it can almost come off as complete filler, but there are things going on such as character and light plot development. The first seven episodes is drowned in its comedy which is hit most of the time; but those whom were used to the action scenes of the first season will be bored most of the time. Others whom enjoy the dolls very presence will be thoroughly entertained.My biggest problem with this season is that the writers try too hard to establish an emotional connection. They simply just didn\'t let the characters work and everything has to be pushed more. This will be the very first time I have an issue with character development. There was too much focus on the main dolls antics, and even their feelings to the point were Jun is almost left out completely. Adding to this, there were pacing issues as well that heavily effected the plot this time around. Even the two new characters whom were introduced weren\'t very well developed, and they felt more like cheap carbon copies.The drama in the series is also heavily over done but don\'t get me wrong here; when it\'s time for the drama to work, it does work. There are some good moments that will provide a few tears for those whom are attached to certain characters. However, at one time, a scene already achieved its desired and full effect, but would be heavily damaged due to its length. This worked against the series for me, and when someone else bit the dust it had that ""oh well"" feeling to me. The series eventually shifts to a darker side, but I think it was introduced a bit too late and simply didn\'t mesh right. Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas.

Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems', 'Rozen Maiden Traumend is the follow up to the original. Due to the lack of a proper interpretation of it\'s plot in the parent series of Rozen Maiden, for that reason I started watching this second season(also for more Suigintou) and since the first wasn\'t too bad, there\'s still hopes for development in this sequel.Traumend starts off from where the first series stopped; after the victorious battle with Suigintou, Shinku starts to feel the guilt of eliminating one of her sisters, all because of the Alice Game. In fact, Shinku simply made her into a ""piece of junk"". Is it wrong to feel sad for...an enemy you\'ve just defeated?Anyway, after completing Traumend, it\'s an improvement(but not massively) on the series, if you compare it to the original. Focusing more into the story, providing adequate explanation and reducing the number of trivial episodes. The story can be quite unpredictable sometimes; just when I thought THAT ""Father"" was the REAL ""Father"", turns that he isn\'t. There\'s also a considerable amount of drama with some fighting sequences and comedy going on. Final episode was more intense and better than in the original. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the results of the Alice Game.Why climb when you can fly? - the characters\' actions can be amusing. So, these dolls have the ability to fly(depends on the location or perhaps their mood). When I noticed that few of the them were ""climbing their way out of danger"", only for the enemy to catch up with them because she simply flew. You can sit there, relax and be amused by some their actions.Episodes 3, 5 and 7 are mostly just filler episodes, haphazardly placing keypoints of it\'s story that only lasts few minutes(sometimes mere seconds) and most of time, near the end. But hey, they\'re fairly watchable. It does focus on the story from time to time but at least 1/3 of the anime consist of very, slice-of-life-ish episodes. Like the original, pacing is slow as a snail.Traumend also introduces new characters and most of them play a major role in the story. First thing\'s first, Traumend has a new antagonist, the seventh and youngest Rozen Maiden doll, Barasuishou. Nevertheless, even with the new bunch of people, Suigintou remains as my number one character in the entire series and will always be.Comparing the original and Traumend and there\'s no enhancement on visuals.  After all, Traumend retains the whole same old visuals; colors are dull; not bright but Rozen Maiden dolls still look beautiful as ever, just like in the first. The visuals are sometimes inconsistent - characters faces differ from scene to scene. Just the same old, same old.ALI PROJECT performs the OP for this one too. Sadly, the majority of her songs including this is just not for me. Listened to the ED, and it was  actually quite good. But it gets old pretty quickly. BGM ranges from rock music(sadly the epic rock music is very rarely played) to same orchestral music pieces back in the original.To sum up, there\'s improvement in the overall storytelling, but even with that, I still wouldn\'t recommend it to everyone. After watching both seasons in the franchise, I must say that this is more recommended to the casual viewers. In any case, this is one series you have to see for yourself.

Less boring casual fillers (and empty space at all - first season was very, very emty, so that it could be cut to 8-9 episode without any harm to the plot). More reflection and philosophy (we even see them talk about God on the example of Master Rozen). Briefly, the story of Traumend is just smarter. Although, the illnesses of past times did not vanish utterly, and some episodes are still rather sleepy. And in plot there appear time after time illogical or rude lines that freak me out and spoil the enjoyment greatly.Art...- 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands. Rozen Maiden style remained stable and good.Sound - 9What is undoubtedly perfect in Rozen Maiden series is its breathtaking soundtrack. Piano and violon plays suit lolita-fashion so well that any action is exciting with this music playing. Opening is not great but alright, ending is dull, but at least you may skip it. What really doesn\'t let 10 to be set is the invariability. OST melodies are not to criticize but they are less, and after 20+ episodes of non-stop watching they don\'t please one\'s ears as much as in the beginning.Character - 9Rozen Maiden dolls are the collection. The collection of faces, haircuts, dresses, and psychological types. Of course, it should not be considered as serious ""panorama of social types"" or some that way. But this variety helps the comedy action a lot. Besides, some characters\' personalities are not as primitive as in season 1 (Suigintou, for example, turned in flesh-and-blood girl (if it can be said this way of talking doll) from Ominous-Villain-Demon-With-Non-Stopping-Nasty-Laugh), Shinku kicks Jun no more (annoyed me a lot) and, in general, became the most ample character in anime (she is principal char so that is natural, but I couldn\'t see it clearly before). All Maidens became more amiable and cute, I love them all after this season. And it\'s not because of their lowened agressiveness... they just got more alive.Enjoyment - 8,5Greatly spoiled by shortcomings of story, it is still high... I can make a conclusion in five words: I Would Rewatch This Anime.Overall - 8,5Rozen Maiden is original and outstanding yet using classical comedy-drama-system, and this is anime for everyone (no nudity, no violence, no profanity, purely platonic love storyline), so it is undoubtedly worth watching. It may please more or less depending on what to pay attention to most in general picture, but I think there are less people who watched RM and considered it a class-B shounen anime or so.I Would Rewatch This Anime.Would You Join Me? - 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands.

We have Jun not afraid to go outside anymore, and is actually trying to get into school again. There isn’t much development in the dolls but I guess that’s to be expected slightly. I have a small feeling that their artificial spirits are made to have a certain personality. I’m going to talk more about my theory later on in this review about that. We don’t really see much of the other human characters and so their personalities seem slightly the same. Jun’s sister...is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou. I have different feelings on both these new characters. Where as the fact I love Bara-Suishou as sort of a new antagonist for the dolls in light of what happen to Suigintou (Spoilers for the first series, sorry), I do not really like the addition of Kanaria. Kanaria felt like she was only there for comic relief. Her personality seemed to be similar to Suiseiseki in that she would get into trouble a lot and trying to sneak into the house. She also seemed slightly like Hinaichigo in how childish she is sometimes.With how deep the story gets, that doesn’t stop them from still doing the slice of life type of story arcs. They do end up making me annoyed slightly because there is so much story that can be given to the main idea of the Alice Game, the story behind the dolls and so on but what do we actually do get? Suiseiseki stealing Hinaichigo’s snack again, Shinku sitting reading or watching Detective Kun Kun, and Kanaria’s comedic attempts at going after the other girls. I can understand they are trying to give the characters more personality and show the personal growth of each of them but sometimes there is no growth at all. Then we are left with a kind of pointless run around with the story.Besides the slice of life stuff, the story does get a bit deep and sad. If I told you any more about that, then it would just be spoilers but there were times that tears did fall from my eyes.I said I was going to talk about my theory about the spirits. If you keep watching each of the dolls, it seems they have a bit of a collective soul. What I mean when I say this is that the personalities of each girl don’t always feel whole. Shinku is very proper; almost princess like where as Hinaichigo is very childish. Suiseiseki is a very mischievous girl who likes to tease others while her ‘twin’ sister Souseiseki is a bit more tomboyish. Suigintou is jealousy, and Kanaria is… I’m not fully sure but I think her personality is a bit of the sneaky planner. Sort of the personality of a girl who will sneak around someone to get what she wants or two get back at someone. If you look at all these dolls as personalities, it would seem that if all of them were put together, they would be the perfect being, the perfect ‘Alice.’ My theory of them and of the game they play is the idea that Rozen, their father, wanted to make the perfect daughter he named Alice and that the dolls must collect each part of Alice’s soul in order to become her. I do have another theory though, a back up theory if you want to take it as such… one that might be a very surprising turn of advents if this actually were to be true. My theory is that there is actually no real Alice Game. That the Alice Game was made up by someone to explain why they were ‘abandoned’ by their father. Their spirits though are pieces of their father’s daughter Alice who died at some point in time. In order to save her spirit, he placed parts of it into the dolls. It’s a large grasp at straws here but it’s another idea that I have from watching this series.The artwork is very beautiful when it wants to be and then it can also feel like they didn’t try. It’s much the same as the first series in both aspects. I still get the feeling that there are two different art styles from slice of life to occult in one show. The dolls are still rather detailed when not making funny faces or in a really comedic scene while the human characters feel a little lack luster. I am not sold on the face of Shirosaki, the salesperson at the doll shop in the show. I understand who he is from the moment I saw him (Not spoiling it though) but his face does not look like a humans. In fact, I really thought he might have been a doll himself with the way his eyes were and how his face was. It just looked way to flat and white to be real.The music is something I forgot to talk about in my review before that I will touch here. Both the first and this one have amazing music, most of it orchestra related. My favorite pieces are when the dolls are in some serious mode. That’s when the beautiful and yet haunting melody seems to come out that sounds slightly like a music box. I can’t help but get chills up my spine hearing that beautiful haunting melody. The English dub is basically the same so what I said before goes for this. I’m still not to keen on Hinaichigo’s or Suiseiseki’s voices much. Again, Hinaichigo’s high pitched childish whine is annoying and I really don’t understand why Suiseiseki’s voice has to be that high as well. They did grow on me more though since the first series which I guess works out. As for the newcomer, Kanaria is about as annoying as Hinaichigo’s voice. It’s high pitched and the way she talks reminds me of Naga the Serpent from Slayers. It’s that snarky little announcing voice that will say everything she is thinking no matter what. She hasn’t really had a chance to grow on me as much as the other characters though and maybe that’s why I can’t stand her right now.The story was actually really done and I liked how they dove more into the Alice Game and the story behind it but again they left more questions then answers. They had a very open ended ending that makes me wonder exactly what they mean by it. I still love the story and can’t wait to watch the rest of the seasons. is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou.

There really isn\'t a single character that I hated. Even the ""bad guy"" had my sympathy.This is a very good anime for anybody who appreciates dolls.

In the first season it was established that Jun had some special magical ability to ""bring back what was lost"" as demonstrated with the clown doll and with fixing Shinku\'s arm during her battle with Suigintou. The ending would have worked a lot better if this power was built upon / explained and then he used that power to restore all of the dolls after he found out they had been tricked - including Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki, instead of having a Deus Ex Machina moment with the...appearance of Rozen.And for some absolutely pointless reason, Rozen decides to leave Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki dead, again just to create cheap sadness with no logic. There is no reason Rozen or Jun should not be able to restore all of them.This ending is a huge disappointment because I really loved the unique concept of this show and the characters were very special, as I felt a real connection with all of them.

I like that certain obvious questions we had about the nature of the dolls was answered in a sensitive and fulfilling way (trying to be vague here to avoid spoilers!).What I don't like is the end. It was rushed and unfulfilling. It really felt like the writers had written themselves into a...corner and had to find a way to keep the action going until the end without leaving us on a sad note. I will chalk this up to trying to appeal to much to the action side of the anime (which was ALWAYS an afterthought). Unfortunately, the way in which they chose to do this robbed the most important characters of agency. And seeing these characters exercise that agency is what makes Rozen Maiden great in the first place (apropos that it is a franchise about ostensibly inanimate objects with animacy!).Nevertheless, the characters were treated with such respect and their personalities depicted well that I can forgive the very end of the story.

In my review of the first season I mentioned how the narrative is centered on the theme of ""trauma,"" but this does not seem to be the case for this sequel, which more deeply explores the conflicts of the story, although it does leaves many things open-ended, especially one of the major questions of the series, ""what does it mean to be Alice?"", so it is not conclusive for the series.One of the things...that is noticeable from the beginning is how the dolls and their personalities have more focus and are developed to make us more attach to them before they meet their tragic(quite tragic) ends. This is well done with all the dolls, but especially those who have benefited most from it are Shinzu, who needed motivation for her character, and Suigintou, who received such a good story that if nothing else, it\'s worth watching this anime just for her.In technical terms, this season has better animation and a better soundtrack. The piano in the background songs manages to convey the perfect tone for each scene, not to mention the opening played by Ali Project, which is always a pleasure to listen to.Not everything is perfect, though. The anime is very focused on the characters of the dolls, but the other characters are not explored much. The protagonist of the first season is sidelined, the protagonist\'s sister is super sidelined, and the new character, Laplace\'s Demon, is completely only used as a plot device.But in the end, this anime is a great continuation of the first one, with more comedy, action, and drama.

Trust me, you'll be lost.While Rozen Maiden was more about evolving characters, Traumend makes the jump right into action and keeps things moving at a fast pace throughout. There are still some fights between the dolls, however, it is more related to drama and action rather than...comedy.The new character Kanaria gives some laughs and eventually wears on the audience. But, Traumend is a bit darker than its predecessor and the dolls have to go through some hard times. There are even sacrifices, broken dolls and deaths.The darker tone suits well for character development and we see important changes in the main characters. The ending was somewhat surprising, but perhaps some would mention that it lacked something – turned out as a bit of a cop-out. Nevertheless, it is a satisfying end to the series.Traumend, overall a highly recommendable watch for fans of Rozen Maiden.

It was gearing up to be, in my opinion, better than the first season. However, the last episode left much to be desired. It's as if the writers did not know how to properly resolve all the conflicts, or perhaps they were confident in getting a third season and figured they would resolve them then. Sadly, this second season is the end for this version of RM. For this reason, I am left with many, many unanswered questions. For instance, why didn't Father tell...the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning? During the whole season, Father is made to look like a tyrant who wishes to see his creations fight to the death in order for his ideal doll to come to life. That is fine; I agree he is a bad man. But then at the end Father comes to the rescue?! And suddenly the fights are not necessary? Who was the Rabbit? What was his purpose and why does he get to possess Rosa Mysticas? I feel like this is cheating. And poor Jun had no character development. Seeing him be helpless and useless in the last episode did not sit well with me. I can understand that the first season was all about Jun, and this second one was going to be focused more on the various dolls. But in that case, it would've been better to leave Jun out of the finale. All in all, the season is great... except the last episode. It's not terribly bad, but it does ruin it if your expectations were higher, in accordance with what was set up in the previous episodes. So, I'd recommend, but be forewarned that the ending will probably not satisfy you. the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning?

Probably corresponds to some point in the Rozen Maiden manga, not sure which, though.Story: Tr&Atilde;&curren;umend picks up an unspecified amount of time after the first season.  All the dolls are still living at Jun's house, and he's definitely better than he was, but still not going to school (though there's good reason for it ' he's playing catch-up).  Shinku is having guilt-related nightmares, and after one of these,...she and Jun end up being drawn back into the mirror in his attic (why haven't they gotten rid of that yet?!) and meeting the seventh doll, whose appearance basically means that Father wants them to get on with the Alice Game, already.This season is everything I wanted last season to be, and more.  There's not so much filler as there was before ' and when there is, it actually advances the plot! --, and there's actually an overarching plot/urgency that wasn't there last season.  And moreover, we get to see the darker tones that were only hinted at in the last season.  There are so many more standout episodes, and the writers really show their talent by making you feel for characters you might not have necessarily liked last season.However, it's not perfect.  There is a character who turns into a bad running joke for most of the series.  And it looked like it was going to resolve things up till the last minute, but in the second half of the last episode, there's a nasty plot twist that leaves things open for a third season and several mysteries in its wake.Art: I don't know why, but the colors seem richer this season.  Maybe it's because there are so many scenes where they can use certain color schemes/tones.  Either way, it looks like it did last season, but better.Music: Again, about the same as last season.  The background music has its instantly recognizable songs (some that carry over from last season, too, which is really nice).  Didn't like the OP as much as last season's (ALI Project, again), but it grew on me.  Liked the ED instantly, though, as it's done by the same group who did Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament's OP, which is one of my favorites (kukui).Length: No real issues with length, this time.  Length is the same as last season's (twelve episodes), but it definitely goes by quicker.  When there was filler, as I said before, it ended up advancing the plot, so that was good, and there was an overarching plot/urgency to drive things forward.  However, the eleventh-hour plot twist in the episode, while it leaves things open for a second season, leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, because they were this close to resolving things, and they've only bought up more mysteries.Seiyuu: I recognize Enju's seiyuu from TmoHS (Koizumi) and Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ (Asuta), and Suigin Tou's seiyuu continues to rawq (Leandra from Nishi no Yoki Majo ' Astraea Testament and Lula from Red Garden!), but no other standout roles.  Decent seiyuu all around.Dub: N/A, has not been licensed as of yet.Overall: A definite improvement on the first season, but still has its flaws.

Although I do not want to give out alot of info this series is about a young boy named jun who is locked up in his room because of cracking under pressure on entrance exams, we do not find out about that until later on in the series, so as a result he is a...hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer. Then he gets possesion of Shinku, a wind up doll in search of Alice (the perfect doll) for his creator or ""Father"" to be happy, and for that to happen she has to defeat all the other dolls known as ""Rozen Maidens"" and take there life which is called a ""Rozen Mystica"" Now as the story goes on you see the characters unique personalities and powers. I believe that this series is a great recommendation to people who are interested in mystical and almost sci-fi\'sh anime. The story was overall good and had me wondering what would happen next although I thought that the ending was a little weak because it doesn\'t explain what happened to everyone else but gives an idea.The Art in this Anime is absolutely amazing. For the most part when I watched this I felt like there was a normal feel (as in the regular japanese home and life) with a little class into it. there is detail in every background although the characters do stick out more. There is one scene I absolutely adored the art and that was when one of the Rozen Maidens (Suigin Tou) goes to her world and it is snowing with Crystals all around. I really did love that the backgrounds fit the characters nature and personalilty for the fighting scenes and the comedy scenes.now the music was great, I loved the opening for this anime so much, it was creepy and yet energetic and was so well done. I love that the ending was great too because it was classy and modern at the same time , with a fast beat but still had that classy feel. I also loved the background music for this anime. the Orchestra was great for the serious scenes and the not so serious scenes. I really did enjoy the musicNow I know in this review I talk alot about the characters but I cannot help it they were great. The way they acted was amazing to the outfits they wore. As a person who thought I\'d never watch this anime due to the fact that I am personally afraid of dolls, felt like these characters were real with every step they took. Each personality was different in there own way and that is why I fell so in love with them. I especially fell head over heels for Shinku. She may act serious at times, but there have been times I felt that she was funny and overall the most beautiful of the Rozen maidens. the costumes fit each of the personalities with different colors on everyone\'s costume, and the fact that each is very unique made my heart jump. I also loved the supporting characters too as they were very great at there personalities and expressions, plus their designs fit their personalities greatly.my overall enjoyment for this anime is splendid. The only problem I had with it was probably the design of barasusishou because the other designs of all the characters were amazing and detailed while her design felt like it did not belong, though I did enjoy this character repeating what everyone said, I did not like how she look because she stood out too much. I also as I said earlier did not really like the ending because I wanted to see what happened to the other characters in the story that got there Rozen Mystica\'s taken away, but it was an overall 9.5 out of 10 hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer.

Where the first season followed an agoraphobic boy as he learned to overcome his fears and demons in order to help those he loved, the second gives center stage to the Rozen maidens and their enigmatic Father. Where once Jun broke the Alice Game and repaired what was thought to be beyond repair, he is now swept to the side offering little more than moral support. This shift in narrative focus had potential. After all, Jun’s story arc was neatly completed by the end of the first season while the dolls were ripe for development. How long...have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun. As the show progresses, so too do the characters: Shinku struggles to deal with the consequences of the first season, the twin sisters find their intentions drifting apart, even the (mostly insufferable) comic relief character Hina-Ichigo concludes a surprisingly emotional character arc. Several new characters are introduced, such as the (completely insufferable) comic relief character Kanaria and the fabled seventh Rozen maiden, Barasuishou, as well as an inscrutable trickster rabbit and a mysterious dollmaker. Far and away, however, the breakout character is Suigintou, who develops into an equal parts sympathetic and badass anti-hero as she and some of the other maidens seek out mediums in order to attain an edge in the Game.The stakes continue to rise and a series of frustrating, yet justifiable decisions are made, investing one emotionally as the plot starts to heat up. Philosophies regarding the Game and the dolls’ involvement in it clash as characters arrive at different conclusions concerning what is right. I, for one, was rivetted to the screen by the later episodes as they steamed ahead towards their uncertain conclusion.And then episode 12 hits.I have never seen a more abortive climax than the one that waits in episode 12. The momentum the show has built collapses in just a few minutes as the ending is rewritten, live, before your very eyes! The writers make a bold statement about the futility of resisting fate and the insignificance of our main character in the grand scheme, and then change their minds 30 seconds later as one is left to weep over the corpse of the last several wasted hours. It isn’t a bitter, sweet, or bittersweet ending, it’s just junk.It is difficult to get further into this review without spoilers, so I will leave you with this: Rozen Maiden Traumend is a lot of buildup for very little payoff. There are other flaws, such as Jun’s consistent inaction in the face of major events and Kanaria’s entire existence, but these pale in comparison to the ending. If a bad ending spoils a show for you, don’t bother watching, or maybe just watch up to episode 11 and imagine your own ending under the influence of whatever drug/drugs you have on hand. have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun.

I chose to watch it, after seeing the ""desu"" memes all over the internet. The characters in this series are really enjoyable. You kind of get attached to them (which i hate when that happens because theres not that much episodes >.>) One thing i fell in love with was hina ichigos voice. (im a sucker for kawaii things like that.) I also really enjoyed how Jun went from being a shut in to falling in love with shinku. I really wish they would of ended the series better though. I hope they make a 3rd season. Withouth it ill...never know who became alice! never know who became alice!', ""STORY:I was very impressed with the story overall, I thought it was pretty unique. There were some great plot twist thrown in that took me by surprise, I was glad to see that things were not as obvious as they seemed. The story moved at a great pace and had no filler episodes.ANIMATION:The art is the same as the previous season although it seems a bit better this time around, the animation during the ending song was particularly beautiful.SOUND:I have to say I was extremely impressed with the voice acting, Mona Marshals performance as Jun was no less then outstanding, the same goes...for Mela Lee as Shinku and everyone else.The music is the same style used in season 1. It fits very well and there wasn't any song I disliked.CHARACTERS:I loved all the characters aside from the true  antagonist, they were all very interesting and I ended up rooting for most of them. I enjoyed Jun and Shinkus development the most. For me the characters are the main draw of the show.ENJOYMENT:Rozen Maiden is a truly unique show that should not be missed   I ended up enjoying the show even more then I'd hoped I would, none of the episodes were boring or unsatisfying.

I saw exactly where this one was headed early. The series reeked of a tear jerker from almost the very beginning. Right off the bat, the writers attempted to continue the character development concerning the dolls, with the intentions of establishing an emotional link with the viewer by over exploiting the dolls cute antics. This isn\'t a full blow against the series at all, because the driving force behind any work is the characters, and the viewer should feel for them. My only gripe is that because of this, the possible events were too spelled out in...light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas. The entire first half is a serious mixed bag, and can be looked at in a number of ways. At times, it can almost come off as complete filler, but there are things going on such as character and light plot development. The first seven episodes is drowned in its comedy which is hit most of the time; but those whom were used to the action scenes of the first season will be bored most of the time. Others whom enjoy the dolls very presence will be thoroughly entertained.My biggest problem with this season is that the writers try too hard to establish an emotional connection. They simply just didn\'t let the characters work and everything has to be pushed more. This will be the very first time I have an issue with character development. There was too much focus on the main dolls antics, and even their feelings to the point were Jun is almost left out completely. Adding to this, there were pacing issues as well that heavily effected the plot this time around. Even the two new characters whom were introduced weren\'t very well developed, and they felt more like cheap carbon copies.The drama in the series is also heavily over done but don\'t get me wrong here; when it\'s time for the drama to work, it does work. There are some good moments that will provide a few tears for those whom are attached to certain characters. However, at one time, a scene already achieved its desired and full effect, but would be heavily damaged due to its length. This worked against the series for me, and when someone else bit the dust it had that ""oh well"" feeling to me. The series eventually shifts to a darker side, but I think it was introduced a bit too late and simply didn\'t mesh right. Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas.

Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems', 'Rozen Maiden Traumend is the follow up to the original. Due to the lack of a proper interpretation of it\'s plot in the parent series of Rozen Maiden, for that reason I started watching this second season(also for more Suigintou) and since the first wasn\'t too bad, there\'s still hopes for development in this sequel.Traumend starts off from where the first series stopped; after the victorious battle with Suigintou, Shinku starts to feel the guilt of eliminating one of her sisters, all because of the Alice Game. In fact, Shinku simply made her into a ""piece of junk"". Is it wrong to feel sad for...an enemy you\'ve just defeated?Anyway, after completing Traumend, it\'s an improvement(but not massively) on the series, if you compare it to the original. Focusing more into the story, providing adequate explanation and reducing the number of trivial episodes. The story can be quite unpredictable sometimes; just when I thought THAT ""Father"" was the REAL ""Father"", turns that he isn\'t. There\'s also a considerable amount of drama with some fighting sequences and comedy going on. Final episode was more intense and better than in the original. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the results of the Alice Game.Why climb when you can fly? - the characters\' actions can be amusing. So, these dolls have the ability to fly(depends on the location or perhaps their mood). When I noticed that few of the them were ""climbing their way out of danger"", only for the enemy to catch up with them because she simply flew. You can sit there, relax and be amused by some their actions.Episodes 3, 5 and 7 are mostly just filler episodes, haphazardly placing keypoints of it\'s story that only lasts few minutes(sometimes mere seconds) and most of time, near the end. But hey, they\'re fairly watchable. It does focus on the story from time to time but at least 1/3 of the anime consist of very, slice-of-life-ish episodes. Like the original, pacing is slow as a snail.Traumend also introduces new characters and most of them play a major role in the story. First thing\'s first, Traumend has a new antagonist, the seventh and youngest Rozen Maiden doll, Barasuishou. Nevertheless, even with the new bunch of people, Suigintou remains as my number one character in the entire series and will always be.Comparing the original and Traumend and there\'s no enhancement on visuals.  After all, Traumend retains the whole same old visuals; colors are dull; not bright but Rozen Maiden dolls still look beautiful as ever, just like in the first. The visuals are sometimes inconsistent - characters faces differ from scene to scene. Just the same old, same old.ALI PROJECT performs the OP for this one too. Sadly, the majority of her songs including this is just not for me. Listened to the ED, and it was  actually quite good. But it gets old pretty quickly. BGM ranges from rock music(sadly the epic rock music is very rarely played) to same orchestral music pieces back in the original.To sum up, there\'s improvement in the overall storytelling, but even with that, I still wouldn\'t recommend it to everyone. After watching both seasons in the franchise, I must say that this is more recommended to the casual viewers. In any case, this is one series you have to see for yourself.

Less boring casual fillers (and empty space at all - first season was very, very emty, so that it could be cut to 8-9 episode without any harm to the plot). More reflection and philosophy (we even see them talk about God on the example of Master Rozen). Briefly, the story of Traumend is just smarter. Although, the illnesses of past times did not vanish utterly, and some episodes are still rather sleepy. And in plot there appear time after time illogical or rude lines that freak me out and spoil the enjoyment greatly.Art...- 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands. Rozen Maiden style remained stable and good.Sound - 9What is undoubtedly perfect in Rozen Maiden series is its breathtaking soundtrack. Piano and violon plays suit lolita-fashion so well that any action is exciting with this music playing. Opening is not great but alright, ending is dull, but at least you may skip it. What really doesn\'t let 10 to be set is the invariability. OST melodies are not to criticize but they are less, and after 20+ episodes of non-stop watching they don\'t please one\'s ears as much as in the beginning.Character - 9Rozen Maiden dolls are the collection. The collection of faces, haircuts, dresses, and psychological types. Of course, it should not be considered as serious ""panorama of social types"" or some that way. But this variety helps the comedy action a lot. Besides, some characters\' personalities are not as primitive as in season 1 (Suigintou, for example, turned in flesh-and-blood girl (if it can be said this way of talking doll) from Ominous-Villain-Demon-With-Non-Stopping-Nasty-Laugh), Shinku kicks Jun no more (annoyed me a lot) and, in general, became the most ample character in anime (she is principal char so that is natural, but I couldn\'t see it clearly before). All Maidens became more amiable and cute, I love them all after this season. And it\'s not because of their lowened agressiveness... they just got more alive.Enjoyment - 8,5Greatly spoiled by shortcomings of story, it is still high... I can make a conclusion in five words: I Would Rewatch This Anime.Overall - 8,5Rozen Maiden is original and outstanding yet using classical comedy-drama-system, and this is anime for everyone (no nudity, no violence, no profanity, purely platonic love storyline), so it is undoubtedly worth watching. It may please more or less depending on what to pay attention to most in general picture, but I think there are less people who watched RM and considered it a class-B shounen anime or so.I Would Rewatch This Anime.Would You Join Me? - 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands.

We have Jun not afraid to go outside anymore, and is actually trying to get into school again. There isn’t much development in the dolls but I guess that’s to be expected slightly. I have a small feeling that their artificial spirits are made to have a certain personality. I’m going to talk more about my theory later on in this review about that. We don’t really see much of the other human characters and so their personalities seem slightly the same. Jun’s sister...is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou. I have different feelings on both these new characters. Where as the fact I love Bara-Suishou as sort of a new antagonist for the dolls in light of what happen to Suigintou (Spoilers for the first series, sorry), I do not really like the addition of Kanaria. Kanaria felt like she was only there for comic relief. Her personality seemed to be similar to Suiseiseki in that she would get into trouble a lot and trying to sneak into the house. She also seemed slightly like Hinaichigo in how childish she is sometimes.With how deep the story gets, that doesn’t stop them from still doing the slice of life type of story arcs. They do end up making me annoyed slightly because there is so much story that can be given to the main idea of the Alice Game, the story behind the dolls and so on but what do we actually do get? Suiseiseki stealing Hinaichigo’s snack again, Shinku sitting reading or watching Detective Kun Kun, and Kanaria’s comedic attempts at going after the other girls. I can understand they are trying to give the characters more personality and show the personal growth of each of them but sometimes there is no growth at all. Then we are left with a kind of pointless run around with the story.Besides the slice of life stuff, the story does get a bit deep and sad. If I told you any more about that, then it would just be spoilers but there were times that tears did fall from my eyes.I said I was going to talk about my theory about the spirits. If you keep watching each of the dolls, it seems they have a bit of a collective soul. What I mean when I say this is that the personalities of each girl don’t always feel whole. Shinku is very proper; almost princess like where as Hinaichigo is very childish. Suiseiseki is a very mischievous girl who likes to tease others while her ‘twin’ sister Souseiseki is a bit more tomboyish. Suigintou is jealousy, and Kanaria is… I’m not fully sure but I think her personality is a bit of the sneaky planner. Sort of the personality of a girl who will sneak around someone to get what she wants or two get back at someone. If you look at all these dolls as personalities, it would seem that if all of them were put together, they would be the perfect being, the perfect ‘Alice.’ My theory of them and of the game they play is the idea that Rozen, their father, wanted to make the perfect daughter he named Alice and that the dolls must collect each part of Alice’s soul in order to become her. I do have another theory though, a back up theory if you want to take it as such… one that might be a very surprising turn of advents if this actually were to be true. My theory is that there is actually no real Alice Game. That the Alice Game was made up by someone to explain why they were ‘abandoned’ by their father. Their spirits though are pieces of their father’s daughter Alice who died at some point in time. In order to save her spirit, he placed parts of it into the dolls. It’s a large grasp at straws here but it’s another idea that I have from watching this series.The artwork is very beautiful when it wants to be and then it can also feel like they didn’t try. It’s much the same as the first series in both aspects. I still get the feeling that there are two different art styles from slice of life to occult in one show. The dolls are still rather detailed when not making funny faces or in a really comedic scene while the human characters feel a little lack luster. I am not sold on the face of Shirosaki, the salesperson at the doll shop in the show. I understand who he is from the moment I saw him (Not spoiling it though) but his face does not look like a humans. In fact, I really thought he might have been a doll himself with the way his eyes were and how his face was. It just looked way to flat and white to be real.The music is something I forgot to talk about in my review before that I will touch here. Both the first and this one have amazing music, most of it orchestra related. My favorite pieces are when the dolls are in some serious mode. That’s when the beautiful and yet haunting melody seems to come out that sounds slightly like a music box. I can’t help but get chills up my spine hearing that beautiful haunting melody. The English dub is basically the same so what I said before goes for this. I’m still not to keen on Hinaichigo’s or Suiseiseki’s voices much. Again, Hinaichigo’s high pitched childish whine is annoying and I really don’t understand why Suiseiseki’s voice has to be that high as well. They did grow on me more though since the first series which I guess works out. As for the newcomer, Kanaria is about as annoying as Hinaichigo’s voice. It’s high pitched and the way she talks reminds me of Naga the Serpent from Slayers. It’s that snarky little announcing voice that will say everything she is thinking no matter what. She hasn’t really had a chance to grow on me as much as the other characters though and maybe that’s why I can’t stand her right now.The story was actually really done and I liked how they dove more into the Alice Game and the story behind it but again they left more questions then answers. They had a very open ended ending that makes me wonder exactly what they mean by it. I still love the story and can’t wait to watch the rest of the seasons. is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou.

There really isn\'t a single character that I hated. Even the ""bad guy"" had my sympathy.This is a very good anime for anybody who appreciates dolls.

In the first season it was established that Jun had some special magical ability to ""bring back what was lost"" as demonstrated with the clown doll and with fixing Shinku\'s arm during her battle with Suigintou. The ending would have worked a lot better if this power was built upon / explained and then he used that power to restore all of the dolls after he found out they had been tricked - including Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki, instead of having a Deus Ex Machina moment with the...appearance of Rozen.And for some absolutely pointless reason, Rozen decides to leave Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki dead, again just to create cheap sadness with no logic. There is no reason Rozen or Jun should not be able to restore all of them.This ending is a huge disappointment because I really loved the unique concept of this show and the characters were very special, as I felt a real connection with all of them.

I like that certain obvious questions we had about the nature of the dolls was answered in a sensitive and fulfilling way (trying to be vague here to avoid spoilers!).What I don't like is the end. It was rushed and unfulfilling. It really felt like the writers had written themselves into a...corner and had to find a way to keep the action going until the end without leaving us on a sad note. I will chalk this up to trying to appeal to much to the action side of the anime (which was ALWAYS an afterthought). Unfortunately, the way in which they chose to do this robbed the most important characters of agency. And seeing these characters exercise that agency is what makes Rozen Maiden great in the first place (apropos that it is a franchise about ostensibly inanimate objects with animacy!).Nevertheless, the characters were treated with such respect and their personalities depicted well that I can forgive the very end of the story.

In my review of the first season I mentioned how the narrative is centered on the theme of ""trauma,"" but this does not seem to be the case for this sequel, which more deeply explores the conflicts of the story, although it does leaves many things open-ended, especially one of the major questions of the series, ""what does it mean to be Alice?"", so it is not conclusive for the series.One of the things...that is noticeable from the beginning is how the dolls and their personalities have more focus and are developed to make us more attach to them before they meet their tragic(quite tragic) ends. This is well done with all the dolls, but especially those who have benefited most from it are Shinzu, who needed motivation for her character, and Suigintou, who received such a good story that if nothing else, it\'s worth watching this anime just for her.In technical terms, this season has better animation and a better soundtrack. The piano in the background songs manages to convey the perfect tone for each scene, not to mention the opening played by Ali Project, which is always a pleasure to listen to.Not everything is perfect, though. The anime is very focused on the characters of the dolls, but the other characters are not explored much. The protagonist of the first season is sidelined, the protagonist\'s sister is super sidelined, and the new character, Laplace\'s Demon, is completely only used as a plot device.But in the end, this anime is a great continuation of the first one, with more comedy, action, and drama.

Trust me, you'll be lost.While Rozen Maiden was more about evolving characters, Traumend makes the jump right into action and keeps things moving at a fast pace throughout. There are still some fights between the dolls, however, it is more related to drama and action rather than...comedy.The new character Kanaria gives some laughs and eventually wears on the audience. But, Traumend is a bit darker than its predecessor and the dolls have to go through some hard times. There are even sacrifices, broken dolls and deaths.The darker tone suits well for character development and we see important changes in the main characters. The ending was somewhat surprising, but perhaps some would mention that it lacked something – turned out as a bit of a cop-out. Nevertheless, it is a satisfying end to the series.Traumend, overall a highly recommendable watch for fans of Rozen Maiden.

It was gearing up to be, in my opinion, better than the first season. However, the last episode left much to be desired. It's as if the writers did not know how to properly resolve all the conflicts, or perhaps they were confident in getting a third season and figured they would resolve them then. Sadly, this second season is the end for this version of RM. For this reason, I am left with many, many unanswered questions. For instance, why didn't Father tell...the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning? During the whole season, Father is made to look like a tyrant who wishes to see his creations fight to the death in order for his ideal doll to come to life. That is fine; I agree he is a bad man. But then at the end Father comes to the rescue?! And suddenly the fights are not necessary? Who was the Rabbit? What was his purpose and why does he get to possess Rosa Mysticas? I feel like this is cheating. And poor Jun had no character development. Seeing him be helpless and useless in the last episode did not sit well with me. I can understand that the first season was all about Jun, and this second one was going to be focused more on the various dolls. But in that case, it would've been better to leave Jun out of the finale. All in all, the season is great... except the last episode. It's not terribly bad, but it does ruin it if your expectations were higher, in accordance with what was set up in the previous episodes. So, I'd recommend, but be forewarned that the ending will probably not satisfy you. the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning?

Probably corresponds to some point in the Rozen Maiden manga, not sure which, though.Story: Tr&Atilde;&curren;umend picks up an unspecified amount of time after the first season.  All the dolls are still living at Jun's house, and he's definitely better than he was, but still not going to school (though there's good reason for it ' he's playing catch-up).  Shinku is having guilt-related nightmares, and after one of these,...she and Jun end up being drawn back into the mirror in his attic (why haven't they gotten rid of that yet?!) and meeting the seventh doll, whose appearance basically means that Father wants them to get on with the Alice Game, already.This season is everything I wanted last season to be, and more.  There's not so much filler as there was before ' and when there is, it actually advances the plot! --, and there's actually an overarching plot/urgency that wasn't there last season.  And moreover, we get to see the darker tones that were only hinted at in the last season.  There are so many more standout episodes, and the writers really show their talent by making you feel for characters you might not have necessarily liked last season.However, it's not perfect.  There is a character who turns into a bad running joke for most of the series.  And it looked like it was going to resolve things up till the last minute, but in the second half of the last episode, there's a nasty plot twist that leaves things open for a third season and several mysteries in its wake.Art: I don't know why, but the colors seem richer this season.  Maybe it's because there are so many scenes where they can use certain color schemes/tones.  Either way, it looks like it did last season, but better.Music: Again, about the same as last season.  The background music has its instantly recognizable songs (some that carry over from last season, too, which is really nice).  Didn't like the OP as much as last season's (ALI Project, again), but it grew on me.  Liked the ED instantly, though, as it's done by the same group who did Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament's OP, which is one of my favorites (kukui).Length: No real issues with length, this time.  Length is the same as last season's (twelve episodes), but it definitely goes by quicker.  When there was filler, as I said before, it ended up advancing the plot, so that was good, and there was an overarching plot/urgency to drive things forward.  However, the eleventh-hour plot twist in the episode, while it leaves things open for a second season, leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, because they were this close to resolving things, and they've only bought up more mysteries.Seiyuu: I recognize Enju's seiyuu from TmoHS (Koizumi) and Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ (Asuta), and Suigin Tou's seiyuu continues to rawq (Leandra from Nishi no Yoki Majo ' Astraea Testament and Lula from Red Garden!), but no other standout roles.  Decent seiyuu all around.Dub: N/A, has not been licensed as of yet.Overall: A definite improvement on the first season, but still has its flaws.

Although I do not want to give out alot of info this series is about a young boy named jun who is locked up in his room because of cracking under pressure on entrance exams, we do not find out about that until later on in the series, so as a result he is a...hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer. Then he gets possesion of Shinku, a wind up doll in search of Alice (the perfect doll) for his creator or ""Father"" to be happy, and for that to happen she has to defeat all the other dolls known as ""Rozen Maidens"" and take there life which is called a ""Rozen Mystica"" Now as the story goes on you see the characters unique personalities and powers. I believe that this series is a great recommendation to people who are interested in mystical and almost sci-fi\'sh anime. The story was overall good and had me wondering what would happen next although I thought that the ending was a little weak because it doesn\'t explain what happened to everyone else but gives an idea.The Art in this Anime is absolutely amazing. For the most part when I watched this I felt like there was a normal feel (as in the regular japanese home and life) with a little class into it. there is detail in every background although the characters do stick out more. There is one scene I absolutely adored the art and that was when one of the Rozen Maidens (Suigin Tou) goes to her world and it is snowing with Crystals all around. I really did love that the backgrounds fit the characters nature and personalilty for the fighting scenes and the comedy scenes.now the music was great, I loved the opening for this anime so much, it was creepy and yet energetic and was so well done. I love that the ending was great too because it was classy and modern at the same time , with a fast beat but still had that classy feel. I also loved the background music for this anime. the Orchestra was great for the serious scenes and the not so serious scenes. I really did enjoy the musicNow I know in this review I talk alot about the characters but I cannot help it they were great. The way they acted was amazing to the outfits they wore. As a person who thought I\'d never watch this anime due to the fact that I am personally afraid of dolls, felt like these characters were real with every step they took. Each personality was different in there own way and that is why I fell so in love with them. I especially fell head over heels for Shinku. She may act serious at times, but there have been times I felt that she was funny and overall the most beautiful of the Rozen maidens. the costumes fit each of the personalities with different colors on everyone\'s costume, and the fact that each is very unique made my heart jump. I also loved the supporting characters too as they were very great at there personalities and expressions, plus their designs fit their personalities greatly.my overall enjoyment for this anime is splendid. The only problem I had with it was probably the design of barasusishou because the other designs of all the characters were amazing and detailed while her design felt like it did not belong, though I did enjoy this character repeating what everyone said, I did not like how she look because she stood out too much. I also as I said earlier did not really like the ending because I wanted to see what happened to the other characters in the story that got there Rozen Mystica\'s taken away, but it was an overall 9.5 out of 10 hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer.

Where the first season followed an agoraphobic boy as he learned to overcome his fears and demons in order to help those he loved, the second gives center stage to the Rozen maidens and their enigmatic Father. Where once Jun broke the Alice Game and repaired what was thought to be beyond repair, he is now swept to the side offering little more than moral support. This shift in narrative focus had potential. After all, Jun’s story arc was neatly completed by the end of the first season while the dolls were ripe for development. How long...have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun. As the show progresses, so too do the characters: Shinku struggles to deal with the consequences of the first season, the twin sisters find their intentions drifting apart, even the (mostly insufferable) comic relief character Hina-Ichigo concludes a surprisingly emotional character arc. Several new characters are introduced, such as the (completely insufferable) comic relief character Kanaria and the fabled seventh Rozen maiden, Barasuishou, as well as an inscrutable trickster rabbit and a mysterious dollmaker. Far and away, however, the breakout character is Suigintou, who develops into an equal parts sympathetic and badass anti-hero as she and some of the other maidens seek out mediums in order to attain an edge in the Game.The stakes continue to rise and a series of frustrating, yet justifiable decisions are made, investing one emotionally as the plot starts to heat up. Philosophies regarding the Game and the dolls’ involvement in it clash as characters arrive at different conclusions concerning what is right. I, for one, was rivetted to the screen by the later episodes as they steamed ahead towards their uncertain conclusion.And then episode 12 hits.I have never seen a more abortive climax than the one that waits in episode 12. The momentum the show has built collapses in just a few minutes as the ending is rewritten, live, before your very eyes! The writers make a bold statement about the futility of resisting fate and the insignificance of our main character in the grand scheme, and then change their minds 30 seconds later as one is left to weep over the corpse of the last several wasted hours. It isn’t a bitter, sweet, or bittersweet ending, it’s just junk.It is difficult to get further into this review without spoilers, so I will leave you with this: Rozen Maiden Traumend is a lot of buildup for very little payoff. There are other flaws, such as Jun’s consistent inaction in the face of major events and Kanaria’s entire existence, but these pale in comparison to the ending. If a bad ending spoils a show for you, don’t bother watching, or maybe just watch up to episode 11 and imagine your own ending under the influence of whatever drug/drugs you have on hand. have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun.

I chose to watch it, after seeing the ""desu"" memes all over the internet. The characters in this series are really enjoyable. You kind of get attached to them (which i hate when that happens because theres not that much episodes >.>) One thing i fell in love with was hina ichigos voice. (im a sucker for kawaii things like that.) I also really enjoyed how Jun went from being a shut in to falling in love with shinku. I really wish they would of ended the series better though. I hope they make a 3rd season. Withouth it ill...never know who became alice! never know who became alice!', ""STORY:I was very impressed with the story overall, I thought it was pretty unique. There were some great plot twist thrown in that took me by surprise, I was glad to see that things were not as obvious as they seemed. The story moved at a great pace and had no filler episodes.ANIMATION:The art is the same as the previous season although it seems a bit better this time around, the animation during the ending song was particularly beautiful.SOUND:I have to say I was extremely impressed with the voice acting, Mona Marshals performance as Jun was no less then outstanding, the same goes...for Mela Lee as Shinku and everyone else.The music is the same style used in season 1. It fits very well and there wasn't any song I disliked.CHARACTERS:I loved all the characters aside from the true  antagonist, they were all very interesting and I ended up rooting for most of them. I enjoyed Jun and Shinkus development the most. For me the characters are the main draw of the show.ENJOYMENT:Rozen Maiden is a truly unique show that should not be missed   I ended up enjoying the show even more then I'd hoped I would, none of the episodes were boring or unsatisfying.

I saw exactly where this one was headed early. The series reeked of a tear jerker from almost the very beginning. Right off the bat, the writers attempted to continue the character development concerning the dolls, with the intentions of establishing an emotional link with the viewer by over exploiting the dolls cute antics. This isn\'t a full blow against the series at all, because the driving force behind any work is the characters, and the viewer should feel for them. My only gripe is that because of this, the possible events were too spelled out in...light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas. The entire first half is a serious mixed bag, and can be looked at in a number of ways. At times, it can almost come off as complete filler, but there are things going on such as character and light plot development. The first seven episodes is drowned in its comedy which is hit most of the time; but those whom were used to the action scenes of the first season will be bored most of the time. Others whom enjoy the dolls very presence will be thoroughly entertained.My biggest problem with this season is that the writers try too hard to establish an emotional connection. They simply just didn\'t let the characters work and everything has to be pushed more. This will be the very first time I have an issue with character development. There was too much focus on the main dolls antics, and even their feelings to the point were Jun is almost left out completely. Adding to this, there were pacing issues as well that heavily effected the plot this time around. Even the two new characters whom were introduced weren\'t very well developed, and they felt more like cheap carbon copies.The drama in the series is also heavily over done but don\'t get me wrong here; when it\'s time for the drama to work, it does work. There are some good moments that will provide a few tears for those whom are attached to certain characters. However, at one time, a scene already achieved its desired and full effect, but would be heavily damaged due to its length. This worked against the series for me, and when someone else bit the dust it had that ""oh well"" feeling to me. The series eventually shifts to a darker side, but I think it was introduced a bit too late and simply didn\'t mesh right. Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas.

Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems', 'Rozen Maiden Traumend is the follow up to the original. Due to the lack of a proper interpretation of it\'s plot in the parent series of Rozen Maiden, for that reason I started watching this second season(also for more Suigintou) and since the first wasn\'t too bad, there\'s still hopes for development in this sequel.Traumend starts off from where the first series stopped; after the victorious battle with Suigintou, Shinku starts to feel the guilt of eliminating one of her sisters, all because of the Alice Game. In fact, Shinku simply made her into a ""piece of junk"". Is it wrong to feel sad for...an enemy you\'ve just defeated?Anyway, after completing Traumend, it\'s an improvement(but not massively) on the series, if you compare it to the original. Focusing more into the story, providing adequate explanation and reducing the number of trivial episodes. The story can be quite unpredictable sometimes; just when I thought THAT ""Father"" was the REAL ""Father"", turns that he isn\'t. There\'s also a considerable amount of drama with some fighting sequences and comedy going on. Final episode was more intense and better than in the original. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the results of the Alice Game.Why climb when you can fly? - the characters\' actions can be amusing. So, these dolls have the ability to fly(depends on the location or perhaps their mood). When I noticed that few of the them were ""climbing their way out of danger"", only for the enemy to catch up with them because she simply flew. You can sit there, relax and be amused by some their actions.Episodes 3, 5 and 7 are mostly just filler episodes, haphazardly placing keypoints of it\'s story that only lasts few minutes(sometimes mere seconds) and most of time, near the end. But hey, they\'re fairly watchable. It does focus on the story from time to time but at least 1/3 of the anime consist of very, slice-of-life-ish episodes. Like the original, pacing is slow as a snail.Traumend also introduces new characters and most of them play a major role in the story. First thing\'s first, Traumend has a new antagonist, the seventh and youngest Rozen Maiden doll, Barasuishou. Nevertheless, even with the new bunch of people, Suigintou remains as my number one character in the entire series and will always be.Comparing the original and Traumend and there\'s no enhancement on visuals.  After all, Traumend retains the whole same old visuals; colors are dull; not bright but Rozen Maiden dolls still look beautiful as ever, just like in the first. The visuals are sometimes inconsistent - characters faces differ from scene to scene. Just the same old, same old.ALI PROJECT performs the OP for this one too. Sadly, the majority of her songs including this is just not for me. Listened to the ED, and it was  actually quite good. But it gets old pretty quickly. BGM ranges from rock music(sadly the epic rock music is very rarely played) to same orchestral music pieces back in the original.To sum up, there\'s improvement in the overall storytelling, but even with that, I still wouldn\'t recommend it to everyone. After watching both seasons in the franchise, I must say that this is more recommended to the casual viewers. In any case, this is one series you have to see for yourself.

Less boring casual fillers (and empty space at all - first season was very, very emty, so that it could be cut to 8-9 episode without any harm to the plot). More reflection and philosophy (we even see them talk about God on the example of Master Rozen). Briefly, the story of Traumend is just smarter. Although, the illnesses of past times did not vanish utterly, and some episodes are still rather sleepy. And in plot there appear time after time illogical or rude lines that freak me out and spoil the enjoyment greatly.Art...- 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands. Rozen Maiden style remained stable and good.Sound - 9What is undoubtedly perfect in Rozen Maiden series is its breathtaking soundtrack. Piano and violon plays suit lolita-fashion so well that any action is exciting with this music playing. Opening is not great but alright, ending is dull, but at least you may skip it. What really doesn\'t let 10 to be set is the invariability. OST melodies are not to criticize but they are less, and after 20+ episodes of non-stop watching they don\'t please one\'s ears as much as in the beginning.Character - 9Rozen Maiden dolls are the collection. The collection of faces, haircuts, dresses, and psychological types. Of course, it should not be considered as serious ""panorama of social types"" or some that way. But this variety helps the comedy action a lot. Besides, some characters\' personalities are not as primitive as in season 1 (Suigintou, for example, turned in flesh-and-blood girl (if it can be said this way of talking doll) from Ominous-Villain-Demon-With-Non-Stopping-Nasty-Laugh), Shinku kicks Jun no more (annoyed me a lot) and, in general, became the most ample character in anime (she is principal char so that is natural, but I couldn\'t see it clearly before). All Maidens became more amiable and cute, I love them all after this season. And it\'s not because of their lowened agressiveness... they just got more alive.Enjoyment - 8,5Greatly spoiled by shortcomings of story, it is still high... I can make a conclusion in five words: I Would Rewatch This Anime.Overall - 8,5Rozen Maiden is original and outstanding yet using classical comedy-drama-system, and this is anime for everyone (no nudity, no violence, no profanity, purely platonic love storyline), so it is undoubtedly worth watching. It may please more or less depending on what to pay attention to most in general picture, but I think there are less people who watched RM and considered it a class-B shounen anime or so.I Would Rewatch This Anime.Would You Join Me? - 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands.

We have Jun not afraid to go outside anymore, and is actually trying to get into school again. There isn’t much development in the dolls but I guess that’s to be expected slightly. I have a small feeling that their artificial spirits are made to have a certain personality. I’m going to talk more about my theory later on in this review about that. We don’t really see much of the other human characters and so their personalities seem slightly the same. Jun’s sister...is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou. I have different feelings on both these new characters. Where as the fact I love Bara-Suishou as sort of a new antagonist for the dolls in light of what happen to Suigintou (Spoilers for the first series, sorry), I do not really like the addition of Kanaria. Kanaria felt like she was only there for comic relief. Her personality seemed to be similar to Suiseiseki in that she would get into trouble a lot and trying to sneak into the house. She also seemed slightly like Hinaichigo in how childish she is sometimes.With how deep the story gets, that doesn’t stop them from still doing the slice of life type of story arcs. They do end up making me annoyed slightly because there is so much story that can be given to the main idea of the Alice Game, the story behind the dolls and so on but what do we actually do get? Suiseiseki stealing Hinaichigo’s snack again, Shinku sitting reading or watching Detective Kun Kun, and Kanaria’s comedic attempts at going after the other girls. I can understand they are trying to give the characters more personality and show the personal growth of each of them but sometimes there is no growth at all. Then we are left with a kind of pointless run around with the story.Besides the slice of life stuff, the story does get a bit deep and sad. If I told you any more about that, then it would just be spoilers but there were times that tears did fall from my eyes.I said I was going to talk about my theory about the spirits. If you keep watching each of the dolls, it seems they have a bit of a collective soul. What I mean when I say this is that the personalities of each girl don’t always feel whole. Shinku is very proper; almost princess like where as Hinaichigo is very childish. Suiseiseki is a very mischievous girl who likes to tease others while her ‘twin’ sister Souseiseki is a bit more tomboyish. Suigintou is jealousy, and Kanaria is… I’m not fully sure but I think her personality is a bit of the sneaky planner. Sort of the personality of a girl who will sneak around someone to get what she wants or two get back at someone. If you look at all these dolls as personalities, it would seem that if all of them were put together, they would be the perfect being, the perfect ‘Alice.’ My theory of them and of the game they play is the idea that Rozen, their father, wanted to make the perfect daughter he named Alice and that the dolls must collect each part of Alice’s soul in order to become her. I do have another theory though, a back up theory if you want to take it as such… one that might be a very surprising turn of advents if this actually were to be true. My theory is that there is actually no real Alice Game. That the Alice Game was made up by someone to explain why they were ‘abandoned’ by their father. Their spirits though are pieces of their father’s daughter Alice who died at some point in time. In order to save her spirit, he placed parts of it into the dolls. It’s a large grasp at straws here but it’s another idea that I have from watching this series.The artwork is very beautiful when it wants to be and then it can also feel like they didn’t try. It’s much the same as the first series in both aspects. I still get the feeling that there are two different art styles from slice of life to occult in one show. The dolls are still rather detailed when not making funny faces or in a really comedic scene while the human characters feel a little lack luster. I am not sold on the face of Shirosaki, the salesperson at the doll shop in the show. I understand who he is from the moment I saw him (Not spoiling it though) but his face does not look like a humans. In fact, I really thought he might have been a doll himself with the way his eyes were and how his face was. It just looked way to flat and white to be real.The music is something I forgot to talk about in my review before that I will touch here. Both the first and this one have amazing music, most of it orchestra related. My favorite pieces are when the dolls are in some serious mode. That’s when the beautiful and yet haunting melody seems to come out that sounds slightly like a music box. I can’t help but get chills up my spine hearing that beautiful haunting melody. The English dub is basically the same so what I said before goes for this. I’m still not to keen on Hinaichigo’s or Suiseiseki’s voices much. Again, Hinaichigo’s high pitched childish whine is annoying and I really don’t understand why Suiseiseki’s voice has to be that high as well. They did grow on me more though since the first series which I guess works out. As for the newcomer, Kanaria is about as annoying as Hinaichigo’s voice. It’s high pitched and the way she talks reminds me of Naga the Serpent from Slayers. It’s that snarky little announcing voice that will say everything she is thinking no matter what. She hasn’t really had a chance to grow on me as much as the other characters though and maybe that’s why I can’t stand her right now.The story was actually really done and I liked how they dove more into the Alice Game and the story behind it but again they left more questions then answers. They had a very open ended ending that makes me wonder exactly what they mean by it. I still love the story and can’t wait to watch the rest of the seasons. is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou.

There really isn\'t a single character that I hated. Even the ""bad guy"" had my sympathy.This is a very good anime for anybody who appreciates dolls.

In the first season it was established that Jun had some special magical ability to ""bring back what was lost"" as demonstrated with the clown doll and with fixing Shinku\'s arm during her battle with Suigintou. The ending would have worked a lot better if this power was built upon / explained and then he used that power to restore all of the dolls after he found out they had been tricked - including Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki, instead of having a Deus Ex Machina moment with the...appearance of Rozen.And for some absolutely pointless reason, Rozen decides to leave Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki dead, again just to create cheap sadness with no logic. There is no reason Rozen or Jun should not be able to restore all of them.This ending is a huge disappointment because I really loved the unique concept of this show and the characters were very special, as I felt a real connection with all of them.

I like that certain obvious questions we had about the nature of the dolls was answered in a sensitive and fulfilling way (trying to be vague here to avoid spoilers!).What I don't like is the end. It was rushed and unfulfilling. It really felt like the writers had written themselves into a...corner and had to find a way to keep the action going until the end without leaving us on a sad note. I will chalk this up to trying to appeal to much to the action side of the anime (which was ALWAYS an afterthought). Unfortunately, the way in which they chose to do this robbed the most important characters of agency. And seeing these characters exercise that agency is what makes Rozen Maiden great in the first place (apropos that it is a franchise about ostensibly inanimate objects with animacy!).Nevertheless, the characters were treated with such respect and their personalities depicted well that I can forgive the very end of the story.

In my review of the first season I mentioned how the narrative is centered on the theme of ""trauma,"" but this does not seem to be the case for this sequel, which more deeply explores the conflicts of the story, although it does leaves many things open-ended, especially one of the major questions of the series, ""what does it mean to be Alice?"", so it is not conclusive for the series.One of the things...that is noticeable from the beginning is how the dolls and their personalities have more focus and are developed to make us more attach to them before they meet their tragic(quite tragic) ends. This is well done with all the dolls, but especially those who have benefited most from it are Shinzu, who needed motivation for her character, and Suigintou, who received such a good story that if nothing else, it\'s worth watching this anime just for her.In technical terms, this season has better animation and a better soundtrack. The piano in the background songs manages to convey the perfect tone for each scene, not to mention the opening played by Ali Project, which is always a pleasure to listen to.Not everything is perfect, though. The anime is very focused on the characters of the dolls, but the other characters are not explored much. The protagonist of the first season is sidelined, the protagonist\'s sister is super sidelined, and the new character, Laplace\'s Demon, is completely only used as a plot device.But in the end, this anime is a great continuation of the first one, with more comedy, action, and drama.

Trust me, you'll be lost.While Rozen Maiden was more about evolving characters, Traumend makes the jump right into action and keeps things moving at a fast pace throughout. There are still some fights between the dolls, however, it is more related to drama and action rather than...comedy.The new character Kanaria gives some laughs and eventually wears on the audience. But, Traumend is a bit darker than its predecessor and the dolls have to go through some hard times. There are even sacrifices, broken dolls and deaths.The darker tone suits well for character development and we see important changes in the main characters. The ending was somewhat surprising, but perhaps some would mention that it lacked something – turned out as a bit of a cop-out. Nevertheless, it is a satisfying end to the series.Traumend, overall a highly recommendable watch for fans of Rozen Maiden.

It was gearing up to be, in my opinion, better than the first season. However, the last episode left much to be desired. It's as if the writers did not know how to properly resolve all the conflicts, or perhaps they were confident in getting a third season and figured they would resolve them then. Sadly, this second season is the end for this version of RM. For this reason, I am left with many, many unanswered questions. For instance, why didn't Father tell...the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning? During the whole season, Father is made to look like a tyrant who wishes to see his creations fight to the death in order for his ideal doll to come to life. That is fine; I agree he is a bad man. But then at the end Father comes to the rescue?! And suddenly the fights are not necessary? Who was the Rabbit? What was his purpose and why does he get to possess Rosa Mysticas? I feel like this is cheating. And poor Jun had no character development. Seeing him be helpless and useless in the last episode did not sit well with me. I can understand that the first season was all about Jun, and this second one was going to be focused more on the various dolls. But in that case, it would've been better to leave Jun out of the finale. All in all, the season is great... except the last episode. It's not terribly bad, but it does ruin it if your expectations were higher, in accordance with what was set up in the previous episodes. So, I'd recommend, but be forewarned that the ending will probably not satisfy you. the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning?

Probably corresponds to some point in the Rozen Maiden manga, not sure which, though.Story: Tr&Atilde;&curren;umend picks up an unspecified amount of time after the first season.  All the dolls are still living at Jun's house, and he's definitely better than he was, but still not going to school (though there's good reason for it ' he's playing catch-up).  Shinku is having guilt-related nightmares, and after one of these,...she and Jun end up being drawn back into the mirror in his attic (why haven't they gotten rid of that yet?!) and meeting the seventh doll, whose appearance basically means that Father wants them to get on with the Alice Game, already.This season is everything I wanted last season to be, and more.  There's not so much filler as there was before ' and when there is, it actually advances the plot! --, and there's actually an overarching plot/urgency that wasn't there last season.  And moreover, we get to see the darker tones that were only hinted at in the last season.  There are so many more standout episodes, and the writers really show their talent by making you feel for characters you might not have necessarily liked last season.However, it's not perfect.  There is a character who turns into a bad running joke for most of the series.  And it looked like it was going to resolve things up till the last minute, but in the second half of the last episode, there's a nasty plot twist that leaves things open for a third season and several mysteries in its wake.Art: I don't know why, but the colors seem richer this season.  Maybe it's because there are so many scenes where they can use certain color schemes/tones.  Either way, it looks like it did last season, but better.Music: Again, about the same as last season.  The background music has its instantly recognizable songs (some that carry over from last season, too, which is really nice).  Didn't like the OP as much as last season's (ALI Project, again), but it grew on me.  Liked the ED instantly, though, as it's done by the same group who did Nishi no Yoki Majo: Astraea Testament's OP, which is one of my favorites (kukui).Length: No real issues with length, this time.  Length is the same as last season's (twelve episodes), but it definitely goes by quicker.  When there was filler, as I said before, it ended up advancing the plot, so that was good, and there was an overarching plot/urgency to drive things forward.  However, the eleventh-hour plot twist in the episode, while it leaves things open for a second season, leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste, because they were this close to resolving things, and they've only bought up more mysteries.Seiyuu: I recognize Enju's seiyuu from TmoHS (Koizumi) and Kashimashi ~Girl Meets Girl~ (Asuta), and Suigin Tou's seiyuu continues to rawq (Leandra from Nishi no Yoki Majo ' Astraea Testament and Lula from Red Garden!), but no other standout roles.  Decent seiyuu all around.Dub: N/A, has not been licensed as of yet.Overall: A definite improvement on the first season, but still has its flaws.

Although I do not want to give out alot of info this series is about a young boy named jun who is locked up in his room because of cracking under pressure on entrance exams, we do not find out about that until later on in the series, so as a result he is a...hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer. Then he gets possesion of Shinku, a wind up doll in search of Alice (the perfect doll) for his creator or ""Father"" to be happy, and for that to happen she has to defeat all the other dolls known as ""Rozen Maidens"" and take there life which is called a ""Rozen Mystica"" Now as the story goes on you see the characters unique personalities and powers. I believe that this series is a great recommendation to people who are interested in mystical and almost sci-fi\'sh anime. The story was overall good and had me wondering what would happen next although I thought that the ending was a little weak because it doesn\'t explain what happened to everyone else but gives an idea.The Art in this Anime is absolutely amazing. For the most part when I watched this I felt like there was a normal feel (as in the regular japanese home and life) with a little class into it. there is detail in every background although the characters do stick out more. There is one scene I absolutely adored the art and that was when one of the Rozen Maidens (Suigin Tou) goes to her world and it is snowing with Crystals all around. I really did love that the backgrounds fit the characters nature and personalilty for the fighting scenes and the comedy scenes.now the music was great, I loved the opening for this anime so much, it was creepy and yet energetic and was so well done. I love that the ending was great too because it was classy and modern at the same time , with a fast beat but still had that classy feel. I also loved the background music for this anime. the Orchestra was great for the serious scenes and the not so serious scenes. I really did enjoy the musicNow I know in this review I talk alot about the characters but I cannot help it they were great. The way they acted was amazing to the outfits they wore. As a person who thought I\'d never watch this anime due to the fact that I am personally afraid of dolls, felt like these characters were real with every step they took. Each personality was different in there own way and that is why I fell so in love with them. I especially fell head over heels for Shinku. She may act serious at times, but there have been times I felt that she was funny and overall the most beautiful of the Rozen maidens. the costumes fit each of the personalities with different colors on everyone\'s costume, and the fact that each is very unique made my heart jump. I also loved the supporting characters too as they were very great at there personalities and expressions, plus their designs fit their personalities greatly.my overall enjoyment for this anime is splendid. The only problem I had with it was probably the design of barasusishou because the other designs of all the characters were amazing and detailed while her design felt like it did not belong, though I did enjoy this character repeating what everyone said, I did not like how she look because she stood out too much. I also as I said earlier did not really like the ending because I wanted to see what happened to the other characters in the story that got there Rozen Mystica\'s taken away, but it was an overall 9.5 out of 10 hermit in his own home refusing to go to school and buying ""stupid"" mystical items off his computer.

Where the first season followed an agoraphobic boy as he learned to overcome his fears and demons in order to help those he loved, the second gives center stage to the Rozen maidens and their enigmatic Father. Where once Jun broke the Alice Game and repaired what was thought to be beyond repair, he is now swept to the side offering little more than moral support. This shift in narrative focus had potential. After all, Jun’s story arc was neatly completed by the end of the first season while the dolls were ripe for development. How long...have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun. As the show progresses, so too do the characters: Shinku struggles to deal with the consequences of the first season, the twin sisters find their intentions drifting apart, even the (mostly insufferable) comic relief character Hina-Ichigo concludes a surprisingly emotional character arc. Several new characters are introduced, such as the (completely insufferable) comic relief character Kanaria and the fabled seventh Rozen maiden, Barasuishou, as well as an inscrutable trickster rabbit and a mysterious dollmaker. Far and away, however, the breakout character is Suigintou, who develops into an equal parts sympathetic and badass anti-hero as she and some of the other maidens seek out mediums in order to attain an edge in the Game.The stakes continue to rise and a series of frustrating, yet justifiable decisions are made, investing one emotionally as the plot starts to heat up. Philosophies regarding the Game and the dolls’ involvement in it clash as characters arrive at different conclusions concerning what is right. I, for one, was rivetted to the screen by the later episodes as they steamed ahead towards their uncertain conclusion.And then episode 12 hits.I have never seen a more abortive climax than the one that waits in episode 12. The momentum the show has built collapses in just a few minutes as the ending is rewritten, live, before your very eyes! The writers make a bold statement about the futility of resisting fate and the insignificance of our main character in the grand scheme, and then change their minds 30 seconds later as one is left to weep over the corpse of the last several wasted hours. It isn’t a bitter, sweet, or bittersweet ending, it’s just junk.It is difficult to get further into this review without spoilers, so I will leave you with this: Rozen Maiden Traumend is a lot of buildup for very little payoff. There are other flaws, such as Jun’s consistent inaction in the face of major events and Kanaria’s entire existence, but these pale in comparison to the ending. If a bad ending spoils a show for you, don’t bother watching, or maybe just watch up to episode 11 and imagine your own ending under the influence of whatever drug/drugs you have on hand. have they existed, who is Father, must they obey the rules of the Alice Game, should they even want to?These latter two questions become especially pertinent as the commencement of the game threatens the harmony of the sisters living with Jun.

I chose to watch it, after seeing the ""desu"" memes all over the internet. The characters in this series are really enjoyable. You kind of get attached to them (which i hate when that happens because theres not that much episodes >.>) One thing i fell in love with was hina ichigos voice. (im a sucker for kawaii things like that.) I also really enjoyed how Jun went from being a shut in to falling in love with shinku. I really wish they would of ended the series better though. I hope they make a 3rd season. Withouth it ill...never know who became alice! never know who became alice!', ""STORY:I was very impressed with the story overall, I thought it was pretty unique. There were some great plot twist thrown in that took me by surprise, I was glad to see that things were not as obvious as they seemed. The story moved at a great pace and had no filler episodes.ANIMATION:The art is the same as the previous season although it seems a bit better this time around, the animation during the ending song was particularly beautiful.SOUND:I have to say I was extremely impressed with the voice acting, Mona Marshals performance as Jun was no less then outstanding, the same goes...for Mela Lee as Shinku and everyone else.The music is the same style used in season 1. It fits very well and there wasn't any song I disliked.CHARACTERS:I loved all the characters aside from the true  antagonist, they were all very interesting and I ended up rooting for most of them. I enjoyed Jun and Shinkus development the most. For me the characters are the main draw of the show.ENJOYMENT:Rozen Maiden is a truly unique show that should not be missed   I ended up enjoying the show even more then I'd hoped I would, none of the episodes were boring or unsatisfying.

I saw exactly where this one was headed early. The series reeked of a tear jerker from almost the very beginning. Right off the bat, the writers attempted to continue the character development concerning the dolls, with the intentions of establishing an emotional link with the viewer by over exploiting the dolls cute antics. This isn\'t a full blow against the series at all, because the driving force behind any work is the characters, and the viewer should feel for them. My only gripe is that because of this, the possible events were too spelled out in...light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas. The entire first half is a serious mixed bag, and can be looked at in a number of ways. At times, it can almost come off as complete filler, but there are things going on such as character and light plot development. The first seven episodes is drowned in its comedy which is hit most of the time; but those whom were used to the action scenes of the first season will be bored most of the time. Others whom enjoy the dolls very presence will be thoroughly entertained.My biggest problem with this season is that the writers try too hard to establish an emotional connection. They simply just didn\'t let the characters work and everything has to be pushed more. This will be the very first time I have an issue with character development. There was too much focus on the main dolls antics, and even their feelings to the point were Jun is almost left out completely. Adding to this, there were pacing issues as well that heavily effected the plot this time around. Even the two new characters whom were introduced weren\'t very well developed, and they felt more like cheap carbon copies.The drama in the series is also heavily over done but don\'t get me wrong here; when it\'s time for the drama to work, it does work. There are some good moments that will provide a few tears for those whom are attached to certain characters. However, at one time, a scene already achieved its desired and full effect, but would be heavily damaged due to its length. This worked against the series for me, and when someone else bit the dust it had that ""oh well"" feeling to me. The series eventually shifts to a darker side, but I think it was introduced a bit too late and simply didn\'t mesh right. Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems light of the tragedy that was soon to strike.Rozen Maiden: Traumend is a solid follow up to its predecessor but it\'s not on the same level and it fails in some areas.

Although the ending may satisfy most, for me it was one of those type of endings that I love to hate, and I\'ll leave it at that. However, there are plenty I know whom pretty much love it.The animation and artwork is still pretty much on par with the previous season. The action scenes are very well animated at times, and can be cool to watch. The artwork is still outstanding and one episode showed the dolls off pretty well displaying them in multiple outfits. This is actually one of the most creative uses for stills. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. There were a variety of songs with a few displaying some beautiful piano melodies, and each song worked well for its particular scene; but this time around, I didn\'t care too much for the opening and closing themes. The voice acting was very solid for the English cast to me. The voice actors fit very well with each of the character\'s appearances and personalities.Overall, as a non fan of the mahou shoujo genre. This is still a series that I enjoyed. I will admit that there was a bit of disappointment here since I enjoyed the first season so much. Still, this is a good series that I think is worth checking out.Highs: Some characters continue their development, character designs are still prettyLows: Tries too hard to work emotion, some characters under-developed, pacing problems', 'Rozen Maiden Traumend is the follow up to the original. Due to the lack of a proper interpretation of it\'s plot in the parent series of Rozen Maiden, for that reason I started watching this second season(also for more Suigintou) and since the first wasn\'t too bad, there\'s still hopes for development in this sequel.Traumend starts off from where the first series stopped; after the victorious battle with Suigintou, Shinku starts to feel the guilt of eliminating one of her sisters, all because of the Alice Game. In fact, Shinku simply made her into a ""piece of junk"". Is it wrong to feel sad for...an enemy you\'ve just defeated?Anyway, after completing Traumend, it\'s an improvement(but not massively) on the series, if you compare it to the original. Focusing more into the story, providing adequate explanation and reducing the number of trivial episodes. The story can be quite unpredictable sometimes; just when I thought THAT ""Father"" was the REAL ""Father"", turns that he isn\'t. There\'s also a considerable amount of drama with some fighting sequences and comedy going on. Final episode was more intense and better than in the original. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with the results of the Alice Game.Why climb when you can fly? - the characters\' actions can be amusing. So, these dolls have the ability to fly(depends on the location or perhaps their mood). When I noticed that few of the them were ""climbing their way out of danger"", only for the enemy to catch up with them because she simply flew. You can sit there, relax and be amused by some their actions.Episodes 3, 5 and 7 are mostly just filler episodes, haphazardly placing keypoints of it\'s story that only lasts few minutes(sometimes mere seconds) and most of time, near the end. But hey, they\'re fairly watchable. It does focus on the story from time to time but at least 1/3 of the anime consist of very, slice-of-life-ish episodes. Like the original, pacing is slow as a snail.Traumend also introduces new characters and most of them play a major role in the story. First thing\'s first, Traumend has a new antagonist, the seventh and youngest Rozen Maiden doll, Barasuishou. Nevertheless, even with the new bunch of people, Suigintou remains as my number one character in the entire series and will always be.Comparing the original and Traumend and there\'s no enhancement on visuals.  After all, Traumend retains the whole same old visuals; colors are dull; not bright but Rozen Maiden dolls still look beautiful as ever, just like in the first. The visuals are sometimes inconsistent - characters faces differ from scene to scene. Just the same old, same old.ALI PROJECT performs the OP for this one too. Sadly, the majority of her songs including this is just not for me. Listened to the ED, and it was  actually quite good. But it gets old pretty quickly. BGM ranges from rock music(sadly the epic rock music is very rarely played) to same orchestral music pieces back in the original.To sum up, there\'s improvement in the overall storytelling, but even with that, I still wouldn\'t recommend it to everyone. After watching both seasons in the franchise, I must say that this is more recommended to the casual viewers. In any case, this is one series you have to see for yourself.

Less boring casual fillers (and empty space at all - first season was very, very emty, so that it could be cut to 8-9 episode without any harm to the plot). More reflection and philosophy (we even see them talk about God on the example of Master Rozen). Briefly, the story of Traumend is just smarter. Although, the illnesses of past times did not vanish utterly, and some episodes are still rather sleepy. And in plot there appear time after time illogical or rude lines that freak me out and spoil the enjoyment greatly.Art...- 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands. Rozen Maiden style remained stable and good.Sound - 9What is undoubtedly perfect in Rozen Maiden series is its breathtaking soundtrack. Piano and violon plays suit lolita-fashion so well that any action is exciting with this music playing. Opening is not great but alright, ending is dull, but at least you may skip it. What really doesn\'t let 10 to be set is the invariability. OST melodies are not to criticize but they are less, and after 20+ episodes of non-stop watching they don\'t please one\'s ears as much as in the beginning.Character - 9Rozen Maiden dolls are the collection. The collection of faces, haircuts, dresses, and psychological types. Of course, it should not be considered as serious ""panorama of social types"" or some that way. But this variety helps the comedy action a lot. Besides, some characters\' personalities are not as primitive as in season 1 (Suigintou, for example, turned in flesh-and-blood girl (if it can be said this way of talking doll) from Ominous-Villain-Demon-With-Non-Stopping-Nasty-Laugh), Shinku kicks Jun no more (annoyed me a lot) and, in general, became the most ample character in anime (she is principal char so that is natural, but I couldn\'t see it clearly before). All Maidens became more amiable and cute, I love them all after this season. And it\'s not because of their lowened agressiveness... they just got more alive.Enjoyment - 8,5Greatly spoiled by shortcomings of story, it is still high... I can make a conclusion in five words: I Would Rewatch This Anime.Overall - 8,5Rozen Maiden is original and outstanding yet using classical comedy-drama-system, and this is anime for everyone (no nudity, no violence, no profanity, purely platonic love storyline), so it is undoubtedly worth watching. It may please more or less depending on what to pay attention to most in general picture, but I think there are less people who watched RM and considered it a class-B shounen anime or so.I Would Rewatch This Anime.Would You Join Me? - 9I can hardly see differences between 2 seasons, but there are more cute dresses (photos at Kanaria\'s), 2 more lolitas with their own styles and all that awesome crystal stuff coming out of Barasuichou\'s hands.

We have Jun not afraid to go outside anymore, and is actually trying to get into school again. There isn’t much development in the dolls but I guess that’s to be expected slightly. I have a small feeling that their artificial spirits are made to have a certain personality. I’m going to talk more about my theory later on in this review about that. We don’t really see much of the other human characters and so their personalities seem slightly the same. Jun’s sister...is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou. I have different feelings on both these new characters. Where as the fact I love Bara-Suishou as sort of a new antagonist for the dolls in light of what happen to Suigintou (Spoilers for the first series, sorry), I do not really like the addition of Kanaria. Kanaria felt like she was only there for comic relief. Her personality seemed to be similar to Suiseiseki in that she would get into trouble a lot and trying to sneak into the house. She also seemed slightly like Hinaichigo in how childish she is sometimes.With how deep the story gets, that doesn’t stop them from still doing the slice of life type of story arcs. They do end up making me annoyed slightly because there is so much story that can be given to the main idea of the Alice Game, the story behind the dolls and so on but what do we actually do get? Suiseiseki stealing Hinaichigo’s snack again, Shinku sitting reading or watching Detective Kun Kun, and Kanaria’s comedic attempts at going after the other girls. I can understand they are trying to give the characters more personality and show the personal growth of each of them but sometimes there is no growth at all. Then we are left with a kind of pointless run around with the story.Besides the slice of life stuff, the story does get a bit deep and sad. If I told you any more about that, then it would just be spoilers but there were times that tears did fall from my eyes.I said I was going to talk about my theory about the spirits. If you keep watching each of the dolls, it seems they have a bit of a collective soul. What I mean when I say this is that the personalities of each girl don’t always feel whole. Shinku is very proper; almost princess like where as Hinaichigo is very childish. Suiseiseki is a very mischievous girl who likes to tease others while her ‘twin’ sister Souseiseki is a bit more tomboyish. Suigintou is jealousy, and Kanaria is… I’m not fully sure but I think her personality is a bit of the sneaky planner. Sort of the personality of a girl who will sneak around someone to get what she wants or two get back at someone. If you look at all these dolls as personalities, it would seem that if all of them were put together, they would be the perfect being, the perfect ‘Alice.’ My theory of them and of the game they play is the idea that Rozen, their father, wanted to make the perfect daughter he named Alice and that the dolls must collect each part of Alice’s soul in order to become her. I do have another theory though, a back up theory if you want to take it as such… one that might be a very surprising turn of advents if this actually were to be true. My theory is that there is actually no real Alice Game. That the Alice Game was made up by someone to explain why they were ‘abandoned’ by their father. Their spirits though are pieces of their father’s daughter Alice who died at some point in time. In order to save her spirit, he placed parts of it into the dolls. It’s a large grasp at straws here but it’s another idea that I have from watching this series.The artwork is very beautiful when it wants to be and then it can also feel like they didn’t try. It’s much the same as the first series in both aspects. I still get the feeling that there are two different art styles from slice of life to occult in one show. The dolls are still rather detailed when not making funny faces or in a really comedic scene while the human characters feel a little lack luster. I am not sold on the face of Shirosaki, the salesperson at the doll shop in the show. I understand who he is from the moment I saw him (Not spoiling it though) but his face does not look like a humans. In fact, I really thought he might have been a doll himself with the way his eyes were and how his face was. It just looked way to flat and white to be real.The music is something I forgot to talk about in my review before that I will touch here. Both the first and this one have amazing music, most of it orchestra related. My favorite pieces are when the dolls are in some serious mode. That’s when the beautiful and yet haunting melody seems to come out that sounds slightly like a music box. I can’t help but get chills up my spine hearing that beautiful haunting melody. The English dub is basically the same so what I said before goes for this. I’m still not to keen on Hinaichigo’s or Suiseiseki’s voices much. Again, Hinaichigo’s high pitched childish whine is annoying and I really don’t understand why Suiseiseki’s voice has to be that high as well. They did grow on me more though since the first series which I guess works out. As for the newcomer, Kanaria is about as annoying as Hinaichigo’s voice. It’s high pitched and the way she talks reminds me of Naga the Serpent from Slayers. It’s that snarky little announcing voice that will say everything she is thinking no matter what. She hasn’t really had a chance to grow on me as much as the other characters though and maybe that’s why I can’t stand her right now.The story was actually really done and I liked how they dove more into the Alice Game and the story behind it but again they left more questions then answers. They had a very open ended ending that makes me wonder exactly what they mean by it. I still love the story and can’t wait to watch the rest of the seasons. is still a caring clumsy girl, Jun’s classmate is a very quiet girl who wants to help sometimes, and there are a few new humans too.During this show, we are introduced two two new dolls, Kanaria and Bara-Suishou.

There really isn\'t a single character that I hated. Even the ""bad guy"" had my sympathy.This is a very good anime for anybody who appreciates dolls.

In the first season it was established that Jun had some special magical ability to ""bring back what was lost"" as demonstrated with the clown doll and with fixing Shinku\'s arm during her battle with Suigintou. The ending would have worked a lot better if this power was built upon / explained and then he used that power to restore all of the dolls after he found out they had been tricked - including Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki, instead of having a Deus Ex Machina moment with the...appearance of Rozen.And for some absolutely pointless reason, Rozen decides to leave Hina-Ichigo and Souseiseki dead, again just to create cheap sadness with no logic. There is no reason Rozen or Jun should not be able to restore all of them.This ending is a huge disappointment because I really loved the unique concept of this show and the characters were very special, as I felt a real connection with all of them.

I like that certain obvious questions we had about the nature of the dolls was answered in a sensitive and fulfilling way (trying to be vague here to avoid spoilers!).What I don't like is the end. It was rushed and unfulfilling. It really felt like the writers had written themselves into a...corner and had to find a way to keep the action going until the end without leaving us on a sad note. I will chalk this up to trying to appeal to much to the action side of the anime (which was ALWAYS an afterthought). Unfortunately, the way in which they chose to do this robbed the most important characters of agency. And seeing these characters exercise that agency is what makes Rozen Maiden great in the first place (apropos that it is a franchise about ostensibly inanimate objects with animacy!).Nevertheless, the characters were treated with such respect and their personalities depicted well that I can forgive the very end of the story.

In my review of the first season I mentioned how the narrative is centered on the theme of ""trauma,"" but this does not seem to be the case for this sequel, which more deeply explores the conflicts of the story, although it does leaves many things open-ended, especially one of the major questions of the series, ""what does it mean to be Alice?"", so it is not conclusive for the series.One of the things...that is noticeable from the beginning is how the dolls and their personalities have more focus and are developed to make us more attach to them before they meet their tragic(quite tragic) ends. This is well done with all the dolls, but especially those who have benefited most from it are Shinzu, who needed motivation for her character, and Suigintou, who received such a good story that if nothing else, it\'s worth watching this anime just for her.In technical terms, this season has better animation and a better soundtrack. The piano in the background songs manages to convey the perfect tone for each scene, not to mention the opening played by Ali Project, which is always a pleasure to listen to.Not everything is perfect, though. The anime is very focused on the characters of the dolls, but the other characters are not explored much. The protagonist of the first season is sidelined, the protagonist\'s sister is super sidelined, and the new character, Laplace\'s Demon, is completely only used as a plot device.But in the end, this anime is a great continuation of the first one, with more comedy, action, and drama.

It was gearing up to be, in my opinion, better than the first season. However, the last episode left much to be desired. It's as if the writers did not know how to properly resolve all the conflicts, or perhaps they were confident in getting a third season and figured they would resolve them then. Sadly, this second season is the end for this version of RM. For this reason, I am left with many, many unanswered questions. For instance, why didn't Father tell...the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning? During the whole season, Father is made to look like a tyrant who wishes to see his creations fight to the death in order for his ideal doll to come to life. That is fine; I agree he is a bad man. But then at the end Father comes to the rescue?! And suddenly the fights are not necessary? Who was the Rabbit? What was his purpose and why does he get to possess Rosa Mysticas? I feel like this is cheating. And poor Jun had no character development. Seeing him be helpless and useless in the last episode did not sit well with me. I can understand that the first season was all about Jun, and this second one was going to be focused more on the various dolls. But in that case, it would've been better to leave Jun out of the finale. All in all, the season is great... except the last episode. It's not terribly bad, but it does ruin it if your expectations were higher, in accordance with what was set up in the previous episodes. So, I'd recommend, but be forewarned that the ending will probably not satisfy you. the Rozen Maidens that there was another way from the beginning?

Prison School,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30240/Prison_School,"[""The original Prison School is probably the most impressive ecchi manga I have ever read. By impressive I don't just mean that it's enjoyable, but rather that it accomplished something that I sincerely didn't believe was possible. It manages to tell a story with hilarious comedy and incredibly lewd ecchi scenes, but at the same time also have a legitimately suspenseful and interesting plotline, *without* making those aspects feel incompatible. I don't think I have ever seen such a smooth and natural way of merging serious and non-serious elements anywhere else where it actually succeeds on both fronts.Now the anime covers the entirety of the...first arc of the manga, which tells the story of five boys who enroll in a previously all-girls boarding school which has just become co-ed. However, many of the female students are still disgusted at the notion of having men as their fellow classmates, and a certain vigilante organization within the school called the Underground Student Council decide to take the matter into their own hands. The group consists of the manipulative president Mari, the voluptuous and sadistic vice president Meiko, and the rather violent crazy person Hana who's also got a quite peculiar fetish to say the least. They set a trap for the boys where they manage to frame them for peeping, and consequently send them all off to live inside a small prison located on the school courtyard. And thus, their new life of hell begins as they are forced into manual labor under Meiko's relentless whipping, and they constantly have to be on their guard against the USC's foul play and attempts at getting the boys expelled for good. Meanwhile, the boys try to channel their inner Andy Dufresne as they start to dream about breaking out of prison...The first thing that needs to be said about this anime is that it doesn't hold anything back. Like not in the slightest. Among other things it features hardcore masochism, a principal obsessed with asses, misunderstandings about two of the guys supposedly being gay for each other, cross dressing, golden showers, a guy shitting himself in class, a girl who sweats about 50 liters per day, a myriad of sexual innuendos, non-stop femdom, epic speeches about the stupidest things imaginable and god knows what else. There are no breaks on this pain train and you better be prepared for what you're getting yourself into when deciding to watch Prison School, because it is rather... crude, to say the least. But crude or not, the execution is stellar, and it rarely fails to make you laugh with how blunt it is.The characters are all highly exaggerated in their behavior, but given the crazy atmosphere of the show it fits perfectly. Our main character Kiyoshi is energetic and dedicated, Gakuto is the best bro ever, Andre is a huge masochist, Joe is infatuated with ants and Shingo is an American delinquent. And of course they're all perverts, whether they admit it or not, but at least they're perverts with class... well discounting Andre that is. Speaking of which, the ecchi elements in Prison School are not to be underestimated. It has scenes you will probably never see anywhere else other than in hentai. But it doesn't come across as needless fanservice at all; rather it either makes it humorous or just plain epic, especially anything starring Kiyoshi and Hana in the same room is a sight for sore eyes. It's something you really need to see for yourself to understand. Of course the TV-airing of Prison School is censored like almost every ecchi anime is these days, but since the sexual content is mostly there for the sake of comedy rather than arousal I don't really find it all that distracting anyway.As far as pacing goes though, there are some issues. The anime covers 81 chapters' worth of content in just 12 episodes, which is quite a lot of story in not too much time. As a result, the transitions in-between scenes are oftentimes done extremely quickly, which means that a lot of the jokes don't really have time to sink in properly before the story moves on to the next segment. There's also the fact that many of the characters actually talk *very* fast, which might just be another way of saving time. So in that sense it is a pretty rushed adaptation, but I think it gets gradually better the longer it goes on, and honestly even despite the fast pacing it still works out fairly smoothly most of the time. A few episodes more would have done wonders though.The manga is notorious for its unusually detailed and realistic-looking art style for an ecchi series, and the anime follows the same idea. I don't think it looks quite as crisp as the original art does, but it still gets the job done and gives you a pretty fresh outlook on the genre. The voice acting is also very on-point. Kamiya Hiroshi's performance fits Kiyoshi's character like a glove, probably because he shares a lot of traits with Araragi Koyomi from the Monogatari Series whom Hiroshi has also voiced. Seeing Hanazawa Kana of all people do the role of Hana might be a bit more unexpected though given her absolutely crazy persona, but she actually does an absolutely phenomenal job at it. I also have to give Konishi Katsuyuki a shout-out for his voicing of Gakuto's character; it was truly a special experience to listen to and a very impressive performance overall.Prison School is an anime with a very unorthodox combination of genres and styles, and an even rarer case of one which actually does it successfully. It stands out for its hilariously exaggerated scenes, its crazy characters and its ability to do literally *anything* without holding back for even a second. Is it a show for everyone? No, but I still think it's targeting a much larger audience than first impressions may lead you to believe. It's a highly entertaining series from start to finish, and while I still prefer the manga version, it's definitely an anime worth checking out, even if only to see just what the hell is actually going on in it. first arc of the manga, which tells the story of five boys who enroll in a previously all-girls boarding school which has just become co-ed.

I'm a big fan of Great Teacher Onizuka and it's the first time in years I've had the same kind of enjoyment watching a comedy. I'm usually not a big fan of over-sexualized female characters or harem animes but prison school is an exception.Story 9/105 perverted teenagers end up in a school full of girls. They peak into the girls bath and get grounded into a prison set in the middle of the campus. These 5 guys are hilarious, one is fat as fuck, one is creepy as fuck, one is geeky as fuck... The...girls in charge of them AKA the Underground School Council, bully them, torture them, insult them. This kind of treatment gives them boners lolAll the comical elements that build up in the series are pretty similar to what would happen in GTO in these kind of weird sexual moments.Art: 10/10The art is flawless. The action scenes are fast paced and you never get bored. Great attention to detail. Nothing bad to say about it. Character design is fine too and there's a lot of panty shots.Sound: 10/10eeeeh, not a fan of the opening or ending. For the sake of giving Prison School a 10/10 I'll just give the sound a 10. The voice acting is awesome though.Character: 10/10AMAZING. The 5 guys are funny as hell, the MC kyoshi is kinda lovable and cute while his friends are just creepy sexual weirdos. Since they're always stuck together they create great bonds and funny homoerotic quiproquos. The girls in charge of the prison are as fucked up as the guys.AND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SCHOOL DESERVES AN AWARD.Enjoyment: 10/10You will not get bored. I swear.Overall: 10/10yep girls in charge of them AKA the Underground School Council, bully them, torture them, insult them.

I swear.Overall: 10/10yep"", 'First, I’m going to have to say what Prison School is about. Because I’m honestly still trying to wrap my head around the concept and the hundreds of planning paper I bought at Office Depot isn’t helping. In some weird universe where parental absence is even more out-of-place than normal by anime standards, there is a private girls’ academy called Hachimitsu (not gonna dignify that name with a response) that has recently started to admit boys for no particular reason like some gender-reversed version of Zoey 101. However, Hachimitsu is an academy that’s far from being suitable for the Nick-audience viewing.It’s a harsh place where...the most minor of infractions will cause you to get treated like a literal prisoner complete with wearing the stereotypical white and black outfits or face expulsion, which is something the five boys who transferred to the academy learn the hard way after making the stupid mistake of trying to peek into the girls’ locker room. Although why they’d want to is beyond me, considering every single girl in this show is less sexually appealing than Bayonetta in clown make-up. In fact, come to think of it, what exactly happens to these boys after they get expelled, considering they don’t exactly seem to be learning anything as is? Well, it turns out they want to stay so they can see a girls’ wet T-shirt contest that’s supposed to occur sometime in the future. Something I find very hard to believe actually exists in this academy - which is quite a feat considering everything else that goes past the headmaster’s eyes.Prison School is an incredibly difficult show to summarize because it seems like it was based on somebody’s Madlibs and the guy who filled it out was off his meds that day. I get that it’s supposed to be combining prison exploitation films with the standard “anime harem/school” tropes, but some things just don’t combine, like the Hercules legend and Michael Bolton. Every single element of the series is so contradictory to another element that I have a hard time trying to find out what I’m supposed to be caring about and more importantly, what I’m supposed to laugh at. So the vice-president punishing the boys for being perverted shows ample amounts of cleavage in school? These girls hate the male form and yet they’re open with showing their vaginas to them and the audience at every opportunity? There’s a guy who really loves ants to the point that he’d die for them? There is a gun in my drawer with a special mechanism that only fires the trigger if I’m pointing it up my nose?Oh sorry. My head was getting overwhelmed and I was thinking for a fast way to clear some thoughts. This whole show plays out like a South Park episode that was stretched to twelve times the length and stripped of all the life, memorable characters, great movie parodies, and subversive topical humor that still played by the rules even when it showcased a magician entertaining kids by sawing his penis off and hiding it behind a kid’s ear, causing it to fall into the same lifeless monkey cheese the shows it tries to parody fall into. Get past the presentation and all Prison School is is another goddamn story about the opposite sex trying to fit into a same-sex school and discovering what qualifies as romance in this medium whilst being about character types rather than characters. And unless you’re one of those people who really like over-the-top art styles, you’ll get tired of the presentation real fast.The humor relies entirely on overreacting, awkward situations that the characters narrate to the point that the joke overstays its welcome (which is any length of time above zero seconds), or just being nonsensical for the sake of being nonsensical. And unusually for a Tsutomu Mizushima anime - and especially compared to JC Staff’s other perverted comedy that aired in the same season - the comedic timing is completely awful, so forget laughing. I know Funimation has never been above being a little liberal with translations, but poking the bear aside, I find it very hard to believe that video games even exist in this universe. And once that thought entered my mind, the shock chuckle I got from seeing that became like the shock chuckle of seeing a piece of wood stuck down someone’s sphincter: incapable of provoking an emotion from me other than confusion.As far as I’m concerned, this show isn’t the least bit as edgy or gritty as it thinks it is. It’s more like a desperate dad trying to make his baby smile by stretching his face out and go “abloogeewoogeewoo”. And when that’s not working, he tells the kid about all the fucked-up things he saw in the world like a twelve-year old who doesn’t know any better. Who’s the baby at that point, huh old man?There’s this stupid conversation between the male students and their principal in which he’ll allow them to stay a little longer if they can tell him whether or not boobs or asses are better and why that is. The punchline is supposed to be that being perverted gets you rewarded, which I think has only been used in at least ten different gross-out comedies, as well as every Kevin Smith film ever. Most of all, I don’t even care about the semantics regarding which is better. It’s a dumb conversation to have in real life and it’s dumb in fiction.Another memorable attempt at the show’s desperation was when the closest thing to a male lead tried to sneak out of the school in order to show up for a date. Let’s be generous for now and say we give two shits for if he actually shows up or not, but the attempts at hiding his break-out are just pathetic because it’s very obvious he won’t get caught until the episode ends at the very least, and the punchline is always that he avoids getting caught due to last-minute circumstance that’s too weird to be funny. I’ll admit to smiling a bit at the defecation radio because that actually seemed possible in reality, but that’s it.But I think the biggest thing that got to me was the finale. First off, it was incredibly obvious who was going to win in the end and the plan to achieve said end was pretty damn simplistic in of itself with virtually no twists to the formula or any attempt to make the characters less boring resulting from it. And yet the show drags the plan out for three episodes just so it can cram in a hundred more overlong “oh shit, I saw a woman’s privates” joke whenever it spots an opportunity to do so whilst tying up loose ends that quite frankly missed the mark for payoff ages ago. Yeah, South Park itself has a tendency to overreach, but not to this extent.Second, I won’t spoil the final result, but I felt nothing for anybody after everything was wrapped up, and not just because of the rampant yet confusing sexism. Because at the end of the day, nothing’s changed aside from certain circumstances. The characters have achieved nothing, learned nothing, will never be remembered for anything, and have certainly not learned how to be funny to anyone older than twelve. All the suffering they went through? What exactly was the point of it all? Please tell me. I’m dying to know.I’ve heard some people who acknowledge this show’s problems by saying it gets by on the tension. As we’ve covered before regarding Detroit Metal City, I find this impossible to feel when the show has an over-the-top style that is ALWAYS on. It NEVER takes a break to have the characters actually act human or feel like they’re in real danger. Imagine if the intrigue in Gurren Lagann was dealt with using the same “who the hell do you think I am/raw raw fight the powah” atmosphere as mostly everything else in that show. We’d think Imaishi wasn’t taking the audience seriously, or that Baz Luhrmann somehow broke into the industry. When they say style can be substance, they don’t mean keep the style on 24/7. Because even the most powerful religious symbolism gets old if you just hammer in the same verse over and over.No likable characters, no funny jokes, not a lick of sense regarding anything that happens, and whatever tension that’s supposed to exist throughout the series is undermined by the fact that I’m watching a bunch of Daily Lives of Highschool Boys rejects constantly trying to perform bad stand-up comedy. Final grade? Utterly forgettable. the most minor of infractions will cause you to get treated like a literal prisoner complete with wearing the stereotypical white and black outfits or face expulsion, which is something the five boys who transferred to the academy learn the hard way after making the stupid mistake of trying to peek into the girls’ locker room.

Final grade? Utterly forgettable.', ""Prison School is a good anime, although it sometimes fails to play to its strengths and descends into pointlessness.I don't look to anime for sexual gratification; so when I criticize the censorship, I'm not doing it out of blue-balled resentment. (Well, not just that anyway.) It detracts from the quality of the animation, and it's often just unnaturally forced into the scene, to cover things that don't really need to be covered. They can indirectly depict urolagnian debauchery but they draw the line at panty-shots? Prison School has nice animation, but it's difficult to appreciate this when so much of it is censored.Honestly,...I kind of wish there wasn't quite so much sex-appeal. I want to be able to just watch and laugh without having to make the sign of the cross every three seconds. A lot of it was just for the purpose of humor, but when we got into territory that was more clearly aimed at arousal, it got a bit more uncomfortable. The series could have been better if it stopped trying to tickle my boner and started focusing solely on tickling my funny bone. (I can tickle my own boner, thank you very much.)Speaking of how Prison School could have been better, the characters were something of a minefield placed over a gold mine. Characters like Hana, Vice President, the Principal guy, Kiyoshi, Joe, and Gakuto were great. But then there's characters like that one guy who had no personality, but got kind of pissy sometimes and that's all we really know about him so how can I really be expected to know his name, and Mari, who I find to be rather flat compared to characters like the Vice President. (Haha. Flat.) And then there's Andre. He is filth. He is the most disgusting character, the most repulsive thing, that I have ever seen in any anime. No, in anything. Every time he was on the screen, I felt tears welling in my eyes and beginning to drip down onto my cheeks as my body shook with dry heave after dry heave after vomiting fit. The creator of this character should be shot. Or just killed. I suppose it doesn't matter how. But he must be brutally murdered (or just murdered, I'm not picky) before he releases another Andre into the world.But it's a testament to the strength of the best characters that the presence of Andre does not result in an automatic 1. Instead, the good, borderline non-existent, and terrible characters balance each other out. I just wish we saw some characters more often. (Like Hana. I want more.)The plot is absurd; it barely exists, and what is there is ridiculous, but it still maintains somewhat of a sense of internal consistency, and it works. The premise is bizarre, and a lot of the plot developments just make it weirder, but it has a beautiful sense of logic to it that would make Hegel turn green with envy as he realized the insignificance of his boring collections of meaningless compound words.But whatever. You should probably forget everything I've said up until now. And I mean everything. Forget everything I've ever said in my life. The most important thing is that Prison School is very funny. It could have been better in a lot of aspects, but it succeeds in entertaining its audience. It's unique and hilarious. You won't find anything else like it, and it's not easy to find anything funnier. If you watch it, you will laugh, unless you suck. It's a comedy; it's comedic. There you go. It's a success.That said, the gags can get very repetitive, (Despite the changing of details and introduction of some new sexual situation, it's still the same damn joke. And somebody needs to tell the mangaka that a running gag isn't just a copy-and-paste thing; you actually have to be creative to keep it funny.) but they don't quite over-stay their welcome. A lot of the time, when Prison School seemed to get stale, it changed just enough to keep you going for another episode. But, towards the end it really isn't that funny anymore. Not laugh-out-loud funny anyway. Ramping up the vulgarity does not equate to increasing the funniness, and it's sort of a cheap tactic.Instead of watching this anime, you should probably just read the manga. Think about it. It covers a lot more of the story, it has minimal censorship, and the panel format sometimes lends itself to better comedic timing. (Mostly just the first two.) And what did it really gain in the adaptation? The boring OP and ED? I am unimpressed. But if you absolutely refuse to read manga, then that's fine too. I would still recommend the anime, provided that you know what you're getting into.A 7 seems about right for Prison School. It is very flawed, but the entertaining parts are entertaining enough for me to call it 'good.' It's certainly better than a lot of other anime out there.

It's certainly better than a lot of other anime out there."", 'You’re probably thinking what does “prison”and “school” have to do with each other? Isn’t prison where criminals go to and school is where people get an education? Prison School sort of works differently. When the ratio of girls to guys is around 20:1, then you know your school has something that’s worth more than just education. Of course, I’m referring to the elite boarding school known as Hachimitsu Academy.Based on the manga of the same name, the series was long sought to get an anime adaptation at some point. And when it did, there were concerns about how it should be adapted. The concerns includes...the amount of censorship or material omitted as a show like this may not be suitable to air on TV. And that’s pretty obvious to tell as well. Prison School is literally like a fan service extravaganza. No less than 30 seconds into the first episode and you’ll realize it why. However, I would also describe Prison School more as a comedy thriller, a show that satirizes fan service itself. Sounds a bit odd right? If you’re interested, keep reading on.The story involves 5 boys. They are Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Joe, Shingo, and Andre. Kiyoshi is sort of the primary protagonist among them although all of them get spotlight in the story some way or another. Regardless, the school they are attending has over 1000 girls and they are some of the few guys. While this seems like some sort of heavenly dream coming true, it isn’t as easy as it sounds. It turns out, there’s a strong female dominance and authority at the school. This mainly composes of the Underground Student Council made of an elite group of female characters such as Mari, Hana, and Meiko. Their main intention is to get the boys expelled and throughout the show, we see how far they go. To say the least, the Underground Student Council is ridiculously powerful. They seem to have absolute rule over the school and anyone who fails to abide by their authority will pay the consequence. This is where the prison part comes in as people get locked up. For its purpose, the show often portrays the women abusing the boys while the main characters tries to make the most of their time there. Remember what I said about fan service earlier? That part easily comes to play when most of the female characters are sexualized throughout the story. Take Meiko for example. She is one of the Student Council members and often punishes the boys through extreme form of sadism such as whipping, brutalizing, and beating up the boys to get satisfaction. Andre is mostly the victim of her assaults although there’s implications that he secretly enjoys it. While all this seems a bit over-the-top notch, I dare say that its performance is more like a thriller. The comedy is the fan service while the thriller is how much the boys can take the mental and physical abuse.As for the characters, most if not all the boys are perverts. Kiyoshi is probably the tamest of them and probably also the most normal character in the show. His crush on Hana, a secretary of the Student Council, often lands him into controversial positions. Despite this, Kiyoshi is an honest guy and stands firm as a character that most others contrast in this series. The other boys also show some delicacy when it comes to their own personalities but none of them come close to him. A good amount of emphasis is also placed on some of their interactions with female characters. While most of them are victims of the characters, there are some that achieve a bit of closure. For instance, we have Shingo’s relationship with Anzu that seems to develop into some genuine love. Kiyoshi’s relationship with Hana also has some bits of innocence although given the nature of the show, it’s mostly satirized by fan service.As fan service dedicates the style of Prison School, the plot has less of a focus. The story is actually pretty simple and prison breaking is part of its plot element. It’s exactly as the premise implies and follows it pretty accurately. When it comes to adaptation faithfulness, there’s some obvious content that is omitted while the story itself is rushed. On the other hand, the adaptation does an explicit job with its comedy. I can’t remember how many times I laughed when watching this show. This is set by Prison School’s high standards of crafting ridiculousness. It’s as if the fan service is alive and self-aware. Cameras are deliberately focused to highlight moments when boobs are bounced or when crotch shots are shown in close view. There’s also some comedic symbolism such as with the mushroom or Medusa that really create a sensational satire. So in essence, Prison School knows its intentions and isn’t shy at all from hiding it. If you want to be serviced, this is where it’s at.By adaptation standards, the artwork is crude but in a good way. For some reason, Madhouse decided to toughen it up a notch and make the boys look more ripped than their manga counterparts. Similarly, the female characters show all sort of juicy body parts. As the show is saturated by fan service, there’s almost endless amount of it. There’s also both a censored and uncensored version so watch at your own discretion. In the meantime, the series’ school looks normal except with the establishment of the prisons.When it comes to soundtrack, Prison School’s success comes from the characters. It takes a strong cast to convince the audience of realism of the setting. Thankfully, the cast pulls it off. Character reactions matches in par with the voice in particular during torture scenes. Yes, torture scenes. This is when the boys get their mental and physical abuse from the Underground Student Council. The voices screams both pain and pleasure as it convinces the audience of their complication. On a lesser scale, the OST and theme songs are much more standard although I will say that some of the symbolism portrayed in the OP theme song is cleverly done. The OST also gets some thrilling moments in particularly some of the later episodes as the boys gets more desperate to fight back.What is the endgame for a show like this? My advice is to give the first 5 minutes a try. If you can last that long, then you’ll have an easy time watching the series. Be aware that fan service is endless and you may forget at times what the story is actually about. Regardless if you’re an anime-only or manga veteran, Prison School accurately adapts its comedy with the character reactions. Unfortunately, the show is only a 1-cour so do expect content to be omitted. (there’s a “teaser” for a potential second season though) Whether these may be something appealing or a personal favorite will be left in the dust. Despite that, Prison School in the end is a fun show. It’s fun enough to not only portray fan service in an overwhelming way but one that makes you come back for more. the amount of censorship or material omitted as a show like this may not be suitable to air on TV.

For those unaware, the term ‘ecchi’ is used among anime fans as a way to describe shows with sexual overtones. Unlike hentai, which is explicit pornographic material, ecchi is meant to be simply erotic and is part of why the anime community views such in a negative light. Because of the nature of the anime industry, erotic content and sexual themes are more likely to be prioritized in production over the possible literary merits of a show. This line of thinking permeates across other genres, leading to an abundance of fanservice – usually unnecessary...sexual content with the purpose of pleasing the audience – being inserted and used for enticing viewers to watch further. This has led many to criticize the concepts of ecchi and fanservice in general, believing its presence indicates a lack of maturity for the anime using them, as well as their intended audiences. But in response to these kinds of claims I would like to pose a question for everyone reading this:Is ecchi/fanservice inherently bad?Making cynical comments about a lewd act in a series may not be unfounded, but are they fair critiques on the show in question? For example, if a series implements sexuality of some sort as one of its core themes, is it then a flaw for the show to sexualise in any way? Can it even be called fanservice if it is, in fact, a necessary part of the story? If fanservice is merely a way of “giving fans what they want to see”, can it include content that isn’t erotic? To answer the original question, one would also have to account for the multiple queries I’ve brought up and more. Personally speaking, while deliberate audience arousal can easily be abused by a creative staff, if ecchi and fanservice in this context just means having characters exploited for their sex appeal, then my answer is no. Ecchi is not simply bad and to call every ecchi anime bad inherently is to dismiss specific plots and themes from the chance of ever being recognized as great pieces of art. Execution and intention are what separates pandering works from the more purposeful ecchi anime, and when it comes to purpose in ecchi, there might be none bolder than the anime known as Prison School.Based on the popular manga written and illustrated by Akira Hiramoto, the premise follows five young boys who are the only men enrolled at Hachimitsu Academy, one of the strictest all-girls schools in Tokyo. With over 1,000 female students to only five males, the academy looks to be a paradise harem for the group. But those unhappy with the admission of boys to their prestigious school quickly make their intentions clear as the five are sentenced to a prison on the campus grounds when caught peeking in the girl’s baths. If the plot sounded preposterous just then, the magic of Prison School is already in effect.Much of the acclaim for the manga of Prison School lied in its ability to tell an extremely entertaining story over a long period of time. As a raunchy slapstick-comedy series with enough ecchi to make one’s dick explode, the manga delivered on an enjoyable comic coupled with erotic content and comedy to match. As a manga adaptation, the anime nails on this appeal while also making excellent use of the different medium; trimming whatever fat that could be found in the source material and, as a result, leaving the show with incredibly fast pacing that manages to build on the humour throughout. It rarely lingers on any one specific joke, instead offering various quips and gags in an almost rapid-fire form, building on each scene and making the situations that much more hilarious. In doing so, the comedy hardly gets exhausting as it continuously morphs into something bigger, better, and often with a purpose that directly relates back to the plot.Typically when referring to ecchi anime, the plot is frowned upon as in a genre laden with tropes designed to put fanservice at the forefront, storylines are more likely to be used as mere backdrops for the “real plot” to take place. This in turn can lead to all kinds of issues: stilted dialogue, contrived comedy, characters lacking verisimilitude, etc. The way Prison School avoids this is masterful – for a show with sleazy shots at every corner, it never falls victim to the numerous problems that plague other ecchi anime. The entire concept of ecchi is clearly absurd and the narrative is very aware of that fact. Rather than lazily pointing out the absurdities on screen like some of its contemporaries have, Prison School opts to revel in it, crafting an outlandish setting and hysterical characters that effectively sweeps viewers into that wacky world; where what would be mundane events are blown out of proportion to make for some genuinely intriguing and laugh-out-loud moments. The humour works because of how it merges the bizarre, visceral and unexpected nature of these situations to a degree that people can’t help but burst out laughing. There can be a sense of repetition felt in these instances, as every joke involves some element of sex humour. The series makes no apologies for its several close-up crotch shots and overall crudeness. However, the ecchi scenes never simply pander to the viewers. Instead they are worked into the series with attention to detail and constantly progress the story, with subsequent character actions and motives driving the narrative to its conclusion.The cast of Prison School are surprisingly strong given the genres the anime belongs to. Even though the series does have a lead protagonist in the form of Kiyoshi, the show gives adequate focus on all five of the male students as they all share a similar level of importance to the plot. They all have their role to play in the grand scheme of things and overtime build distinct personalities from one another. Because the anime centres around five characters instead of one, all ecchi scenes are divided amongst them, helping to ensure none of the main characters are left out across the duration of the anime. Their female prison captors are also fleshed out as more than their exploitative camera angles and fetishized characteristics would ever imply and do receive noteworthy development, providing a separate dynamic to the five male prisoners and their numerous attempts to escape. Every character is highly exaggerated in their behaviour, yet they all ironically fit with the internal consistency and overall atmosphere of the show. It also demonstrates a unique and amusing way of pitting the men and women against one another that remains one of the most memorable instances of such happening in an anime.While the series is primarily an ecchi comedy, underlying the veneer of crass humour and lewd anime scenes is an almost inspiring story of friendship and male bonding. As Prison School progresses, we find all five boys subjected to mental and physical abuse on multiple occasions, all in the hopes that they would break and get themselves expelled. This fear of expulsion constantly looms over the main characters, so much so that these moments genuinely carry a sense of tension to them. The way these scenes are approached gives way to just how big are the sacrifices these characters are making. Despite being titillating on the surface, Prison School quickly becomes a battle of wits between inmates and captives within the prison-break subgenre. It’s high-stakes and high-intensity. Thrilling as it is funny, possessing all the standard conventions of a prison tale whilst keeping unpredictable for the majority of its 12 episodes. By embracing the madness of a story where people deliberately shit their pants and have sticks shoved up asses, the anime manages to captivate and draw viewers in with their ridiculous premise and very real stakes. But most importantly, it makes for the audience to rally behind these main characters through all their struggles: their mistreatment, their treachery, the trickery, the forgiveness and eventually, them emerging victorious.As a manga notorious for Hiramoto’s hyper-stylized designs and artwork, the anime captures the charm in those images without ever getting lost in motion. J.C Staff was the studio in charge of adapting the source material and they largely succeed in moving the manga’s material to the world of animation. Granted, the animation used is never the highlight of the series, only maintaining a sense of fluidity with little compromise to the general attention of detail on the visuals. But visually speaking the anime is impressive, with expressions, backgrounds and colour palette that are distinct from any other series the studio has worked on. There’s also a surprisingly good amount of cinematography and directing present that deserves recognition. The way Tsutomu Mizushima is able to ramp up the tension and hilarity with simple cuts and blocks may not be subtle but is wholly effective in making the experience that much more enjoyable. However, there is a considerably poor use of lens flare hilariously coined by fans as the “blinding white light of censorship” that covers nearly half the screen whenever a heavy dose of ecchi appears. Thankfully there is an uncensored version available for those unfazed by the show’s sexual scenes.Not only does the art direction do the manga justice, the sound direction and voice acting truly brings the manga’s story to life. The sound effects act as a core component for most of the comedy and are utilized extremely well consistently throughout the show. They can get repetitive as they are essentially a part of every joke and jest in the anime, but if anything, they are more likely to elevate the humour as a whole. The voice acting however, I would argue never grows old as for the 12-episode series, viewers are left craving for more of these characters and their performances. All the voice acting here was tremendous and on-point, with the actors for Kiyoshi, Gakuto and Hana being the standouts. They clearly made the most of their roles and manage to fit each crazy persona like a glove. The soundtrack was composed by Kotaro Nakagawa, who has also been responsible for the music behind Planetes and Code Geass. Although the tunes here are nowhere near as memorable as the latter anime, they do capitalize on the sheer intensity of scenes whenever played. For a comedy series like this one, that is crucial in making the show such a fun time.Rarely do we come across a show like Prison School that blends the likes of comedy and ecchi together so seamlessly. Ecchi comedy have been prevalent in anime for a long time and that is not likely to change anytime soon, but hardly any of them feel worth the time investment. More often than not, an ecchi will feature a bland, unrelatable protagonist who is either indifferent or completely avoids the harem created for him, alongside ecchi scenes that tend to come off shallow, adding nothing to the quality of the series. But Prison School is different. In a world when boys actions are often driven by sex, all five of the main characters are more than their one-dimensional counterparts and hold legitimate reason behind their actions: they have penises. Prison School is truly a man’s show, as where it succeeds outweighs all of its flaws, making for one of the best ecchi and comedy anime in recent memory. It’s hilarious, it’s absurd, and it’s brilliant. sexual content with the purpose of pleasing the audience – being inserted and used for enticing viewers to watch further. This has led many to criticize the concepts of ecchi and fanservice in general, believing its presence indicates a lack of maturity for the anime using them, as well as their intended audiences.

The humour works because of how it merges the bizarre, visceral and unexpected nature of these situations to a degree that people can’t help but burst out laughing. There can be a sense of repetition felt in these instances, as every joke involves some element of sex humour. The series makes no apologies for its several close-up crotch shots and overall crudeness. However, the ecchi scenes never simply pander to the viewers. Instead they are worked into the series with attention to detail and constantly progress the story, with subsequent character actions and motives driving the narrative to its conclusion.The cast of Prison School are surprisingly strong given the genres the anime belongs to. Even though the series does have a lead protagonist in the form of Kiyoshi, the show gives adequate focus on all five of the male students as they all share a similar level of importance to the plot. They all have their role to play in the grand scheme of things and overtime build distinct personalities from one another. Because the anime centres around five characters instead of one, all ecchi scenes are divided amongst them, helping to ensure none of the main characters are left out across the duration of the anime. Their female prison captors are also fleshed out as more than their exploitative camera angles and fetishized characteristics would ever imply and do receive noteworthy development, providing a separate dynamic to the five male prisoners and their numerous attempts to escape. Every character is highly exaggerated in their behaviour, yet they all ironically fit with the internal consistency and overall atmosphere of the show. It also demonstrates a unique and amusing way of pitting the men and women against one another that remains one of the most memorable instances of such happening in an anime.While the series is primarily an ecchi comedy, underlying the veneer of crass humour and lewd anime scenes is an almost inspiring story of friendship and male bonding. As Prison School progresses, we find all five boys subjected to mental and physical abuse on multiple occasions, all in the hopes that they would break and get themselves expelled. This fear of expulsion constantly looms over the main characters, so much so that these moments genuinely carry a sense of tension to them. The way these scenes are approached gives way to just how big are the sacrifices these characters are making. Despite being titillating on the surface, Prison School quickly becomes a battle of wits between inmates and captives within the prison-break subgenre. It’s high-stakes and high-intensity. Thrilling as it is funny, possessing all the standard conventions of a prison tale whilst keeping unpredictable for the majority of its 12 episodes. By embracing the madness of a story where people deliberately shit their pants and have sticks shoved up asses, the anime manages to captivate and draw viewers in with their ridiculous premise and very real stakes. But most importantly, it makes for the audience to rally behind these main characters through all their struggles: their mistreatment, their treachery, the trickery, the forgiveness and eventually, them emerging victorious.As a manga notorious for Hiramoto’s hyper-stylized designs and artwork, the anime captures the charm in those images without ever getting lost in motion. J.C Staff was the studio in charge of adapting the source material and they largely succeed in moving the manga’s material to the world of animation. Granted, the animation used is never the highlight of the series, only maintaining a sense of fluidity with little compromise to the general attention of detail on the visuals. But visually speaking the anime is impressive, with expressions, backgrounds and colour palette that are distinct from any other series the studio has worked on. There’s also a surprisingly good amount of cinematography and directing present that deserves recognition. The way Tsutomu Mizushima is able to ramp up the tension and hilarity with simple cuts and blocks may not be subtle but is wholly effective in making the experience that much more enjoyable. However, there is a considerably poor use of lens flare hilariously coined by fans as the “blinding white light of censorship” that covers nearly half the screen whenever a heavy dose of ecchi appears. Thankfully there is an uncensored version available for those unfazed by the show’s sexual scenes.Not only does the art direction do the manga justice, the sound direction and voice acting truly brings the manga’s story to life. The sound effects act as a core component for most of the comedy and are utilized extremely well consistently throughout the show. They can get repetitive as they are essentially a part of every joke and jest in the anime, but if anything, they are more likely to elevate the humour as a whole. The voice acting however, I would argue never grows old as for the 12-episode series, viewers are left craving for more of these characters and their performances. All the voice acting here was tremendous and on-point, with the actors for Kiyoshi, Gakuto and Hana being the standouts. They clearly made the most of their roles and manage to fit each crazy persona like a glove. The soundtrack was composed by Kotaro Nakagawa, who has also been responsible for the music behind Planetes and Code Geass. Although the tunes here are nowhere near as memorable as the latter anime, they do capitalize on the sheer intensity of scenes whenever played. For a comedy series like this one, that is crucial in making the show such a fun time.Rarely do we come across a show like Prison School that blends the likes of comedy and ecchi together so seamlessly. Ecchi comedy have been prevalent in anime for a long time and that is not likely to change anytime soon, but hardly any of them feel worth the time investment. More often than not, an ecchi will feature a bland, unrelatable protagonist who is either indifferent or completely avoids the harem created for him, alongside ecchi scenes that tend to come off shallow, adding nothing to the quality of the series. But Prison School is different. In a world when boys actions are often driven by sex, all five of the main characters are more than their one-dimensional counterparts and hold legitimate reason behind their actions: they have penises. Prison School is truly a man’s show, as where it succeeds outweighs all of its flaws, making for one of the best ecchi and comedy anime in recent memory. It’s hilarious, it’s absurd, and it’s brilliant.', 'Prison school is in fact a great example of bad show with great elements. Prison School successfully takes suspense, drama, action, and ecchi, turns them into one perfect mess. Prison School is also a great example of a ""Hit or Miss"" anime show. Meaning you either like it or don\'t like it depending or your personal tastes in anime and experience.  The story is sort of plain however the elements they add like violence, sexy scenes, drama, suspense etc literally makes the a bit non existent. There are many things I like about story though, but for now the thing that stood out the...most was the fact that (and stated before) the show overall was so bad it\'s good. The soundtrack is awesome lots of rock and metal added to make action scenes and ""Uh oh i\'m in trouble"" scenes more suspense. The characters, will never, ever be forgettable. Prison school has one of the best cast of unforgettable characters I have seen in a while. Hana (she\'s first because she was my favourite) Kiyoshi, the vice president, the Chairman of the school, just about everyone is unforgettable. You, the viewer, if Prison school is up you alley and you enjoy bizarre shows this show is indeed for you.

The mediocre art, accompanied by tasteless, immature humor and the tendency to over-appeal to every fetish out there, make Prison School one of the worst anime I have ever seen. The characters are not even remotely likable. The sound design is decent, but the archetypes of plot progression failed to inspire me or any of my friends in any meaningful manner.Beside the poor design and application, Prison school attempts to approach a classic anime trope and blows it way out of proportion. The hyperbolic setup for this series destroyed any semblance of hope I had in this anime. ', ""DISCLAIMER: This anime is for mature audiences.This anime is currently on episode 12/12(Complete) and that deeply saddens me because this anime uses shock humor at its finest.

I have never laughed so hard at something so degenerate, stupid, yet undeniably hilarious since GTO. The humor is so amazingly well executed that the stupidest things will drive the plot, which is surprisingly well done. One of the greatest strengths of Prison School is the voice acting, as all the proper screeches and fluctuations come in fitting times to make the experience worthwhile. There isn\'t much significant character development, a deep plot, or any of that, but rather this anime utilizes all the ideas we find ridiculous and mashes it together, backing the viewers out into a corner...where they have no choice but to laugh. The directing is great, as the animation is by the same studio that responsible for ""Shokugeki no Souma"". The camera angles are utilized to its fullest to provide the ultimate ecchi-comedic effect. Great anime to watch in groups, if you find a few friends who can see the humor in degeneracy. Very impressive overall, but if you don\'t find the first episode amusing, then don\'t bother with the rest. If you do, you\'re in for a ride, as each episode tops its previous shenanigans. where they have no choice but to laugh.

Staff,  a studio well-known for adapting mediocre light novels and for their bad deeds against reputed visual novels, their relatively poor artistic sense in comparison with competiting studios, and their more or less tight budget (generally more than less), Prison School\'s adaptation was kind of disappointing even before we could watch it. I myself didn\'t plan to see more than the first episode, and talking with some...blinded fans of the manga beforehand didn\'t encourage me to review my position (don\'t ask me why, it\'s not even anticonformism but more something like disgust regarding their circlejerk for which I was insensible).Finally, the first trailer came out and, stunned by the care given to the visuals, I was very decided to watch at least the beginning. Anyway, let\'s talk about the anime in itself.For those who discovered Prison School for the first time (like me), some might have been a bit perplexed at the beginning, but quickly, without even liking that much this exagerated, distasteful ecchi side, everyone seemed to go along with the entertaining plot. To the point it became hard to wait for next week\'s episode, the suspense being definitely present, and sometimes unbearable. If what I\'m saying is giving you hope to find again a good thriller series like Death Note, it\'s not a coincidence, I guess.The manga plays a lot with parody. It parodies ecchi (some think so at least) by using it in a shameless and absolutely commercial manner, until it becomes, like I already said earlier, distasteful and taxing. But the adaptation goes further, until even mimicking the sonorities of Hollywood blockbuster movies\' soundtracks, which award it, as an anime, a certain singularity, a really dramatic or even epic side. It also parodies thrillers like Death Note, or maybe even Prison Break (which I didn\'t see, so I\'m only imagining), and from this absurd blend of absurd, erotism, pinch situations and friendship in a prison-school environment (?!) is born a funny mess in where each situation — and that is less true for their solution which seemed very well-thought and logical — seems to come from another world so much improbable they are.What is excellent in the end is definitely how the main characters succeeds to find their way out of the worst dead-ends, in a manner much more composed and believable than all the unbelievable shit that fall upon them. And it is, in a way, exhilarating, like a good Death Note, even if more original.Honestly, I couldn\'t wait for the end of the broadcasting so I started reading the manga after episode 4. Which made me realize some flaws inherent to the anime, which may not be noticeable or bugging when you only experienced this one. I don\'t really consider them like cons, or maybe yes I do, but I think it could have been way more awesome if this part would have had a better treatment.AS AN ADAPTATIONThe problem is the pacing. A flaw that I seem to often notice in recent anime adaptations like Parasyte, Seven Deadly Sins, Magi or even Hunter x Hunter 2011, and which seems be something like a new  trend or a commercial approach allowing to adapt more, while keeping a low number of episode which avoid fillers and also permit a constantly good animation quality all the way to the end without costing buckets (and all this by satsifying the general public, traumatized by Naruto fillers and One Piece\'s catastrophic recent episodes). I complain so much about those pacing issues these times that I feel obligated to talk about it, for once I make a review. Maybe I\'ll convince you, reader, and you\'ll finally understand why filler is, in itself, not a bad thing, and can be an intelligent way to give additional value to the adaptation, while saving money and time (for the long-running franchises at least).It\'s when I read Prison School\'s manga that the parodying side of Death Note came to my eyes : the dark tones from some scenes, the camera angles and the internal monologues in pinch situations, the keikakus (it means plan). And it\'s very well done in the manga. And Death Note anime is very impressive too, because it adapts perfectly this psychological tension, while being very dynamic (it could have been slower and more boring like Monster — I like Monster), and the pacing doesn\'t feel too much rushed, the thought processes are well rendered and believably timed.One of the loss which come from the very fast pacing in the anime is unfortunately the intensity of the best psychological scenes (those with Hana, mainly), it goes fast, too fast, I personally found it difficult to feel worried about Kiyoshi\'s recurrent incredible and desperate situations. I\'m not an expert, nor a scriptwriter, but I think that some added lines of introspective monologue, or silent stills to show the awkwardness and difficulty of the moment, even filler,  would have helped to add a bit of hesitating emotions, and even some intensity, to those scenes.In fact, to put it simply, the anime\'s director gave us an external point of view of the scene, the one of a spectator, when the manga gave me a more ""in Kiyoshi"" feeling, which felt much more tense and desperate and made me worry about the next actions, ""what should he do, he\'s risking his social life right now, poor Kiyoshi"".The ""external viewer"" point of view that the director put in place isn\'t in my opinion very appropriate because the jokes aren\'t so well-thought in themselves (it\'s just the level of absurdity that is amazing), so seen  from outside it just looks like some retarded chain of quickly happening dumb actions commited by the characters, when from an internal point of view, more introspective, everything at stake seem much more important and heavy. It\'s too bad, in my sense.The other flaw in this anime is also, in my opinion, directly due to the fast-pacing. And it\'s much more to the core of the anime, so it\'s plain wrong. The problem when you go so fast, it\'s that the gags don\'t have the time to take properly effect. A big part of the comedy in this anime is absurd, but really some ""what the fuck did I just watch?!"" kind of absurd. The thing is, as a manga, Prison School give the reader one or two gag per chapter, so you can digest them with a laugh before reading the next chapter. But in the anime, and I have to precise beforehand that it adapted more or less 80 chapters in 12 episodes (didn\'t count exactly), the events and unbelievably ridiculous actions come one after another in pack of ten, the viewer don\'t have any time to integrate the joke, so it could have sink in.It\'s not a secret that for some jokes, the timing is very important. In Prison School, the joke that is supposed to make you laugh after 5 seconds, not because your brain is slow and that one is very subtle, but more because you really need 5 good seconds the realize the immensity of the ridiculousness of what just happened before your eyes, this awesome stupidity is sweeped away by the next one that comes only 3 seconds after and for which you will do your best to understand to follow the story, to finally sacrifice the comic potential of the situation. And I also think that\'s too bad.In conclusion, the anime place itself in the grandstand, rather than wanting to be involved to understand what happens in the field, with the players, it\'s a shame but it is nevertheless a very good anime, granted with a good soundtrack and a stunning visual work, there\'s a lot of things that happens in the plot that will keep you from getting bored even if some joke, while staying always astounding, are less impacting than they could have been. And maybe you will succeed better than me at involving yourself in the characters through the anime, a thing I couldn\'t do with the pacing imposed on me by J.C. Staff.And for those who loved the first season, you have to know that it is only the beginning and the sequel will be even better, the psycho-erotic frenzy really takes off at episodes 11-12, and a lot of the following event are equal or worth more than those, some reminding me a lot the deviant but intimate  perversion of manga like Nozoki Ana. blinded fans of the manga beforehand didn\'t encourage me to review my position (don\'t ask me why, it\'s not even anticonformism but more something like disgust regarding their circlejerk for which I was insensible).Finally, the first trailer came out and, stunned by the care given to the visuals, I was very decided to watch at least the beginning.

I\'m not an expert, nor a scriptwriter, but I think that some added lines of introspective monologue, or silent stills to show the awkwardness and difficulty of the moment, even filler,  would have helped to add a bit of hesitating emotions, and even some intensity, to those scenes.In fact, to put it simply, the anime\'s director gave us an external point of view of the scene, the one of a spectator, when the manga gave me a more ""in Kiyoshi"" feeling, which felt much more tense and desperate and made me worry about the next actions, ""what should he do, he\'s risking his social life right now, poor Kiyoshi"".The ""external viewer"" point of view that the director put in place isn\'t in my opinion very appropriate because the jokes aren\'t so well-thought in themselves (it\'s just the level of absurdity that is amazing), so seen  from outside it just looks like some retarded chain of quickly happening dumb actions commited by the characters, when from an internal point of view, more introspective, everything at stake seem much more important and heavy. It\'s too bad, in my sense.The other flaw in this anime is also, in my opinion, directly due to the fast-pacing. And it\'s much more to the core of the anime, so it\'s plain wrong. The problem when you go so fast, it\'s that the gags don\'t have the time to take properly effect. A big part of the comedy in this anime is absurd, but really some ""what the fuck did I just watch?!"" kind of absurd. The thing is, as a manga, Prison School give the reader one or two gag per chapter, so you can digest them with a laugh before reading the next chapter. But in the anime, and I have to precise beforehand that it adapted more or less 80 chapters in 12 episodes (didn\'t count exactly), the events and unbelievably ridiculous actions come one after another in pack of ten, the viewer don\'t have any time to integrate the joke, so it could have sink in.It\'s not a secret that for some jokes, the timing is very important. In Prison School, the joke that is supposed to make you laugh after 5 seconds, not because your brain is slow and that one is very subtle, but more because you really need 5 good seconds the realize the immensity of the ridiculousness of what just happened before your eyes, this awesome stupidity is sweeped away by the next one that comes only 3 seconds after and for which you will do your best to understand to follow the story, to finally sacrifice the comic potential of the situation. And I also think that\'s too bad.In conclusion, the anime place itself in the grandstand, rather than wanting to be involved to understand what happens in the field, with the players, it\'s a shame but it is nevertheless a very good anime, granted with a good soundtrack and a stunning visual work, there\'s a lot of things that happens in the plot that will keep you from getting bored even if some joke, while staying always astounding, are less impacting than they could have been. And maybe you will succeed better than me at involving yourself in the characters through the anime, a thing I couldn\'t do with the pacing imposed on me by J.C. Staff.And for those who loved the first season, you have to know that it is only the beginning and the sequel will be even better, the psycho-erotic frenzy really takes off at episodes 11-12, and a lot of the following event are equal or worth more than those, some reminding me a lot the deviant but intimate  perversion of manga like Nozoki Ana.', ""I came across Prison School after checking the top seasonal anime. At first glance I believed it to be nothing of interest, as I am not a fan of ecchi anime. However, after watching the first few episodes I came to understand why it was among the higher ranks of its season.Story: 7If I had one word to describe the story of Prison School, I would call it absurd. The simple story that boys can get locked into a school prison is completely nonsensical. However, upon closer evaluation, where does something like this even show up? It is so ridiculous that it can be described...as uncommon. Therefore, it avoids the the usual tag that people like to throw onto shows. Generic. If the story is not good, it will at least be interesting.Art: 8The art is a eight. I usually don't bicker too much about art as long as the animation does its job. However the one downside about the graphics of the show is the abundance of censorship. While I do believe that it is probably needed, it can get a little awkward at times and for some, it is even annoying to an extent.Sound: 8The music for the anime is a eight. I usually have the same rule for sound as I do art. However, in this case, the sound not only functions within the anime, but it adds a little.Characters: 10This is where the anime shines the most. The five boys that enter the prison are already very interesting characters. However, the one thing that makes characters good is change. In prison school change becomes something very apparent. As the five boys continually face challenges, they change a lot throughout the series.Enjoyment: 10Are you serious? This is most definitely a ten. The anime shines the most with its sense of humor. The absurdity of the anime, the strange characters, even the music and art contribute to the overall humor of the anime. If anything, this aspect of the show will always make you want to watch the next episode!Overall: BWell the mean of my evaluations round up to 8.6. That is in fact a B. There are a few reasons that I feel that the show is a B and not higher. This has a lot to do with the discrepancy of character development. While three of the five boys were given a deep character, two of them didn't really get highlighted. Also the fact that the censorship was everywhere did make the show a little bit worse in presentation. as uncommon. Therefore, it avoids the the usual tag that people like to throw onto shows.

It takes itself as seriously as possible with its pace and its *god-tier* sound and art direction which brings about an incredible sense of urgency for what is an incredibly dumb story premise. By taking itself seriously and going so far...in it comes out the other side, it invites us to laugh at it and telegraphs to us that it knows how stupid it is. Bold, striking art and a hilariously complex orchestral score underline some of the best story moments and dramatic tension, using them as a vehicle for comedy simply by manipulating the tone of the scene.This sort of expert manipulation applies *most* of the time. Meiko\'s scenes are shamelessly exploitative and her design is absurd, and I\'m not a huge fan of her character, especially given how down-to-earth almost every other character\'s design is (although she shines as a caricature whenever she\'s partnered with Andre for a comedic scene).Her use in the plot is mostly justified and it\'s great for a laugh when her sex appeal is actually used to drive the plot somehow, but her scenes are the closest to that feeling of actual sincerity to its fanservice and I honestly don\'t care for that a whole lot. Characters like her and several others pale in comparison to seeing characters like Hana, ones with developing internal conflicts and real struggles (albeit hilarious ones).As ""real"" as they can get within the boundaries of the high school comedy genre, anyway.In any case, this is a lot more words than is really deserved for a show this stupid. But it is unflinching in its stupidity and dares to go beyond. It\'s something to be both respected and laughed at. in it comes out the other side, it invites us to laugh at it and telegraphs to us that it knows how stupid it is.

It\'s something to be both respected and laughed at.', 'Yours truly is here to write a review about one of your truly\'s favorite anime this season.When I first looked at the tags for this anime, I though it looked fairly promising, ""Comedy, Ecchi, Romance, School, Seinen."" Definitely a stereotypical romantic comedy, right?Oh boy was I wrong. This was nothing like the stereotypical anime that I was expecting, but I guess I\'ll just get into the parts of the anime right away.Story: 8The story was good in comparison to any average anime, and very good in comparison to other romantic comedies, that are almost 100% slice of life and gag comedy. The premise is interesting...in that instead of one main guy and his one dimensional buddy, we have 5 pretty unique guys. First episode features these 5 socially awkward guys in a formerly all-girls\' school. Weird stuff happen and they get locked up in a prison that is on school grounds. Umm.... yeah.... Like I said the premise is pretty weird, but very unique. I haven\'t read the manga that the anime is based off of, but in that respect, I think the anime did a good job in adapting and definitely in making the viewers enjoy (I\'ll get more into this later).Art: 6Let me be clear. If you came here looking for ecchi, you came to the right place. The art could use some getting used to. I personally didn\'t hate it, but didn\'t like it too much either. It doesn\'t have the stereotypical anime girl art to say the least. The backgrounds are very nicely drawn and the character faces are just so side-splittingly hilarious, sometimes I found myself pausing the show just to laugh my head off. Sometimes, I even rewatched certain parts to get more laughs off. I personally didn\'t like the immense amount of ecchi, especially with certain parts blurred out and whatnot, but it was definitely bearable.Sound: 8Oh boy, the sounds were amazing, from the voice actors to the background noises. Especially anything involving the vice president, I pretty much always got some giggles out of that. I thoroughly enjoyed the detail in which the background noises, like how clothes sound like when you move in them, or clothes ripping, or a certain someone pooping their pants... Yeah. I said it.Character: 7Like I said before, there are 5 main guys all with unique personalities. Some of them are pretty nasty, I\'ll have to admit, but all are hilarious in their own aspect. My two favorite main guys were Kiyoshi and Gakuto just because they reached such a great dynamic with each other that whenever they came on screen together, I had to prepare myself. However, despite me singing praises, the characters are somewhat one-dimensional. Sure they do have their moments of brilliance, but overall, you can sorta predict what\'s going to happen, heck, even the prison guys could predict the actions of the USC members.Enjoyment: 9As you could probably guess from my praises on praises above, I really like the show. It truly was a fresh air to the stereotypical romantic comedies out there and ecchis out there. Everything from the art to the sound came in sync with each other to make a super fun, super funny, amazing anime. I haven\'t watched too many anime from this season, but I think Prison School really stands out in the ecchi and comedy departments.Thanks for reading my review. I can\'t really tell how long it\'s going to be because I\'m typing in a super small box, but if it\'s really long sorry teehee:P.p.s. If you plan to start watching, look forward to episode 11.

In fact, this may be one of the best anime series I\'ve seen thus far. What I\'m seeing from people discussing this show is contempt for the more risque and bold elements it utilizes so often. A dismissive attitude is taken towards just about every facet of the shows storytelling, structure, and characters when you can wave the magic ""fanservice"" stick and reject the positives that this story brings.To describe this further, I want to go to the root of the issue. Fanservice. What does it mean and how does...it affect the way someone views something. Especially if that someone regards fanservice as wholly negative. Or, I should say, what fanservice has become.Let\'s begin._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Fanservice : What It Means and What It Is]Fanservice, as a term, began as a description of a series, show or film, that gained a following of fans that imposed their views onto the creative staff. This could be having opposing views to the stories being developed or something as simple as pushing a relationship between two characters that only they see.Instead of proceeding with their own vision, the creative teams of these products decided to cater their content towards the fans. Which meant creating plot devices, no matter how contrived, to create these pairs or storylines. At its base, this is exactly what fanservice is. Servicing the fans. Giving them what they want to see. This is a negative term because it often resulted in characters being flanderized.Flanderization is a term that strictly exists in the media landscape. The general definition is a character losing their humanity and becoming nothing but a collection of their most popular traits. For example, if there\'s a great child character that also happens to be excessively adorable and the fans love the kind of cute shit this character does. If the creative team decides that they want to make this show strictly about fanservice, they\'d slowly forget about every other character trait just to force scenes of that character being cute. Therefore flanderizing the character and making them more hollow as a result.Fanservice, as a term, grew from there. It evolved to talk about fans of a medium in general. Like anime? Well you have a specific set of things you may like that are generally included in just about every anime there is. For example, this could be the fact that as a whole, a vast majority of hardcore anime fans love seeing cute girls with big tits act clumsy and stupid. So now every show past a certain demographic has a cute, clumsy girl with big sweater puppies. That\'s servicing the fans by creating content that the creators think they\'ll like without the fanbase for that specific piece of work existing yet.This is how a list of certain tropes and archetypes began flooding into anime. Seemingly overnight an influx of certain character types penetrated the industry. These archetypes slowly became tropes which slowly became boring, unoriginal cliches.The last evolution of the term laid with online communities. It simply began meaning having tits in your show. Or ass in your show. Or some kind of romanticization of any of that. Sexy characters doing cute or sexy things. This is where I have to disagree. If a show starts with concrete themes and original ideas that happen to involve sexuality or sex in some way, is that servicing fans? Or is that simply creating a story. If it doesn\'t impact the overall shows quality, in fact, in many casing, adding to the entire concept, should it be dismissed?The answer is no. Throughout my journey through Prison School, there were gross, sleazy shots of these perverse characters. yet none of them felt pandering or exhausting or even sexy. None of it felt like it was there to sell to a lowest common denominator. So either i\'m completely missing something, which I find hard to believe since i\'m generally incredibly critical of ""fanservice"". Or, more logically, the show is simply following a structure. That structure involves batshit insane sexuality, fetishism, and violence. None of it felt pandering. Why? Because it was all played for the theme. More importantly, it was all made to make you laugh._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[The Narrative Jail]We follow five characters as they try and survive a prison that is hilariously located within a school environment. Being sentenced to jail for doing what boys do, peeping, they try to balance relationships, labor, and escaping. If it sounds ridiculous then it\'s doing the trick.This show is solidly insane. The idea is so crazy and hard to believe, it\'s almost crazier to think that I found myself fully buying into it by episode two. An idea can only be stupid if it\'s execution is stupid. If the idea is far-fetched then the writer needs to work extra hard to sell that idea. Whether it\'s through comedy, drama, or flat out surrealism.A lot of this shows premise and comedy that gets drawn out of it comes from the way the story is treated. Instead of having characters constantly break the meta by pointing out the ridiculousness of the situation, they instead double-down on the seriousness. That seriousness transforms into believe-ability as you get just as swept away as the characters do. By treating the situation seriously, the narrative not only sets proper stakes, but also creates a great anti-dichotomy. Both drawing comparisons to how school and prison relate and how they differ.But the show doesn\'t waste time making these kinds of parallels. This is because Prison School doesn\'t waste any time. Period. The first four episodes fly by because their pacing is so incredibly fast. If a joke doesn\'t land, then the one that comes two seconds after may. Its ability to build on a scene and progressively make the situations more and more ridiculous causes this potentially exhausting scenario all the more hilarious and entertaining.What struck me as surprising was the amount of tension this show can build. What was even more surprising was the amount of tension it can build while still being funny as fuck. The pacing services the comedy, the three separate arcs of the show service the tension. When a scene is intense it\'s smartly played as fully serious.The humor comes from the situation, rather than the characters pointing out how stupid the situation is. Which I was so grateful for, since too many shows rest on pointing at something and laughing, rather than explaining the comedy as the scene unravels. By having the characters deal with these stakes that are built up seriously, this show kicks two crows with one stone by creating genuinely intense scenarios with laugh-out-loud results....All my praise goes towards the way the first four episodes were dealt with. They were near-flawless executions of character building, comedic timing, and rising stakes with equally rising absurdity as a result. While the show slows down afterwards, I wouldn\'t necessarily say that was a bad thing. It begins telling the story of all the characters, rather than two of them. Giving each one a reason to be there and add to the story being told.Prison School smartly drops hints and ideas throughout it\'s build-up and has each one of these ideas create an entertaining and thoroughly well-done climax. I\'d say that this show is a regular anime mystery and thriller but in an absurdist scenario, but I\'d be wrong. This is wholly better than any Anime thriller. In fact, this show does better storytelling regardless of the scenario it\'s in.That\'s both thanks to tight narrative structure as well as the characters._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[The Prisoners and Their Masters]The characters in this show are great. Each one has a role to play and each one builds enough of a character never be fully likeable or hateable. Even the seemingly one-dimensional captors get enough time to actually become believable characters within this absolutely insane universe. The secondaries being included in this show are more there for their quirks, however, even they gain some hilarious and interesting things to do as the series progresses. The Chairman in particular is both hilarious and outstanding as the looming hand of god that peers over the school.All five prisoners have their own interesting traits. Even the more hate-able a character becomes they manage to fight their way back into your heart with the writers ability to create scenarios that are heartfelt but also hilarious at the same time.The three captors of these prisoners could have very well served as fetishistic dominatrix porn and nothing else. Yet they are constantly played as both threats, but given enough character to also be interesting in their own scenes as well. Each one, as I\'ve said, has a role to play. I never felt as though I should be turned on by anything in this show, which is a huge plus to the creative team. While I may not personally be into the whole cartoon thing, I can easily recognize when an anime is trying to be erotic and sexy, and when an anime is trying to play something for laughs.This show is undoubtedly exploitative in the way it portrays its characters. However, the amount of which it exploits is where the humor lies. Specifically in the inconceivably ludicrous Vice-President character who carries around a riding crop wearing a short skirt and tits that seem to have a gravity of their own. She\'s subject to probably the most sexuality throughout the series, yet none of if felt lame or pointless. We get these hilarious sleazy shots that are never really questioned in-universe. Her entire character may feel one note, yet they develop that note until it\'s playing a tune.As the Prison School progresses and it\'s journey winds down, so do its characters. Each one feels as though they\'ve been pushed to the brink and only one side may win. In this universe, the idea of Men vs. Women could\'ve been incredibly annoying to me, as i\'m consistently annoyed at anime for making it\'s female characters useless, unrealistic, exploitative, doting, etc. Yet it comes as one of the biggest surprises that I had none of these feelings during the show.While something like No Game No Life infuriated me with it\'s blatant figurine-bait characters with absolutely no depth other than the pockets that the producers were lining... Prison School on the other hand goes the extra mile by creating this competition, Girls vs. Boys, in a way where both sides felt equally capable of defeat.For once, I feel, the females in an anime that was, for the most part, meant for men were given an intimidating role that wasn\'t ever really stripped from them in favor of self-insert bullshit. These girls were awesome. They were memorable. They were exactly what I wanted from villains and it never felt as though they were there to sell....While I wish that towards the ending that every character had a role to play in the finale, it felt as though there was one big story being told that never really involved the lesser developed characters. Unfortunately, this caused a feeling of shoehorning certain characters to wrap up a story, rather than actually creating something that can be seen as a ""perfect"" wrap-up.The ending leaves a lot of room for the future of the show, however, it still provides a decent closer in terms of character development and status._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Art of a Cell Block]The art is mostly great. J.C Staff really put a lot of effort in translating the visuals from the Manga to the series. In fact, i\'m thoroughly impressed with the fact that so many of these characters were drawn with so much detail and effort. The shows style overall suited this oddly gritty environment and it helped sell the entire concept better.The character design in this show is pretty outstanding if I do say so myself. It keeps a mostly realistic style. However, some of the characters are also hilarious unrealistic in terms of design. Both Andre, a fat tiny-faced student, and Meiko, the student council vice-president are incredibly unrealistic in terms of design. They do mesh well with the other characters too, especially since they are the two most fetishistic and fetishized characters.Since a lot of the humor did come from the situation, more specifically, character dealing with a certain situation, J.C staff being able to perfectly translate the hilarious and over-the-top expressions and emotions every character was going through was just brilliant.It felt like what KonoSuba could\'ve been when it comes to creating punchlines through reactions, rather than a flat-out joke being told._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Music]The OP was pretty awful. The ED was pretty bad. That being said, the actual music within the show was flat-out great! A lot of it was thematic, intense, and memorable. I really enjoyed the use of dramatic sound effects to either sell a joke, or a sell a scene as a whole.On occasion some of the sounds did become a little repetitive, however, it didn\'t get to the point where it detracted from the scene as a whole._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Directing]I really didn\'t expect to be talking about direction with this show. Directing in comedy anime has often been fairly weak in terms of creativity. They set up a scene, they deliver it, and the reaction-based comedy does all the work. Two shows stand out from that crowd. Nichijou, and now Prison School. Very different shows, yet equally bursting with creative direction.Tsutomu Mizushima does an outstanding job. I never knew you could be so creative with simple blocking shot utilizing some thicc-as-fuck thighs. There are some genuinely fun PoV shots and some really smart editing. I got some really impressive Edgar Wright vibes from the way some of the scenes were put together.Specifically, certain match-cuts elevated scenes from simply funny to flat-out hilarious. I can\'t emphasize how much editing and directing in general plays a role in how many jokes in a series land. I can\'t think of a single time when a joke in this show fell flat due to an issue in editing or directing, which is some major praise._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Where the Enjoyment Is Derived]This show was outstandingly enjoyable. Although peppered with certain flaws it was, as a whole, a very fun experience. One I\'d recommend experiencing with like-minded friends rather than alone. The ability to hear the tension build as you journey with these characters is amplified by hearing your friends experience the same thing.Prison School isn\'t there to be sold as a marketing tool. In fact, i\'d say a lot of it is crazy and off-the-wall enough to straight up turn off viewers. However, that\'s all the more appealing to me. I love the ""no-fucks given"" attitude that this show takes. The creative freedom the mangaka had when creating this is so well expressed by the animation studio.It goes without saying, but this show is infinitely better being viewed as it was meant to be viewed. Uncensored. I can\'t imagine how awful some of the punchlines and extended scenes of gratuitous violence or fetishism may have been if half the shot was black._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Conclusion]Prison School is something to be cherished. I feel like I could\'ve easily dismissed it as a fetishistic potential-harem. One-dimensional characters with a limp story that was there only to provide eye-candy. Since I\'m not one to really enjoy something meant to just serve the fans, I was incredibly hesitant with watching this series.However, its ability to convey genuine tension with more genuine laughter hooked me immediately. It wears its motivations on its sleeve, but these motivations aren\'t nearly as sleazy as this shows  scenarios. The motivation is to make you laugh your ass off. I\'d be hard pressed to say that this show didn\'t do that perfectly.The director worked wonders with what he was given and created funny situations significantly more funny with incredibly clever editing and great shot composition throughout. It makes me furious that so many series out there lack this kind of understanding of comedic timing and editing. However, it makes me even more grateful that I was able to watch something that honestly impressed me from a creative directorial standpoint as well as a comedic and storytelling one.While it\'s not lacking flaws, as our protagonists love interests aren\'t nearly as engaging as any other character and the finale could\'ve involved more of the shows characters. The solid audio, standout art, surprisingly deft storytelling, and endlessly memorable and bad-ass characters deserve all the praise I can give this show.Prison School is infinitely enjoyable if you are a fan of over-the-top scenarios and equally over-the-top characters in a hilariously inappropriate world. Don\'t simply dismiss this show as fanservice. Don\'t simply expect something lame and tedious. Take the extra step and look into that peephole and maybe you can see what this show is truly keeping locked up. it affect the way someone views something. Especially if that someone regards fanservice as wholly negative. Or, I should say, what fanservice has become.Let\'s begin._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Fanservice : What It Means and What It Is]Fanservice, as a term, began as a description of a series, show or film, that gained a following of fans that imposed their views onto the creative staff.

Therefore flanderizing the character and making them more hollow as a result.Fanservice, as a term, grew from there. It evolved to talk about fans of a medium in general. Like anime? Well you have a specific set of things you may like that are generally included in just about every anime there is. For example, this could be the fact that as a whole, a vast majority of hardcore anime fans love seeing cute girls with big tits act clumsy and stupid. So now every show past a certain demographic has a cute, clumsy girl with big sweater puppies. That\'s servicing the fans by creating content that the creators think they\'ll like without the fanbase for that specific piece of work existing yet.This is how a list of certain tropes and archetypes began flooding into anime. Seemingly overnight an influx of certain character types penetrated the industry. These archetypes slowly became tropes which slowly became boring, unoriginal cliches.The last evolution of the term laid with online communities. It simply began meaning having tits in your show. Or ass in your show. Or some kind of romanticization of any of that. Sexy characters doing cute or sexy things. This is where I have to disagree. If a show starts with concrete themes and original ideas that happen to involve sexuality or sex in some way, is that servicing fans? Or is that simply creating a story. If it doesn\'t impact the overall shows quality, in fact, in many casing, adding to the entire concept, should it be dismissed?The answer is no. Throughout my journey through Prison School, there were gross, sleazy shots of these perverse characters. yet none of them felt pandering or exhausting or even sexy. None of it felt like it was there to sell to a lowest common denominator. So either i\'m completely missing something, which I find hard to believe since i\'m generally incredibly critical of ""fanservice"". Or, more logically, the show is simply following a structure. That structure involves batshit insane sexuality, fetishism, and violence. None of it felt pandering. Why? Because it was all played for the theme. More importantly, it was all made to make you laugh._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[The Narrative Jail]We follow five characters as they try and survive a prison that is hilariously located within a school environment. Being sentenced to jail for doing what boys do, peeping, they try to balance relationships, labor, and escaping. If it sounds ridiculous then it\'s doing the trick.This show is solidly insane. The idea is so crazy and hard to believe, it\'s almost crazier to think that I found myself fully buying into it by episode two. An idea can only be stupid if it\'s execution is stupid. If the idea is far-fetched then the writer needs to work extra hard to sell that idea. Whether it\'s through comedy, drama, or flat out surrealism.A lot of this shows premise and comedy that gets drawn out of it comes from the way the story is treated. Instead of having characters constantly break the meta by pointing out the ridiculousness of the situation, they instead double-down on the seriousness. That seriousness transforms into believe-ability as you get just as swept away as the characters do. By treating the situation seriously, the narrative not only sets proper stakes, but also creates a great anti-dichotomy. Both drawing comparisons to how school and prison relate and how they differ.But the show doesn\'t waste time making these kinds of parallels. This is because Prison School doesn\'t waste any time. Period. The first four episodes fly by because their pacing is so incredibly fast. If a joke doesn\'t land, then the one that comes two seconds after may. Its ability to build on a scene and progressively make the situations more and more ridiculous causes this potentially exhausting scenario all the more hilarious and entertaining.What struck me as surprising was the amount of tension this show can build. What was even more surprising was the amount of tension it can build while still being funny as fuck. The pacing services the comedy, the three separate arcs of the show service the tension. When a scene is intense it\'s smartly played as fully serious.The humor comes from the situation, rather than the characters pointing out how stupid the situation is. Which I was so grateful for, since too many shows rest on pointing at something and laughing, rather than explaining the comedy as the scene unravels. By having the characters deal with these stakes that are built up seriously, this show kicks two crows with one stone by creating genuinely intense scenarios with laugh-out-loud results....All my praise goes towards the way the first four episodes were dealt with. They were near-flawless executions of character building, comedic timing, and rising stakes with equally rising absurdity as a result. While the show slows down afterwards, I wouldn\'t necessarily say that was a bad thing. It begins telling the story of all the characters, rather than two of them. Giving each one a reason to be there and add to the story being told.Prison School smartly drops hints and ideas throughout it\'s build-up and has each one of these ideas create an entertaining and thoroughly well-done climax. I\'d say that this show is a regular anime mystery and thriller but in an absurdist scenario, but I\'d be wrong. This is wholly better than any Anime thriller. In fact, this show does better storytelling regardless of the scenario it\'s in.That\'s both thanks to tight narrative structure as well as the characters._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[The Prisoners and Their Masters]The characters in this show are great. Each one has a role to play and each one builds enough of a character never be fully likeable or hateable. Even the seemingly one-dimensional captors get enough time to actually become believable characters within this absolutely insane universe. The secondaries being included in this show are more there for their quirks, however, even they gain some hilarious and interesting things to do as the series progresses. The Chairman in particular is both hilarious and outstanding as the looming hand of god that peers over the school.All five prisoners have their own interesting traits. Even the more hate-able a character becomes they manage to fight their way back into your heart with the writers ability to create scenarios that are heartfelt but also hilarious at the same time.The three captors of these prisoners could have very well served as fetishistic dominatrix porn and nothing else. Yet they are constantly played as both threats, but given enough character to also be interesting in their own scenes as well. Each one, as I\'ve said, has a role to play. I never felt as though I should be turned on by anything in this show, which is a huge plus to the creative team. While I may not personally be into the whole cartoon thing, I can easily recognize when an anime is trying to be erotic and sexy, and when an anime is trying to play something for laughs.This show is undoubtedly exploitative in the way it portrays its characters. However, the amount of which it exploits is where the humor lies. Specifically in the inconceivably ludicrous Vice-President character who carries around a riding crop wearing a short skirt and tits that seem to have a gravity of their own. She\'s subject to probably the most sexuality throughout the series, yet none of if felt lame or pointless. We get these hilarious sleazy shots that are never really questioned in-universe. Her entire character may feel one note, yet they develop that note until it\'s playing a tune.As the Prison School progresses and it\'s journey winds down, so do its characters. Each one feels as though they\'ve been pushed to the brink and only one side may win. In this universe, the idea of Men vs. Women could\'ve been incredibly annoying to me, as i\'m consistently annoyed at anime for making it\'s female characters useless, unrealistic, exploitative, doting, etc. Yet it comes as one of the biggest surprises that I had none of these feelings during the show.While something like No Game No Life infuriated me with it\'s blatant figurine-bait characters with absolutely no depth other than the pockets that the producers were lining... Prison School on the other hand goes the extra mile by creating this competition, Girls vs. Boys, in a way where both sides felt equally capable of defeat.For once, I feel, the females in an anime that was, for the most part, meant for men were given an intimidating role that wasn\'t ever really stripped from them in favor of self-insert bullshit. These girls were awesome. They were memorable. They were exactly what I wanted from villains and it never felt as though they were there to sell....While I wish that towards the ending that every character had a role to play in the finale, it felt as though there was one big story being told that never really involved the lesser developed characters. Unfortunately, this caused a feeling of shoehorning certain characters to wrap up a story, rather than actually creating something that can be seen as a ""perfect"" wrap-up.The ending leaves a lot of room for the future of the show, however, it still provides a decent closer in terms of character development and status._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Art of a Cell Block]The art is mostly great. J.C Staff really put a lot of effort in translating the visuals from the Manga to the series. In fact, i\'m thoroughly impressed with the fact that so many of these characters were drawn with so much detail and effort. The shows style overall suited this oddly gritty environment and it helped sell the entire concept better.The character design in this show is pretty outstanding if I do say so myself. It keeps a mostly realistic style. However, some of the characters are also hilarious unrealistic in terms of design. Both Andre, a fat tiny-faced student, and Meiko, the student council vice-president are incredibly unrealistic in terms of design. They do mesh well with the other characters too, especially since they are the two most fetishistic and fetishized characters.Since a lot of the humor did come from the situation, more specifically, character dealing with a certain situation, J.C staff being able to perfectly translate the hilarious and over-the-top expressions and emotions every character was going through was just brilliant.It felt like what KonoSuba could\'ve been when it comes to creating punchlines through reactions, rather than a flat-out joke being told._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Music]The OP was pretty awful. The ED was pretty bad. That being said, the actual music within the show was flat-out great! A lot of it was thematic, intense, and memorable. I really enjoyed the use of dramatic sound effects to either sell a joke, or a sell a scene as a whole.On occasion some of the sounds did become a little repetitive, however, it didn\'t get to the point where it detracted from the scene as a whole._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Directing]I really didn\'t expect to be talking about direction with this show. Directing in comedy anime has often been fairly weak in terms of creativity. They set up a scene, they deliver it, and the reaction-based comedy does all the work. Two shows stand out from that crowd. Nichijou, and now Prison School. Very different shows, yet equally bursting with creative direction.Tsutomu Mizushima does an outstanding job. I never knew you could be so creative with simple blocking shot utilizing some thicc-as-fuck thighs. There are some genuinely fun PoV shots and some really smart editing. I got some really impressive Edgar Wright vibes from the way some of the scenes were put together.Specifically, certain match-cuts elevated scenes from simply funny to flat-out hilarious. I can\'t emphasize how much editing and directing in general plays a role in how many jokes in a series land. I can\'t think of a single time when a joke in this show fell flat due to an issue in editing or directing, which is some major praise._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Where the Enjoyment Is Derived]This show was outstandingly enjoyable. Although peppered with certain flaws it was, as a whole, a very fun experience. One I\'d recommend experiencing with like-minded friends rather than alone. The ability to hear the tension build as you journey with these characters is amplified by hearing your friends experience the same thing.Prison School isn\'t there to be sold as a marketing tool. In fact, i\'d say a lot of it is crazy and off-the-wall enough to straight up turn off viewers. However, that\'s all the more appealing to me. I love the ""no-fucks given"" attitude that this show takes. The creative freedom the mangaka had when creating this is so well expressed by the animation studio.It goes without saying, but this show is infinitely better being viewed as it was meant to be viewed. Uncensored. I can\'t imagine how awful some of the punchlines and extended scenes of gratuitous violence or fetishism may have been if half the shot was black._____________________________________________________________________________________________________[Conclusion]Prison School is something to be cherished. I feel like I could\'ve easily dismissed it as a fetishistic potential-harem. One-dimensional characters with a limp story that was there only to provide eye-candy. Since I\'m not one to really enjoy something meant to just serve the fans, I was incredibly hesitant with watching this series.However, its ability to convey genuine tension with more genuine laughter hooked me immediately. It wears its motivations on its sleeve, but these motivations aren\'t nearly as sleazy as this shows  scenarios. The motivation is to make you laugh your ass off. I\'d be hard pressed to say that this show didn\'t do that perfectly.The director worked wonders with what he was given and created funny situations significantly more funny with incredibly clever editing and great shot composition throughout. It makes me furious that so many series out there lack this kind of understanding of comedic timing and editing. However, it makes me even more grateful that I was able to watch something that honestly impressed me from a creative directorial standpoint as well as a comedic and storytelling one.While it\'s not lacking flaws, as our protagonists love interests aren\'t nearly as engaging as any other character and the finale could\'ve involved more of the shows characters. The solid audio, standout art, surprisingly deft storytelling, and endlessly memorable and bad-ass characters deserve all the praise I can give this show.Prison School is infinitely enjoyable if you are a fan of over-the-top scenarios and equally over-the-top characters in a hilariously inappropriate world. Don\'t simply dismiss this show as fanservice. Don\'t simply expect something lame and tedious. Take the extra step and look into that peephole and maybe you can see what this show is truly keeping locked up.', ""Prison School was one of the best anime of the season, or at least the most memorable of them.That said this anime is not for everyone.It has a special kind of humor that some people may find offending or just plain vulgar.Anyways I found the anime hilarious in a perverted/twisted kind of way and I can easily say I haven't laughed so much with an anime since a very very long time.SO here it is:Story~7The setting is ideal for the development of an ecchi anime/situation.Pretty straightforward and the anime actually delivers what it promises from the very start.What is interesting is that it actually delivers...something more that is not at all expected.This anime with an unoriginal and very simple and shallow story actually manages to hold a grip on you and make you excited waiting for the next episode.They manage to hype you so much for it and create such intensity that it's amazing how they did it with such a stupid plot....It's so stupid it's amazing....So while the story is plain and unoriginal it flows smoothly and you don't get tired at all watching the anime(with some repetitive gags here and there).So a 7.Character~7I can say that all the characters were likeable.But,most of them were shallow and only there to add to the comedy.The show though was focused on comedy so you can't expect depth of character,so the shallowness is justified.What the show manages to do splendidly though,is making you sympathize with the boys which are portrayed at first as perverted and disgusting.It can also remind us of some phases and thoughts that we had as teenagers(at least for the boys).Sound~7The sound was not something memorable or special.But it managed to highlight and enhance the intensity of the scenes when it was needed so i guess it was pretty okay.(I loved Gakuto's voice acting though and ofc Kiyoshi's which was done by a well known voice actor)Art~9The art is where this anime shined at least for me.The character design was a bit generic and the enviroments and backgrounds plain and mostly gray or black.BUT I gave art a 9 because all the special effects,the facial expressions the BLOOD...they were all used perfectly to complement the anime and the comedy.The facial expressions particularly were absolutely hilarious.I haven't seen something like that anywhere else.It really justifies the 9.Also a reminder.The anime has a LOT of ecchi.Huge breasts naked butts....In most anime I find the overuse of ecchi very annoying.But in this case it was used well to add to the comedy,although it can feel a bit much at times.Enjoyment~9The anime may have flaws and be unoriginal and simple or too vulgar at times.But I really haven't laughed so much since a long time.I consider it one of the best comedy animes ever made.Althouhg most credit should be given to the amazing manga from which this adaptation came.But the adaptation was actually very well made.So props to the anime as well.It should be Noted though (again) that this anime is not for everyone.I know many people wouldn't even consider this as proper comedy.That said,I found it intelligent(in a twisted and perverted kind of way) so if you are into this style of humour then it should be really enjoyable.Overall~8This was a very good and enjoyable anime.But because it can be over the top and somewhat vulgar I really recommend watching the first episode.You will know by then if this anime is for you or not. something more that is not

very good and enjoyable anime.But because it can be over the top and somewhat vulgar I really recommend watching the first episode.You will know by then if this anime is for you or not."", ""I can't even begin to describe how skeptical I was about this anime. I have never watched ecchi before and when I saw the first episode, I was floored by how gross and explicit it was at times. So I dropped it for a while, and then got convinced by my friend to keep on watching when the anime already had 10 episodes. I consumed all of them in one day and I loved it.I have no excuse. This anime is vile, it is disgusting and it is also hilarious. The art is fantastic, very well drawn, the music fits the show incredibly well,...the voice actors do all sorts of ridiculous things and it's just... the ultimate guilty pleasure, I should think. The fact that they got such bigshot seiyuus to voice this speaks for itself, I should think.Overall, if you're not too squeamish (there's lots of cleavage, butt humor and also public defecation – not explicit but it's still there – then go for it. This anime will definitely be remembered.Honestly, though, I still have no idea why I like it, I just do, and so do many other people. I was very interested in seeing the ending, and if there is a season two, I will definitely watch it (much to the horror of my more PG-13 friends). the voice actors do all sorts of ridiculous things and it's just... the ultimate guilty pleasure, I should think.

I was very interested in seeing the ending, and if there is a season two, I will definitely watch it (much to the horror of my more PG-13 friends)."", 'Story (5): First and foremost, this series is not meant to be taken seriously, and I think a lot of people fail to recognize that before starting it. It\'s pretty much a parody; it\'s the unapologetic, over the top ecchiness/comedy that manages to carry the ridiculous setting/plot line and the series sticks to its guns in that regard. Take out the fan service/ecchiness (its essence), you essentially have a thin, slice of life story about high school boys being... high school boys. If you\'re completely opposed to sex jokes and are2edgy (as there already seems to be indications of elsewhere) well, don\'t watch. Idk what...else you would expect after reading the premise. I mean the cover picture alone should tell you enough about its target audience/genre. My story score of 5 though is trying to be objective as possible keeping said people in mind, along with the other different types of anime enthusiasts, but honestly if this series is up your alley in terms of comedy/open mindedness to ecchiness you\'ll definitely rate it higher.Here is an interesting side note about the mangaka I\'ve read in various discussions online; His previous main series, Ore to Akuma no Blues, was a much more serious-toned manga about the historical American South/Blues scene that apparently did not do very well sales wise and subsequently prompted him to present works to his editor that were ridiculously over the top in fan service (aka Prison School) catered to the general public. Ironically enough, Prison School to date has become his biggest success lol.Art (10): If there is anything that this series outshines all others in, it\'s the art. Obviously it looks pretty in HD animation, but to get a better idea of how skilled the mangaka\'s drawings are all you need do is see a random page out of the Prison School manga as compared to any other random manga. This being an Ecchi work only enhances this. What I love most personally is that the character facial features tend to be of more ""realistic"" proportions, as in not the traditional super large eyes with barely visible nose, if one exists at all. On top of that, each significant character\'s face is subtly distinct from one another where they can be somewhat distinguished from face alone (like Kiyoshi\'s face compared to Shingo\'s), as compared to completely relying on different hair style/color in other media. The appreciation of this becomes a little more apparent in the would-be characters introduced in a potential season 2. IMHO it\'s the best art I\'ve seen in manga/anime period.Sound (8): The OP/ED are apparently anime original, and IMO nothing special. Not bad, but not something I would listen to by itself. The overall soundtrack chosen though for the actual episode content I feel was very, very well done. From well timed over the top, traditional orchestra to emphasize the comedic/parody aspects talked about above, to the Chinese instrumental music to accompany Gakuto and the Three Kingdoms, everything is well timed/appropriately chosen. Overall, the sound/music thoroughly enhances the entire comedic value this show has to offer.Characters (7): Character development wise there isn\'t anything too significant to squeeze in within the given 12 episodes. More manga content would have to be adapted to see that. However, from the male protagonists perspective, what you get throughout the story is high school male bonding at its finest, with the plot doing everything it can to test said male bonds/friendships. Character wise, the MC (Kiyoshi) is used to connect to the viewers as he is the most ""normal"" of the bunch (Shingo as well, but he isn\'t the MC). The other male characters, though relatable in some respects, all have hilariously unique/original quirks that drive the story\'s comedy. The girls likewise are all uniquely (sadistically) distinct from each other, though in some of respects contain many cliche anime tropes. The best aspect of the characters though is the relationships in the unique rapport/wit built between each individual male prisoner/female overseer, from labels like ""Brown Thunder"" to ""Masochistic Slave"" lol.Enjoyment (9): Like I said, if you understand going into the series that this show embodies ecchiness/fan service/sex driven comedy to its very core, you will enjoy it. If you\'re looking for something serious/more meaningful in its theme or message, why the f*ck would you choose to watch this? As a male in his mid 20s, I found this to be one of the best comedies I\'ve had in a long while, that former detail being very important.Overall (8): Again, I will reiterate for a third and last time, understand what you\'re getting into beforehand by realizing the genre/type of audience this show is catered to. Though the story premise is ridiculous, the mangaka does a great job at unabashedly recognizing that and turns said ridiculousness into all out ""I can\'t believe that just happened"" comedy that is ultimately enhanced by the superb art/sound, making it a highly rated overall experience for me. If you\'re not into ecchi/sex jokes I can understandably see why you wouldn\'t rate highly of the show, but I wouldn\'t be able to understand what compelled you to watch the show in its entirety in the first place. Seriously, you\'ll be able to tell within the first 2 episodes whether you like the series or not.This was my first review btw, I tried my best to be somewhat balanced in bringing to light what this show is really all about while also addressing some points to those who will have a problem with it. else you would expect after reading the premise.

I was surprise by how much it surprised me. It's definitely not for everyone but for the people that don't mind a story that really only takes place in one area this is a very good choice.Art and Animation (10/10) MasterpieceI'm going to start taking about both art and animation in this section for now on. Animation must be talked about. So both Art...and Animation is done by J.C. Staff Studio and I have to give it to these guys that they have to be the best at creating ecchi series they've done quite a lot in the past if you look up their resume but this one has to be the best and their budget and work put behind it speaks for itself.Sound (10/10) MasterpieceThe character's voice acting, anime opening and ending, sound effects, and BGM all outstanding. I have to wear my surround sound headphones when watching this series when the series when it starts to get serious and their BGM starts to play the dramatic scenes really feel so much more impact with the choice of music that they have made you have to be deaf retard to not give them a perfect score in the section.Characters (10/10) OutstandingThe character roster in Prison School for what type of genre anime this is understand is at the top of it's food chain. Not once have I personally watched an anime to have such an interesting cast of characters on both the protagonist group and the antagonist group every character that was introduce felt relevant and outstanding.Enjoyment (10/10) OutstandingOther than majority of episode 1 (basically till the end of episode one with the Hana scene) every episode in this 12 episode anime had me hooked in with enjoyment. The opening and ending song i love and the comedy in this anime is amazing not a lot of comedy anime these days are actually funny to me. I was always excited to watch a Prison School episode because none felt like a waste and it never disappointed me.Overall (9/10) GreatMore Specifically (9.60/10) Great+Prison School was flat out amazing to me it's definitely my favorite anime and also in my opinion as far as this Summer Season of Anime of 2015 the best one. Maybe is I watched Rokka No Yusha which I heard is better than it my opinion may have been different but I didn't so don't disagree with what I think is the best because I haven't seen things people say are better, so to me Prison School is the best anime of the summer season of anime for 2015, it's also the most surprisingly impressive on also. I thought I would give this series a high 7 to mid 8 I have no clue it would be so close to a 10 for me and it deserves to be this high. I hope that J.C. Staff makes a season 2 because they setup for it at the end of episode 12 which you would assume they would make another but you know nothing is guaranteed these days but this series deserves it! and Animation is done by J.C. Staff Studio and I have to give it to these guys that they have to be the best at creating ecchi series they've done quite a lot in the past if you look up their resume but this one has to be the best and their budget and work put behind it speaks for itself.Sound (10/10) MasterpieceThe character's voice acting, anime opening and ending, sound effects, and BGM all outstanding. I have to wear my surround sound headphones when watching this series when the series when it starts to get serious and their BGM starts to play the dramatic scenes really feel so much more impact with the choice of music that they have made you have to be deaf retard to not give them a perfect score in the section.Characters (10/10) OutstandingThe character roster in Prison School for what type of genre anime this is understand is at the top of it's food chain. Not once have I personally watched an anime to have such an interesting cast of characters on both the protagonist group and the antagonist group every character that was introduce felt relevant and outstanding.Enjoyment (10/10) OutstandingOther than majority of episode 1 (basically till the end of episode one with the Hana scene) every episode in this 12 episode anime had me hooked in with enjoyment.

I kept my eye on it and waited for all 12 episodes to be released, and boy am I glad I did.I appreciate what some would call immature humour, that is, sex jokes (or any related ""taboo"" subject).

There is a ridiculous amount of boobage in this series, however, I managed to get over it for the sake of the comedy. If unnecessary cleavage and gratuitous up-skirt shots are a dealbreaker for you, then perhaps this anime is not for you, though I still recommend attempting to watch up to the 3rd episode; if you get that far and still do not appreciate the humour over your distaste for the ecchi, then you can honestly say that you did truly attempt to watch the show.Though honestly, I have recommended and shown this anime to a total of 8 of my friends (so far), and every single one of them thoroughly enjoyed the show (even those completely against ecchi).Personally I found myself laughing so hard and having to hold my sides from the pain, it was that good.

Spoilers ahead!)Prison has a lot negative connotations attached to it. Prison is a place where the wrongdoers of society go as punishment for their crimes against humanity. From killing to theft, prison is designed as a correctional institute. Whether or not that actually happens is a topic for another day, but at the minimum prison, as people know it, is a place that you do not want to end up.Prison School is the same. “School” in the title should not fool anyone; this prison is more like a torture chamber than a place of reform. That sounds...absurd – and it is – but that is exactly what the anime thrives on: absurdity. Of course there are other undeniable motifs throughout the show but those, too, always have their absurdity cranked up to eleven and then some.Speaking about myself, I have never been to prison (and I plan to keep it that way forever). Furthermore neither my immediate nor extended family has ever had anyone in prison. My father did go to his local jail once when he was in his late teens, though. He and his friends had gotten into a scuffle with others, landing them all in a jail cell for the night. “But I wasn’t scared of the place,” my father always says when recounting this small tale, “I was scared of what my dad was going to do me when he found out.” And that surmises Prison School pretty well: it is not the prison, but the people, that should be feared.STORYIn order to understand Prison School, one has to be prepared for the absence of shame. This anime is not afraid to debase itself. By never being ashamed, the anime achieves its comedy through a variety of means that, ultimately, lead into the bigger picture of this show.The first of these means is the over-the-top scenarios the characters constantly find themselves in. While this is a realistic show in the sense that the setting, people, and outcomes are seen in everyday life, Prison School always makes sure to go one step further. For instance, Andre keeps a diary detailing all of his punishments, but the cutesy, kiddy nature of the violent depictions makes the diary more like a children’s book rather than a fetish-filled notebook. Similar is during the arm-wrestling match. During Kiyoshi’s turn, he gets sent into a daze when he sees the vice-president’s nipple. A daze so deep that he does not notice that his arm has been essentially twisted backwards. These types of scenes work as well as they do because of the contrast between the reality of the show and the imaginary portrayal that the aspects often take.Prison School does not always lean on the ridiculous to elicit laughs from its audience. The anime can actually be quite clever with its jokes, relying on its context and its expectations to use yet another form of comedy. One of the earlier examples of this is when Kiyoshi and Gakuto are together in the shower. Shingo misunderstands the situation; from his and subsequently the audience’s point-of-view, Kiyoshi and Gakuto appear to be taking part in a “don’t drop the soap” scene, utilizing a known prison trope. Another example is when the gang forgives Shingo for his misdeeds, apparently upholding that friendship comes first. But after he confesses what he had been doing with Anzu, specifically her “downblouse and nip-slip”, the boys proceed to beat the snot out of him. Again, these scenes are funny because they both rely on the context of the given setting and on the flipping of initial expectations.For Prison School, it takes the ridiculousness and the cleverness to get at its next brand of comedy. The show has a weird focus on both domination and degradation. The women in the anime are, sexually speaking, dominatrix. They whip the prisoners, they are evil towards the prisoners, and they look down on the prisoners. That is to say, the women are constantly put on a pedestal above the men. Granted, the men do have their dominating moments, too. Gakuto smashing his prized figurines and Andre’s nipple hair, while not directly dominating the women, are events where they overpower their captors. Yet the anime also does the complete opposite. Meiko is known to sweat profusely due to the sheer gravitas of their leader. Hana at one point is peed on. Mari, the student council president, unbeknownst to her, eats a handful of dirty peanuts. As for the men, they usually occupy this camp. They are constantly humiliated throughout the season, such as when Gakuto defecates himself on purpose to get a sound-clip of some bathroom noises or Kiyoshi makes the stupidest face possible when taking a selfie with Chiyo.But Prison School shines brightest when it combines these features simultaneously, achieving a harmony of domi-grading proportions. A highlight from the show is Hana’s “Medusa”, encapsulating the power she holds over the situation while also insulting her severely with the comparison to an ugly, mythological snake-creature. These dominating and degrading scenes would presumably not be comedic due to the definition of the words; watching someone get mercilessly abused or lambasted is not normally funny. But because they are as crazy and inventive as they end up being, the show manages to make even these touchy subjects fun.However, all of these separate examples demonstrate where the comedy is most often derived: sex. Without a doubt,Prison School’s most utilized asset is sex, sexual exploits a way to obtain the trifecta that is absurdity, shame, and comedy. Otherwise known as “ecchi” content, the anime rarely has nonsexual downtime, and due to the amount of sex, there are no boundaries for the show. The sexual content can reach quite the crude levels. In-your-face calisthenics, “mushroom” touching, and a butt-shaped mouse pad are merely a sampling of the perverted material that the show regularly presents in a comedic fashion. This should not be taken lightly. Whether it is the vice-president wearing a much-too-tight outfit or the Kurhiara sisters touching the tube that Kiyoshi had equipped minutes before, sex permeates the anime like pornography fills the Internet.Interestingly the sexual content is not just used for comedic purposes. Sex also plays a meaningful role as well. To be fair, the anime does have sexual moments that are purely aimed at arousal; the Meiko cleaning the president’s body in the shower or Meiko (a lot of the sex revolves around the vice-president…) getting her underwear caught on a door handle serves little else than to please the audience. But even these moments, like the more meaningful, drive Prison School. “Drive” in every sense of the word. The plot begins only because the boys are deviants – peeping on the girls in the bathroom. Their biggest motivational factor is sex – the feeling of a girl’s chest pressed against their face and the prospect of a wet T-shirt contest. How they escape from sticky situations – explaining the evolution of the female body and an intense make-out session. The teenage boys’ hormones more or less force them forward. Thus sex is not just used for comedy or for pleasure. Sex is what pushes the narrative along.Taken together, there is more to Prison School than meets the eye. Intriguingly, Prison School can be interpreted allegorically. People are driven by sex. Scientifically speaking, everyone is programmed to seek out sex as a means for genetic propagation. Sex is an inherent, and indeed natural, part of life. This can be extended beyond humanity and to society; entertainment like Prison School uses sex as a selling point because that is what people are drawn to. Sex controls people, influences people. In other words, sex makes people prisoners to themselves. That is the metaphor. The prison in Prison School represents the dominating hold that sex has on the lives people lead. And as was said, sex is both the cause and the savior within the narrative. So paradoxically sex is something that is always around even when it is not and allegorically sex is something that is inescapable.Whether or not this interpretation is true is certainly up for debate, but regardless Prison School executes every part of its narrative as best as it can. The comedy is diverse, the “ecchi” content is purposeful, and the ending – the three main women going to the prison, providing some satisfying role-reversal and full-circle framing – is as successful as it could be. Meaning, shame or no shame, the anime easily made bail.ANIMATIONUnfortunately for Prison School, the anime sees a small step down in the artistic and animation department. This is almost entirely at the hands of the censoring that is overly employed. Crotches are blackened out and beams of light cover chests, obviously getting in the way of the “ecchi” content. Given that the sex is such an integral part to the show, hiding a sizeable portion of it behind censorship is nothing short of a bad move.The rest of the art is a different story. Despite the show taking place in pretty much the exact same area – the school-grounds prison – Prison School gets quite inventive with the way in which it presents everything. The camera direction especially sees a variety of angles, perspectives, and zooms, giving the anime a dynamic feel that fits comfortably with the craziness that the events are so often steeped in. This craziness likewise gives the show the chance to be as imaginative as possible. Gakuto’s historic idols drinking together or Kiyoshi defending butts over boobs are chances for the show to get away from the prison and the school while also remaining contextually relevant and adding to its comedy. Speaking of comedy, the anime also focuses on the reactions of the characters. Andre getting desperate, Joe looking murderous, and Shingo acting creepy take advantage of the anime’s over-the-top tendencies, which in turn produce even more comedic moments. Most notably is Hana, whose face goes through every range of emotion – insanity, pleasure, and anger to name a few.The character designs are a mixed offering. Kiyoshi is decidedly plain, his short hair and normal looks meant for the audience to self-insert themselves as him. This works but the result is that his design is rather boring, especially compared to the rest of the cast. Shingo is similar, although his slick-backed blonde hair and “Yankee” face give him a cool vibe. Chiyo and Anzu, the women who have a romantic relationship with Kiyoshi and Shingo respectively, are likewise plain in their designs – cute faces and shoulder-length brown hair. It is not until Mari, Chiyo’s older sister and the student council president, do the designs start to flourish. Her long black hair, leg-long black tights, and icy, teal eyes paint her as not just the leader but as someone to be feared. Her and Chiyo’s father dons a trimmed mustache and a blue tie, turning him into quite the gentleman. Andre’s small face, huge stature, and floppy ears create a walking clown. Joe’s defined but hidden face and small height make him an enigma. Hana’s loose pants are meant for easier karate movement but they also reduce her overall sex appeal, contrasting with the other women of the show and with her (unintentional) perverted habits. But the best design goes to Meiko. Her absurdly large breasts, glasses, and gray-with-bun hair give her a very mature look, coinciding with her commanding position. Her knee-high black boots and leather riding crop add further to her dominatrix personality and persona, collectively making her design the most intricate of the bunch.For all of the designs, everyone has very refined contours, shadows, and detail that makes them realistic and impactful, regardless of how boring some might be. These highly detailed designs surprisingly do not get in the way of the amount of animation that is used. Prison School does have a sizeable chunk of “visible” animation – eyes can go chaotic, limbs fly during violent segments, and breasts jiggle. But there are also subtle movements like twitching and hair ruffling that exist to keep the anime flowing. A possible explanation may be due to the fact that the anime prides itself on capturing each ridiculous moment. Meaning, the anime constantly has prolonged shots of the characters’ faces or the current situation. This consequently reduces the overall amount of animation for those scenes but the trade-off is that the more involved ones receive even more animation. It is a trade-off, one in which Prison Schooldiscovered a nice balance.CHARACTERSThe cast of Prison School are not complex characters in the slightest. For the most part, they are made up solely of their base characterizations. Given the comedy-centric direction, this makes perfect sense; Kiyoshi the straight-man, Gakuto the hobbyist, Shingo the dude, Andre the gentle giant, and Joe the reserved. The same line of thinking can be applied to the women; Mari the vixen, Meiko the buff, and Hana the psycho. The characters are who they are and not much more.“Not much” because there is thought put into some of the characters. Mari, the student council president, is infamous for her adoration and control of crows. Crows are intelligent creatures, some of the smartest nonhuman animals on the planet. They are also ominous; their pitch-black feathers and foreboding cry are creepy, especially when these birds fly in flocks. No better bird symbolizes the equally intelligent and ominous Mari. But as the anime depicts, Mari is not as smart or as scary as one is lead to believe. Her plan falls through and while she has a deep-seeded hatred for men – most likely the result of a disconnect with her father – she is regularly shown to care for all of the women. She offers them positions, she shares tea with them, and in Hana’s case, she stops her from doing any more damage than has already been done when she takes a punch meant for Kiyoshi for herself. In other words, Mari has an inversion about her that makes her the opposite of what she appears to be.Hana is also an interesting character in her own right. Arguably she is the least attractive of the women, mostly because of her personality, looks, and actions. But she, more than any of the women, finds herself always at the brunt end of the stick. Simultaneously, she is the most immature in the sense that she has no idea what an erection is or how to kiss. Again, there is an inversion present, one that flips the audience’s perception of her.Ultimately inversion is what the characters rely on to achieve their brand of comedy. Andre is a very calm and very nice person, thus his love of punishment and lack of receiving it is comedic. Meiko acting high and mighty towards the boys but then going fully submissive towards Mari is comedic. Chiyo’s father nonchalantly having pornography lying around when his daughter is nearby is comedic.Inversion, like the sexual material, also does more than act as a comedic crutch. Looking at Shingo’s character throughout the season, he was initially placed on the wayside. It was not until Kiyoshi and Gakuto were caught that he more or less takes center stage during the season. When he learns of Kiyoshi’s behavior – that he had gone behind his, Andre’s, and Joe’s backs in order to meet up with some girl and that he had caused their prison stay to lengthen – he shuns Kiyoshi, mistreating him as much as possible. Yet, when presented with the opportunity to do the exact same as Kiyoshi (technically he did even more by getting free meals, going outside, and personally betraying his friends), he does not hesitate. It was hypocritical, or considering the discussion, it was an inversion of his character. And it is this same inversion that he witnesses with a bunch of young kids that opens his eyes to how childish he had been. In the end he realizes the error of his ways and the group comes together once more, appropriately enough ending on a joke relying on inversion.Gakuto is also a prime example of the anime’s reliance on inversion. Gakuto is a bit of an oddball. He is obsessed with history and speaks in a strange manner. He is also very respectful, a trait derived from the previous two. But despite what he does or says, he rarely acts selfish. That is to say, Gakuto might seem like an attention seeker but he is the first to sacrifice himself before anyone. Embarrassing himself in front of the whole school, destroying his prized figures, and refusing to “besmirch” (Gakuto’s words) Chiyo’s clothes are just a sampling of the individual instances where Gakuto chooses his friends over himself.Friendships feed directly into relationships, another staple of Prison School. Kiyoshi’s relationship with both Chiyo and Hana is bizarre. The former is more or less a lie – he does not really like sumo wrestling and he never told her the truth about the peeping – whereas the latter goes way too far for mere acquaintances. Furthermore, Kiyoshi’s crow-helping and butt-worshipping has made him into, according to the Kurihara family members, not a “bad” guy. To put it differently, Kiyoshi having a relationship with them requires him to uphold quite the niche stipulation. Joe has his ants that mean more to him than any girl could – the final sequence shows all of the boys with a woman except Joe who, coincidentally enough, is with his ants. But the most important set of relationships within the anime are the ones between the men. They each have those moments where they forget the others – Kiyoshi going on his date, Shingo sneaking out, Andre succumbing to depravity, Joe overcome with venomous rage, and, surprisingly yes, Gakuto ignoring Kiyoshi for some period. Their time in prison seemingly breaks the friendships they had. However, through their determination for each other (and for sex), the boys rise above their misdeeds. Each person, at one point or another, apologizes and, like friends do, they forgive them, reconstructing their bonds to be even stronger than before. And this is what the characters represent thematically. What gets somebody through tough times is not some figurines or a few ants or even a personal diary. What gets somebody through tough times are the people that person holds dear.According to Prison School, relationships are coveted. Thus, the only prominent time in which the cast weakens is when these relationships are prevented from developing. This stunted growth is caused by the disproportionate on-screen time. The show focuses mainly on Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Meiko, and Hana, and to be fair this makes sense since they are arguably the funniest characters in the anime. And given that this is a comedy, having the most fun cast members at the front more so than the others is a logical move. Still, Andre and Joe are hardly used throughout the season, both receiving two, very brief spotlights (Andre with his non-punishment and nipple hair, and Joe with his ants and deception). Arguably again, Andre and Joe exist just for their silly personas and nothing more, and given that there are the other three boys and a handful of girls to focus on, those two not getting much attention is somewhat understandable.But there is still the issue of Shingo – who has no presence in the beginning, takes over briefly, then disappears again – and Mari – who is technically the kingpin of the whole fiasco but is rarely shown doing much of anything. So, dissimilar to the animation, Prison School misses the balance in regards to its characters and their on-screen time. This has a domino effect: less of the characters means less foundation for the relationships they share with the others, a dampening in the relationships hurts the theme, and damaging the theme lowers the overall execution of the anime.SOUNDThe opening theme is rock-and-roll heavy, but what it champions is the theme the show’s characters symbolize; switching off the vocalists achieves that friendship feel. The piece is also satirical, the hard instruments contrasting with the silly lyrics. Yet the lyrics also correlate to the allegorical interpretation presented earlier. “The heart is an endless love prison” gets at the notion that what one feels makes us prisoners to ourselves. Repetition is also prevalent. In the context of Prison School, the repetition symbolizes the repetitive nature that a stay in prison induces. Combined with the actual composition of the track, there is no denying the strength of the OP.As is common with ending themes, the ED forms a dichotomy with the OP, taking more of a party route. At the minimum the ED is more relaxed than the OP. The ED also aims at the other focus of the show; showing the different women in suggestive poses mirrors the anime’s content and, once again, reflects the manlier opening theme. The song itself is lighthearted, catchy, and fun and, like the OP, the lyrics reinforce the allegory: “Falling in love with someone is a trap programmed into our genes”. It is a silly song, one that rests comfortably among Prison School’s comedic origins.Voice acting for the show also has a high amount of quality. Katsuyuki Konishi as Gakuto hits a home run, his honorifics, his honorable tone, and his quickness of speech fitting the character perfectly. Kana Hanazawa as Hana proved that she could provide a voice that was less cutesy and more guttural, her angry voice capturing the oft-angry girl well. Shizuka Itou as Meiko also deserves a shout-out for giving the mature, dominating girl the womanly and commanding voice that she needed. And one would be remiss if Chinami Hashimoto as Chiyo was not given some kind of praise. In one of her first big roles, her girly voice demonstrated that she has a future in the voice acting business.Akin to the censoring, the sound-work takes a slight step down in the original soundtrack department. The majority of the tracks are there for the mood and little else. A heavenly track for the sexual moments, orchestral ensembles to raise tension, and guitar strings for the triumphant victories, to sample a few. While they do increase the level of emotion for their respective scenes, the OST is by no means a memorable outing, especially when compared to the rest of the music let alone the rest of the anime.ENJOYMENTThis anime is a doozy.I do not fault anyone for avoiding this show based purely on the amount of violence, perversion, and insanity that it contains. While I would not say that this is a show for the faint of heart, this is a show that requires a bit of tolerance on the viewer’s end. Realistically, given the “seinen” genre tag, someone going into this one should know it is meant for a more mature audience, so maybe a warning of any kind is not warranted.Regardless, I found this show nothing short of hilarious. The altercations between Kiyoshi and Hana were especially funny. The funniest part during their final spat was not the Medusa or the vigorous making-out. It was when Kiyoshi gave Hana “permission” to hit him as payback, but after the seventh or so punch (the sound-effects and animation during this segment are top-notch) he desperately asks her to stop because he did not realize it would hurt so much. Afterwards, too, where the other boys were flabbergasted at what exactly could have gone down in the office, capped off this episodes-spanning scene nicely.But Hana also induces one of my biggest peeves with the anime: the faux romantic relationship between her and Kiyoshi. Obviously Kiyoshi likes Chiyo and Chiyo likes Kiyoshi. Nobody can deny that. And I loved seeing them care about each other. Chiyo standing up against her tyrant of a sister for Kiyoshi and Kiyoshi going so far as to cross-dress in order to fulfill his promise to Chiyo made my heart flutter. So when Hana showed up, sharing her privacy, sidling up next to Kiyoshi, and even stealing his first kiss, made me not angry or annoyed but sad. Sad because I know how Kiyoshi and Chiyo feel about one another and sad because Chiyo deserves better. Chiyo is sweet, thoughtful, and compassionate, so seeing her relationship with Kiyoshi tampered with – worse still, all of it happening without her knowing – just did not sit right with me. I am aware that this was all done for comedic purposes. Kiyoshi also justifies that the kiss was not his “true” first and even if it was what mattered most was him succeeding in his endeavor so that he and his friends could stay and that he could spend more time with Chiyo. But being the romance aficionado that I am, watching Kiyoshi and Chiyo’s pure relationship constantly messed up by Hana saddened me.This was a minor grievance. The rest of the anime, truth be told, consistently put a smile on my face. Gakuto’s dumb analogies, Meiko unsure if she should point out the redundancy of “DTO Operation”, Shingo amazed as Anzu stepped over him in the movie theater, Kiyoshi unable to stop himself from continuing to argue the superiority of butts over boobs, and the way Chiyo’s father talked were all moments that had me laughing. Likewise, the over-the-top, sexual, and degrading comedy was impossible to sit through without chuckling out loud. I remember always saying something to the effect of “This show…” every time something completely absurd happened. That was practically what the anime mostly ended up doing, so I was saying that phrase more times than I would care to admit.Prison School accomplishes a lot over the span of twelve episodes. The comedy always works wonders, the artistic direction is flavorful, and the cast represents more than just their base characteristics. The censoring, unbalanced character focus, and the competent OST are issues, but the symbolic opening theme and the utter absurdity of the events highlight the anime’s high degree of execution in many of its categories. Thinking about it now, this may be one prison worth checking out.SUMMARYStory: Great, the diverse range of comedy, the purposeful sexual content, and the allegorical narrative create a well-rounded and well-executed experienceAnimation: Fine, gross censoring, very nice camera work, imaginative artistic direction, both boring and inventive character designs, and above average actual animationCharacters: Good, the cast is designed with comedy in mind, and they represent inversion and friendship, but disproportionate attention hampers its relationship themeSound: Good, good OP, good ED, okay OST, above average VA performancesEnjoyment: Good, a hilarious romp, soured only by Hana messing with Kiyoshi and Chiyo’s romantic relationshipFinal Score: 7/10 absurd – and it is – but that is exactly what the anime thrives on: absurdity. Of course there are other undeniable motifs throughout the show but those, too, always have their absurdity cranked up to eleven and then some.Speaking about myself, I have never been to prison (and I plan to keep it that way forever). Furthermore neither my immediate nor extended family has ever had anyone in prison. My father did go to his local jail once when he was in his late teens, though. He and his friends had gotten into a scuffle with others, landing them all in a jail cell for the night. “But I wasn’t scared of the place,” my father always says when recounting this small tale, “I was scared of what my dad was going to do me when he found out.” And that surmises Prison School pretty well: it is not the prison, but the people, that should be feared.STORYIn order to understand Prison School, one has to be prepared for the absence of shame. This anime is not afraid to debase itself. By never being ashamed, the anime achieves its comedy through a variety of means that, ultimately, lead into the bigger picture of this show.The first of these means is the over-the-top scenarios the characters constantly find themselves in. While this is a realistic show in the sense that the setting, people, and outcomes are seen in everyday life, Prison School always makes sure to go one step further. For instance, Andre keeps a diary detailing all of his punishments, but the cutesy, kiddy nature of the violent depictions makes the diary more like a children’s book rather than a fetish-filled notebook. Similar is during the arm-wrestling match. During Kiyoshi’s turn, he gets sent into a daze when he sees the vice-president’s nipple. A daze so deep that he does not notice that his arm has been essentially twisted backwards. These types of scenes work as well as they do because of the contrast between the reality of the show and the imaginary portrayal that the aspects often take.Prison School does not always lean on the ridiculous to elicit laughs from its audience. The anime can actually be quite clever with its jokes, relying on its context and its expectations to use yet another form of comedy. One of the earlier examples of this is when Kiyoshi and Gakuto are together in the shower. Shingo misunderstands the situation; from his and subsequently the audience’s point-of-view, Kiyoshi and Gakuto appear to be taking part in a “don’t drop the soap” scene, utilizing a known prison trope. Another example is when the gang forgives Shingo for his misdeeds, apparently upholding that friendship comes first. But after he confesses what he had been doing with Anzu, specifically her “downblouse and nip-slip”, the boys proceed to beat the snot out of him. Again, these scenes are funny because they both rely on the context of the given setting and on the flipping of initial expectations.For Prison School, it takes the ridiculousness and the cleverness to get at its next brand of comedy. The show has a weird focus on both domination and degradation. The women in the anime are, sexually speaking, dominatrix. They whip the prisoners, they are evil towards the prisoners, and they look down on the prisoners. That is to say, the women are constantly put on a pedestal above the men. Granted, the men do have their dominating moments, too. Gakuto smashing his prized figurines and Andre’s nipple hair, while not directly dominating the women, are events where they overpower their captors. Yet the anime also does the complete opposite. Meiko is known to sweat profusely due to the sheer gravitas of their leader. Hana at one point is peed on. Mari, the student council president, unbeknownst to her, eats a handful of dirty peanuts. As for the men, they usually occupy this camp. They are constantly humiliated throughout the season, such as when Gakuto defecates himself on purpose to get a sound-clip of some bathroom noises or Kiyoshi makes the stupidest face possible when taking a selfie with Chiyo.But Prison School shines brightest when it combines these features simultaneously, achieving a harmony of domi-grading proportions. A highlight from the show is Hana’s “Medusa”, encapsulating the power she holds over the situation while also insulting her severely with the comparison to an ugly, mythological snake-creature. These dominating and degrading scenes would presumably not be comedic due to the definition of the words; watching someone get mercilessly abused or lambasted is not normally funny. But because they are as crazy and inventive as they end up being, the show manages to make even these touchy subjects fun.However, all of these separate examples demonstrate where the comedy is most often derived: sex. Without a doubt,Prison School’s most utilized asset is sex, sexual exploits a way to obtain the trifecta that is absurdity, shame, and comedy. Otherwise known as “ecchi” content, the anime rarely has nonsexual downtime, and due to the amount of sex, there are no boundaries for the show. The sexual content can reach quite the crude levels. In-your-face calisthenics, “mushroom” touching, and a butt-shaped mouse pad are merely a sampling of the perverted material that the show regularly presents in a comedic fashion. This should not be taken lightly. Whether it is the vice-president wearing a much-too-tight outfit or the Kurhiara sisters touching the tube that Kiyoshi had equipped minutes before, sex permeates the anime like pornography fills the Internet.Interestingly the sexual content is not just used for comedic purposes. Sex also plays a meaningful role as well. To be fair, the anime does have sexual moments that are purely aimed at arousal; the Meiko cleaning the president’s body in the shower or Meiko (a lot of the sex revolves around the vice-president…) getting her underwear caught on a door handle serves little else than to please the audience. But even these moments, like the more meaningful, drive Prison School. “Drive” in every sense of the word. The plot begins only because the boys are deviants – peeping on the girls in the bathroom. Their biggest motivational factor is sex – the feeling of a girl’s chest pressed against their face and the prospect of a wet T-shirt contest. How they escape from sticky situations – explaining the evolution of the female body and an intense make-out session. The teenage boys’ hormones more or less force them forward. Thus sex is not just used for comedy or for pleasure. Sex is what pushes the narrative along.Taken together, there is more to Prison School than meets the eye. Intriguingly, Prison School can be interpreted allegorically. People are driven by sex. Scientifically speaking, everyone is programmed to seek out sex as a means for genetic propagation. Sex is an inherent, and indeed natural, part of life. This can be extended beyond humanity and to society; entertainment like Prison School uses sex as a selling point because that is what people are drawn to. Sex controls people, influences people. In other words, sex makes people prisoners to themselves. That is the metaphor. The prison in Prison School represents the dominating hold that sex has on the lives people lead. And as was said, sex is both the cause and the savior within the narrative. So paradoxically sex is something that is always around even when it is not and allegorically sex is something that is inescapable.Whether or not this interpretation is true is certainly up for debate, but regardless Prison School executes every part of its narrative as best as it can. The comedy is diverse, the “ecchi” content is purposeful, and the ending – the three main women going to the prison, providing some satisfying role-reversal and full-circle framing – is as successful as it could be. Meaning, shame or no shame, the anime easily made bail.ANIMATIONUnfortunately for Prison School, the anime sees a small step down in the artistic and animation department. This is almost entirely at the hands of the censoring that is overly employed. Crotches are blackened out and beams of light cover chests, obviously getting in the way of the “ecchi” content. Given that the sex is such an integral part to the show, hiding a sizeable portion of it behind censorship is nothing short of a bad move.The rest of the art is a different story. Despite the show taking place in pretty much the exact same area – the school-grounds prison – Prison School gets quite inventive with the way in which it presents everything. The camera direction especially sees a variety of angles, perspectives, and zooms, giving the anime a dynamic feel that fits comfortably with the craziness that the events are so often steeped in. This craziness likewise gives the show the chance to be as imaginative as possible. Gakuto’s historic idols drinking together or Kiyoshi defending butts over boobs are chances for the show to get away from the prison and the school while also remaining contextually relevant and adding to its comedy. Speaking of comedy, the anime also focuses on the reactions of the characters. Andre getting desperate, Joe looking murderous, and Shingo acting creepy take advantage of the anime’s over-the-top tendencies, which in turn produce even more comedic moments. Most notably is Hana, whose face goes through every range of emotion – insanity, pleasure, and anger to name a few.The character designs are a mixed offering. Kiyoshi is decidedly plain, his short hair and normal looks meant for the audience to self-insert themselves as him. This works but the result is that his design is rather boring, especially compared to the rest of the cast. Shingo is similar, although his slick-backed blonde hair and “Yankee” face give him a cool vibe. Chiyo and Anzu, the women who have a romantic relationship with Kiyoshi and Shingo respectively, are likewise plain in their designs – cute faces and shoulder-length brown hair. It is not until Mari, Chiyo’s older sister and the student council president, do the designs start to flourish. Her long black hair, leg-long black tights, and icy, teal eyes paint her as not just the leader but as someone to be feared. Her and Chiyo’s father dons a trimmed mustache and a blue tie, turning him into quite the gentleman. Andre’s small face, huge stature, and floppy ears create a walking clown. Joe’s defined but hidden face and small height make him an enigma. Hana’s loose pants are meant for easier karate movement but they also reduce her overall sex appeal, contrasting with the other women of the show and with her (unintentional) perverted habits. But the best design goes to Meiko. Her absurdly large breasts, glasses, and gray-with-bun hair give her a very mature look, coinciding with her commanding position. Her knee-high black boots and leather riding crop add further to her dominatrix personality and persona, collectively making her design the most intricate of the bunch.For all of the designs, everyone has very refined contours, shadows, and detail that makes them realistic and impactful, regardless of how boring some might be. These highly detailed designs surprisingly do not get in the way of the amount of animation that is used. Prison School does have a sizeable chunk of “visible” animation – eyes can go chaotic, limbs fly during violent segments, and breasts jiggle. But there are also subtle movements like twitching and hair ruffling that exist to keep the anime flowing. A possible explanation may be due to the fact that the anime prides itself on capturing each ridiculous moment. Meaning, the anime constantly has prolonged shots of the characters’ faces or the current situation. This consequently reduces the overall amount of animation for those scenes but the trade-off is that the more involved ones receive even more animation. It is a trade-off, one in which Prison Schooldiscovered a nice balance.CHARACTERSThe cast of Prison School are not complex characters in the slightest. For the most part, they are made up solely of their base characterizations. Given the comedy-centric direction, this makes perfect sense; Kiyoshi the straight-man, Gakuto the hobbyist, Shingo the dude, Andre the gentle giant, and Joe the reserved. The same line of thinking can be applied to the women; Mari the vixen, Meiko the buff, and Hana the psycho. The characters are who they are and not much more.“Not much” because there is thought put into some of the characters. Mari, the student council president, is infamous for her adoration and control of crows. Crows are intelligent creatures, some of the smartest nonhuman animals on the planet. They are also ominous; their pitch-black feathers and foreboding cry are creepy, especially when these birds fly in flocks. No better bird symbolizes the equally intelligent and ominous Mari. But as the anime depicts, Mari is not as smart or as scary as one is lead to believe. Her plan falls through and while she has a deep-seeded hatred for men – most likely the result of a disconnect with her father – she is regularly shown to care for all of the women. She offers them positions, she shares tea with them, and in Hana’s case, she stops her from doing any more damage than has already been done when she takes a punch meant for Kiyoshi for herself. In other words, Mari has an inversion about her that makes her the opposite of what she appears to be.Hana is also an interesting character in her own right. Arguably she is the least attractive of the women, mostly because of her personality, looks, and actions. But she, more than any of the women, finds herself always at the brunt end of the stick. Simultaneously, she is the most immature in the sense that she has no idea what an erection is or how to kiss. Again, there is an inversion present, one that flips the audience’s perception of her.Ultimately inversion is what the characters rely on to achieve their brand of comedy. Andre is a very calm and very nice person, thus his love of punishment and lack of receiving it is comedic. Meiko acting high and mighty towards the boys but then going fully submissive towards Mari is comedic. Chiyo’s father nonchalantly having pornography lying around when his daughter is nearby is comedic.Inversion, like the sexual material, also does more than act as a comedic crutch. Looking at Shingo’s character throughout the season, he was initially placed on the wayside. It was not until Kiyoshi and Gakuto were caught that he more or less takes center stage during the season. When he learns of Kiyoshi’s behavior – that he had gone behind his, Andre’s, and Joe’s backs in order to meet up with some girl and that he had caused their prison stay to lengthen – he shuns Kiyoshi, mistreating him as much as possible. Yet, when presented with the opportunity to do the exact same as Kiyoshi (technically he did even more by getting free meals, going outside, and personally betraying his friends), he does not hesitate. It was hypocritical, or considering the discussion, it was an inversion of his character. And it is this same inversion that he witnesses with a bunch of young kids that opens his eyes to how childish he had been. In the end he realizes the error of his ways and the group comes together once more, appropriately enough ending on a joke relying on inversion.Gakuto is also a prime example of the anime’s reliance on inversion. Gakuto is a bit of an oddball. He is obsessed with history and speaks in a strange manner. He is also very respectful, a trait derived from the previous two. But despite what he does or says, he rarely acts selfish. That is to say, Gakuto might seem like an attention seeker but he is the first to sacrifice himself before anyone. Embarrassing himself in front of the whole school, destroying his prized figures, and refusing to “besmirch” (Gakuto’s words) Chiyo’s clothes are just a sampling of the individual instances where Gakuto chooses his friends over himself.Friendships feed directly into relationships, another staple of Prison School. Kiyoshi’s relationship with both Chiyo and Hana is bizarre. The former is more or less a lie – he does not really like sumo wrestling and he never told her the truth about the peeping – whereas the latter goes way too far for mere acquaintances. Furthermore, Kiyoshi’s crow-helping and butt-worshipping has made him into, according to the Kurihara family members, not a “bad” guy. To put it differently, Kiyoshi having a relationship with them requires him to uphold quite the niche stipulation. Joe has his ants that mean more to him than any girl could – the final sequence shows all of the boys with a woman except Joe who, coincidentally enough, is with his ants. But the most important set of relationships within the anime are the ones between the men. They each have those moments where they forget the others – Kiyoshi going on his date, Shingo sneaking out, Andre succumbing to depravity, Joe overcome with venomous rage, and, surprisingly yes, Gakuto ignoring Kiyoshi for some period. Their time in prison seemingly breaks the friendships they had. However, through their determination for each other (and for sex), the boys rise above their misdeeds. Each person, at one point or another, apologizes and, like friends do, they forgive them, reconstructing their bonds to be even stronger than before. And this is what the characters represent thematically. What gets somebody through tough times is not some figurines or a few ants or even a personal diary. What gets somebody through tough times are the people that person holds dear.According to Prison School, relationships are coveted. Thus, the only prominent time in which the cast weakens is when these relationships are prevented from developing. This stunted growth is caused by the disproportionate on-screen time. The show focuses mainly on Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Meiko, and Hana, and to be fair this makes sense since they are arguably the funniest characters in the anime. And given that this is a comedy, having the most fun cast members at the front more so than the others is a logical move. Still, Andre and Joe are hardly used throughout the season, both receiving two, very brief spotlights (Andre with his non-punishment and nipple hair, and Joe with his ants and deception). Arguably again, Andre and Joe exist just for their silly personas and nothing more, and given that there are the other three boys and a handful of girls to focus on, those two not getting much attention is somewhat understandable.But there is still the issue of Shingo – who has no presence in the beginning, takes over briefly, then disappears again – and Mari – who is technically the kingpin of the whole fiasco but is rarely shown doing much of anything. So, dissimilar to the animation, Prison School misses the balance in regards to its characters and their on-screen time. This has a domino effect: less of the characters means less foundation for the relationships they share with the others, a dampening in the relationships hurts the theme, and damaging the theme lowers the overall execution of the anime.SOUNDThe opening theme is rock-and-roll heavy, but what it champions is the theme the show’s characters symbolize; switching off the vocalists achieves that friendship feel.

After knowing of its presence for over a year, I decided to get Prison School off of my PTW list, and to my surprise, I actually didn't like it. Here's why:-[story & stuff]-5 degenerate boys are caught peeping on their female classmates, and are summarily sent to the (Michael Rosen voice) SCHOOL...PRISON. They want to escape, and so they try to. That's pretty much the gist of it.The writing is pretty inconsistent. On one hand, the prison dynamics are well-presented. I can't go into much detail since it would spoil some plot points, but I do feel as if characters develop semi-realistically. On the other hand, this show relies on anime logic to progress the story. Obviously, Prison School isn't Death Note, but as a show presenting itself as a prison-break drama, I do expect some semblance of congruity to be upheld.-[presentation]-Starting with the least interesting part, the OP was a metal-ish, rise-up, 1-minute-30-second piece of mediocrity. There really isn't a lot to say about it. It seems pretty obvious that whoever made it wasn't trying that hard with the lyrics. I didn't even bother to watch the ED, so go read someone else's review for a hot-take on Prison School's ED.The visuals of the show were, like the story, very inconsistent. The artstyle was gross and gritty- making it come off as /super serious/. The artstyle, while ugly as hell, did resemble old-school hentai. This serves to justify, or at least make sense of, the raunchiness seen in every episode. To be sure, I don't think that Prison School have been presented in a modern artstyle, as the show's comedy and fanservice wouldn't come off well in the pastellic, eye-catching visuals of today. Take that how you will.The voice acting was okay, I guess. It's hard to point out the inflectional flaws of an actor whose language I don't even understand. I can say, though, that the delivery was not noticeably terrible. Again, Take that how you will.But, was the ecchi at least good? Yeah, the ecchi was fine. The whole anime is shot provocatively, leaving few scenes without some female part demanding the viewer's attention. Unfortunately, I noticed no desirable changes in my pants. Mayhaps I've become desensitized to the anime tiddy; an outcome that would be truly regrettable.-[character]-The characters were rather uninteresting, in my opinion. The character development is pretty done-to-death, but presenting a prison-drama with a group of characters who get along perfectly would be pretty lame, so I digress. Each of the characters' designs and personalities are unique and memorable. This is obviously a good thing, but since the characters grow in any meaningful way, appearances are all these boys can boast about.-[overall]-Prison School was kind of a letdown. When I heard the tits-vs-ass rant from my friend, I figured that I'd be in for much more than an unabashedly perverted, but otherwise unremarkable piece of anime trash. 4/10. Not good. PRISON.

This anime does have a story which can be accepted if we ignore the initial plotholes but is too messed up if you ask me. This is my first review and I hate to say it that this anime was so disgusting that I had to write this to warn the one reading this.The treatment of the boys was so inhuman that if anyone finds enjoyment in watching them getting beaten like that then they are the scum of our planet. All the main characters are messed up in some way or the...other, this is the first time I am not favouring any of the characters in an anime. I got no enjoyment watching this and only watched cuz I was wishing for some happy ending...what i get is the revenge of the boys being succefull....which even is kinda sad. I don\'t recommend this and strongly tell the people, who think it would be fun to try it out since I have written such a review, to heed my warning. THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME AND EMOTIONS. Go watch some other anime with milder violence and more romance if that\'s what you seek. If you so prefer such a scenario of boys enrolling in all-girls school, go watch Maken-ki or some other like that which is atleast kinda sweet compared to this rotten anime. other, this is the first time I am not favouring any of the characters in an anime.

I\'d also like for it to be known that Dardoch should be hung, torched, and fired.Prologue-?Let me start off by saying that this anime was the tits. I don\'t mean them saggy granny sacks that your girl probably houses. I\'m talking about them big ol Hindenburgs that you only see in an Eastern European basement strip club. When I was watching this show, I couldn\'t contain...myself from how funny it was. At every corner, I was thrown with a dramatic plot twist driven off some pretty ridiculous joke. At some point, I was laughing so hard it sounded like I was dying of a heart failure after snorting too much coke off some girl\'s double D\'s. Let it be known that I don\'t even do that kind of shit, but that\'s just how hard those titties rolled.Story-9The MAL police said no spoilers, so Im cucked, because this makes it really hard for me to fill in words for this review. But the story was pretty great. Real quality content. It\'s got good pacing with solid twists to keep your ass glued to that dildo sticking off on top of your seat. Then out of no where it smacks you in the face with a soggy homerun meatstick that\'ll makes you make you drop harder than Dre drops beats. I for one thought the story was a 10/10 but I\'m giving it a 9/10 because my butt hole still itched at the end. Also because I don\'t like to wait for a season 2 but that\'s a whole another ordeal.Art-8Art was a combination of transcendental elements intertwined with neo-contemporary vibes. By utilizing thick brush strokes and a color pallete of unsatu..I really don\'t fucking know. The art was good. Character expressions and whatnot  stood out and dramatized everything, which I thought they executed well. And yeah they did a pretty good job drawing out the fan service hentai we all know and love.Sound-8Sound was great too. It complimented the anime well and that\'s as much as I can say. But it was no Beethovan or anything that made you go ""WOWZERS IM LITERARALLY BONKERS and AND EARGASM RIGHT NOW."" But it was good.Characters-8The characters seemed well balanced. Again, no spoilers so yeah, all I can really say is that they complimented each other well and a lot of great moments were had from their similarities and differences. Honestly I gave this anime a 9/10 overall so I don\'t know why I\'m breaking down each quality as though my opinion matters so fuck it HERE WE GO - ENJoyMENt & oVERALL 9 & 9- it was really GREAT ReAlLY GOOD ANIme HOPE you LIKE BEccause I LoVED IT.

Glancing at the ads for it, I assumed it was another ecchi esque show that was strongly upvoted by the males for the sexual content but with no backbone and core story. But then I saw a poll of shows fans wanted of second seasons, and PS was one of the top three picks for the females. That got me interested enough to try, so I did. The initial episode left me a bit confused, as I found it funny but not a hugely deep plot. But the imprisonment kept me interested and the jokes were indeed funny....As I watched more episodes, it gradually hooked me more.The jokes in this show come from serious thoughts and plans the main characters have, but these actions are taken to the extreme. A small scene where a character could need something as simple as, say, a water bottle could transpire into a huge cesspool, and I found the storywriting and characterization behind that very funny.There is indeed fanservice, but I found it entertaining, and I enjoyed when the fanservice was addressed directly and tied to the actual plot. I find that a bit more tolerable that shows like, say, Grimgal this season where the characters are peeping on the women in the bath or talk about ""flat chests"" because I find that a lot more uninteresting and completely pointless. The way its done here is way more tasteful, sexy, and entertaining. I will say that it caters a bit more toward male audiences though (but it seems to still have a fair female fanbase as well as suggested by that poll mentioned earlier).This show doesnt waste time with fluff, showing a lot of things happening and moving at a brisk pace. It doesnt introduce almost any new characters from the core cast giving the main male and female leads plenty of time to develop in different ways. You see the friendships of the good guys and the bad people too, and you see several interpersonal connections that are done well, as well as the loyalty and bonds between characters. Best of all, it doesnt have a bloated cast, as all the characters serve functions. Theres no ditzy girl stereotype just to fulfill character space and provide fanservice, no tsundere or moe character just for the sake of having them in the show, etc.There were of course small nitpicks I didnt like, like some characters logics at times, but this was overshadowed just by how funny the jokes were. There were even unexpectedly emotional moments, and also there were moments where things from many episodes before would return, creating a strong sense of continuity. Overall very solid, and I recommend the manga too for any who liked the anime and want to continue further.

It was definitely different from the usual ""perv"" anime that are generally produced in the anime industry. Their use of ""serious moments"" combined with the obvious intent of being light hearted and plain run of the mill humour was a good step - ingenious in my opinion. And with that said, the arc which was covered in this anime was also really good, because the twists were actually covered well, and were balanced. Especially in terms of plot points, it kept me on my feet.Art:The art suited the story. Without a single...chibi moment, and yet being able to integrate chibi into this ""quasi-serious"" scenario, is usually difficult to handled but they pulled it off and in style. The tension, combined with the paradoxes that were portrayed through the characters, was really good. I personally found it rad.Sound:The sound was suited to the moment, was not so annoying to the ears - in fact, I\'d say that the characters were voiced perfectly and according to their personalities - and likewise, the music suited the general ambiance of the anime. At the same time, the awkward moments, and the humorous moments, all were on cue - the art felt alive especially because the sound was spot on.Character:I honestly have no comments here. That rating that I\'ve given speaks for itself.Enjoyment:This anime was hilarious, and it was sincere to its plot. Especially where the manga is concerned,  I\'d say this anime deserves recognition. It\'s a masterpiece in my opinion.Overall:Watch it. It\'s hilarious.

Plain hilarious.', 'Metabolism juices and borderline hentai with fucking fantastic writing?! - Prison School reviewPrison School is a show with some of the best writing and direction I’ve seen in recent time. Nothing in the story happens by accident, for everything in Prison School happens for a reason. Before long, Hachimitsu academy was an all girls private academy until recently it followed up with open enrollment for boys. And those boys are the slick and wicked main characters of the series: Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Joe, Andre, and Shingo. We watch as they commit a crime of peeping in the girl’s bathroom earning themselves time in the school prison....We are brought right into the action, no stalling and no stagnated scenes, where the story quickly gathers center around the boys in the prison.Not in a long time have I seen such great writing in an anime alongside Shokugeki. From the moment Gakuto mentions the Three Kingdoms and Guan Yu, it all plays out in the breakout arc. Or when Kiyoshi finds Hanna doing her business in the school forest that of which plays a pivotal role in the entire show. There is such a brilliance of connecting ideas that means something, and not just for the sake of it. It handles immature things maturely, if that makes any sense. For one thing that plays out, it leads to another and ultimately leads to the awesome ending that we fans deserve to witness. Not one concept is thrown out of the window left to be discarded in the burial at sea. The comedy is a sure fire of laughter and re-watchable. Whether it ranges from sexual to violence, while also being serious, it handles all of it very well executed and shows the underlying messages of the series such as honor, redeem-ability, morals etc. which is prevalent within all of the characters.The five boys each have their own unique character traits. Kiyoshi may seem like your generic nice guy, however he has this loving heart and honesty to him greater conveying his convictions. What makes him a better character is the sequences that he puts himself through. Anyone can nitpick and point out “he’s a generic character” but why? Kiyoshi in the show proves with his actions that he is his own, he steers the show in the critical direction that it truly earns. Gakuto is the brains of the group yet he is so much more. His love for the Three Kingdoms plays out fundamentally strong in the breakout arc. From here, we see him show with his intellect that he can be both comical and suave. Much more when he defecates himself to proceed with their plans of escape with no single regret. Joe is like the Kenny (South Park) of Prison School. His love for ants make him quite distinct and it plays a major role in the DTO arc. He is a bro that forgave Kiyoshi after preventing him from harming the president in reaction to him assuming the crows were eating his ants. Andre is the tank of the group. His masochistic nature to get brutalized by the vice-president offers hilarious scenes, like him licking her saliva off his face. His design is unique and is someone I’d hang out with. Lastly, Shingo’s role is hilarious to mistaken the actions of Gakuto and Kiyoshi during their breakout planning. Spreading rumors to Joe and Andre, they grow suspicious of the two of them. Eventually he is seduced by Meiko to become a rat. From there it plays out in the end that you should always have your bro’s back, no matter what.Ever since the underground student council made their first appearance, they were already distrustful from the start, and making it even stronger is Mari’s hate towards men because of her father, the principal’s hobbies in women. By no means are they dislikeable characters, as the audience, we understand who they are and whatever reason caused it. Meiko ‘disciplines’ the boys but only for it to be taken advantage of. But of course, her metabolism juices are disgustingly enjoyable. Hanna is tough on the outside, but on the inside she is just a child who knows nothing. Her character development is really strong as she gets more and more violent and emotional because of the events that happen between her and Kiyoshi. And it is all the more enjoyable because they are such great characters.The art of the show goes for a more realistic approach, sort of. With the unique coloring and atmosphere given life into the world of Prison School, it all the more immerses the violence and sexual content by breathing realism. Brutalities done in by Hanna to the boys feel impact and invigorating. It is all consistent along with the great animation. I did not notice one derpy scene in the production of the show. Sound offers enticing and arousing elements. It conveys the scenes of Meiko punishing the boys, Hanna beating the shit out of the boys, or the boys doing their crazy stuff all very phenomenal. Voice acting is just really good. It fits well with the cast and they voice act appropriately and insightful throughout the show. Opening and ending portray the the series anime or manga, perfectly. I can’t see it any of other way.I don’t know how to contain my pleasure of watching Prison School, and that is why it earns high score of 9/10 with a juicy and masochistic seal of approval. Of all the shows out there, this one is definitely a contender for the best of 2015. It offers mature writing and direction, well executed characters, and a satisfying narrative. I nod Prison School for giving me such a wonder and I hope that it comes back for a season 2. I’ll be on my way now.

When I review anime, a 7 is a 70% which means the anime was average but nothing special. I noticed most people would say that was worth a 5, or a 50%, but that is an F. If an anime didn't have any obvious flaws other than being nothing special, then I don't think it failed. So please read my reviews with this in mind. This is why most of my ratings seem on the high end. If I enjoyed it enough to finish it, it should be getting a C, not any lower.Prison School...was an anime I was really hesitant to watch due to a lot of the content I saw of it. It looked like a nudity-central anime with little plot and excessive ecchi. Though that may be true for the most part, I was still pleasantly surprised. Overall the anime is very funny, but manages to have an interesting and serious plot to back it up.Story(7/10)This isn't the strongest story I have ever seen, but it sure is good. Th concept is more or less original and well executed. It all comes together as a plan begins to unfold and it all becomes very exciting. Finding out the genius escape plans was really cool. I certainly thought it was a pretty unique story, and since it was well done, it deserves a 7.Art(9/10)This is certainly the strong point of the anime. The art is really new, and strange. At first it is a little bit annoying, but as things progress it grows on you. I really enjoyed the unique art style, and it was all wrapped up with smooth and detailed animation.Sound(5/10)Like the art was the strong point, this was the weak. Nothing ever really stood out as far as sound is concerned. Of course, when the sound seemed off it was either really goofy, or just unfitting.Character(7/10)All of the characters were very likable. Th all had good development, especially the main five, and none were too flat or cliche. I found that all of the characters against the protagonist were also likable, which is something I really enjoy seeing.Enjoyment(8/10)I thought this show was hilarious. With the right balance of comedy, tension, and ecchi, the anime was really fun to watch. At times I was laughing so much it hurt, and others I was holding my breath. It really came together better than you could expect.So don't let assumptions put you off, like me. Yo just may be pleasantly surprised. I recommend this show to anyone who likes comedy, ecchi, or schemes. Anyone interested in prison breaks or mental games would most likely really enjoy this show. I would not recommend this to the faint of heart, as nudity, gore, and profane language is really frequent here. I also won't recommend this to anyone looking for action-heavy or philosophy-heavy anime. was an anime I was really hesitant to watch due to a lot of the content I saw of it.

Th concept is more or less original and well executed. It all comes together as a plan begins to unfold and it all becomes very exciting. Finding out the genius escape plans was really cool. I certainly thought it was a pretty unique story, and since it was well done, it deserves a 7.Art(9/10)This is certainly the strong point of the anime. The art is really new, and strange. At first it is a little bit annoying, but as things progress it grows on you. I really enjoyed the unique art style, and it was all wrapped up with smooth and detailed animation.Sound(5/10)Like the art was the strong point, this was the weak. Nothing ever really stood out as far as sound is concerned. Of course, when the sound seemed off it was either really goofy, or just unfitting.Character(7/10)All of the characters were very likable. Th all had good development, especially the main five, and none were too flat or cliche. I found that all of the characters against the protagonist were also likable, which is something I really enjoy seeing.Enjoyment(8/10)I thought this show was hilarious. With the right balance of comedy, tension, and ecchi, the anime was really fun to watch. At times I was laughing so much it hurt, and others I was holding my breath. It really came together better than you could expect.So don't let assumptions put you off, like me. Yo just may be pleasantly surprised. I recommend this show to anyone who likes comedy, ecchi, or schemes. Anyone interested in prison breaks or mental games would most likely really enjoy this show. I would not recommend this to the faint of heart, as nudity, gore, and profane language is really frequent here. I also won't recommend this to anyone looking for action-heavy or philosophy-heavy anime."", ""Prison School is a very dutiful animation that brings to life the comic to the best of its abilities. There proves to be no real difference between the two and in some aspects the anime proves to be superior to the manga at least for getting you through the first real arc. It's a great way to shave off tens of chapters with the same effect as having read them.There's nothing really too horrible about the show  as a whole if you're a fan of the manga then it should be a joy to watch or if you're interested in the manga but unsure...on whether it's within your taste then this will definitely sway you toward a decision. My only real gripe is the fact that due to censorship you're robbed of the real basic concept that makes Prison School so over the top as to its ecchi portions. But I mean what can you do it's part of the broadcasting law, plus gotta get something so the Blu-Rays will sell.Basically if you enjoy the manga then it's a good watch, but if you didn't enjoy the manga or don't enjoy a comedy with ecchi in it then there's really nothing here that's going to change your mind towards liking either. Hope for a possible season 2 in the future. on whether it's within your taste then this will definitely sway you toward a decision.

What I first thought to be trashy fan service shocked me in every way. The funniest anime I’ve probably ever seen. Laughing out loud (literally) almost every episode. Characters that felt more real than most other shows. Fan service with animation quality and style I couldn’t get enough of. I felt compelled to buy the manga after finishing the 12 episodes.I specified this review is for the dub because comedy is difficult to translate across cultures. That’s why visual...or physical humor is more popular than a clever pun. The dub team clearly knew the fucking gold they had on their hands and played it up. The character VA’s sounded like a hentai dub but with effort. It was obvious the VA’s were having fun. I saw an episode in sub and, while it’s still good, it just doesn’t have that impact unless you’re a native moon speaker.Speaking of hentai, the art style for the girls is fucking fantastic. Many times I just wanted to stop the video and unzip my pants. The tits, the ass, the proportions—just destroys your crotch. The character designs are more realistic instead of that moeshit. They look like real fuckin’ women. Not bug eyed little shits.On being real, I gotta say it’s fucking refreshing to see male characters act like real dudes. It’s nice seeing guys being guys. Today you’ve got one guy to ten girls because you gotta have self-insert harem. But not here. They’re teenagers exploding with hormones, and they wanna see some T and A.The plotting in this show is more of a thriller than a show trying to be a thriller. I wanted these boys to get what they want. There’s none of that slice o’ life shit here. Every episode: something is fucking happening. You know what they want, you know what’s going on, and you want them to get it.I couldn’t believe that the writing here is actually good because there’s one particular thing I noticed: when writing your character’s plot, it’s easy to let them succeed with much trouble. That’s bad writing. It’s your job as the creator to make trouble for your characters. That’s interesting. Going from Point A to Point B is a snooze fest. But going from Point A to Z to X to K to B is what’s exciting. The boys’ plans were constantly being flipped at every turn making each episode intense.Look, this show isn’t some paragon of comedy. The premise is silly. There’s a whole scene dedicated to a poop joke. But if you hate on it because of that then fuck you and fuck your pretentious bullshit. Fun things are fun.

Prison School is a satire of the over-sexualization of Japanese media, and specifically anime. It presents all of the boys as horndogs and all of the women, save one or two, in completely sexual terms. Every time one female character speaks the camera is nearly always focused in on her breasts. Which I don\'t think is ""fan service,"" in the way that it is normally presented. I think it is done to call attention to how ridiculous and over the top manga/anime can be with this type of stuff. The boys at the...center of the show are cookie cutter in their own way, but each of them is unique and you remember them. Especially Gakuto.

It is slightly above average, and as an individual who values the quality of art, it is vital for the illustrations to be somewhat appealing. Furthermore, since the anime is for mature audiences, the version I viewed contained mild censors from time to time. Also, prepare for excessive sweating from the characters and minor bloodshed, in a positive way.For character development, I found the characters to be unique and enjoyable in their own way.

This 'ecchi-filled' anime will constantly have you at the edge of your seat with the amount of suspense put in. From time to time there will be nice scenes to fuel your imagination and a hint of adult themes.Story: 9/10As you can tell from the synopsis, it's about a a group of guys who make it to an all girl's boarding school. While watching this i found it unpredictable at times which i like. Who likes an anime where they can easily predict what will happen next? It's just full of suspense which makes it so interesting to watch, you...can't take your eyes off it. Ever watched something so awkward you wanna scrunch up into a tiny ball? This anime will give a similar feeling.Art: 10/10The art is simply amazing, i love anime which have such nice visuals. Prison School never fail to make me laugh with the funny faces and expressions they make. Facial expression is so powerful, just by looking at it you can tell exactly how they feel. I noticed they put as much effort into the background as the foreground. Most anime generalize the background.Sound: 8/10This is up for debate but, i didn't really like the opening song and ending song. However, the soundtracks and sound effects used in scenes building up tension are almost perfect. The voice actors are really good at bringing the characters to life because, they have so much feelings when they speak.Character: 10/10Now this is where i believe Prison School really shines. If we just look at the group of 5 boys they are all unique in their own way. They done an amazing job in revealing each of their personalities within one episode. It wasn't even directly introducing them one by one but, we would gather hints just by watching the show. Genius, just genius.Enjoyment: 10/10Okay, i'm probably going to be abit bias by saying this.

Despite the genre itself having 758 animes including squeals only a handful of them are actually good or at least competent. The reason why I say this is that the majority of ecchi anime tend no purpose other than to meander to the lowest common denominator of anime fans. They love to showcase numerous sexual shots yet the show’s don’t have anything to say.Look am not expecting every ecchi series to be Evangelion or other cynical series out there but there should be a fine line between...fun and goofy ecchi to the hamfisted ecchi. High School DXD, Testament Of Sister Devil and To Love Ru Darkness are solid examples of how to be fun and goofy ecchi animeGranted not all of them were necessarily good but their least hey had character and charm which I cannot say the same thing for shows like Maken Ai, AntiMagic Academy, Hybrid x Heart Magias Academy Ataraxia, Ikkitousen, Dears, Photokano etc where their hamfest fan-service without any effort, commentary, charm or substance.Then again there were 2 ecchi series out of the 758 ecchi series that not only embraces and comments on all the cliches and tropes from the genre, but they managed to be very good anime in the progress making them stand out from other ecchi anime.These are two anime are Prison School and Shimoneta.

If, this was another show then the male lead would either be a coward or a dense idiot.Furthermore, the girls in those shows despite knocking the male lead out will be on the male lead crouch for the sake of fantasy.

It’s honestly a breath of fresh air if you ask me.Over the course of 12 episodes, we follow our honest leads who live their lives at Prison School where do chores as well as getting physically and mentally beaten up by the underground student council for wrong acts. That’s basically the plot of Prison School simplified but there’s much more to it.

The ecchi is used for trolling reasons, especially as for the vice-president. They include deep sayings and famous battles in history to make fun of some situations.

It\'s one of those cases where the everything is so stupid that it\'s hilarious.The plot is quite simple, but well developed. In each episode there is something new happening and you can see and feel things evolving. The comedy and ecchi genres fit well together to create great moments in the show.The art is great and it contributes a lot to the comical part of the show. The characters faces can be dead serious and its still going to be funny. In my opinion is the best feature of the show along with the sound that also helps...a lot to the funny moments. The opening is great and funny and the animation sequence also portraits well the dark humorous feeling of the anime. The ending is lighter but still enjoyable.The characters are all funny in their own way. You have horny, nerdy, masochist, hot shot sports guy and the quiet ant lover. They are all unique and hilarious, contributing a lot to the development of the story. The girls are all well managed even though I didn\'t quite like how they were portrayed sometimes, I still found the irony in it and for me it was a lot of fun to watch them ""battle"" the boys.I really like this type of dark humor/irony anime so I enjoyed this a lot. It might not be for everyone though. It\'s quite sexual and there are a lot of dirty jokes that need an open mind to understand them.

But, I think that the older audience can appreciate all power of this work.In fact, Prison School tells about ordinary things in a...modern anime: friendship, partnership and of course romance.

This epic absurd paced like a roller on all Ecchi at once, and not only Ecchi. Sports and Slice Of Life were also affected. Only that legendary armwrestling battle between the guys and Meiko costs much (not to mention more). Moreover, the banter of the anime went through contradictions of Japanese society in matters of sex. After all, the fact that protagonists were declared criminals and jailed for peeping is not inherently absurd for Japan.No, I\'m not going to cry about the genius and the blame of the season.

The boys are excited to spent their high-school years surrounded by girls but the student council wants desperately to expel them, hating all boys in typical anime fashion.After a peeping scheme by the boys goes wrong, the powerful student council sentences them to prison. Literally. In the middle of the courtyard is a building clad in iron barred windows. And thus perversity, insanity and hilarity ensues.This is a very funny anime. If...you don`t mind crude jokes and toilet humor. There is a lot fan-service included but it is not an ecchi anime. The fan-service is used as a mean to deliver the jokes and the insanity and not simply to arouse the average teenage viewer. Having said that, there are a lot of fetishes included and scenes that seem to have no other purpose other than advancing the general feeling of wackines and vulgarity.The premise continues to build in its initial insanity, the boys becoming desperate in their prison, concocting far-fetched schemes to deal with the increasingly sadistic and hateful student council girls.The visual style is slightly unorthodox: the character designs appear a little more realistic than usual which accentuates the eroticism at certain scenes (and the absurdity on others). Generally a top production work from the experienced J.C.Staff animation studio.The ending is pretty satisfying for a 12-episode series. For those who liked the anime, it covers the first 81 chapters of the manga. The manga is still ongoing at the time of this writing and has published 197 chapters.Concluding, if you like vulgar humor you will enjoy Prison school and laugh throughout its 12 episodes. You may get annoyed at how evil the council girls are or how ridiculous the premise is, but it will be a fun ride. 7.5/10. you don`t mind crude jokes and toilet humor.

I don't read manga I just watch anime. I do read the discussions on r/anime though and this show has gotten a lot of praise for following the manga so closely with insane attention to detail and important scenes.Each episode is a masterfully orchestrated piece that ends on the most intense of cliffhangers only to be bested by the next episode.Really though. Right from the start it's really engaging and sets a silly/serious tone that just feels right throughout the entire process of watching.

The concept will sound really odd and maybe even stupid at first but once you take your seat on this wild ride you'll never want to get off.Visually, it's very impressive but since I haven't seen the Blu-ray/DVD stuff yet, the censorship is very brutal and overbearing in some places. The style is wonderful, but some of the parts where it zooms in on a character are a little odd.The MUSIC is super intense and really sets a good stage for everything to play out. It has romantic music, silly music, super intense stuff and sometimes the show will switch it around so quickly you don't even know what hits you, but it works. Some of the sounds are little uncomfortable though like when the Vice Prez sweats a lot (sounds like tentacle hentai).The MC's are wonderfully developed and have a great presence throughout the show and are easily likable.

Nevertheless, her body did not attract me in spite of myself being a heterosexual male. I must say that two of the main female characters who were playing the...role as corrections officers were more attractive than the abusive prison guard.Anyhow, I may have given an overall rating of 10 on this show, but the women in the show do need to express more modesty within their personal image. I am, of course, in favor of the ""ecchi"" subgenre; however, their expression of their physical appearance were apparently too excessive for my liking.

I started this series after a recommendation from a friend. Originally, I only intended to watch the intro to get a feel for it before going to bed. I ended up watching the first two episodes before falling asleep. When I woke up, I watched the third. And then, when I got home, I binged my way through the rest of them. I don\'t make a habit of finishing series in the space of 24 hours, but...with this show... I don\'t know what it is. It\'s crude, we see a panty shot in the first thirty seconds (and that\'s not the worst of it) and the five male characters are perverts, but it\'s strangely entertaining. I\'m not a fan of ecchi or anything of the sort, but it\'s the way that this show is able to use fanservice as its strength. Without the fanservice, it wouldn\'t be quite as hilarious as it is.The fanservice appears to such an exorbitant amount that it\'s hilarious. Not to mention, with the exaggerated personalities of the characters, Prison School somehow manages to make it work. There\'s a guy who\'s obsessed with ants and coughs up blood due to canker sores, a guy who\'s obsessed with The Three Kingdoms and historical wars, a guy who\'s the literal dictionary definition of \'masochist\', a guy that I don\'t even know how to CLASS and then there\'s our MC, Kiyoshi. The three main USC (Underground School Council) characters are quite a sight to behold too. There\'s Hana, the strange blonde with a pee fetish (honestly, I wasn\'t too much of a fan of those scenes) Meiko, the voluptuous sadist who could be said to be the strongest character in the entire series and Mari, the ""crow user"". All of these different characters put together, along with the addition of a few quirky others, makes for a strangely interesting show.The story itself is what really intrigued me. With the amount of fanservice in this show, it\'s impossible to imagine that there could be a coherent plot behind it. However, Prison School does exactly that: it crafts an intricate plot while simultaneously employing the use of fanservice. If anything, I kind of grew immune to the fanservice after the first few episodes. In Prison School, the five boys are caught peeping and are therefore sentenced to a month in prison, hence the title \'Prison School\'. The story revolves around them trying to escape, and in the midst, proving their innocence for the further crimes that they are accused of. Our history-obsessed guy, who I\'ll refer to as ""yours truly"" (honestly, I can\'t even remember his name. I only remember them calling him ""filthy four-eyes"" and the ""yours truly guy"" so I\'ll go with that) is the mastermind behind many of their plans and does many heroic things in order to save his comrades, such as defecating himself in a class full of girls and letting Kiyoshi stab him in the forehead with a fork. He even breaks his limited edition figures just to save everyone else from further punishment. While there isn\'t much \'character development\' (I mean, the boys are just as perverted at the end as they were at the start) there\'s only twelve episodes so it would be fairly tough to squeeze in any character development. We get to see some interesting planning, unexpected plot progressions, some hilarious jokes and (if you\'re into it) fanservice. I can\'t really explain the story, even with it all fresh in my mind. It\'s something you have to watch for yourself to truly understand.As for the art, it\'s surprisingly... detailed. I don\'t really have much to say about it. I really liked the visuals in the OP, though. I\'ll speak more about the OP in my next paragraph. The character designs are also suited to their characters; it\'s easy to differentiate between all the different characters. I didn\'t notice any problems with the art. In fact, one particular scene comes to mind where [slight spoiler] Meiko is holding a vibrating object in her hand and it\'s blurred so that the audience thinks that it\'s a sex toy, only to find out in the next episode that it\'s actually just a razor. [spoiler over.] I found that hilarious. The show was creative with its use of art in its own way, and I feel like I have to give it credit for that.The sound was something I really enjoyed. The songs for both the OP and the ED are amazing. I loved both of them (although I love the OP just a little bit more) and I never skipped either of them while watching this show. The OP is incredibly catchy (I have it stuck in my head as I\'m typing this) and the music also goes with the visuals given in the OP. They used the soundtrack effectively during the show itself, using it to show changes of mood and to alert the audience that something was about to go down. 9 might seem a little high, I know, but I\'d have to say that the Prison School OP would make it into my top 5 (and if not that, then my top 10). It\'s an amazing OP, and that alone garners a score of 9. The voice actors did a really good job as well. Hana\'s VA did a commendable job as well, being able to sound gentle one minute and ravenous the next. She embodied Hana\'s temperamental mood perfectly. Not to mention, the VA for ""yours truly"" did a really good job as well. Also, one more thing, it was SO NICE not to have to hear the typical anime girl voice (you all know what I\'m talking about) and there was actual variety in the female voices rather than every female character speaking with that same squeaky ""K-K-Kiyoshi-kun?"" voice complete with jiggling breasts and flushed cheeks. There was variety, and the VAs were very well suited to their roles. Because of the above reasons, I have no complaints about the sound whatsoever.Like I\'ve said in above paragraphs, I liked the variety of characters that the show had to offer, and for that I gave the rating of 8. Some might disagree with this rating, but it\'s my personal opinion. The female characters in particular were fairly interesting to watch (my personal favourite is Chiyo, since she\'s such a loyal and adorable character. It really got me how she was willing to face expulsion just to defend Kiyoshi, and it really established her as an important character in the show).I rated my enjoyment a 9 due to the fact that I couldn\'t stop laughing at all the random parts that came up. Sometimes there were panty shots that were so UNNECESSARY that I couldn\'t help but start laughing, and to be honest, I think that\'s what the show wanted. It kind of makes fun of itself, and a show that can make fun of itself is a show that has the potential to succeed. Prison School doesn\'t try to take itself seriously (which is a mistake that many other anime shows have made) but it instead pokes fun at itself and exaggerates itself to the max, therefore making the viewing experience even more enjoyable. Even the speech patterns of some characters were funny, like the Chairman. On the last word of every sentence, they make his facial expression more intense and have him pause before he speaks. I don\'t know why, but it made me laugh. (Oh, the Chairman really is a great character. I\'m not going to say everything he does here, but he\'s actually hilarious.)I\'m not going to lie, there were some bits that made me uncomfortable. The Hana and Kiyoshi scenes made me cringe a bit. To sum it up for those who haven\'t watched, Hana tries to force Kiyoshi to pee in front of her on more than one occasion, forces him to undress and then gets mad at him for peeing on her/getting a boner/being resistant. Honestly, if it weren\'t for the fact that their scenes were nearly always cut short by someone interrupting, the \'Enjoyment\' score would be even lower than 9. It was probably meant to be funny that Hana wanted to see Kiyoshi pee, but I really couldn\'t find it funny. It made me so uncomfortable to watch them on screen together. Plus, I just hated Hana as a character in general. I wish she\'d gotten less screen time. This didn\'t dampen my viewing experience too much, although it prevented me from giving my enjoyment a perfect 10. (I personally wish they\'d left the \'pee fetish\' out of the show, but maybe people enjoy that? I don\'t know. I didn\'t.) I also wasn\'t too much of a a fan of Andre (the masochist). He seemed like a really insignificant character compared to the other four boys. The other four left an impression on me, but Andre... I only remember him as the most perverted guy in the group. As far as I\'m concerned, he had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. They could\'ve gotten rid of Andre completely and I wouldn\'t have noticed. Even the CROWS played a bigger part in the show than he did and the crows can\'t even speak, for God\'s sake. Perhaps he\'ll get a bigger role in Season 2 if there ever is one, but until proven otherwise, his character\'s redundant.Either way, considering that this was all done in twelve episodes, Prison School did an outstanding job. It didn\'t feel rushed at any stage--in fact, Prison School sets its own pace and it WORKS--and if anything, twelve episodes was perfect for this little season. (Then again, I wouldn\'t complain if they decided to release more episodes.) If you\'re trying to decide whether to watch this or not, just go and watch the first episode right now. When it comes to \'Prison School\', it\'s either a hit or miss. If you\'re fairly new to anime, I don\'t think I\'d recommend Prison School (mainly because some of the stuff and angles depicted are the kind that you\'d only see in hentai) but if you\'ve been watching anime for a while, then go ahead and take a dive into the world of Prison School. You won\'t regret it. with this show... I don\'t know what it is. It\'s crude, we see a panty shot in the first thirty seconds (and that\'s not the worst of it) and the five male characters are perverts, but it\'s strangely entertaining. I\'m not a fan of ecchi or anything of the sort, but it\'s the way that this show is able to use fanservice as its strength. Without the fanservice, it wouldn\'t be quite as hilarious as it is.The fanservice appears to such an exorbitant amount that it\'s hilarious. Not to mention, with the exaggerated personalities of the characters, Prison School somehow manages to make it work. There\'s a guy who\'s obsessed with ants and coughs up blood due to canker sores, a guy who\'s obsessed with The Three Kingdoms and historical wars, a guy who\'s the literal dictionary definition of \'masochist\', a guy that I don\'t even know how to CLASS and then there\'s our MC, Kiyoshi. The three main USC (Underground School Council) characters are quite a sight to behold too. There\'s Hana, the strange blonde with a pee fetish (honestly, I wasn\'t too much of a fan of those scenes) Meiko, the voluptuous sadist who could be said to be the strongest character in the entire series and Mari, the ""crow user"".

I really loved this anime, and I really wanted to give it an 8, but my policy is to deduct 1 score from anything that isn't finished, and this anime really needs a season two.Story:If people ever ask me what Prison School is like, I say it's an anime American Pie. The story here is probably on the weaker side, however I can only speak for the 12 episodes we've been given so far. The basic premise is that five guys get transferred to a previously all girl school as a test. After they get caught peeping in the girls shower, they...get thrown in the school prison. I won't fault the show for having a ridiculous premise like that, as I've seen way stranger by now. All of that happens in the first two episodes, and the rest of the series is focused on the boys attempts at escape and run ins with the sexy school council members who run the prison. The characters and situations they get into on an episodic base really make up for the overall weak story. The ending isn't very satisfying, but they did at least manage to make it somewhat bearable (unlike Deadman Wonderland).Art:Since it's a generally slow moving show, there aren't a lot of fast paced action scenes to grade the show on. However, all the nice titty shots and innuendo scenes were done extremely well, with the white light filter leaving just enough to the imagination. Also, some of the still shots of Gakuto's face had me in stitches at times. Overall, the art is on the higher quality side of things.Sound:The sounds in the show were definitely the weakest point, however the music wasn't a detrimental part of the show (ie action scenes to accentuate, etc.) so the lack of memorable music didn't feel like it hurt the show at all. I really do like the opening theme though, it's very catchy!Character:This is where the show stands out. The character interactions on this show easily had me laughing at multiple times throughout each episode, all the while reminding me of stuff like American Pie and Van Wilder. The character Gakuto is just something else entirely, he's easily the funniest characer on the show. The main character Kyoshi is a little stale at times, but the four others around him have enough personality to keep everything going). As for the student council members, Hana is easily my favorite. All her cringey encounters with Kyoshi were all most too much at times (in a good way).Enjoyment:This series is a perfect example of not needing a pro story to be good. This story stands well as an Ecchi piece and, as I've said a few times now, feels like you're watching an anime American Pie.Overall:I really liked Prison School, and I want to score it an 8, but I just can't considering it's technically an incomplete anime. I know they attempted an ending, but it wasn't so great. This anime is great at parties and when you're alone at night with a bottle of whiskey. Toodles gents! get thrown in the school prison.

But enough about that, here is my review on Prison School. And yes this is my first time writing reviews so I'm really good at it.So, the plot is just simple, a private strict all girl school (I don't remember what it's called) and later they began taking in five boys that is Kiyoshi, Gakuto, Shingo, Joe and Andre. Seems normal until one night where they began to plan on peeking on girl's bath...and getting caught by a Student Council. The next day the five boys were sent into a jail in the middle of campus. So what's so amazing about it? Just watch the first episode and I guarantee that you die of laughing with all the humorous gags and jokes throughout especially the facial expressions faces. But what kept it entertaining is the clliffhanger and the fast paced theme. The art is simply amazing, the voice acting and the sound design is excellent and the characters are enjoyable and funny as fuck. The storyline is not that good but overall this is the best anime so far. and getting caught by a Student Council. The next day the five boys were sent into a jail in the middle of campus.

I mean... this anime, is like a Prison Break, crossed with angry-feminist-torture-porn, and some sort of 'love over the boundaries'- story, that I don't even know, what to call this, really! This consept alone shouldn't really work, when it comes down to the actual storytelling, or at the very least something, that I would like to watch, with a clear consience, and without making baby kittens cry - I swear, I don't even have testicles, and they still hurt! And still... I absolutely love this anime! I adore it! I want to see it again! Butt...first... the review!Okay, so I'm gonna come out of the box, and say it out loud... None of these guys didn't really do anything wrong! No don't get me wrong, mind you... I wouldn't be too much thrilled, if I find out, that some creeps - and butt-ugly ones, for that matter - are possibly taking pictures of my naked body, when I'm not even shaved, or washd my hair yet, or put some makeup... whait, no, that's not the issue? Oh well... Anyway, what I'm trying to say, that the intentions from these blokes weren't really that noble, but hey, it's not like they hade some drugs and knives, to get those photos - just some ludicrous plan, rope, and cellphone! Yeah, sure, I guess that this particular girls-only- high school in a middle of nowhere doesn't really have that great of an internet connection to actually see some professional boobs and cunts - the ones with no bushes - but seriously... the reason for this whole premise, and for the story, for that matter, was so shallow and ridiculous, that I can't fell but to hate these tightass bitches, and feel sorry for these little deviants! Would it have been actually any different scenario, if the girls they were gonna peep, where actually some realistic, not-so-perfect- girls, instead of those pitch perfect underpant- models, that every single girl ever put on in anny kind of anime ever, ultimately is? I don't think so!Speaking of ludicrous, when taken away the whole aspect of the story, theres really nothing much more to it, that some needles whipping, blood and boobysweat - those are some sweet boobies, I give them that - while humiliating and scorning these poor lads, all in some sick, psycothic girl-powered glee! Seriously, some of the punishment these guys get, over some of the most smallest little things, is so outstandingly ludicrous and distasteful, that it really makes wanna to protect these guys, rahter than call them scumbags and wish that they should just die already, like all of those girls who got peeped and I'm just guessin... there really wasn't that much to look at, was there? Some of these girls really put me in some protective, hide-my-true-gender- state, where I simply refused to view them as a boys and girls anymore, but like a faceless puppets, where some like to torture the rest, less aggressive and more passive puppets - kinda like my own barbie-games as a wee lass!So the story isn't really nothing that great - epic speaches about wheter or not you should poop your pants, how great the asses are, compared to the boobs, and that sweaty-yet-epic arm wrestling- match - and the characters can really be a real hit-or- miss - absolutely stonecold leader, her masochist pawn, and truly psycothic bitch that cums if she gets kissed too roughly.

If your not into this sort of things, or this sort of people, it's truly understantable, that you're not going to like this anime either... altough the ending was really, truly satisfying! Trust me... you won't, and it's totaly fine! But, if you're a raging feminist, little on the sosiopath/psychotic side, and hungry to see some of the testicles being crushed, lads being humiliated, tortured and treated like shit, and you're not too squirmish about boobs, asses, blood or sweat, or prehaps just some deviant who likes to see his/her fellow men being treated the ways and methods that I used to dream of using on my former classmates from middle school, then this is truly a anime for you!And now, if you excuse me, I have this anime right here, waiting to be rewatched...Story: 7Art: 9Sound: 9Characters: 10Enjoyment: 10Overall: 10 first... the review!Okay, so I'm gonna come out of the box, and say it out loud...

If your not into this sort of things, or this sort of people, it's truly understantable, that you're not going to like this anime either... altough the ending was really, truly satisfying! Trust me... you won't, and it's totaly fine! But, if you're a raging feminist, little on the sosiopath/psychotic side, and hungry to see some of the testicles being crushed, lads being humiliated, tortured and treated like shit, and you're not too squirmish about boobs, asses, blood or sweat, or prehaps just some deviant who likes to see his/her fellow men being treated the ways and methods that I used to dream of using on my former classmates from middle school, then this is truly a anime for you!And now, if you excuse me, I have this anime right here, waiting to be rewatched...Story: 7Art: 9Sound: 9Characters: 10Enjoyment: 10Overall: 10"", 'Prison school is vulgar, repulsive, absurd and... hilariously funny.Yes, i knew from the beginning what this series was about and was fully aware of the good critics surrounding it and i was almost certain i would drop it, yet i found myself laughing my ass off like a maniac every episode. There were scenes so intense that i had to pause it and shout at the screen, seriously.Story: 6: as i said, absurd. A prison in a school? Sadist girls beating some guys for having hormones? Ridiculous, yet perfect for the series as it is. Dont forget that prison school is a comedy,...so it is bound to exaggerate certain situations for the fun of it, and in my opinion it does it pretty well. Now, the series is full to the very top with those soooo classic cheap jappanese jokes about sex and poop and ""others"", but it excels on giving them an actual purpose for the plot and not just to try horribly to take a laugh out of you.Art: 8: beautiful is not the word i would describe for the art rather HILARIOUS (and explicit). The expresions of the characters are so funny and match the situation perfectly, showing you that it is not trying to be the ""pretty and sexy"" rather raw, explicit, funny and agressive.Sound: 7: music was good. Considering this is a comedy anime i would have expected to found the soundtrack a little more funny, but the epic soundtrack in some scenes was laughable enough.Character: 8: does any character have a background story?  no. Do we get justification for their way of acting? no. and that does not metter PEOPLE. i have heard so many critics about this, and yeah if prison school were a romantic or psicological anime it would have mattered a lot, but this is just comedy!! the purpose of the series is not (clearly) to teach you a lesson about life, it is just to make you laugh, and for achieving that purpose we dont need reasonable and coherent characters, we need FUN characters. And oh my are they funny. Their way for each character to react to the several situations is hilarious and they are sooo ridiculous in their own unique way it is almost impossible not to want to hug them.Enjoyment: 9: if not a ten really. This is the only series i can recall that made me laugh so much. I almost felt this was ment to be a satire for common ecchi really: characters bleeding more through the mouth rather than the nose when excited, such grotesque way of presenting the sexual content... it is just hilarious. It got me freezing the screen every 10 minutes because of the anticipation.A must watch for people who: are not pecky with sexual content, can let go of their seriousness for an episode and laugh at cleverly yet ridiculously formulated jokes, do not expect a complicated plot and just want to laugh their asses of for a while. Really, really laugh their asses off. so it is bound to exaggerate certain situations for the fun of it, and in my opinion it does it pretty well.

It hits you with fan service and comedy right out the gate. The thing that makes Prison School so good is the comedy that it hits you with. Not only that but also it has the most like able main Character that I have seen in awhile. So lets go through the good and the bad of this show.THE GEWDThe CharactersEach character in Prison School has their own unique qualities, such a diverse amount of characters....but this show has one of the strongest main characters that I have ever seen.  Kiyoshi Fujino does what ever it takes to get the job done. He doesn't fear embarrassment of what might happen with the actions he takes.The ComedyThis is what, in my opinion makes the entire show. The comedy is the strongest I have seen. I haven't laughed so hard out loud in ages. The jokes hit fast and they hit strong.THE BADThe Fan serviceI hate that I'm saying this but the Fan service in this show is way WAY too much. It is so much that it takes away from the show itself making it less credible in my opinion. If they did without at least 10% of the fan service that they have the show would be much better.OverallOver all this show is a great watch and it took me a week to decide whether or not this show was a good recommendation to tell people of. But after thinking about it, it is a show that I would Recommend but only if they can handle the fan service which is a bit too much other wise I give this show a whopping 7 out of 10. but this show has one of the strongest main characters that I have ever seen.

Well ... Amazing.It's a whole different type of ecchi story. Great Art, hilarious story, hilarious faces made by the characters, and just a hilarious thing in general. While showing you the stories of those 5 main perverts, you also get a little side story of the principal (or that's what I think he is) and his life. There's also always a curveball in there in the story, like a surprise piss on the face, or characters misunderstanding each other in hilarious ways.Even things like the art style, the shouting, the facial expressions.. All the greatest elements and parts of this entire...thing. It really all adds up to be amazing.Great Anime 10/10. thing. It really all adds up to be amazing.Great Anime 10/10."", 'Prison School, is a school based ecchi anime that released in Summer 2015.Story (7): The premise of the Prison School evokes the tale of the protagonist Kiyoshi Fujino, and his classmates Andre, Joe, Gakuto, and Shingo as they embark on their first semester at the illustrious Hachimitsu Private Academy. The school was once an all-girls boarding school, but with the revision of the school’s policy due to a new director, 5 boys were introduced onto the campus. During the first episode, the boys are surrounded by girls, and planned to go peeping on the girls as they showered, yet to their dismay they were...caught and sentenced to the aforementioned Prison School. The interesting aspect to Prison School, is that unlike other ecchi series, it puts the fan service and comedy towards the progression and development of the story. Certain events that rapidly progress the series forward are direct influences from ecchi or fan service moments, and reoccurring plotlines are extensions of previous fan service laced moments. While the story is not the most engaging, the humor certainly paid an effect on the development of the series and certainly does well.Art (8): The art style has a strong sense of variety and style, with crisp animation, and a certain gloss to it at times. The overreacting shots surely make the series stand out with many over the top situations and reactions to events bring out the art style and design of the characters in their development at Hachimitsu Academy. The character designs are certainly well done and with the production of the anime being J.C. Staff, the animators behind Bakuman, Shokugeki no Souma, and Toradora!, the art quality certainly is worthy of the pedigree.Sound (8): The music used certainly had a great effect on the condition and the quality of the scenes in the series. The OST did a tremendous job of amplifying the emotions and tone of the setting during the course of the story. The Opening and Ending theme songs also bear a similar quality, with an addicting opening theme song featuring lyrics of the eponymous show.Characters (8) While other series offer fan service and ecchi scenes as a means to coerce their audience, Prison School does a tremendous job of amplifying the ecchi into the development of their characters. All of the characters in Prison School show signs of insecurities and lacking aspects of the character as the series begins, as all of them start as stereotyped aspects of a typical teenager. Gakuto is initially a closet otaku who obsesses over Chinese tales and the Warring States, Joe is a quiet loner who enjoys being alone with his ant farm, Kiyoshi appears to be the most stable of the group, but is having issues on knowing what to do and how to find his place, Andre has a keen obsession on being punished, and Shingo has leadership qualities but does not know where his allegiances lie. The characters certainly change as the series progresses, and all of them had likable qualities by the end of the show.Enjoyment (9): Prison School was an excellent school based ecchi anime, that leads its fanservicing moments towards the actual development of the series. Not only do the boobs jiggle, or the booty clap, but in doing so has a clear influence on the developments of the characters and the progression of the series. The humor of the series was certainly on point, with many aspects of the humor being absolutely hilarious at times. A great mold of story influenced ecchi, fantastic humor and gags as well as well done character development with crisp animation and sound design, I’d happily recommend Prison School towards anyone wanting to watch an ecchi based humor anime in a school setting, as well as fans of the similar series: Shimoneta.Overall (8/10) caught and sentenced to the aforementioned Prison School.

But prison school is something different. It's a comedy. Nothing is serious. It will make you laugh, a lot.Is it pure male fantasy? Maybe it is.  Then the final male fantasy is to be female, to take up the female gender role. It is not like that gender reversed Cinderella story (I forgot the name of that movie). I am not sure what it is. It is brilliant in terms of portraying and ridiculing that masochist male fantasy that seems to be the mainstream in Japan, which is a very very patriarchal society...on the surface. The pleasure of subversion then comes from maybe fantasizing the opposite. on the surface. The pleasure of subversion then comes from maybe fantasizing the opposite."", ""Artistic direction and music were very good and definitely well executed.For me the subject matter ruined the experience.I can deal with the cliche of pervy guys checking out girls, but there's a huge degree of casual objectification going on in the anime. Far too many fan-service moments that made the experience unpleasant.Not a lot of character development from the episodes I've seen either, yes there is a strong friendship but their initial crime is inherently wrong and none of them learn from the experience.Shame, as the art direction and music could of made this a solid piece if only the story was character focussed...rather than showing down-blouse or in between the crotch camera shots. rather than showing down-blouse or in between the crotch camera shots."", 'Welcome we are in a high school setting, yet again, but let’s turn into a prison and not just have a story about simply trying to escape, but let’s have the characters actually wanting to stay in prison.The Video Review is up on my channel, but here is the written Review.Story - 8/10What happens when you get 5 boys and put them in a school with girls only. Simple they boys try to take a peek at the girls when their bathing, obviously they get caught and thrown into prison, in their school. Naturally in a prison type setting, the characters would be aiming...to escape, but in this case, if they were to attempt escape and get caught 3 times, they are expelled from high school, and if you were expelled from high school perving, good luck in your social life. The first half of the story starts off as one of the boys are trying to escape the prison to go on a date, whereas the second half focuses on all the boys trying to stay in prison.It’s interesting how they throw in the idea, that the boys love being in prison. Almost at every moment the boys are punished by the girls, they love it, hence why they love the prison. But the most interesting part of the story is that, the boys are going through that phase where they are trying finding themselves, of course trying to find a way to get girls, so it plays the idea of a coming of age story. The pacing of the story is quite rushed, it’s a pacing that gives you a lot of information, but never really lets you sink in all the details beforehand. There’s a lot of cliff hangers leaving you wondering, how are they going to get out of the situation they’re in. The reason for this is because, the dialogue being spoken to quite fast, because they were trying to fit in so many things, into such a short anime. It may have been 2 arcs, but that 2 arcs felt rather rushed. Sure it’s ridiculous sometimes, and doesn’t make sense, but at the same time, the story doesn’t take itself too seriously.Characters - 7/10Kiyoshi Fujino, is the straight man out of all the boys and the main protagonist. He is the guy who tries his best to be good, even though deep inside he just like any of the other guys in a perverted way. Over the course of the anime, he tries to get along with his fellow jailbirds and keep them safe from the prison wardens. Unfortunately he is nothing special of a protagonist, he’s just a complete straight man, willing to help his friends. And he is shy around girls and not completely opened. But I guess he is needed, because the next few characters are pretty crazy.Takehito Morokuzu, also known as Gakuto is well, what you would a call a mad genius type. He is the one usually coming up with plans to escape prison or get the boys out of trouble. Despite his intelligence, he will go to great lengths when it comes to girls. He is shown be the mostly openly perverted out of all the guys.Reiji Androu or also known as Andre is the biggest and the strongest out of all the boys. Although usually calm and a gentle person, he is a complete masochists, meaning he loves to be punished by the prison wardens, especially the Vice-President. He shown to care for his friends over himself, although this could also imply that he just wants to get punished more, because of his masochists side.Jouji Nezu, is always seen wearing a hoodie over himself, no matter what outfit he wears. He is probably the biggest oddball of the group, with interests for other things outside the others, such as his loves for ants. Not only that he has a chronic cough, which he coughs blood. Despite him struggling with his speech, he’ got the most gut when it comes to calling out the wardens.Shingo Wakamoto is the last of the 5 boys. He plays the cool guy of the group, trying to act all cool to everyone else. He also acts the most selfish and becomes a hypocrite later on the series, but starts trying to redeem himself. But its due to his cool boy act start, he gets quite the development, as he learns how to forgive people and help his friends.The prison wardens are Mari Kurihara, Hana Midorikawa and Meiko Shiraki. And they play as the main villains in prison school, their goal was to prove the fact that all boys a scum and get them expelled from school. They’re also responsible for the majority of punishment and fan service for the boys. Apart from Shingo, no other character really gets a lot of development. So why it is the characters are likeable. It’s the way the characters interact with each other. Because despite having completely different personalities, the characters get along with well with each other and most of their interactions are actually very entertaining. Actually the only really small development is when the boys start learning how to trust each other, as at the start they were all just new boys at a new school, so there is that aspect that they learn how to work together, to get through things.Animation and Sound - 8/10, 7/10The art style looks quite mature as if it’s for a more mature serious audience, as it looks grittier than most other anime. Even though the character designs look like any other anime characters, it’s the fact that you can tell they’re clearly separated from the background. Now the way the fan service is down, I’m fine with it but to a certain extent sometimes it becomes annoying. The genre is considered ecchi, so having fan service is no problem, and censoring is not a problem at all, considering the majority of anime is censored, compared to the manga counterpart, but some of the censoring is just plain annoying. It’s annoying for the eyes when every type of censoring is done with a bright shining light out of nowhere, it just makes some scenes very bright. However that being said the art and animation also adds to some of the comedy to Prison School. Some of the faces and expressions that characters pull off is completely over the top exaggerated funny, and it makes such good use of the art style, because the characters for a brief moment start looking realistic.The soundtrack of Prison School, is nothing special. You can barely hear it and they don’t really add too much to the scenes. There is maybe some okay rock tracks in there, but there is nothing I would listen to by itself. The opening and ending songs are great and funny, which I think fits very well for this type of genre, and its sung by the cast. But their animation for it, is kind of underwhelming. What I do like about the sound is the voice actors, because they have pulled off a good job of making these characters sound very funny, but also somewhat serious at the same time, especially for Gakuto.Enjoyment - 9/10Although some of the jokes get stale from time to time, and the ecchi can completely be annoying, I cannot deny the fact that I loved watching this show. It’s actually legit funny, some of the jokes are clever, and the art style just adds to the creativity of some of them. Some of it can be toilet humour, but if it makes you laugh, it’s still funny and entertaining regardless. The story plays out like a typical escape prison story, but then flips the script later on and becomes a trying to stay in prison story. The character interactions make the show even funnier and their personalities are so likeable as well, due to their differences. It’s really enjoyable, because it knows what it is and doesn’t try to hide the fact it’s completely over the top as well, so it’s an anime you don’t have to take too seriously.Verdict - 8/10For the story of Prison School, I give it an 8, it may play out basic to start off with. But when the story changes itself and becomes a story of wanting to stay in prison, every moment feels like how are they going to get out of this predicament moment. I like how the story is sort of a finding one’s identity story as well. The thing holding it back is that it felt a bit rushed and it’s hard to take everything in completely.For the animation and sound, it gets a 8 and 7 from me. The art style is quite good to look at, and its uniqueness adds a lot to the comedy, whether it’s the facial expressions or the atmosphere. However the fan service censorship can be annoying when all of it is just bright light, shining in your face. The soundtrack is nothing special, and opening and ending themes are good. It’s the voice acting that’s great, because every character is done very well and they all sound funny, especially Gakuto.For the characters, I give it a 7. The biggest reason holding the characters back is the lack of any proper development besides, Kiyoshi, Shingo and Gakuto to an extent. No other character shows that much development, especially the wardens, maybe Hana, but that is more of a reaction. But the character interactions are great and the different personalities really add to the comedy.For my personal enjoyment, I give a 9. I love watching how the characters were going to escape prison, I love watching how they were going to stay in prison. I love watching how their planning and plans go into action. The comedy makes me laugh, and I wish for a second season, because I think the end sets up for an interesting story. The ecchi can be quite annoying, with the censorship sometimes, but it’s not too bad.So for the overall score of Prison School, after rounding it up, I give it an 8/10. It’s a funny anime, but sometime may go too far for some people, who can’t take a joke. I recommend it to people looking for comedy, or a prison drama fans. The comedy will make you laugh, just be wary some of the ecchi can be annoying. to escape, but in this case, if they were to attempt escape and get caught 3 times, they are expelled from high school, and if you were expelled from high school perving, good luck in your social life.

It’s the voice acting that’s great, because every character is done very well and they all sound funny, especially Gakuto.For the characters, I give it a 7. The biggest reason holding the characters back is the lack of any proper development besides, Kiyoshi, Shingo and Gakuto to an extent. No other character shows that much development, especially the wardens, maybe Hana, but that is more of a reaction. But the character interactions are great and the different personalities really add to the comedy.For my personal enjoyment, I give a 9. I love watching how the characters were going to escape prison, I love watching how they were going to stay in prison. I love watching how their planning and plans go into action. The comedy makes me laugh, and I wish for a second season, because I think the end sets up for an interesting story. The ecchi can be quite annoying, with the censorship sometimes, but it’s not too bad.So for the overall score of Prison School, after rounding it up, I give it an 8/10. It’s a funny anime, but sometime may go too far for some people, who can’t take a joke. I recommend it to people looking for comedy, or a prison drama fans. The comedy will make you laugh, just be wary some of the ecchi can be annoying.', ""Two Thumbs up! A solid 10 from me.Who here aside from me has seen a perverted moment that you think there was not just punishment made? I bet i hit a bell. Anyways... with this show a justice(in my opinion) is preformed. LITERAL JAIL TIME AT SCHOOL! WHERE THEY ARE Belittled IN COUNTLESS WAYS! I could go into graphic detail but that is aside from the point. Yes, there was payback made but hope was instilled. True, one should feel angered towards the proven guilty but isn't there more that meets the eyes? Something or two that are eyes can not see even if staring...at it directly. Not something that is invisible per-say but more wrapped in hidden code. One in particular that portrays highly in this case is social norms. A guy and a girl start a family. The origin for that you ask? Without content it is a fair guess that one of them felt a grand urge that would not subside. Given how i think women are forced to hide their feelings in order not to suffer emotionally leaves one party. The sole man must act. This is just part 1 of part 2. Part 2 is why is the man the aggressor here? It is not just because he alone remains it is nature. Try as we might our minds wish to procreate to stay alive. Alas, this is where the female reemerges. She must be made to be strong yet weak. Strong to endure the troubles of what will lie ahead and weak to give in to fate. Her main weakness her privates. In view they are taken in by storm. No matter the strength one has there is no escaping it. Where there are toys you will find kids. So, it only makes sense where you as a man go a women will to. Yes, freedom of will is lovely but somethings can't be help. All said in mind this goes to proven that yes men are guilty of perversion but they are not the only guilty party. Guilt is only guilt because something has shifted the balance greatly. For example, robbing a bank or murdering a person which will you feel guilty on? you picked one? HA, you have proven my point. No matter how you see it both are guilty actions. Our society demands punishment and to progress we must see someone lesser on the ladder. Ergo, a scapegoat is unavoidable. No matter how you spin a coin there are at least two faces.*wipes forehead* sorry. Normally, not the kind of review i do but i felt it needed to be addressed before i continue. If you are still with me i thank you. Where was i? oh yeah, the boys found guilty of peeping change. Not quite a simple meta-morph but inside. Their view on the world becomes altered. The women could have simply left the men rot in jail but they chose to whip them, humiliate them and destroy their living mind. all for what? peeping? peeping doesn't involve physical harm.... at least last time i checked. how is that trade off fair? This leads the viewer to root for the guys to make a stand and fight. Not just to get out but to better themselves. For an anime to deliver such a message and have a nice plot/art/sound to top it off who can resist such a wonderful ice-cream Sunday? at it directly.

I must admit I did enjoy this for what it is. I didn\'t know what to have expected so i just delved right in. This anime is extremely lewd to the point where I had to ask myself ""What the fuck am I watching?"" and then proceed to laugh at the ridiculousness. After you realize what it is and you give into it, it becomes amusing to watch. I must say, the story sucks though. Regardless, I will look forward to more.Oh, also, as a male, watching this also made me cringe at the brutality the Student Council are on the male...characters. I couldn\'t help but feel it as if it were happening to me or a friend I know (LOL). That vice-president needs to stop leaking so much too. characters. I couldn\'t help but feel it as if it were happening to me or a friend I know (LOL). That vice-president needs to stop leaking so much too.', 'Wow. I never thought I would have such respect for a comedy anime. This show does so many things well it\'s hard to know where to begin. First off, I have to express my admiration for just how confidently the show takes its approach to humor. It\'s just so bold in how it does absurd comedy it\'s hard not to be awestruck.The premise of the show is pretty basic, but the actual events that take place actually have tons of moving parts. There\'s so much attention to detail that you\'ll be very impressed with how elaborate and ingenious it all is when plans unfold....Although there are 5 protagonists, really only 3 ever get anything more than a side role. The remaining 2 characters do have their occasional moments, but mostly they\'re just there. Would the show have been better if they\'d had more screen time? That\'s hard to say given how much I already enjoyed it. The antagonists are equally likable but for different reasons. The punishments they dish out are absurd in the best way possible. And their attitudes really sell their roles as spiteful wardens.How would I describe the show\'s style of humor? The first word that comes to mind is ""ridiculous."" The gratuitous fan service is hardly worth mentioning because most of the show\'s hilarity comes from the situations the writers think up. Things always go awry when the protagonists plan to escape or what have you, and the dread of them being discovered is an experience in and of itself. And the execution of their far-fetched schemes always involve them doing something utterly unbelievable.So now I\'ll tell you what not to expect from this anime. Don\'t expect formulaic episodes or childish humor. Make no mistake, everything is very well thought-out and you\'ll never be disappointed. This is hands-down the best comedy anime I\'ve seen.

This review may be dry but if you have a firm grasp of the English language this will suit you fine.Main Points:- This is an ecchi anime; expect the expected and the unexpected :).- Visuals are stunning.- Retardedly stupid funny situations I have never seen in any other anime.- Toilet humor and sex jokes.- Definitely not for everyone.I have watched several ecchi animes: To Love Ru, High School DxD, Seikon no Quaser etc. This anime looks at 5 high school guys with healthy libidos in what used to be an elite all-girls school. I know the previous...sentence sounds like your typical ecchi plot but read on. This review is a little dry but pseudo-analytical.The libido is a caged animal that is buried inside the skull that wants out and needs to be set free. This anime shows that although a man may think with his penis; mankind has been known for his creativity and ingenuity when faced with adversary. Novel ideas, creativity and hard work spurn out of man's needs. I am not talking about desperate needs of hunger or thirst but that of the libido. It has been said that when man thinks with his penis, he does not think or is brainless. Prison school is showing that man does think with his dick but with the inclusion of using his ingenious, creative brain. This notion combined with titillating (yes pun intended) visuals, plus a comedic and effective plotline makes Prison School truly enjoyable. Prison School innovates and redefines what a good comedic ecchi show should be. Definitely a rare gem.The ecchi genre is not for everyone. People should know what they are getting at before they watch an ecchi anime. But this is not your typical ecchi anime, from the first episode onward it can be said that this is truly a unique anime. The plot/story is well thought out with superb attention to detail. The story is fresh and it does not rehash old plotlines or formulaic circumstances based on other animes. The comedy and jokes are mature and dirty in nature as well expected. This anime contains a good amount of toilet humor so be warned. Its integration with the plot is very good. Enmeshed with this is exemplary executed visuals and art.An attention to detail is exemplified in the art work and visuals. The character's emotions and facial expressions, although sometimes exaggerated, convey exactly what they feel with a twist of comedy, not a lot of anime can pull that off I believe. With this attention to detail in mind, I could attest that the visuals are certainly enticing. The satisfaction I get is that of erotic appeal but with the sophistication of art. Now that is hard to achieve. I have noticed certain nuances in the art. Even color shades and skin tones are well executed. The level of detail put into the art and visuals shows. Also with regards to the manga, I cannot attest to any comparisons with the manga, but I can say that this is one fine show.I believe that the voice acting is superb. The talented cast consists of experienced seiyu from other high profile animes. A terrific voice acting draws the viewer in. What else can I say? The soundtrack is the only thing I won’t praise.Overall, WOW. I can't stop grinning after each episode. A must watch. To all guys out there with perfectly functional eryngii: it is your obligation to watch this show, and hopefully enjoy it. sentence sounds like your typical ecchi plot but read on.

High school ecchi's aren't my cup of tea unless they have something setting them far apart from the masses, and oh boy does this set itself apart. I pulled an all nighter because I couldn't find myself stopping.Five perverted boys find themselves at a used to be all girls school. Why are they the only boys with two hundred girls you might ask? Don't worry about it. Why does no one expect them to be perverts and go look in the girl's bathroom? Not really sure. Why...is there just a full decked prison in the school courtyard? Don't question it. The story turns into one thing and then into another, and I found it to be hilariously enjoyable from the second it started.The art is absurd ( in the good way). Its over the top and dramatic with almost every frame and it works so well with the style and tone of the show. The ecchi is over the top, the facial expressions are over the top, heck, even some of the backgrounds are over the top. It works.This is hard because I own this and watched both sub and dub. The sub is alright, but the dub is amazing. The dub adds more crudeness and humor to the show. Like Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt and Ghost Stories,this one deserves to be watched as a dub.The characters are hilarious. End of story. From the boys to the Underground Student Council to the Above Ground Student Council to the girls in the school to even the principal. Each one of them are so different but they all work so well.Like I stated at first, I refused to even go near this thing. I found myself finishing it in the span of a night because I literally couldn't close my laptop after episodes ended. Prison School is a short lived over the top ecchi that deserves the hype it gets (this thing is super popular in Japan) because of the antics, characters, and art style. For the love of all things holy watch this one with the door closed and headphones in.As of the end of the manga coming forth, please go see my review of the Prison School Manga because oh boy its really different. is there just a full decked prison in the school courtyard?

This show had me laughing and cringing every episode and is a fantastic ride through and through. Even the moments that aren't purposely funny they just are based on what the characters are doing and how they act. The premise of somehow a group of four boys somehow getting enrolled into an all girl school with a fascist style student council who throw the boys into a jail because boys were being pervy sets up for the comedy in such an absurd way. Raunch comedy is...for sure what I would label it but it's the absurdity of the comedy that always kept me rolling in laughter throughout the entire run of the anime. for sure what I would label it but it's the absurdity of the comedy that always kept me rolling in laughter throughout the entire run of the anime."", 'I\'m still kinda new to reviews but I\'m gonna try and leave a good one here for prison school ;)Alright so the art style was pretty nice, it was very detailed and I actually liked it a lot.The story is one of a kind, I\'ve never seen any other anime with a similar plot and I don\'t think there will be any either :PDon\'t really know what to say about the soundtrack because I don\'t really pay attention to the soundtrack very much but I think it was good and made the anime more intense, I also liked the opening it was quite...catchy :3I enjoyed it quite a lot, however I don\'t know if other might enjoy it as much as I did, it contained A LOT of fan service (and with A LOT I mean that it\'s basically a hentai xD) and there was a lot of censorship so if you really hate censorship you should probably not watch this :/ The comedy was pretty brutal or explosive comedy or what it was called and I really like that kind of comedy but I don\'t think a lot of people like that kind of comedy so you\'ll have to watch it and see for yourself ;) It contained a bit of romance and I think that some guys can relate to the characters a bit. It had some intense and exciting moments and some like smart plans moments (kinda like in the ending of death note if you know what I\'m talking about)The only bad things about it that I can think of (That some people might not like but personally I don\'t have any problems with it) was that the women were the bosses in it, I\'ve seen another anime where the women ""rules"" and a lot of people were hating on that in the comments so I thought I would include it here just so you know if you hate bossy women kind of animes then this is NOT for you :(My ratings:Story: 9Art: 8Sound: 8Characters: 8Enjoyment: 10Overall: 8 catchy :3I enjoyed it quite a lot, however I don\'t know if other might enjoy it as much as I did, it contained A LOT of fan service (and with A LOT I mean that it\'s basically a hentai xD) and there was a lot of censorship so if you really hate censorship you should probably not watch this :/ The comedy was pretty brutal or explosive comedy or what it was called and I really like that kind of comedy but I don\'t think a lot of people like that kind of comedy so you\'ll have to watch it and see for yourself ;) It contained a bit of romance and I think that some guys can relate to the characters a bit.

Enjoy!!"", 'So I was in the mood for a new series and one that didn\'t recently come out. So I went to my trusty anime provider, brought up the dubs list (because if I am going to be diving into a complex plot or one that melts my brain, I at least want to still follow what is happening when my eyes roll backwards.), and playd Russian Roulette to determine what to watch.It just so happened to land on Prison School. Now I have a rule that says that any show that doesn\'t entertain by episode 3 is a drop anime. Prison School almost fell...into that category. I read the summary before starting and was interested but upon start it didn\'t deliver much. So Prison School is best described as an Ecchi Comedy. Now the Ecchi is ""there"" from the word go, but the comedy actually takes backseat for a few episodes. Thusly the comedy is what saved this show for me. So let us go on this adventure of a review.Story: 6The story in Prison School is what I would call an Idiot Plot. If you are unfamiliar or can\'t decode the meaning off name alone, an idiot plot is a plot that is only made possible by stupid people doing obviously stupid things. Some can be good idiot plots by having the characters seek out the solution to the problem they created and growth happens along the way so that if the characters were in the same situation again there would definitely be a different outcome.Unfortunately, Prison School falls on the other side of idiot plots where the characters screw up and spend there time living through their consequences not learning much along the way. Again the comedy is what kept me invested for the most part. I went out and read the manga (for a number of reasons) and found that the plot actually picks up a lot better in the later arc so there is that.Art: 8Not much to this, the design is enjoyable to look at, there were a few times where the facial expression threw me off for a few moments but over all well done. One thing that did bug me was how they did the ecchi and why I put \'there\' in parentheses. The show has no problem panning over or having the camera angle in such a way that the lewd view was VERY noticeable but at the same time they covered a lot of it up with light beams. So it became a consistent nag of watching a full scene, switch to half a scene since the other half is light beams, then go back to full. The manga obviously doesn\'t do this.Sound: 6Much like Art, there isn\'t much to say about sound. I didn\'t notice any nice tracks that play in the background. The Op and Ed were good but not memorable. The voice actors did well in bringing out the character of each character. Like I said, not much to say.Character: 5Ok so while the voice actors did well in bringing out character. that still didn\'t do any favors for the lack of character these guys have. Remember, I said this is an idiot plot so not much growth happens here. The lead only gains some confidence while also still being a whining bitch. His pals consist of a whining bitch that is also smart, a whining bitch who is also a pussy, a masochist who is only that, and an ant lover who has a stomach disease. None of them grow or change. There were two characters who I found interesting and was also part of the reason I went back to read the manga. Hana and the Chairman. Hana is a treat to watch her play nice while instantly flipping shit when she gets mad while at the same time trying to get revenge (and more) on the lead. Its actually funny to watch and I was cheering her on the whole time. The Chairman is just an Ass addict who empathizes the last word or sound in every sentence he says. Kinda funny to see.Enjoyment: 7As it stands I probably wouldn\'t go back to Prison school for a second run. The plot is really dumb, the characters are pretty bland (aside from 2), and sound is just forgettable. I remember asking myself at one point, ""If I left now would I regret it?"", to which my brain said ""No, but it wouldn\'t kill ya to finish it."" And that\'s pretty much how it was for me. At the end of the day the comedy and a couple characters saved it for me. I would honestly read the manga if you are at all interested because at least you get more of it. I can give a firm guess there will not be a season 2 so might as well.Overall: 6 into that category. I read the summary before starting and was interested but upon start it didn\'t deliver much.

It's like if Death Note overdosed on toilet humor and had a one night stand with High School of the Dead. The entire show is way better than it has any right to be.Story 9/10: Whoa there buddy, your giving this a 9? Yes, yes I am. Arguably the best part of this absolutely glorious fetish ridden clusterfuck is it's thriller story; and no, I was not exaggerating when I compared it to Death Note. Without spoiling anything...beyond the first episode, the general premise is an all girl boarding school (for some reason) decides to allow a trail run of 5 guys to join. They of course decide to go peeping and get locked away in the (which they have handy for this sort of offense, of course) on campus prison to serve out a sentence of one month.The story centers around the mind games and mental gymnastics of the student council versus the prisoners, as they devise ways to escape and the student body devises ways to catch them red handed. Somehow, it actually manages to give us a strong, suspenseful story without getting rid of its GOOD locker room humor; I have no idea how, but this show makes them work better when combined. For how dumb of a story this is, it takes itself surprisingly seriously and is more than able to back it up. I was gripping my seat in anticipation for what happens next while laughing hysterically the entire time.Art 8/10: Why is this so good? I don't need to see ass in this level of artistic detail, but if some Chad at J.C.Staff is going to spend 200 hours on the most realistic digital interpretation of one to ever grace my monitor, I'm certainly not going to look away from it. Real talk though, the art is a cut above the 2015 standard, but when it actually tries to, it can shoot up to god tier in short bursts. It'll frequently change the art style and significantly punch up the quality to highlight tension in a scene, it does it a lot but it does it well. Other than that, the character designs are average, the animation is alright, and whoever made Andre needs a raise.Also, as a quick side note, I'd highly recommend watching an uncensored version of this if you can. No, it's not just because of the tits, but because I've seen parts of both and the censored version takes up like 3 times more screen area than it ever needs to and it gets really annoying really fast.Sound 8/10: The intro, like everything else in this show, is way better than it has any right to be given the nature and content in this anime; the outro is alright to. Other than that, the background OST is good, it does it's job and does it fine. Not really much else I can say here, writing about the music and art of a series is really hard if nothing about those areas stood out to much.Character 7/10: This show is not for everyone, and it's characters highlight that point more than anything else. Their shallow, overexaggerated, underdeveloped, act irrationally, and are constantly horny all the time. Thank god that all of those horrible qualities are perfect for telling the story Prison School is trying to tell. They work for the story, but have very little substance beyond that.Enjoyment 10/10: Boobs = funny.But like actually, the story was incredibly gripping by itself, the ecchi was just the icing on the cake that I didn't even know I needed till I had it. The ecchi in this show is pretty much used exclusively to add tension and humor to a scene, and rarely reduced to cheap fanservice. I didn't even know I was into this kind of stuff till I was already enjoying it.Overall 9/10: Holy shit, this is so funny I legitimately cannot stop laughing. This show takes itself very seriously and extremely not seriously at the exact same time and is able to do both at once. The pacing was a little fast, and it ignored development of it's characters to move the plot along quickly, but it never felt rushed. Even the scenes that came across as slightly forced still carried an incredible amount of surprisingly well made tension, and I couldn't take my eyes off this spectacular made ecchi Death Note parody. beyond the first episode, the general premise is an all girl boarding school (for some reason) decides to allow a trail run of 5 guys to join.

Even though the story basically surrounds the youthful drama of five boys and their Eros drive living around the pool of girls. What makes this ecchi anime worth watching is the characterization, storylining and pleasuring animation. Each distinctive character holds a different point of view regarding their ambitious lust whether it be masochistic Andre, soft-spoken yet very vulgar Jo, or classical history maniac Takehito; these characters are very unique in the whole history of anime because characters like these are very rare, you don't get to see them in any anime. The most badass character in this...anime had been the Principal which is hilarious! His fetish regarding Ass is what makes this anime stand out from any other anime because in the history of anime we don't get to see such characters where they don't like the very luscious part of the female body which is Ass and his question to Kiyoshi regarding what makes Ass to be a standout than Boobs and that was eye-opening!Not only do the perverted boys hold these anime to be unique but the very Underground Council of Three women makes this anime ridiculously amazing, especially the Vice-president. Some people may only watch this anime because of those extreme big breasts and shortest possible skirt peeping the glances of her inners. But it should maintain with the violent yet soft Hana who at first is like a brute but when her embarrassing or innermost act of self-relief is disclosed before Kiyoshi is far more serious it looks. And after that cornering him in every possible way to enclose his embarrassing side. The president was not very different from any apathetic person in any anime but her pet, Crows, makes it different than any other anime.In short, this anime is the ride of perverted self-determination of youthful boys standing against the very feministic domain of unequal treatment where they're being suffered in prison for peeping but tortured for being a boy with or without reason.So I recommend this anime to all those boys who are perverted in their own way to imagine the very possibility of being the such a character and enjoy their adventures with unparalleled libido. anime had been the Principal which is hilarious!

If you enjoy ecchi then you could definitely enjoy this, but if you're like me, you can take this one off of your watch list. If you're not sure, just watch 1 ep and you'll probably have your answer.

The voices were done really well and there are heaps of comedic moments which include dirty jokes. There weren't that many sex scenes, but there were still quite a few. I'm more into anime shows that would have had more sex scenes but that's probably only because hentai is my favourite anime genre, but if you need a new comedic ecchi to watch, then this would be for you. I like how each character had their own personalities and the voices were done really well and it's nice to see a non-harem type of fan service for once...since we don't really see many of those. The guys were all really funny with the ways that they tried to survive/break out of where they were being held, Hana was kind of funny with her lewdness, Chiyo was a helpful and likeable character, the Vice President was funny with the way she always got pissed off over the tiniest things and how the guys went crazy over her and the President was also funny with the ways she tried to get the guys in trouble, although I think other people would find her character annoying.

The five turned the scales in their favor, and Kiyoshi escaped exposing his secret by their new ally ChiyoBut for Anime, like Prison School, an entirely happy ending looks disappointing, as we all expected a sudden shift that would return the five to prison or spoil their plan from the ground up, but what we got was the biggest surprise, as the Student Council became a prisoner, and 3 new personalities came to dominate and dominate What it looks like.It may be disappointing that a similar series ended at the borders of Episode 12. But we are not at the site of the complainant, especially after what the series provided"", ""Prison school is a comedy mixed with ecchi and a show that uses these two elements to create this type of story . There are some advantages and disadvantages to this show:This show's concept and story is non existing  but the true elements are the comedy and the crazy amount of fan service . I will admit many of the jokes made me laugh and it can be very funny . The first few episodes were honesty decent but after that I realized the stupid amount of fan service there was. Like the amount of fan service is quite overwhelming ,and many times it...can get really uncomfortable to watch .Sometimes the show can be very gross, which I get is funny but how many times does Kiyoshi has to get his ass injured and how many times does takehito have to literally poop his pants or speak of the matter of it . I'm not saying its bad it is not , it can be very funny but the true issue is the unbalance of ecchi and comedy .Sometimes it feels like another version of daily like of high school boys ,which is a great show but a much more extreme version with really hot girls wearing almost nothing and tons of fan service .This show is decent but if they decreased the amount of fan service and balanced the comedy to the ecchi it could have been much better .Even with these problems it deserves a watch for the funny aspect of it . can get really uncomfortable to watch .Sometimes the show can be very gross, which I get is funny but how many times does Kiyoshi has to get his ass injured and how many times does takehito have to literally poop his pants or speak of the matter of it .

I've avoided watching this anime for weeks thinking it was not my type and that I would be disappointed, but I was pleasantly surprised.The characters are all amazing. First you have the five boys taken prisoner, who each have their own unique personality. There's Andre, a morbidly obese masochist, Joe, a hooded guy obsessed with ants, Shingo, and American delinquent, Gakuto, who is a hilarious mastermind, and Kiyoshi, the dedicated main dude. Among the Underground Student Council are three unique women. Meiko is a...sadistic Vice President with boobs larger than her head. Hana is even more violent with a grudge against Kiyoshi and an strange obsession with golden showers. Finally there's the President Mari with a hate for perverts because of her own father, the chairman of the school who's obecessed with butts.The story is not the best yet I couldn't stop watching. There are some hilariously dramatic scenes where I realize, wait this is about someone sacrificing themselves by shitting themselves or coming together to answer the question of which is better, breasts or butts? There were points where I had to pause because I was laughing so hard I didn't want to miss a second.I didn't expect to enjoy this anime as much as I did, but it's definitely worth watching. sadistic Vice President with boobs larger than her head.

However, I expected something with a more punch in it.This anime is based around idea of a school having a ""prison"" for group of students and those students trying to get out of that prison. There\'s a lot of very crude humor and fancervice(? not sure if I\'d call it fancervice) that has subtlety of getting hit by a sledgehammer in the face. The anime doesn\'t hold back. There are S&M-related jokes, quite a lot of fem-dom, nudity, etc. For some reason the whole thing didn\'t really click with me, however.Story:Ridiculous premise,...dramatic moments and humor. All of this is rough and direct, without any subtleties. We have sexual jokes, nudity, extremely violent interactions, and blood (for comedy effect). The anime does not mess around. The story spans one continuous ""arc"" meaning things happen one after another, and there\'s always driving force moving the story forward. It is fairly solid, I\'d say.Art:I\'m not fond of the shading method used in this anime. Drawings of character themselves look great, but shading used on it sometimes looks ""cheap"" and gives the whole iamge a bit of a ""dirty"" feeling. I\'m not sure if it is intentional. Characters are quite well drawn. One female character has HUGE assets (for comedy purposes) and wears skimpy clothes to boot, probably for comedy purposes. Overall art is pretty solid, but I\'m not sure why they selected this approach to shading.Sound:Solid music, but appears to be underutilized.Character:Due to ridiculous story, characters also act in ridiculous way, due to being in ridiculous situations. The most memorable character is Hana, but unfortunately she does not get enough screen time. Other characters appear to work as some sort of plot devices, and do not stand out too much.Enjoyment:IT was alright. I thought it woudl be better. THere were some cool moments here and there, but I really expected a bigger impact.OVverall:Worth a watch if you enjoy ecchi and crude humor.

Girls are the moral beings, those who have to protect themselves from this creepy sexuality -- but, in this subversion, actually have the power to punish those advances, to attack back at the male gaze. This is the opposite of the real world, where woman's sexuality is the one being judged and punished.But is more complex than that, for the boys perviness is limitless and adaptable. As is sexuality, the girls' strictness and sadist pleasure-less practices gives birth to the boys' masochist tendencies, feeding the same sexuality...they desire to punish. And, in this school of female anti-sexuality, the girls are oblivious to the natural sensuality of their existence, even to the most obvious degree: their bodies, and it's exposition, which actually feeds the same male gaze that they're trying to attack.There's a clear message - most eloquently put by the opening and ending themes - that this effort to control the boys sexuality is useless, for sex (they call it 'love', but let's be serious...) is a part of the human nature & experience. And this is why the real prison... is love. (But actually is moralism.)Mostly, Prison School is (weirdly) so much fun. The story is a very particular struggle to survive oppression -- there's a constant tension to escape the prison, the punishments, the attention of the girls-jailers. The boys succumb to intrigue, but there's also a greater arc about their friendship forming and giving them strength to persevere, turning the final stretch of the series in a great game of wits. The characters are both likeable and stupid enough to deeply root for them. And is just constantly funny.Loose thoughts:- Overall, the strongest way to maintain the boys locked up is the threat of public humiliation. There's a very constant fear to be socially judged in most of the characters.- Outlaw legos.- Kiyoshi butt is a black hole that attracts a lot of unwanted, violent penetration.- Butt philosophy. VERY INTENSE butt philosophy.- No one that likes sumo/crows/butts can be a bad person.- Everything surrounding Hana is my favorite, and the development of her fetish and/or attraction is one of the best parts of the series.- Which leads to a hilarious Isaac Newton's apple falling on the head epiphany, but instead of an apple is a mushroom, and instead of the head is a butt. And instead of discovering gravity she remembers a penis.- Which leads to a great, rage-filled, scene about cutting mushrooms.- A well-placed (and perfect metaphor) Medusa.- The coloring of the series annoys me a lot, but I can't quite place it: the texture seems to be misplaced light, or something like this.

Herein, the main characters attempt to survive the brutality of the USC, as they conspire against the boys, trying to expel them.Prison School is an extremely ecchi anime, on par with actual hentai, and it is completely unapologetic on this front. Not only is the fanservice omnipresent (with the USC's vice president more or less serving...entirely this role, whose breast size probably set a world record), but, the characters routinely experience severe punishment for their misdeeds, which is a great pleasure for someone with a reverse ryona fetish, such as myself.As a comedy, Prison School's main entertainment value lies in its ability to be comedic. The writing is well-done, but where Prison School really shines is with its characters. While the main character, Kiyoshi is relatively 'normal', others, such as the masochistic Andre, Joe, who has a loving for ants, and Gakuto, my personal favourite of the series, an otaku with a strong interest in the Three Kingdoms (a historical period when China was separated into three kingdoms, as the name implies) with very strong leadership abilities, strategies, and an overall strong character, willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. Additionally, his voice actor did an excellent job, and captured his character greatly.The storyline of Prison School can be summarised in a few sentences, as I did earlier in this review, even, but the episode by episode happenings are far from predictable. Each episode is varied and the exploits of the pentagonists are all a pleasure to view. This writing is particularly good for a comedy anime.Overall, Prison School is a well-made anime. It's not one of the greatest comedies ever written, and some may find it hard to look past the raunchy nature of it, but if you can, you're in for one of the best balances of story, comedy and characters I've seen in an anime of this genre for quite some time. entirely this role, whose breast size probably set a world record), but, the characters routinely experience severe punishment for their misdeeds, which is a great pleasure for someone with a reverse ryona fetish, such as myself.As a comedy, Prison School's main entertainment value lies in its ability to be comedic.

While the main character, Kiyoshi is relatively 'normal', others, such as the masochistic Andre, Joe, who has a loving for ants, and Gakuto, my personal favourite of the series, an otaku with a strong interest in the Three Kingdoms (a historical period when China was separated into three kingdoms, as the name implies) with very strong leadership abilities, strategies, and an overall strong character, willing to sacrifice himself for his friends. Additionally, his voice actor did an excellent job, and captured his character greatly.The storyline of Prison School can be summarised in a few sentences, as I did earlier in this review, even, but the episode by episode happenings are far from predictable. Each episode is varied and the exploits of the pentagonists are all a pleasure to view. This writing is particularly good for a comedy anime.Overall, Prison School is a well-made anime. It's not one of the greatest comedies ever written, and some may find it hard to look past the raunchy nature of it, but if you can, you're in for one of the best balances of story, comedy and characters I've seen in an anime of this genre for quite some time."", ""Honestly when I complete a show I don't usually write review about it,but for prison school I decided to write one as this show is a gem among ecchi anime.When I first started the show it seemed ridiculous and somewhat annoying at first but as I watched more and more episodes the story got much more intriguing and much more ridiculous and funnier .The characters are mostly good especially kyoushi , hana and gakuto are the best characters of the show.Story is pretty lame but what more can be expected from an ecchi anime so its okay in my opinion.Art is great throughout the series...and makes the situations much more impactful . Sound is pretty good especially the opening song .As for enjoyment it is the funniest show I have watched in my life especially the last 3 episodes of the show are simply epic .So, if you want to watch a funny show and are okay with ecchi stuff, then this show is purely gold for you. and makes the situations much more impactful .

I think it\'s a very safe bet to say if you liked that you\'ll like this too. As with HSotD, this anime is completely ridiculous and over the top, completely self-aware and shamelessly completely all in on what it\'s doing and it leads to more than a few absolutely absurd scenarios and even more fits of laughter. It should of course be noted that this type of humor is certainly not for everyone, and probably...the older and weirder you are the more likely you are to understand and appreciate everything, but if you fit the demographic this anime is targeting you\'re in for a wild ride!The story here is completely nonsensical, as with just about everything else in this anime, throwing a main cast of horny boys who get caught being peeping toms at an otherwise all girls school into the school\'s built-in prison run by the girls. That alone should give you an idea as to whether or not this is up your alley. All sorts of tropes and kinky fetishes from bondage to face-sitting to humiliating and degrading a partner to golden showers, and plenty more, are on display here. One of the main female characters who oversees the boys while they are serving their prison time, of course, has comically large breasts that cannot be contained by her clothes.Beyond that the ""story"", which believe it or not, while simple, there actually is one, largely revolves around blatantly setting up, usually in the most absurd and convenient ways possible, just about any excuse possible to put these fetishes on full display and make any and every situation sexual as the boys try to wait out their prison sentence and avoid outright expulsion from the school.The voice acting in the English dub can sometimes be pretty cringe-inducing. Two of the main five boys have absolutely ridiculous, borderline obnoxious voices. This was clearly a conscious choice made by the voice actors/director to further go down the road of tropes and ridiculousness, but sometimes it\'s just super annoying and actually detracts a bit from the show. I think perhaps the execution here could have been better.Other than perhaps the opening theme, which isn\'t my personal cup of tea but is admittedly catchy, the music here isn\'t memorable. I definitely enjoyed and appreciated how, as with all other parts of the show, even the music was designed specifically to lend to the overall ridiculous and self-aware tone of the anime, often being super super dark, serious and ominous and jokingly trying to convey drama and seriousness in an anime that is anything but. In dramatic scenes in this anime you hear the same kind of music you\'d hear in a dramatic scene in Death Note or in a tragic character death or the aftermath of a great battle in a more action oriented anime. i loved this choice stylistically, and it furthered my already omnipresent sheepish grin, but there\'s nothing I\'d add to my playlist after the fact. The music here is meant to be complementary, which it succeeds in being, as opposed to a standalone product.Being a newer anime, the animation here is what you\'d expect it to be from a product of this time period. This show never attempts to be a visual spectacle, other than its numerous instances of fan service, but the quality, consistency and fluidity of the animation are all where they should be.Character development for at least two of the main five boys is honestly pretty weak, arguably to the point where they\'re just generic throwaways that could have had their roles filled by just about anybody without changing the anime in any meaningful way. This is, however, more forgivable in an anime that isn\'t designed to be deep and serious. One could argue that it doesn\'t actually need to develop its characters. The main boys, and the group as a whole, do grow closer over the course of the anime and they all contribute more than nothing, but it\'s very clear who the primary guys are and who is resigned to secondary character status.I always feel weird recommending or not recommending anime like this because it\'s totally dependent on personal taste and what kind of humor does it for you. Instead, I tried to spend most of this review giving you an idea of what to expect here, without spoilers, so you can make your own decision and I hope I succeeded in doing so. I, personally, found myself laughing and grinning very frequently during my viewing experience and found this to be a feel-good, absolutely ridiculous good time.

The story being absolutely crazy with students trapped in a prison in school sounds too crazy to work, but ultimately produces a really good narrative. The story doesn't take itself too seriously, having all sorts of crazy things happening constantly. Most of these are used...just for humor, which is pretty standard. But what I feel is unique here is that even though these events are completely nonsensical, they still end up mattering and having an impact on the overall narrative. The end result is a story that has a narrative that is simultaneously both absolutely hilarious but also has a pretty intense to the point that you're incredibly interested in seeing what happens next. In addition there is a string of crazy plot twists and constant suspense, this is due to their being such a strong cast of characters. The main five are all pretty varied with their own motivations and personalities that results in them not always getting along, but also working really well together when they do. They're certainly not heroic, but they're characters that are easy to get invested in. But at the same time, what's just as important is that the antagonists, the Underground Student Council, are a just as strong, if not stronger, set of characters. They too have varying personalities, and though they're more united due to being clearly led by the President, they have their own bonds as well. Surprisingly in a way that feels kind of like Stockholme Syndrome I suppose, they too I think are pretty likable and easy to get invested in. But most importantly is the interactions these two factions have with each other, with them being in a very bizarre battle of wits that results in them exploiting the other sides personality quirks and creating a very interesting dynamic between the two groups. The anime also ends at a solid point, where one arc is clearly resolved but another is also set up.Something that's also important to mention is that the art was amazing, like absolutely top class in terms of an art style that is both really good to look at, both in terms of being beautiful and being really good at fan service, and incredibly well made with great animation. The OP was really good in terms of visuals and audio and fit the atmosphere of the show perfectly. The ED and soundtrack were also both really solid. just for humor, which is pretty standard.

Is it an Ecchi? Harem? Hentai? Romance? Nope! Prison School, at its core, is a bromance comedy with tons of hilarious sexual humor. The comedy is first-rate and this is probably the funniest anime I have ever watched. The humor was raunchy, the timing was spot on, the characters were bizarre and uncomfortable. It was great.The plot can be summed up in a few lines. After a foiled attempt at peeping on the girls’ shower room, the five male students at an all-girls high school are sentenced to serve a month in the on-campus prison which is run by the...tyrannical and estrogenic “Underground Student Council”. The series takes us through the boys’ absurd, demeaning and hilarious trials and tribulations of Prison School Life.What’s immediately noticeable about Prison School is how blatantly unsexy the series is. For all the obscene physicality--the tits and ass--there is a marked lack of either sexual gratification or tension between the characters. It’s more than just an icy, Fem-Dom thing too—the female characters were almost completely asexual in terms of personality and response to their surroundings (I’ll come back to that later). The only sexual tension occurs between Hana, the sadistic student council secretary, and Kiyoshi, the hapless protagonist, but their bizarre and absurd interactions are skillfully engineered to make you laugh, not fap. As a caveat, I should mention that there is going to be a subset of people who genuinely find the concept of scantily clad women beating the shit out of male anime characters more erotic than comical, but I will leave it up to the viewer to decide which category they belong in.I’ve heard critiques that Prison School objectifies women but it’s hard to know which gender gets it worse—which makes it hilarious. On one hand, the women in the series are all sexually objectified up the wazoo. T&A abound to a gratuitous degree. Some characters get more screen time for their boobs than their face. Equally unflattering for the ladies is the ultra-prudish attitude of the all-female Underground Student Counsel and the bland naivety of every other female cast member. They are unreasonable, humorless, reactionary, sadistic and domineering.Now on to the guys. The male characters are essentially hormone-driven, loser sex slaves---they are confined, beaten and humiliated daily. But this is O.K. because they are resilient guys who take everything in stride and, on some level, kind of like the abuse. Theirs isn’t a struggle for human rights, justice, or equality—no no---they fight back to protect the things that really matter to them, like managing an ant colony, procuring a rare collectible action figure or keeping a date with a cute girl…While every character in Prison School is ‘fleshed out’ in some sense, only the male protagonists are fleshed out in the personality department. This whole show is a parody of a young man’s awkward and graceless journey through adolescence.Overall, I would highly recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys finely-crafted, filthy humor and has enough self-awareness not to take this anime too seriously. tyrannical and estrogenic “Underground Student Council”.

But one day, I saw a poster for this anime, Prison School, floating around the internet. I was under the impression that this was going to be another high school slice-of-life anime with a twist, like y'know, we all go to high school,...but its a prison. I had no idea this was an ecchi or what the story was going to be.I can't believe an entire plot point of the show is this girl determined to pee on this dude, seriously. I'm adverse to those kinds of kinks, so I was surprised to have found myself watching an ecchi going this far into the territory. I was on the fence about continuing the show because if there is pee there will be poo! And I don't wanna see that! And well...there is poo, but not like that. It actually comes in another hilarious interaction from our boys.The boys. Let's talk about the boys. The MC, he is aight. Glasses, I hate him, he sucks. Ants, he's aight. I kinda like him. Small face, he a FREAK, he nasty. The homie, he aight too. The principal? I watched this dubbed (which you should too, seriously, they do a wonderful job), and he will randomly emphasize words, like they are in bold, and idk its funny...RIGHT?The girls. Hmm. We got massive BDSM tiddies, we got principal's daughter, and we got virgin. And MC's waifu. Surprising how threatening they all were tbh. The story is so wild and yet somehow the stakes are so high??? Even if ecchi isn't your thing, this show really does have a good story and is really funny.BDSM waifu x Small face for life, match made in heaven.A friend of mine read the manga and gave me the deets about the rest of the story so far, I wish they would animate more of it :( but its a prison.

Watching this show is one of the most frustrating things as I loved the humour at some times and burst out laughing but the Prison School just couldn't retain its magic due to repetition and non-nonsensical antics. The initial episode had fully enticed me and I binged watched this show all in one day but throughout the show I was progressively getting more and more turned off by...it, not being able to have a taste of that initial hook. The show took a turn towards tickling your boner instead of telling good jokes and developing characters in a proper manner. The characters were enjoyable to begin with, albeit is perverted high school students, but nothing developed after everything was said and done. This experience of theirs lead to nothing and they will get nothing out of it, leaving an almost unsatisfying ending (Underground Council got what they deserved). They stayed perverted high school students with nothing remotely different about them and it hurts to see that be the end result. Many of the jokes introduced were hilarious but beaten to death with a hammer and no longer yielded ideal results. I want to recommend this show to others and have them enjoy the jokes I had enjoyed but due to the straight up porn that ruined the jokes for the most part and the dulling of those jokes I most likely won't. it, not being able to have a taste of that initial hook.

No matter what insults you hurl at me, I will say every single time:THIS. IS. PEAK.“On this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hades will not over come it.”- Matthew 16:18As is the case with any anime reviewer who would dare considers  themselves a connoisseur of the arts, although all others are but imitators, there must be some sort...of foundation when reviewing any anime. Oft times, it is tempting to resort to cliches, to standard conventions of reviewing that can be used generally for all types of anime. This type of foundation, while formidable against criticism most of the times by appealing to easily understandable guidelines, is nothing but banal. ‘Story: 7, Characters: 6, Art: 8,’ etc. You may have even seen that awfully reused review type on Steam with a list of check-boxes that are ticked off; as if any piece of medium can be condensed into such categories! But, when you approach an unconventional anime such as Prison School, an entirely different approach must be taken, out of respect for the artist’s integrity and a true appreciation of the work.When faced with the beauty and mystery of the Mona Lisa, would you give it a grade rating? A mere ‘A+?’No, of course you wouldn’t.So why treat Prison School any different?Forgetting about the ‘mark,’ we must appreciate this magnum opus for what it’s really worth.There exists a very odd breed of anime, one that you must be courageous to venture downwards because when you eventually put it on your MAL, you will be bullied. It threads beneath two valleys: the soft-core ecchi with innuendos and metaphors to suggest, and blatant pornography. In that rift, you will find Prison School. While not appropriate for watching out in public, you can’t exactly jack off to it.Prison School is simply unabashedly erotic, so much so that it’s ridiculously easy to get slightly queasy, especially for the layman. Water sports, BDSM, scat, bimbofication, foot fetish, bondage, CBT, voyeurism. If you can name it, you can probably find it in Prison School. But, at the same time, this is not porn. No, Prison School is not porn. And, no matter how close they get to unleashing it all, we, the audience, are left edging and keep blue-balled. So, if you can’t call Prison School an ecchi or a hentai, what would you call if?A goddamn masterpiece.All of the fetishes in this anime are so blatant, almost ridiculous in nature, that it feels like nothing but a celebration of sexuality. Yes, oft times they do feel satirised and maybe even ridiculed, but is that not the very nature of our sexuality? It’s ridiculous, crazy even, but at the same time it’s fun.Well, obviously it depends on who you’re asking because you would never see me doing scat, but you get the point.Prison School excels where other anime would fumble. It doesn’t try to hide any sexuality, it goes all out and says, ‘this is a fetish, this is also kind of weird, but that’s okay.’ There is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of in Prison School. You like what you like, you’re into what you’re into, and that is completely okay.And, I should also mention that Prison School is, quite frankly, one of the funniest anime out there. Many times I’ve found myself wincing and even crying ‘please stop’ at some of the scenes, but at the same time, it was ungodly hilarious. That being said, I can sort of understand the negative reception that Prison School has gotten. Im sure for many people that the sexual humour is a just a bit too much and I get that.

With headphones on.', 'I had heard about this anime from passing jokes and knew about its bad rep, but I wanted a comedy to watch and so I decided to watch it myself— I got more than I expected. It is so incredibly stupid and dumb, but executed in such an entertaining manner that no matter what bs was going on, I just needed to know what would happen next. I binged this because I couldn’t not find out what was next for the guys. The characters are very memorable and I really did like how well knit the story was. While it wasn’t the funniest thing I’ve...ever seen, it did make me laugh and not in the taking a deep breath type of “laugh.”It’s already embarrassing enough that I rated it so high and that this review is getting long, but for those wondering whether or not you should watch it: the anime is set in a school setting (wow! surprise!) and I’m not sure if the characters are supposed to be underage. If they are, then I retract everything positive I just said, but if not, keep in mind the nudity and sexual comments because it is a large portion of the show. At times, it even felt like a scene was happening just for the nudity. I also felt uncomfortable with their ages not being explicitly disclosed in the anime. I think this could’ve easily been avoided by setting the story in a more adult environment and if I could change anything about this anime it would 100% be that.Also something to keep in mind, various scenes in the show are very rapey and uncomfortable. THERE ARE NO RAPE OR SEX SCENES, but there are scenes in which people very clearly state they don’t want to do something and the person go against their wishes. I didn’t know that coming in so I feel I should disclose that. Just know everyone is a pervert.It’s stupid, it’s funny, but morally dubious. It earns an 7 because while it is the story is entertaining and the characters are good— the nudity uncertainty on their age, and rape-y moments make it not enjoyable. ever seen, it did make me laugh and not in the taking a deep breath type of “laugh.”It’s already embarrassing enough that I rated it so high and that this review is getting long, but for those wondering whether or not you should watch it: the anime is set in a school setting (wow! surprise!) and I’m not sure if the characters are supposed to be underage.

Hardcore, perversely hilarious and psychologically trying. The trials the five guys go through literally feel so relatable, it is almost as if you are in the same prison with them and fighting to survive, physically and internally. I have read and watched different mediums of fiction where women in positions of dominance is the main premise, yet this anime practically explodes full force with it. To say the least, it is a whirlwind of an anime that sends you on an emotional and creepily sensual roller-coaster ride. In that sense,...the prison is more than physical and repressed while on a lustful level each ot the characters-those in authority and those imprisoned-are each trapped.Mari Kurihara I admit is one of the few characters from the series I came to admire and relate to (Kiyoshi Fujino and Takehito Morokuzu second and third). In terms of her skepticism of the good will of others, being an animal lover, and believing people should always act with good intentions. We both like to stick to tradition, and reluctant to change. How she's also not one to ignore the faults in others, and tend to hold people to said faults I identified with.The blatant outright sexual situations, complex relationships, along with the heavy psychological and power play struggle make it a guilty pleasure to watch...and at the same time be disturbed by. It's a pulse-pounding anime that's madly contentious yet has an entertaining aura despite the unrestrained smutty context. Once you follow the five MCs, you are pulled into the story from beginning to end.While this certainly may not be to everyone's preference, this is worth watching as it addresses the conflict between raw human urges and desires versus the hypocritical and sexist cruelty that divides and draws people together...in the most licentious  and lethal of circumstances and settings. the prison is more than physical and repressed while on a lustful level each ot the characters-those in authority and those imprisoned-are each trapped.Mari Kurihara I admit is one of the few characters from the series I came to admire and relate to (Kiyoshi Fujino and Takehito Morokuzu second and third).

This is probably the most hilarious anime I've watched to date. Though the series relies on slapstick humour and absurdity beyond measure. The comedy makes it easy to look over those aspects. It's more of a great example of how to turn absurdity and folly into entertainment and by that, I certainly don't mean to imply that the jokes are childish or so. It's more about how the show exaggerates or undermines some concepts—like how the loss of blood or being injured and the ecchi aspect, alongside others, purely serves a farce purpose.The level of...nudity is fairly mild. Panty shots and oversized breasts–though only 1 character has them, she gets a decent amount of screentime. Other than that, the sexual jokes are fantastic. Top fucking kek. It's also interesting how some concepts such as integrity among friends is kept serious without any loss of comedy.Overall, Prison school is a great anime to lighten or cheer the mood. Though it's nothing intense or serious, yet it does not fail to keep you hooked for even a split second. nudity is fairly mild.

Most of what it does is for the sake of goofiness. The super sexualized shots have been criticized a bunch, but the way I saw it, they were part of said goofiness and added to the funny nonsense. It doesn't take itself too seriously, even though it could probably do fine without the jokes as well, as a serious story anime. The buildup of tension, empathy for the characters and all did it for me.If you like Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou type humor, you'll probably like this.

This is the first ecchi I've went out of my way to watch, and, although it did get repetitive, especially in the middle, overall it was at least two laughs an episode (most of those coming from Gakuto, who's visual comedy is far too good for the rest of the show) which I suppose is all you can really expect. The pacing was a bit off, as each episode seemingly dragged on far longer than it should've.

"", 'Prison school is about 5 boys trying to graduate from highschool in a school that was once a girls school. This is a pretty typical setting for an ecchi anime but the difference between Prison school and regular ecchi anime is that the story focuses on the aspect of being imprisoned and the followed urge to achieve freedom. Which is why this anime also includes complexity in its storytelling.Prison school is a well executed mixture between comedy, ecchi, romance and drama. Even though Prison school contains a lot of scenes filled with curiosity, it is able to convey a dramatical storytelling. Especially the relationships...in this anime should be pointed out because every character has different characteristics of their own which allow a realistic representation of the relationship between the 5 boys who are often faced with stressful situations and also allow the comedy in this anime to be varied.The animation in this anime is very good considering that it was animated 8 years ago. The manga that was beautifully drawn was adapted very well or maybe even perfectly.So in total, I believe that everyone who does not mind anime that include ( a lot ) of ecchi will not regret watching this. in this anime should be pointed out because every character has different characteristics of their own which allow a realistic representation of the relationship between the 5 boys who are often faced with stressful situations and also allow the comedy in this anime to be varied.The animation in this anime is very good considering that it was animated 8 years ago.

Already this means its ceiling in terms of what rating I can give it is lower than some great story with the intention of intriguing viewers rather than making jokes that are a bit hit or miss. Regardless I would say, for me, any piece whose main category is comedy as it seems to be here will be harder to get interested in because any collection of jokes, while...potentially entertaining in the moment, don't build up any captivating progression. To feel compelled to continue watching I need to feel a sense of quality coming into the next episodes. This is already largely dependent on the quality of the jokes of course, but also the general execution and plot. Even if you laugh whilst watching Friends, you won't continue watching if there is really no valuable story in any episode - the writers do have to come up with something funny & new happening constantly.To delve into Prison School more substantially in this regard - the humor is good, but definitely repetitive. There are a few really good ideas in each episode and the writer should be praised for this, but the episodes are 20+ minutes long after all. The rest is filled with ecchi, the same old beatings that the prisoners take, the characters' ridiculous styles of dialogue (e.g. the chairman's gimmick), ridiculous gag humor. Sometimes it works, sometimes you just feel like the joke's been run dry and the author should give us something good quickly. Regardless, of course, the comedy is above average, although gag humor is pretty cheap and common in anime, and it represents an overwhelming proportion of the comedic attempts in this show. I definitely did not laugh much the 100th time mommy vice-president beats Andre (and he enjoys it), I did laugh at the more inspired jokes (such as him calling her Mom, or the characters being what they are at the start - a figurine nerd, an edgy weirdo with an ant-farm and the fatty's facial design? Jesus Christ that was hilarious). That's kind of how comedy goes for me (and as I hope it goes to any somewhat experienced viewer). The really valuable stuff that you don't get everywhere is naturally pretty rare.And when you don't have that high quality comedy, you still need to be entertained somehow watching the show. So comedy shows still have some sort of story and Prison School is no different. The entertainment value is affected by the plot and execution of said plot, too, and particularly in moments that are not comedic, it's the plot, really, that entertains you and pushes you to keep watching. That being said, the plot in this is not the best. It's a sort of funny premise that builds some sort of anticipation (e.g. what will happen to the prisoners after ep 1), but in the end it didn't captivate me much. Being confined in the prison, everything felt so local, limited, irrelevant/non-impactful in the bigger picture, especially before we get closer to the characters. So although the premise with the school prison was kind of original, I wish the plot had remained inside the school, with potentially more stuff to do (or alternatively there could've been more going on inside the prison as opposed to continuous labor). There's 3-4 episodes of the first breakout plan to meet Chiyo outside the prison and buy the figurines, then 3-4 episodes for the DTO operation. (Then I stopped watching). The rest is probably for the end operation, trying to stay in the school or whatever and a nice conclusion. A very simple story if you ask me, and you can't really feel the stakes in such a non-serious show so viewers cannot *really* care if the prisoners get expelled or not, for example. Again, we've barely met the characters, and they are ridiculous characters very clearly designed this way for comedic purposes. So what makes you (the author) think that viewers will care whether the guy meets the girl? And when they do meet, the whole moment is rather vanilla (perverted jokes) until Chiyo discovers her uniform. The repetitive aspects of the plot (e.g. the beatings) also didn't help. Slower moments such as the planning to break out, or the prisoners bonding, could've probably been executed better too - were they really necessary instead of trying to make a better story we can actually care for and that actually presents some difficulty we can get interested in? It feels as though the show planned to have one important/surprising action every episode whilst everything else - that is largely unsurprising - exists as a build-up to that moment.A decent comedy show but in the end the somewhat repetitive take on gag humor, together with the brittle story lacking intricacy, made it a pretty average watching experience. I was often entertained in the moment but felt no curiosity as to how the next episode would pan out - a most common experience I have with comedy shows - hence finishing a grand total of 9 out of 12 episodes which isn't too bad. potentially entertaining in the moment, don't build up any captivating progression.

An absolute marvel of engineering.', 'I am not one for binge watching, I think in order to get the best experience out of anything you have to enjoy it at your own pace. And for me, that’s usually three to five episodes a day, maybe a handful of chapters. I understand that this doesn’t apply to everyone. In fact I’d say most people who frequently watch shows through streaming services would strongly disagree with me. However this was a series where I broke my own rule. I could not put down the show thanks to its combination of high brow humor, low brow humor, amazing character dynamics/relationships, superb animation, spectacular...visual gags and each episode having a cliffhanger ending even the sappiest of long running soap operas can only dream of having. So how can a show, so unapologetically raunchy, be my second favorite anime of all time?From the get go you’ll notice the amount of detail that went into the show’s visuals. And for that you have to thank J.C. Staff for bringing Akira Hiramoto’s extremely detailed and unique artstyle to life. And the visuals aren’t here just for the sake of being eye candy. The extravagant level of detail used on character’s expressions, reactions, and body composition enhances the joke and maximizes the impact of the punchline. Detailed characters aside, the show also has a knack for transitions between scenes. For example, if a character is about to be struck with a whip, the following shot will be someone slamming down a checker piece in sync with the character being hit. The manga also utilized this technique efficiently, though it became overbearing in one of the later arcs. But I digress, this is the anime I’m talking about. The point is, this show utilizes its visuals to heighten the impact of a joke more so than any other anime. From wicked camera shots, and over the top reactions, to even having an escape plan shown to us in the form of legos.But why is this show having legos to demonstrate an escape plan? Because this show is about a group of highschool boys who decide to attend a formerly all girls school who only recently opened their doors to the opposite sex. One night the boys decide to go out to be peeping toms and end up getting caught in the act by the Underground Student Council. It’s here that they’re sent to an underground prison where they come up with various schemes to escape and or to lessen their sentence. And that is the most stripped down plot synopsis I can give without spoiling too much, because this is an experience with an ever unfolding plot that is constantly progressing at a fast rate. And I say that as a good thing. Because though the show’s not going at breakneck speed, you’re never dealing with the same situation for long. And I think a solid rate of progression for a story is an often overlooked aspect of anime. And trust me this show has it all: epically sacrificing yourself for your bros, heartbreak, backstabbing, lust, philosophy. Not to mention that every character is distinct and hilarious in their own unique way (minus shingo possibly) and the trajectory each of the relationships characters have with one another is surprisingly nuanced and fun to watch. The characters we follow are the epitome of modern highschool kid archetypes that’ll make you shudder once you recognize an action or thought a character is doing, reminding you of your own past.I’ve heard many criticizing or even flat out not giving this anime/manga a chance due to its heavy use of fanservice, nudity, and over the top lewdness that teeters the line between being a straight up ecchi anime and just a raunchy comedy. But those people are only closing themselves off from a well written comedic story. Despite show’s erotic nature, I could imagine watching this with buddies or in a livestream/chat and have all sorts of fun. Rooting for the boy’s success and crying over their failures in a group, singing the OP and ED along together sounds like a great time in spirit of the show. And I think that a show, being as graphic as it is, that manages to make me encourage others to watch it in a group is a testament to how tastefully this show handles crude humor. Because I am not one to like watching anything in a group, let alone an anime I hold near and dear.So how can a show so unapologetically raunchy be my second favorite anime of all time? Much like my favorite anime of all time (Nichibros), it’s funny and never fails to make me laugh for the umpteenth time. Comedy is subjective, and so this will only be as funny as each individual perceives to be, but even beyond that this show has much more going for it like its distinct visual flair and cleverly written character dynamics. So go see the show that I managed to finish in a single sitting and a quarter. (I was tired and had to go to bed but finished it following my wake up). visual gags and each episode having a cliffhanger ending even the sappiest of long running soap operas can only dream of having.

Detailed characters aside, the show also has a knack for transitions between scenes. For example, if a character is about to be struck with a whip, the following shot will be someone slamming down a checker piece in sync with the character being hit. The manga also utilized this technique efficiently, though it became overbearing in one of the later arcs. But I digress, this is the anime I’m talking about. The point is, this show utilizes its visuals to heighten the impact of a joke more so than any other anime. From wicked camera shots, and over the top reactions, to even having an escape plan shown to us in the form of legos.But why is this show having legos to demonstrate an escape plan? Because this show is about a group of highschool boys who decide to attend a formerly all girls school who only recently opened their doors to the opposite sex. One night the boys decide to go out to be peeping toms and end up getting caught in the act by the Underground Student Council. It’s here that they’re sent to an underground prison where they come up with various schemes to escape and or to lessen their sentence. And that is the most stripped down plot synopsis I can give without spoiling too much, because this is an experience with an ever unfolding plot that is constantly progressing at a fast rate. And I say that as a good thing. Because though the show’s not going at breakneck speed, you’re never dealing with the same situation for long. And I think a solid rate of progression for a story is an often overlooked aspect of anime. And trust me this show has it all: epically sacrificing yourself for your bros, heartbreak, backstabbing, lust, philosophy. Not to mention that every character is distinct and hilarious in their own unique way (minus shingo possibly) and the trajectory each of the relationships characters have with one another is surprisingly nuanced and fun to watch. The characters we follow are the epitome of modern highschool kid archetypes that’ll make you shudder once you recognize an action or thought a character is doing, reminding you of your own past.I’ve heard many criticizing or even flat out not giving this anime/manga a chance due to its heavy use of fanservice, nudity, and over the top lewdness that teeters the line between being a straight up ecchi anime and just a raunchy comedy. But those people are only closing themselves off from a well written comedic story. Despite show’s erotic nature, I could imagine watching this with buddies or in a livestream/chat and have all sorts of fun. Rooting for the boy’s success and crying over their failures in a group, singing the OP and ED along together sounds like a great time in spirit of the show. And I think that a show, being as graphic as it is, that manages to make me encourage others to watch it in a group is a testament to how tastefully this show handles crude humor. Because I am not one to like watching anything in a group, let alone an anime I hold near and dear.So how can a show so unapologetically raunchy be my second favorite anime of all time? Much like my favorite anime of all time (Nichibros), it’s funny and never fails to make me laugh for the umpteenth time. Comedy is subjective, and so this will only be as funny as each individual perceives to be, but even beyond that this show has much more going for it like its distinct visual flair and cleverly written character dynamics. So go see the show that I managed to finish in a single sitting and a quarter. (I was tired and had to go to bed but finished it following my wake up).', ""This is probably the most outlandish ecchi anime I have yet to watch. From how the characters are all relatable to some extent, to the over the top fan service. This quick series that you could finish in a day will really bring a great laugh all around. unfortunatly these boys land themselves in one of the strictest girls’ academies in Tokyo. With the law's that are in place with the school even the most minor of offensive can wind you up behind bars within the schools ground. As the boys realize that they will soon have to break out in order to escape from...punishment and humiliation their crew will face a testament that will test the bonds of their friendship and forge what could be called a perverted brotherhood.. punishment and humiliation their crew will face a testament that will test the bonds of their friendship and forge what could be called a perverted brotherhood.."", ""Prison School starts off with the most debauched cast of five guys just acting creepy and straight up criminally in a sexual harassment manner. Episode one was straight up nasty seemingly catering towards kinks. Things readily available are female domination, humiliation fetishism, masochism, spit, pee etc. The cast seemed to have no redeeming qualities and all of the hardships that came their way seemed justified. I was personally about to drop the series at this point.But I went on to watch Episode 2 in order to give it a chance. The same theme as the previous paragraph continued but halfway through Episode 2 there...was finally redeeming qualities shown and the main character is finally given a purpose other than being creepy. From here on out, Prison School developed into a good comedy with hints of strategy here and there throughout all of the depraved kinks.As the anime progresses the main characters all go through character development of different degrees. They attain goals, personality and you finally get to experience a (partially) unified group. The antagonist, the Underground Student Council, also work throughout the anime and are seemingly competent with quirks making the clash of the two groups interesting.One thing I'd like to emphasize is that in the anime, a side character has this quirk of ending sentences by taking a pause and saying the final word deafeningly as the camera zooms in on the face. Though it seemingly decreases in intensity and frequency later on I'd like to say: It's not funny. Loud doesn't equal funny and is barely low hanging fruit when it comes to comedy, it's the fruit rotten on the ground nobody wants.In conclusion, towards the end of the anime I can personally say that I enjoyed it thoroughly, everything except for the first episode. The anime is fit for people that want a setting where the main cast is forced to work together or lose it all. It also caters heavily into the comedy aspect though romance comes in sparse amounts. Ecchi parts of the anime cater towards an audience that likes female domination, masochism and humiliation. was finally redeeming qualities shown and the main character is finally given a purpose other than being creepy.

Viewer may shouldn\'t watch this serial together with family, remind that \'fanservice\' ingredients somehow appear (even there are some scene which according to me, maybe \'fanservice\' are not necessary).Long review, here ya go.Prison School have an unique than other anime which have same genre (ecchi). The story plot in this serial is kinda interesting, if you ever had watch film that tells about the strategy about how to escape from the prison, so this anime is somehow kinda similar story telling about (except the fanservice).What makes serial Prison School is different than other anime is about story ingredients, and...character developments is well-build-ed, so the viewer can still enjoy the story while \'fanservice\' may appear in some condition and know the story how about each male character (which they being as main story also) progress regarding episodes that tells about. Five male characters have their roles in each story or conflict, may I say this anime which contain 12 episodes instead tells about how they (5 male characters) find out strategy about to escape, in fact they also experiencing each conflict.Each male character have their conflicts and solution, for example Kiyoshi that teamed with Gakuto about find out way to temporary escape just for business which makes Shingo feel jealous. Then another conflict/problem also following Shingo that gang up with deputy head of the student council, and much more. Every conflict-inside-conlict makes the story interesting. Not to forget about this serial is \'ecchi\' labeled, so each episode have \'fanservice\' that may appear. You guys may can guess, which character that contribute \'a lot\' about fanservice-ing this story. Lmao.This serial have total 12 episode, quite compressed storytelling, interesting story and viewer may did not expect and guess about ""ah they may escape somehow"". Of course the story plot tell about how they do strategy to find a way, so they determine about their fates. Escape from the prison literally, or even accept worse punishments.About ""fanservice"", there are no commentary even more. But quite unfortunate, this serial just only 12 episodes, so there are no information even more about student council member\'s fate. Maybe there are information further in manga version. Fanservice in this serial is quite acceptable, but maybe there are some situation or scene which regarding my experience, fanservice maybe little bit too intense. To be honest, they shouldn\'t needed to detailed about the fanservices. Even each member in student council may quite enough for. But that just an personal opinion, Prison School still enjoy-able to watch, even for who just wanted to know the story. character developments is well-build-ed, so the viewer can still enjoy the story while \'fanservice\' may appear in some condition and know the story how about each male character (which they being as main story also) progress regarding episodes that tells about.

But that just an personal opinion, Prison School still enjoy-able to watch, even for who just wanted to know the story.', ""Normally, if you are caught peeping at school, your punishment would be suspension. At Hachimitsu Academy, you go straight to the school's prison, hence the name of this anime Prison School. When I first heard the name, I found the concept to be very intriguing, and I patiently waited until adulthood to give this anime a try. Prison School's story was indeed, interesting.Hachimitsu Academy was normally a girls-only school, and then the rules changed allowing boys to enroll. Only five boys made it in, and they are the main characters. Their names are Kiyoshi, Takehito, Shingo, Joji, and Reiji. As you can easily guess coming...from the introduction paragraph, they tried to peep on the girls and they were easily caught by the Underground Student Council (USC), an elite trio of girls that practically govern the school. For their crimes, the five boys must spend a month in the school's prison. If one of them dares to break out, it will count against all five of them.The first breakout will result in a one month extension of prison time.The second will add three months.The third will lead to expulsion.The story is divided equally into three parts, four episodes each. The first part is all about Kiyoshi trying to keep his promise to take a girl named Chiyo out on a date to watch sumo wrestling. The second is centered around the USC sabotaging the boys into getting caught for breaking out and getting them expelled. The third and final part focuses on the boys' mission to prove their innocence. It's rare to see an anime's story be well organized like this, and I find that to be very impressive.When it comes to the characters, I'm not exactly on board with most of the masochistic personalities the boys, except for Kiyoshi, have. They do serve a purpose for the story, but I personally feel like they were forced just for the sake of the genre. In my opinion, one can put stuff to satisfy the genre while still making it feel like a natural part of the show. Now, the members of the USC are very well written characters. The president, Mari may be one of the best anime antagonists I've ever seen. I don't blame her for her hatred of men. She always catches her father, the Chairman of Hachimitsu Academy, looking up images of rear ends on his computer. The vice president, Meiko is well known for having two sides to her personality. When supervising the boys, she is the perfect definition of a femme fatale, always being completely merciless. However, when interacting with Mari, Meiko feels under pressure to please the president. That is how much she strongly pledges her loyalty to her. Finally, the secretary, Hana. When introduced, she comes off as charming and cute, but deep inside, she's just as cold and vicious to the boys, just like Mari and Meiko. Hana is especially aggressive towards Kiyoshi who ended up getting into several mishaps with her, though I will never understand the first one. While Kiyoshi climbed a tree to help a baby crow back into its nest, Hana goes number one underneath the tree... even though there is a bathroom just yards away from the prison, and the campus isn't that visually huge. Like, why did she elected to do her business underneath a tree, let alone close to the main school building, instead of going to the bathroom? The author clearly put this just to create the hate relationship.The animation is great. J.C. Staff is another studio I've come to look up to, the more of their work I watched. The one most memorable thing about Prison School is that most of the time when any of the boys get hit, blood comes out of them, and since they're masochists, they are going to get hit a lot. I know it's probably weird I'm praising bloodshed, but the members of the USC really do use so much force when they smack the boys, so it feels right to see the boys bleed.The opening and ending songs are pretty decent. I can get by with the rock n' roll theme they were going for. I really like the opening song's title being Prison of Love. Yeah, that just solidifies the masochistic nature of the boys. In fact, it's their voice actors that sing the anime's music, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.Prison School has a great story, excellent cast of antagonists, and was well animated. With so many intense moments, it was very engaging as I watched it. It's held back by the forced masochism and situations the characters get into that could've been easily avoided. from the introduction paragraph, they tried to peep on the girls and they were easily caught by the Underground Student Council (USC), an elite trio of girls that practically govern the school.

I rated this a 6/10; and if not that a 5.What I liked:The different Archetypes of the main characters-I like how different all of the main characters are and how they all have unique silhouettes emphasizing good character design.The art style worked well with the anime and was unique. It worked really well for the show\'s poster and marketing.The premise and plot of 4 boys going to an all girl school and immediately being put in jail for their...gross behavior (suffered actual consequences)my favorite character: Mari (The president) and Hana-i loved Hana\'s character and how she was introducedKinda liked the Comedy aspectsKiyoshi\'s ""Save the cat"" moment was a good establishment of his characterThe principle being a perv running gag was funnyStorytellingDislikes:I don\'t like how we\'re just thrown into the middle of the story and they go to jail so fast.- We never fully got introduced to the 4 main characters individually and outside of school; we just know they\'re all friends who wanted to transfer to an all girl school to be surrounded by women. That\'s it.-This doesn\'t work because the anime makes it seem like they want us to feel bad that the four of them are in jail and going through such cruel punishment without establishing an emotional connection to them.-Needed at least 1 episode introducing them all and watching them be friends before jail-They were thrown into jail way too quick and we never got to see how they acted in any environment besides the school/prison. I was hoping to see their rooms or like at least have one hangout to establish how close they were before all of thisMost of the girls were sexualized and none of the guys were. (Hence why I say I probably am not the target for this show)-There was a ton of panty shots, ton of boob shots, ton of girls in suggestive positions all the time when giving their dialogue but not really any of that for the dudes with some exceptions. my rule is sexualizing characters is fine but if you do it to the girls you gotta do it to the guys too. Never really saw the boys sexualized unless it was like gay jokes.Example: Kyoshi and Takahito dropping the soap in one of the episodes-Most of the humor felt like shock value-Vice president characterization-The prison guard women are made to feel really smart and cunning at running a prison but the vice president ""punishes"" them in ways they like and when she learns that they like a certain punishment she berades them and then keeps doing it. This confused me.-Also acted stupid/made terrible judgement calls a lot which I don\'t think fits with her character- ex: her burning herself with frying grease and then one of the guys had to tell her to put an apron on.Overall I thought it was fine and I don\'t really regret watching it. If you\'re really bored and have watched a lot of anime and looking for something different then I guess I would recommend this. gross behavior (suffered actual consequences)my favorite character: Mari (The president) and Hana-i loved Hana\'s character and how she was introducedKinda liked the Comedy aspectsKiyoshi\'s ""Save the cat"" moment was a good establishment of his characterThe principle being a perv running gag was funnyStorytellingDislikes:I don\'t like how we\'re just thrown into the middle of the story and they go to jail so fast.- We never fully got introduced to the 4 main characters individually and outside of school; we just know they\'re all friends who wanted to transfer to an all girl school to be surrounded by women.

Leaving it up to your imagination, you’d think they did indecent acts. Yes, that’s right, which brings us to the setting of the anime - Prison School.Prison School introduces its main cast - the 5 boys: The ‘Normal’ one, The Geek, The Ant-lover, The Masochist, and The Delinquent. Despite their vastly different personalities, they all share one thing in common - they’re all extremely desperate and perverted to the point they'd land themselves in a prison within the school.There’s almost always something to laugh about in every episode, mostly due to...the boys' dumb and outrageous actions. It reaches a point where it becomes stupid and hilarious. What was surprising was that there's actually conflict in the anime, since I really thought it would all be 'desperate, silly boys getting punished'.The style and animation are really good, staying true to the manga's art style, which I appreciate a lot when it comes to anime adaptations. The pacing is well-managed, making it easy to follow, and it doesn't drag on, which is great if you enjoy fast-paced, idiotic, and humorous action.I’m not a fan of Ecchi. In fact, I never thought I'd watch this series but I decided to give it a shot. No regrets!

Bonus points if you're a fan of the Three Kingdoms, as there are a few mentions of it throughout the anime!"", ""You can see that I gave the story, the art, and sound 5, 5 and 4 however what made me give the 10 out of 10 score is the characters and hypeif you are the type who likes well written stories and good art then sorry prison school would be a waste of time fo youNow I dislike ecchi but the sheer honesty of characters, male ones to be exact hooks me up, Prison school is the second anime in history to make a sexually likeable cast since they are nuts and go through impossible tasks to achieve their goals, but I liked mainly Gakuto...for his plans, Gakuto single handedly no joke carries the whole shows. while Gakuto is an average character in terms strenght and intelligence, his cunning plans and ad libing by his sheer will makes him likeable.The anime is full of tropes and cliche moments especially when it comes to the chairman that tries to act cool but he can't hide his goofy self, Yet somehow the fast pacing makes it a blast to watch for his plans, Gakuto single handedly no joke carries the whole shows. while Gakuto is an average character in terms strenght and intelligence, his cunning plans and ad libing by his sheer will makes him likeable.The anime is full of tropes and cliche moments especially when it comes to the chairman that tries to act cool but he can't hide his goofy self, Yet somehow the fast pacing makes it a blast to watch"", ""It's hilarious! Idiotic, but definitely funny.I can't say I recommend it, nor do I not recommend it, but if you're willing to watch something silly, you can give it a try.The transition in art style also complements the humorous moments. However, some of the male and female characters come across as rather silly, and I couldn't find anything particularly interesting about them.That being said, I found myself laughing during every episode, so I can confidently say that I enjoyed it. My overall rating is 8/10 because there were moments when I laughed so hard that I couldn't justify giving it anything less than an 8,...considering the fun and emotions I experienced.Edit: if you enjoyed anime, you should read the manga. considering the fun and emotions I experienced.Edit: if you enjoyed anime, you should read the manga."", ""I believe this anime manages to balance out having nudity and using comedy to go with it, so it seems natural most of the time. This is an anime that I believe can pull off that kind of theme correctly without completely ruining it with it. I found the actual story to be exciting with how they are trying to escape and survive and I thought the characters were very enjoyable to watch. I thought it had a satisfying ending that closed it off nicely without leaving questions to be asked (OVA). All the characters ended up being explored into a deep enough depth to...which you feel like it.

As it was my first ecchi anime I have ever seen, I have mixed feelings about it. A part of me loves it to the core and to this day i think about some moments and I find them funny, but the other part was really weirded out so bad I wanted to stop watching anime whatsoever. But as I said, mixed feelings since i saw it a long time ago...and now my taste in anime is different.Overall, the anime was actually pretty funny and the plot was okayish so if anyone wants to watch it, I think it might deserve a shot. and now my taste in anime is different.Overall, the anime was actually pretty funny and the plot was okayish so if anyone wants to watch it, I think it might deserve a shot.', 'No, this show isn\'t funny and I\'m sick of hearing that it is. The comedy was written by toddlers for toddlers. I mean, come on, one of the funny jokes is that a guy shits himself and that\'s it. That\'s the joke. The show is basically just ""We said it was supposed to be funny so you have to laugh"". The characters are all unlikeable, the setting is interesting but executed poorly and all in all, the end feels completely unsatisfying. I seriously doubt that you will laugh if you watch this show, except for maybe out of pity. The only reason I bumped the...score is because the voice acting is solid and the art style is also quite decent. Aside from that, I cannot recommend this to anyone that has even a shred of humour, because you will be just as bored as I was. If you want a show like this that is executed properly and is actually funny, watch Grand Blue. Its a better use of your time. score is because the voice acting is solid and the art style is also quite decent.
