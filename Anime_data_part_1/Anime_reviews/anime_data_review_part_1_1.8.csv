Rank,Review
198,"['From the perspective of a professional jazz musician,Jazz has been a part of my life for the better part of 8 years now and no piece of media, art or animation has ever captured the passion nor love that I have for jazz more than this movie. I watched it on the plane ride to Japan …. AND the plane ride back. This was because on the way there I didn\'t have an adapter for my nicer headphones so I had to use the provided one. Thus, to me, nothing was more logical than watching the movie properly again on the way back. It\'s that...good.This isn\'t a review from someone who watches anime often. I\'m sure there are multiple plot holes, also after reading the manga, this is comparatively rushed, the use of CGI in some of the scenes felt off BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERS.The best part of this movie is thankfully the most important part, the music. One thing of note is that the songs and the type of Jazz that Dai and his trio play is not “pure” or conventional Jazz, it’s unbelievably energetic and passionate and is in a subset of its own in this oversaturated genre. I recently talked to a well established composer about the film and even he said it\'s unlike anything he\'s ever heard. Hiromi, the composer for this movie, is someone who I have admired for a long time, and I can’t believe I’m saying this but SHE IS A BETTER COMPOSER THAN SHE IS A PERFORMER … If you understand the magnitude of that statement then I salute you. Our main character Dai is technically a ""newbie"" to Jazz having started his passion for Saxophone quite late compared to others. Yet it is his passion and personality that allows him to perfectly capture the ethos of Jazz and make him the most ""developed"" character musically. The movie constantly uses him as a anchor for the other two band members to latch onto and grow from. Thus slowly but surely, their sound changes, their feelings and expressions change and the music eventually becomes one big juicy amalgamation of bliss.The cast of musicians in this film is also brilliant beyond belief. Obviously, Hiromi is on piano and you can hear that in the sheer energy of the piano as with the absence of a bassist, she has to do the role of two musicians not one. The saxophone is done by Tomoaki Baba, who is mostly unknown even among musician circles, heck I didn\'t even know who he is and that is exactly what makes his sound mind blowing. His sound represents the potential of Jazz, and with Hiromi providing the canvas for his solos, hoooooboy was he absolutely ON FIRE. The drummer, Shun Ishiwaka has to mimic someone who was never exposed to Jazz, however has been completely devoured by it as they can\'t help but want to play despite their overwhelming lack of experience. It\'s very endearing to see the drums slowly improving in quality as the movie progresses until the final performance in which things get REAL. Thus the three characters represents musicians at different stages in their journey, with the Pianist Yukinori growing up with music since a young age, Dai at the peak of his determination to succeed and the Drummer Shunji obsessing over his new passion.When there is no CGI (Thankfully there is not a lot or it\'s done well in some part), the animation goes unbelievably hard. It\'s a chaotic, ebbing and flowing, never ending cluster of flashing colour. At some point the saxophone doesn\'t even look like a saxophone anymore and the music can literally be seen. I wish, and I mean I REALLY wish I saw this on a better screen because god is the animation good during the performances. The way they portray the audiences reactions to the music is exactly the kind of facial expressions I would\'ve liked to have made if I wasn\'t sitting in economy class next to 5 people.Anyways I could talk about this for days but I\'ll leave it here as YOU SHOULD WATCH IT IF YOU HAVEN\'T. The movie will release internationally at some point hopefully and I\'ll probably have to watch it... again. You probably won\'t enjoy it nearly as much as I did, but I really do hope you give it a try as I wish for more people to exposed to proper Jazz. By that I mean music that embodies the fundamentals of Jazz philosophy and thinking, not some cookie cutter standard or Bossa Nova piece. Hope this review helps ;). good.This isn\'t a review from someone who watches anime often.

Many keep studying at Uni even when it's dull and boring because people assure you that 'you'll have a good future'.

Because of the fact that it is set after high-school, its always frightening to think that one mistake could end their careers with nothing else as a back-up - a harsh reality of being a musician. His bravery and willpower to keep moving forward is what made him incredibly inspirational, making every moment of Blue Giant so special.Their stories make you feel so attached like a fanboy - always reassuring to see the character's success and the band striving towards their dreams despite it being so gruelingly hard. This feeling and the dazzling passionate jazz combines to make an thrilling yet elegant performance that makes you be on the edge of your seat!Animation for the concerts were on par with demon slayer, ignoring the CGI. Never before was there a performance that makes you immersed within the blazing sparks of heated jazz along with the eloquent sakuga blooming the instruments to life. It truly was a magical experience.Five fantastic music gigs for ten dollars. 100% worth watching. capital of Japan.

The players here had a uniquely difficult job, they didn’t just have to play well, they had to act with their instruments. Their performances wonderfully capture the emotions of the characters, and their level of experience. The drummer did a particularly good job, replicating the play of a developing amateur.

Its visuals are an uneven mixture of good 2D animation, awkward CG, and sublime sakuga. Occasionally, its sound design falters.

There’s one plot point in particular that’s left field and disrupts the narrative.Its flaws are numerous, and obvious, but don’t hold back its infectious energy. Love of jazz drips from every second of Blue Giant, the feelings of its creators conveyed in every image and frantic sequence of cuts.Blue Giant is rough and uneven, its parts are dissonant, its animation rough, its narrative inconsistent. It rushes, gets ahead of itself, stops for a moment, and those dissonant parts suddenly collide in an explosion of emotion.Much like jazz, its flaws create interesting emotional intersections. That plot point I didn’t like pays off soon after. The CG animation just starts to work out of nowhere.Out of dissonance and imperfection emerges emotion. That's the soul of jazz, and of Blue Giant.

Only read first two and last two paragraphs if you don\'t want any spoilers.A surprise find... on a plane flight? As a clarinetist who has dabbled in jazz, I have to say that this movie is an ABSOLUTE TREAT. This is a sort of typical (insert hobby) anime interlaced with drama, yet the music aspect of this movie shines so brightly that it is almost okay to ignore some of the shortcomings in its other aspects. I think words from the movie itself best describe how watching it felt - it was...hot and intense.The soundtrack was great, and the performances were of the edge-of-the-seat variety. Naturally, the animation has to complement this. Yes, there is CGI used in animating the characters\' movements in performance, but the other parts of the animation more than make up for it. The dazzling rush of colors and camera movement in the performances really helps sell the idea that the characters are completely immersed in their own world. The animation in the performances really feels as creative as the music itself.Now that the lip service is out of the way, let\'s talk about the characters and the story.Miyamoto Dai is nothing short of a genius. Of course, the saxophonist behind him is a professional, but even so, the way Dai is constructed makes him a genius. That level of technical prowess, velvety tone, and musical creativity is not something someone can normally attain in 3 years. It shows not only extreme dedication but also huge innate talent.The implications of this on the story is that Dai plows through without much difficulty, and is left as a rather one-dimensional character. It somewhat undermines the ""underdog rises up"" story since Dai shines so brightly from the start that he is destined to succeed. However, had the story tried to give Dai some artificial roadblocks, it would have only ruined the pacing. The current character of Dai is probably for the best, yet it inevitably comes with some flaws. Perhaps it\'s an unfair criticism.The reaction of Yukinori after hearing Dai playing for the first time was almost identical to my own. Yukinori\'s facial expressions accurately capture the simultaneous admiration, jealousy, and despair when hearing someone with that much more talent. It nicely foreshadows and sets up Yukinori\'s own story arc.Yukinori\'s story represents the cliche ""you\'ve gone astray"" character. While it was somewhat cheesy, it does a good job in illuminating complacency in music. Many music anime push the idea that playing without passion equals playing without any musicality whatsoever, which is simply not true. Perhaps it is true for players who haven\'t learned to express themselves, but definitely not for experienced players. A favorite quote of mine from my clarinet teacher is that ""you need the \'what\' and the \'how\'"". In music, ideas (the \'what\') are the guide for how to shape the music, as in dynamics, articulation, etc. (the \'how\'). Yukinori\'s playing has always sounded good, but he is complacent with being ""good"", and without inspiration, it will just be ""good,"" and not fresh and interesting. But at the end of all his development, we get a banger of a solo as a well-deserved reward.Shunji\'s growth gives a more realistic look at the underdog story. Throughout the performances, the drummer slowly plays better and better, but you can still clearly hear the drummer holding back, often playing more heavy-handed like a beginner, which was a nice attention to detail. Shunji\'s character represents someone who isn\'t so serious about making it big, but who is serious about music as a hobby, which is another great perspective.But in the end, pretty much everything I said doesn\'t matter. After all, this is an anime about rooting for our trio\'s success, seeing them climb up the ladder, and being absolutely sucked in by their intense passion. I only wish that they explored more sides of jazz, but maybe that would\'ve been too hard to do while keeping a coherent narrative and theme.So my recommendation is to just go in, don\'t think about it too much, and enjoy the ride. Hopefully you will also find yourself on the other side, on the edge of your seat, and jaws wide open. hot and intense.The soundtrack was great, and the performances were of the edge-of-the-seat variety.

To me, it was an exceptional movie with passion at its core and flair in its execution. And for a movie in the music genre, with how straightforward themes in said genre usually ends up being, the extremely grounded manner in its telling impressed me. This movie was clearly made with musicians in mind, and for everyone to enjoy.Anyone who’s performed jazz, or just music, in any capacity will be able to appreciate the amount of detail that went into the scenes, and I’m...not just talking about the soundtrack. The characters in Blue Giant reflect a personality or feeling you’ve likely felt before. The experienced and jaded. The talented and confident. The amateur and fiery. They’re simple yet effective characters, and the way they interact makes them really feel like a band of real people. Not so close that they’re corny, and not so ragtag to seem unnatural or idealistic. And despite being in the same band, each of them clearly go through their own individual journeys. The script is solid, and the characters develop thoroughly.And the music in a jazz movie, as advertised, is amazing. Despite the story being thorough, it still really feels like 90% music and 10% movie. Personally, as someone who’s played a bit of jazz, I have a great amount of respect for jazz musicians, both live or recorded, real or animated. Improvisation is such a difficult yet expressive style of music, it’s hard not to admire the amount of work it takes to reach a presentable form. And to be honest, the soundtrack is not something I see myself downloading and listening to again. What makes this movie special is how well it recreates the experience of a jazz/improv performance, which is hard to reproduce by nature. Improv reflects how the performer feels in the moment, and the timing and circumstances the band in the movie performs under enhances the experience and makes it feel truly one of a kind.The visuals that accompany the music are great as well. The shot composition is very dynamic yet almost dizzying at times. The use of CG in the filler scenes, I’ll admit, can be distracting, and I’m not usually someone who’s bothered by this stuff. And if I were to nitpick a bit more, they also definitely overused “black-line shading” in the 2D animation. But otherwise, it doesn’t take away from the experience, and the 2D + CG in the key scenes are well done and incredibly immersive.Blue Giant is a movie I’d lightly recommend to the average person but strongly recommend to the true jazzphile. I’d definitely catch it in a theater if possible, or at least somewhere with a good sound system, hopefully GKIDS brings it back someday. You’ve probably already decided whether or not this is your type of movie or not based on the trailer, but if not, hopefully my stamp of approval can *swing* your opinion. not just talking about the soundtrack.

This is my first ever writing a review and maybe it was the last time, because spending time on presious thing like this one maybe only happend once a lifetime. Blue Giant maybe will be a bigger Giant in the future with this kind of masterpiece, first time watching this movie will easily be my best memories ever in...my life. my life.', ""This is a stunning anime that will make you fall in love with Jazz! The performances are jaw dropping and the characters will pull you in with their emotions. This movie positively radiates passion for Jazz and music, and it tugs on the heart-strings too. Unfortunately, there is heavy use of CGI for animating crowds and performances, however I don't think it gets in the way of conveying the message and the power of the music, and there is plenty of amazing Sakuga throughout the performances that make the music feel electric. Please, do yourself a favor, get your best headphones or audio set up...available, and get jazzed! available, and get jazzed!"", 'The very first notes of ""Blue Giant"" just clicked with me in terms of melody. This anime masterfully weaves a story, music, and emotions like a virtuoso improviser to create a unique symphony that no jazz lover can ignore.The protagonist, Dai Miyamoto, is not just your normal teenager who is into music. He\'s fanatic about it, driven by a passion for the saxophone and jazz. His path to the top is hard, but he never gives up, inspired by rhythms and melodies that ring in his soul.This anime doesn\'t only tell the story; it submerges you into the world of jazz—a place where every note...matters, each musician a creator. Jazz here isn\'t only a background; it is a living character, playing with the heroes and uncovering their inner selves.The soundtrack is stunning, dragging you not only into the plot but into a whole musical universe created by the genius of Japanese pianist Hiromi Uehara. In 2011, she became a Grammy Award winner, skillfully interweaving her melodies with Tomoaki Baba on the saxophone and Shun Ishiwaka on the drums. Together, they represent music that accompanies the film, not only in ordinary terms, but more like enriching it with such a perfectly accompanying symphony of every instrument, telling a story on its own, creating an atmosphere that lingers far beyond the end credits.The characters are much more than animations; they are real people with dreams, fears, and emotions.

I want to make a Perfect Blue joke so bad but I\'ll hold myself back for now.Blue Giant pretty much presents an earnest, yet enthralling journey through the world of jazz. It\'s a straightforward and emotional tale of ambition, friendship, and musical mastery. The film; which reminds me heavily of Whiplash, orchestrates a seemingly uncomplicated narrative canvas painted with...the hues of three distinct characters.At the forefront is Dai, an intense and rough stoic individual adorned with talent and determination. A high schooler driven by an unyielding passion for jazz and a desire to become the greatest saxophonist in the world. He epitomises an innocence that harmonizes beautifully with an unwavering love for his craft, steadfastly resilient against any obstacle encountered along the path to realizing his dreams. He is the flawed but earnest catalyst for this film\'s narrative momentum.Contrasting Dai\'s resolve is Yukinori, a seasoned participant in the jazz domain, whose journey started at the age of 4. His tenure in the jazz scene has been an exhaustive pursuit of perfection, sculpted by years of dedication and a relentless climb to the zenith of musical prowess. Yukinori\'s starkly different worldview serves as a compelling foil to Dai\'s innocence. He\'s also a cynical composer. In contrast to his love for solo plays, being a music composer has made him rely heavily on the logistics and formulaic side of things, eventually leading him to be humbled by an expert calling his own play uninspired compared to his two other supposed less skillful band mates. On that topic, it\'s the interplay with the third protagonist that embellishes his character arc:Enter Shunji, a below average college scholar inspired by Dai\'s infectious passion for jazz, steering him away from a prior fading desire for soccer. A nightly encounter brings Shunji into the duo\'s sphere, filling the void as a drummer, albeit with expected shortcomings - as he is the ""least good"" musician there. While Yukinori is harsh but fair towards Shunji, informing him of how many mistakes he\'s made after each play, it\'s his own dedication to improving - that eventually gets the reaffirmation he\'s always wanted. The old tofu guy that shows up across the film is such a kind soul. After this reaffirmation of his improvement, he actually strives to be on equal levels as the other two rather than just take it for granted, which also leads to Yukinori changing his perception of him.The film does a great job at creating this narrative axis where Shunji\'s absence of innate talent is counterbalanced by a dedication to tireless effort, which I really loved cause once again similarities to Whiplash.Shunji\'s metamorphosis from a disillusioned college student to an amateur drummer driven by hard work offers a compelling dichotomy between musical philosophies as well. The clash between Yukinori\'s ambition-driven approach and Dai & Shunji\'s joyous camaraderie begs the question: What defines a superior musician in the emotionally charged realm of jazz? In the intricate interplay between Dai\'s resolute dedication, Yukinori\'s introspective change towards musical expression, and Shunji\'s transformative journey from a novice to a ""good"" drummer, elegantly explores the nuances of aspiration, camaraderie, and the multifaceted landscapes of jazz.The characters are so good I almost forgot to talk about the OST. I have been put in a trance dude. The heart and soul of Blue Giant rest in its music, reminiscent of the dying echoes of jazz\'s golden era. Hiromi Uehara\'s compositions elevate the film, encapsulating the essence of \'60s jazz legends like Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane. The concert scenes got me moving the exact way the audience members did through pulsating rhythms and ecstatic harmonies that are just ARHHHHHHHHHH.On the production side of things however: the animation techniques employed, while mostly expressive and vibrant - I can see people being mixed on. The integration of rotoscoping CG amid 2D animation creates a kind of unsettling dissonance during performances, which I acknowledge can be detracting momentarily from an otherwise visually compelling narrative. I was mostly fine with it though as there were too many creative sequences for me to be even a little bitter toward the overall performances.Also, the film\'s final act had me in a chokehold. The accident scene was so unexpected ESPECIALLY after we had that scene with Akiko crying tears of joy. Basically lowering your guard down thinking it was a home run from there on out - only to rip your comfort to shreds but also culminating in a more heartfelt and satisfying resolution. This film was a treat and I have been thinking about it for the entire morning. It\'s just a really cool & earnest ode to jazz, steering clear of conventional melodrama and unnecessary diversions while rewarding you with a cinematic musical extravaganza through 3 surprisingly loveable and nuanced characters that all receive a fulfilling character arc.To conclude, Blue Giant embodies the soul of musical determination, harmonizing the rawness of aspiration with the practicalities of musical education. While grappling with visual and storytelling nuances, its emotive depth and musical passion shine through, making it an inspirational jam to the human spirit\'s unyielding pursuit of artistic excellence. the hues of three distinct characters.At the forefront is Dai, an intense and rough stoic individual adorned with talent and determination. A high schooler driven by an unyielding passion for jazz and a desire to become the greatest saxophonist in the world. He epitomises an innocence that harmonizes beautifully with an unwavering love for his craft, steadfastly resilient against any obstacle encountered along the path to realizing his dreams. He is the flawed but earnest catalyst for this film\'s narrative momentum.Contrasting Dai\'s resolve is Yukinori, a seasoned participant in the jazz domain, whose journey started at the age of 4. His tenure in the jazz scene has been an exhaustive pursuit of perfection, sculpted by years of dedication and a relentless climb to the zenith of musical prowess. Yukinori\'s starkly different worldview serves as a compelling foil to Dai\'s innocence. He\'s also a cynical composer. In contrast to his love for solo plays, being a music composer has made him rely heavily on the logistics and formulaic side of things, eventually leading him to be humbled by an expert calling his own play uninspired compared to his two other supposed less skillful band mates. On that topic, it\'s the interplay with the third protagonist that embellishes his character arc:Enter Shunji, a below average college scholar inspired by Dai\'s infectious passion for jazz, steering him away from a prior fading desire for soccer. A nightly encounter brings Shunji into the duo\'s sphere, filling the void as a drummer, albeit with expected shortcomings - as he is the ""least good"" musician there. While Yukinori is harsh but fair towards Shunji, informing him of how many mistakes he\'s made after each play, it\'s his own dedication to improving - that eventually gets the reaffirmation he\'s always wanted. The old tofu guy that shows up across the film is such a kind soul. After this reaffirmation of his improvement, he actually strives to be on equal levels as the other two rather than just take it for granted, which also leads to Yukinori changing his perception of him.The film does a great job at creating this narrative axis where Shunji\'s absence of innate talent is counterbalanced by a dedication to tireless effort, which I really loved cause once again similarities to Whiplash.Shunji\'s metamorphosis from a disillusioned college student to an amateur drummer driven by hard work offers a compelling dichotomy between musical philosophies as well. The clash between Yukinori\'s ambition-driven approach and Dai & Shunji\'s joyous camaraderie begs the question: What defines a superior musician in the emotionally charged realm of jazz? In the intricate interplay between Dai\'s resolute dedication, Yukinori\'s introspective change towards musical expression, and Shunji\'s transformative journey from a novice to a ""good"" drummer, elegantly explores the nuances of aspiration, camaraderie, and the multifaceted landscapes of jazz.The characters are so good I almost forgot to talk about the OST. I have been put in a trance dude. The heart and soul of Blue Giant rest in its music, reminiscent of the dying echoes of jazz\'s golden era. Hiromi Uehara\'s compositions elevate the film, encapsulating the essence of \'60s jazz legends like Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane. The concert scenes got me moving the exact way the audience members did through pulsating rhythms and ecstatic harmonies that are just ARHHHHHHHHHH.On the production side of things however: the animation techniques employed, while mostly expressive and vibrant - I can see people being mixed on. The integration of rotoscoping CG amid 2D animation creates a kind of unsettling dissonance during performances, which I acknowledge can be detracting momentarily from an otherwise visually compelling narrative. I was mostly fine with it though as there were too many creative sequences for me to be even a little bitter toward the overall performances.Also, the film\'s final act had me in a chokehold. The accident scene was so unexpected ESPECIALLY after we had that scene with Akiko crying tears of joy.

Holy crap though, this went so hard! The movies pacing was definitely ""quick"" but it is what to expect from a 2 hour and 10 minute movie. The movie perfectly covered all nuance of what its like to be a musician and working your way in the industry.Blue Giant is a solid 10/10, the amount of colours and mediums they used for the 2D parts of the performances were absolutely beautiful. I definitely prefferred the 2D to the 3D, but that aside, the animation is so captivating otherwise....It genuinely felt otherwordly watching each and every performance scene. The people behind the instruments did a fantastic job at creating the tones and mood for the movie. Dai\'s saxophone tone is immensenly great, and theres definitely the ""young"" sound to it. The sound is refreshing in the convuluted genre of jazz. Yuki developing his piano tone from the restraints of technicality, to just feeling the music was amazing. Especially major props to Shinji for catching up on the drums, considering hes characterized as an absolute amateur. Each person behind their instrumental roles did amazing jobs at capturing the characterization of each guy.Now even though I did rate it a 10/10, I wouldnt say its the most breathtaking/life changing/questioning your trajectory of life type of plot. Often, most music animes start off with the premise of ""bottom to the top."" The premise is definitely very simple, but Blue Giant does a good job at making a relatively simple plotline for most music animes, into something even better for the films premise. But fundamentally, the plot still is quite simple and follows again, the ""bottom to the top"" aspect. This isn\'t a bad thing though, because we as viewers like to be able to consume something simple.

It's an incredible display of talent. The jazz is something to behold throughout, but especially as the team gels over the runtime of this movie, it just gets better and better. And the way they visually display the flourishes, particularly of Dai's bombastic style with his sax, is very impressive.That being said, the rest of what's here just feels like window dressing. To start, the CGI in this looks rough in places. Sometimes it looks really good, but the compositing could really have used some work in others. As for...the characters, I get that this is a movie, but I wanted more. Dai wants to be the best jazz player and we only get minimal insight into why. Shunji picks up the drums for reasons we only partially get and then goes very hard into them, becoming quite good after a year (dude's almost as much of a prodigy as Dai), though I liked watching his development so much that it wasn't harmful to the experience. We get more insight into Yukinori, but a single scene serves as his development as a player and we don't much of an idea as to what changed for him. Something else clearly does later, but it did feel like it was inserted chiefly for dramatic effect, which felt a little forced (truck-kun wasn't required to make this story hit). I would have preferred that this was just a musical journey for the central three characters throughout. In fact, the ending itself seemed forced, with the sudden revelation that this was their last performance going unexplained. Maybe the idea was that Dai was going to strike out on his own or that Yukinori simply knew this was the end of the road for him, but it felt like the decision to end the group came out of left field just to insert more drama into that ending. I get the feeling there was a lot more exploration of these choices and themes in the manga, there's so much to love about the music that it's hard to fault them for making it an anime, I just wish it had been a series instead of a single movie.So while elements of this movie are masterfully done, it does feel like it's missing elements that would make the whole product great. Still, a more than worthwhile watch for those elements alone. the characters, I get that this is a movie, but I wanted more.

As pretentious as that sounds, the film really conveyed why some emotions are just too overwhelming to be display on other medium. This is first and foremost, an anime for dreamers. Whether it\'s the pure joy, passion, or perseverance, this film does it all with flying colors. From beginning to end, I could feel the whole theater being under the film\'s spell. Damn, it kept everyone in their seats and stunned to silence through the end credits.I went in not knowing much about the story other than ""jazz"" (which I love as...a casual fan of live performances) and got swept away by the characters and their dreams. The story of young talents trying to become famous musicians are as old as it gets, yet the portrayal was so powerful in making you fall for their music. Even the most cliche part still hit me deeply (despite my spidey senses warning the incoming danger). All the drama feels super human. Some progression might felt too rush, but at its core, the film is always sincere.In terms of animation, not all parts are flawless. Some movement CGI are noticeable, yet the ""MOMENTS"" it hit, that\'s just some of the best blend of visual and music ever. As lame as it sounds; I FEEL THE MUSIC.

I just got done with “Blue Giant” and it was absolutely brilliant. I never had much link to jazz as a whole and I’m a pretty shitty drummer, I could relate to Tamada (until he got “good”), but without any bias whatsoever this movie hit HARD.Story – 9/10 [SPOILER WARNING]This is not the most innovative piece of fiction you’ve ever seen, but I would strongly agree it does it bloody well. Fresh out of high school and radiating full of ambition, our shining main character, Dai, has big aspirations and he is not afraid to act upon them. After the questionable comment of...“Wow that’s big.” being said at a urinal, he sets upon his dreams to be the greatest jazz player with fellow pianist Yukinori and “landlord” & new time drummer Tamada. Together they begin the long and gruelling trail up the ranks of music in the big city of Japan, and my god have they have the talent to back it. Throw in a few dramatic scenes, success and failure and there is nothing you can wrong with. Except that’s how it was MEANT to go until truck-kun shows his ass on screen and thunders into Yukinori. I still feel like didn’t impact the overall result of what happened but was an interesting contrast from the lead up to success shown previously.I would also like to mention how they managed to throw 10 volumes worth of content into 2 hours and still have it work brilliantly.Characters – 10/10No character is bland, no matter the role, significance, or number of appearances I think every single one added something to the story. The main cast have such contrasting personalities on occasion yet still work so well together on screen. The side characters never really say that much yet I genuinely enjoyed seeing them constantly reoccurring – specifically the guy rooting for Tamada’s drums and the bartender of their practice location. They didn’t need to steal the show or oppose anybody – I wouldn’t change a single thing about anyone of them.Music – 10/10I feel like Blue Giant might have set a new standard for music anime. Every single song was composed to give my ears an orgasm and played perfectly into the whole “remaking jazz” theme. I genuinely had my jaw open after one of the performances, to me it was that good.Art & Animation– 8/10Both the art and the animation were always at a higher standard throughout the film, during the final performance of “Jass” they stepped it up quite a few notches. The CGI didn’t bring me out of anything and looked pretty good where it needed to. I have no complaints asides from the fluctuating quality throughout.Closing ThoughtsI was very pleasantly surprised watching this. I know I’ve just glazed BG for a while but it is definitely worth your time!Score – 9/10 “Wow that’s big.” being said at a urinal, he sets upon his dreams to be the greatest jazz player with fellow pianist Yukinori and “landlord” & new time drummer Tamada.

It's a shame, because I really wanted to know more about him, even if the movie reveals some of his life. Despite being a jazz deity when the story begins, he still retains a charismatic and endearing presence.Musicals with good music and visuals are a blessing, like an extended music video.

The other main characters also follow a similar pattern as well, all of them starting at the bottom, and I love that.If something made you cry, it must be something special, and Blue Giant certainly lives up to this sentiment if you can relate it in some capacity. Otherwise, it might feel boring or not having anything special for some.Apart from not adapting the first volumes, I also disliked the use of CGI. The art style is beautiful, the animation during the shows is amazing, but was the use of CGI really necessary? It felt off, but it didn't ruin the movie for me. This is still a sure recommendation for jazz and its subgenres or music fans in general. narrative too.I didn't expect to enjoy it at first, but I was surprised.When you have a big penis, you need a good blood flow.

Blue Giant is the epitome of musical animation, and you\'ll have to fight me...for it if you dare to say otherwise! for it if you dare to say otherwise!', ""Shinichi Ishizuka's jazz-themed\xa0manga series genuinely loves music and the emotional production of it. Jazz as a genre is just pure soul with roots in blues and characterized by swing, which no other discipline can mimic because jazz can also be undisciplined. Blue Giant's adaptation for the big screen translates the passion well, and actually hearing music helps. The lead character, Dai Miyamoto, is a former high school basketball player turned saxophone\xa0player. As a self-trained musician, his theoretical understanding is lacking, which he compensates for with an uncontrollable devotion to honing his skills. It's Dai that holds the writing together in its highs and lows, consistently...remaining a symbol of unchanging motivation to be the best. Whether or not that's in his near future isn't important, although we do fast forward to a documentary being filmed with people he's interacted with in the past. They all admit to being floored by his intensity, personifying\xa0his music as sheer confidence and a loud demand for attention. Ishizuka isn't interested in the fundamentals or details of the artform and instead writes about a climb to the top using instinct and expression.There are equal upsides and downsides to the narrative structure, and the latter is mainly a case of being by-the-book dramatically. It's completely predictable, which leads to Blue Giant becoming less and less about stakes and more so about electric displays of jam sessions and performances. Prioritizing music in action isn't the worst creative choice if the writing isn't quite supportive of textured character writing. However, the story does still offer modest philosophies about living for a dream and devoting your all to the hardest part of success, practice. The trio—Dai, Shunji, and Yukinori—practice like hell. Their dynamic gives us slight light-hearted banter but also loosely experiments with talent, beginner's hard work, and unadulterated passion. It's difficult to fully immerse oneself in the literary mechanics Ishizuka uses to accumulate tension, especially if the viewer is familiar with the tenets of the medium. The same applies to me, although I'd argue a calculated process of hitting familiar high notes and giving the audience an uplifting feel-good rush is all a movie really needs to be a good time, which this is. An underdog journey of amateurs improvising what they lack in experience to the pinnacle of Japanese jazz venues.Hiromi Uehara's score is phenomenal, committing to the originality of the pieces Yukinori writes for the band while simultaneously being inspired by the many jazz pioneers referenced here and there. A lot of the tracks are based on John Coltrane's later discography as well as new wave jazz. Uehara assembled more than 30 elite musicians to compose the soundtrack, beautifully reflecting the hearts of the instruments. There are numerous solos during the trio's performances, and we'll hear the drums or piano going off in their own world, dishing out joyous grooves to overwhelm the senses. The music accompanies an interesting visual arsenal from Studio NUT, and this is where I became slightly divided on animation effectiveness. Complex 2D sequences are nigh-impossible to pull off nowadays in a production time crunch, so studios will resort to CG models. The evolution of 3D integration over the years has been impressive, yet still, the reduced framerate and noticeable stiffness become an awkward moment when editing between close-ups and expressionless flailing. In the long run, it's up to the viewer to decide their stance on the visual product, which also has many standout cuts.The best scenes in Blue Giant sort of melt into the atmosphere, showing us nebulous keyframes blending into the audio. Director Yuzuru Tachikawa employs smears that we typically see in his work in TV animation. The film is shot almost entirely in blue, at least when it's establishing any particular location, and switches to gold when we're absorbed by Dai's powerful timbre. Satoru Hirayanagi's art direction is a remarkable aspect of the film's visual storytelling and language, including but not limited to constant glimmers or glints on the instruments, and subtle things like dented cymbals sell the satisfaction of a great performance. At the height of enlivening the animation, the rotoscoped character acting and attention to fingerwork all accumulate to a rush of freeform, often abstract transformative movement. This adaptation has integrity; even in its weaker elements, there is discernible effort to maximize the sound design's giant impact.

At first I was kinda questioning them since they just seemed really goofy, but goofy makes them good.And obviously the biggest part of this movie,...the music. GAWW DAMNNNNNN is all I can say. Every single time they played it was great, and the animation and everything for the scenes were so good. Had my friendss in vc with me watching and they were losing their minds lmao.I loved the progression they had through the movie, from being a small group not really knowing how to play making hundreds of mistakes, to then playing infront of tons of people and getting offers to be on records. The problems they had along the way were actually really good too, gave even more things for the characters to do and overcome.The performance at the end of the movie was really good, I loved the animation and visuals for it too. The transitions for it were insane.Make sure you watch the after credits, very epic.100% going to read the manga soon. Also the soundtrack is on Spotify. W the music. GAWW DAMNNNNNN is all I can say. Every single time they played it was great, and the animation and everything for the scenes were so good. Had my friendss in vc with me watching and they were losing their minds lmao.I loved the progression they had through the movie, from being a small group not really knowing how to play making hundreds of mistakes, to then playing infront of tons of people and getting offers to be on records. The problems they had along the way were actually really good too, gave even more things for the characters to do and overcome.The performance at the end of the movie was really good, I loved the animation and visuals for it too. The transitions for it were insane.Make sure you watch the after credits, very epic.100% going to read the manga soon. Also the soundtrack is on Spotify. W']"
195,"['Kara no Kyoukai review Part 8.There\'s an old aphorism about saving the best till last, and Kara no Kyoukai ~The Garden of Sinners~ has done just that.The seventh and final movie in the franchise doesn\'t simply follow the events of the second movie, but utilises threads from several previous stories to weave an interesting, and sometimes disturbing, tale of obsession. The second part of Satsujin Kousatsu (Murder Speculation), takes place in February 1999, one month after Oblivion Recording, and more than three years after the events in the second movie.This time around it seems the serial killer from part one is back, and as the...bodies are found one by one, Mikiya Kokuto searches for answers as he continues to believe Ryougi Shiki was not responsible for previous set of murders, and that she is innocent of the crimes being commited now. Meanwhile, Shiki prowls the dark alleys night after night ...One thing that really sets this movie apart from the rest of the series is that the plot is much tighter and more flowing than in most of the previous outings. There is also a conscious effort to tie up some of the loose ends left over the course of the series, and while there are still several unanswered questions, the second part of Satsujin Kousatsu does manage to offer some catharsis about Shiki and Kokuto\'s relationship.That said, the writing isn\'t perfect. There are still some plot points that remain unresolved, and while they may not have a major impact on the narrative per se, they do leave one feeling that the overall storyline from the whole series is a little incomplete. In addition to this the dialogue suffers from an abundance of intelligence as every character can philosophise their actions in some manner. The upshot of this is that the movie can sometimes seem condescending or patronizing, and even though this questionable arrogance may be unintentional, the simple fact is that viewers may find themselves wanting to punch the screen from time to time.While the writing may not be up to standard, the same can\'t be said of the visuals. Ufotable have, once again, pulled out all the stop for this finale, and it shows. The characters move with an animal grace that is rare to see, and the overall animation is stunning in its quality and choreography. The opening credit sequence is particularly noteworthy as it shows great imagination, as well as some stunning techniques that will hopefully appear in more anime. As for the movie proper, there are some fantastic lighting effects throughout which add a more ominous atmosphere to much of the story, especially when used alongside the often dark, dank backgrounds and settings. That said, there are occasions where the lighting is a little off (for example, characters are easily distinguishable in areas where there is no readily available light source), however this is a minor gripe as the majority of the movie is the most atmospheric and well animated episode in the franchise.Sound is another area where the movie excels, although there are admittedly a few minor niggles here and there. The cast are at their best in this episode, and their experience with the characters, especially Kokuto (Suzumura Kenichi), and Shiki (Sakamoto Maaya), really does shine through. The performances of the seiyuu literally ooze quality, and while there is a penchant for philosophical monologuing at times, these are delivered with aplomb.In terms of effects Satsujin Kousatsu Part 2 might arguably be the best in the series. Each sound  is clear and distinguishable, even when the habitual cacophony occurs during heavy action sequences, and once again the franchise proves that it can deliver very high production values.The real triumph though, is the music.In the simplest terms this movie a definite contender for ""best anime choreography of the decade"" as it features some of the most breathtaking melding of animation and music to be found in the medium, and the choice of tracks is nothing short of inspired. The opening sequence is a choral, hymn-like track which perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the movie, while the end theme, a bittersweet ballad, works very well with the movie\'s finale. Where Satsujin Kousatsu Part 2 really shines though, is in the application of its thematic music. The tracks on offer have a generally dark feel to them (this isn\'t really a ""nice"" story after all), but added to that are visuals that have not only been timed extremely well, but feature some excellent animation, stunning set designs, and superb camera angles.One of the issues that has plagued the Kara no Kyoukai franchise from the outset is that the characters are often underdeveloped, and while certain events over the course of the series provide opportunities for growth, these chances are all too often overlooked. That said, there is some development to be had, it\'s just unfortunate that the lion\'s share of it only occurs in a few movies, and this is one of them. It\'s the introduction of Shirazumi Lio that changes the dynamics of not only the story, but also the relationship between Kokuto and Shiki. He is the one thing that forces the pair to grow as characters, and his presence in the movie casts a pall over every story in the franchise.Confused? I\'ll elaborate then.Kara no Kyoukai has made the effort to portray Souren Araya as the main ""bad guy"", but while his goals may be the drivers for many of the events over the course of the series, he never affected Kokuto and Shiki in the way that Lio does. It\'s his formation of a very disturbed ""menage-a-trois"" that causes Kokuto to ""get off his backside"" for once, and pushes Shiki to the edge of reason. Lio is also noteworthy for the surprising amount of characterisation that has gone into his creation. He is a complete persona from start to finish, and while there is virtually no development on his part, he honestly doesn\'t need it.To be perfectly frank, I found this to be the best installment in the series, and while it is somewhat more graphic than other episodes, this only serves to improve one\'s understanding of the characters and events (as opposed to simply being graphic in order to be ""cool""). A case in point is one particular interaction between Lio and Shiki, which while being rather sexually charged, is more reminiscent of a child pulling the wings off a fly. It\'s this emphasis on improving the viewer\'s understanding of the characters that really sets the movie apart, especially as this is what has been lacking for most of the series.If you\'re a fan of franchise, or of TYPE-MOON, then Satsujin Kousatsu Part 2 is a movie that you should definitely watch. As a standalone it holds its own against many other releases, but when the series is taken as a whole the movie is raised to a new level. That said, in order to fully appreciate the difference it\'s best to watch the rest of the series first, as while each episode functions as an autonomous tale, this particular film has been designed to convey an ending.Kara no Kyoukai may not be to everyone\'s tastes, but whether you like it or not the one undeniable fact is that the franchise makes a great advertisement for the potential inherent in the anime industry, and given some recent releases like Break Blade, it seem like someone was paying attention. bodies are found one by one, Mikiya Kokuto searches for answers as he continues to believe Ryougi Shiki was not responsible for previous set of murders, and that she is innocent of the crimes being commited now.

But it takes a truly remarkable series to become memorable among the bottomless sea of anime. Kara no Kyoukai is that series.Kara no Kyoukai 7: Satsujin Kousatsu Part 2 is the finale of a string of movies based of a series of light novels by Kinoko Nasu. In the final movie, the story revolves around the appearance of multiple murders as well as the disappearance of Ryougi Shiki, and Kokutou Mikiya's attempt to unravel the mysteries of the murders and Shiki's whereabouts.Story: 10I was...really conflicted on whether or not the story for the finale deserved a 9 or a 10, but in the end i chose the give it a 10 against my better judgment. All of the Kara no Kyoukai movies have a very adult plot, focusing on murder and moral values within society, and the 7th movie also takes this stance while focusing on Shiki and Mikiya's relatioship, as well as tying up lose ends in the plot, and revealing things that the other movies left out.  The use of suspense and mystery, as well as the constant flash backs that reveal more and more of Mikiya and Shiki's tale really helps to keep the story flowing as well as keeping the viewers interested. If I had to be really picky, the only problem with the story is the pacing at some points. The flow of the story does not have a constant pacing, where at some points it seems to move extremely slow while other times the story seems to progress and reveal information in a short amount of time.Art: 10Really, all the Kara no Kyoukai movies have amazing art and animation and the finale is no exception. The use of a dark color palet brings out the story's dark undertones of the story, as well as complementing the characters and scenery.Sound: 10Sound is also used very effectively as well to help create a mood to immerse the viewers in. It is up beat when it needs to be, and sad when it needs to be as well. The combination of the art and sound creates a mood that helps immerse viewers in Shiki and Mikiya's world and the situation they are in. It is the addition of these elements which truly brings out Kara no Kyoukai's brilliance. Keeping the viewers attention is only half the battle, for an anime to truly become remarkable in the eyes of the public it needs to draw in the viewers, immerse them in the characters world. Having the viewer feeling tense as a character rounds the corner, having them feel for the characters during emotional moments, this is all created through the use of art and sound, and Kara no Kyoukai nails it.Character: 10As stated in the story, we get to see more of the relationship between Shiki and Mikiya as well as their development as characters. Shiki is a very unusual character, one of the reasons that people are drawn to this anime, and although she is hard to identify with, seeing her struggle with her problems, struggle with understanding her emotions, as well as evolve as a person is what draws us to her. While other movies did not so much focus on Shiki and her emotions and how she is changing, this movie is solely dedicated to it, and that is one of its greatest draws.Enjoyment: 10What can I say, I have been praising this movie for the whole review. It is a masterpiece in my eyes, and while it may not have as much action as the others, it is still my personal favorite.While writing this review, I was trying to find things wrong with this movie, but not matter how hard I thought, I was not able to. It may seem stupid that I gave this all 10's, but really, this movie deserved every one of them. It is outstanding, amazing and remarkable.So let me ask you, what makes an anime memorable to you? Characters? Story? Art? There are only a select few animes that ever reach this level with people, an anime which you will remember while forgetting many others. It needs to stand out, it needs to grab your attention, and most importantly, it needs to affect YOU.

For me, Kara no Kyoukai 7 is that kind of anime."", 'I usually don\'t feel compelled to review animes.  I watched the entire ""Garden of sinners"" series of films and would give all of them a collective grade of 8 if I was forced to.  But after watching the seventh film, seeing nothing but rave reviews all over the web saying this is the best of the bunch, I felt I had to say something.*slight spoilers ahead*This film had some good points (the art for example, which has been a consistent highlight throughout all of the films) but it\'s heavily outweighed by the low points in the execution of the movie\'s story.For one,...it ran an hour too long.  The film is a bulky two hours I felt was mostly filler, and definitely could of been condensed. It seemed like the director and writer made this film way too long to make up for the long wait but it was completely unnecessary.That being said, I did enjoy the first part of the film.  It\'s starts off very promising with a suspenseful murder-mystery sort of vibe that\'s been prevalent with all the films.  Shiki\'s back story is finally fleshed out a little more which was nice, though you have to have a good memory to catch everything. (Lots of references to the past films, to be expected.)Where the movie really lost points for me was the main theme of the film; the idea that Shiki has always had this latent desire to kill and Kokuto\'s argument that murder is never justified.  I agreed with Kokuto and the movie argues very well throughout that killing means killing a part of yourself too. This was a recurrent theme throughout the films and they had me believing it, which was why the ending was such a supreme disappointment for me.  The film seemed to contradict and ignore it\'s own argument for the sake of a ""happy"" ending and I felt a little cheated by it.  Where are the consequences of murder they kept talking about? the loss?So, if you liked the other films then you\'ll get a lot of the same.  The tone, characters and artwork are all familiar and are certainly worth a look if only to know how the series ends. But this film is a prime example of a story that was structured with a very clear ideal in mind, only to chuck it out the window for no reason at all.  If your a fan of good, consistent writing like me, you\'ll be disappointed. it ran an hour too long.  The film is a bulky two hours I felt was mostly filler, and definitely could of been condensed.

If your a fan of good, consistent writing like me, you\'ll be disappointed.', 'This is the final and possibly best installment of the series Kara no Kyoukai: The Garden of Sinners. I would like to mention before I begin that if you have a minimal knowledge of the previous movies in the series this may spoil the franchise for you. Let me also say, I have not read the novels, for in a way, I wanted to savor the animation and suspense these movies bring. And boy am I glad I did. When I finished this anime, I was taken back for a moment. It\'s one of those few anime miracles that occur, a deep breath, an awkward...sigh, and then followed by a short reminiscence of what you just spent two hours watching. The plot delivery, the characters, the animation, the sound all astounding. Subtly tying the entire series together, almost nothing is left unexplained - while many questions remain.Story: 10/10The story wraps up what the other six movies manage to establish - an awesome gut-wrenching plot that really shifts your way of thinking. Now I can\'t really say anything because I don\'t want to spoil the movie, but this movie really does it right. The character you saw for a brief moment during the end of the fifth movie appears, playing a major role. But what really makes this anime different  in the story telling department is (and this is why I love it) not the solid plot itself, but the details that surround it. A minor phrase can inadvertently change how the story progresses, or a scene that occurred a few movies earlier can really influences what happens.Now about the seventh movies story. Shiki and Mikiya\'s love is really held high here, seeing as it is the final and climactic movie. The time is also set as the furthest set time to date, which was threw me for a loop because since this movie was called ""Murder Speculation (Second Half)"" I thought it would be a direct sequel to the second movie. It is in fact not, and explains what happened shortly after the second movie through flashbacks. The fight scenes are as always, top-notch. The \'other Shiki\' is explained in this movie, for up until now the idea of \'another Shiki\' (SHIKI) seemed rather abstract. As I said before I can\'t say too much about the story, seeing as it would ruin the suspense.Art: 10/10The art and animation are far beyond any anime, rivaling 5/Centimers Per Second. The fighting scenes are so high tension that you can\'t help but move a little in your seat every time the camera switches angles. Ufotable, which also worked on Eve no Jikan and Pale Cocoon uses the same kind of art style, so if you liked those you should also like the way this anime looks. Some moments of animation are just jaw-dropping. In a scene where Shiki is lying down the camera pulls forward, pulses blue, pulls back a little and continues to zoom in. It may be hard to visualize in your head but this one scene was so intense I move closer to my computer screen, as if the anime was drawing me in. The chiaroscuro used in this anime really enhances the overall experience. The horror scenes in this anime are too, really disturbing, not because of the what is happening but how it is presented (an anime that does not truly excel here is the original Hellsing, where what is happening is creepy, but without proper animation it seems to lack the oomph Kara no Kyoukai has). No 3D elements or CG can be scene although the way this is animated makes it feel as if another dimension exists between the two, the movements of characters, vehicles, and even magic are so realistic it\'s fascinating.Sound: 10/10Not much to be said about the sound other than it too, is stellar. The opening song really creepy. I started drawing short breaths when it was finished, it fitted this anime quite well and it matched the animation to a T. The background music is creepy in its own, quiet, way. It plays as light filler in the background for when the fighting scenes start, building suspense all the while. The sounds of the cars, the rain, the sound of knives clashing with one another - all superb. It\'s like your really standing in front of a knife fight (that is without worrying for your life). The voice acting, too, is done really well, the voices fit the characters well and are executed without problems (I\'d say more but I\'m not an expert on VA). The ending song like all Kara No Kyoukai ending songs, fits the movie well, using lyrics that actually relate to what you just saw.Character: 10/10The characters reach a climax in this movie. All that you knew and didn\'t know about them meets here. Mikiya begins to reveal his love for Shiki, and you see him in a new, darker light. You\'ll find yourself asking ""Is this the same guy from the second movie, or what?"" the change is quite apparent. Shiki and her counterpart SHIKI\'s motives are explained and the view you have of her will also change from the beginning to end of this movie. I do digress that Araya had less of a role than in previous movies, seeing as he was such an interesting character, I wish they made more use of him. He does appear but doesn\'t say much. The new character, Lio, was briefly shown in earlier movies, but is revealed as Shiki\'s ""stalker"". He is a pivotal character that explains a lot of what happened in the second movie which was essentially the catalyst for the entire series. Once again, if I say too much, it\'ll be ruined.Enjoyment: 10/10By God! If you\'re still reading, you should know that I harbor a deep love for this series, these characters, and this movie! What an incredible experience. There was not a single moment that I didn\'t enjoy this movie. Now you\'re probably thinking ""Well because yeah, you were having a freaking orgasm the whole time just by staring at the animation"", and essentially, you could say I was. I\'m writing this to heavily suggest you watch these movies. I want to you, the reader, to want to watch this, not because it\'s gimmicky, or all the cool kids are watching it (but they are) but because it\'s simply amazing.Overall: 10/10Masterpiece.Closing note: This is my first review, and I\'m writing it because I feel that more people should know about this anime. My review may sound pretentious (which my writing may be, but not this movie) and over-exaggerated but it really isn\'t. This is truly one of the great anime epics, holding its own with Legend of the Galactic Heroes and Monster. sigh, and then followed by a short reminiscence of what you just spent two hours watching.

The opening song really creepy. I started drawing short breaths when it was finished, it fitted this anime quite well and it matched the animation to a T. The background music is creepy in its own, quiet, way. It plays as light filler in the background for when the fighting scenes start, building suspense all the while. The sounds of the cars, the rain, the sound of knives clashing with one another - all superb. It\'s like your really standing in front of a knife fight (that is without worrying for your life). The voice acting, too, is done really well, the voices fit the characters well and are executed without problems (I\'d say more but I\'m not an expert on VA). The ending song like all Kara No Kyoukai ending songs, fits the movie well, using lyrics that actually relate to what you just saw.Character: 10/10The characters reach a climax in this movie. All that you knew and didn\'t know about them meets here. Mikiya begins to reveal his love for Shiki, and you see him in a new, darker light. You\'ll find yourself asking ""Is this the same guy from the second movie, or what?"" the change is quite apparent. Shiki and her counterpart SHIKI\'s motives are explained and the view you have of her will also change from the beginning to end of this movie. I do digress that Araya had less of a role than in previous movies, seeing as he was such an interesting character, I wish they made more use of him. He does appear but doesn\'t say much. The new character, Lio, was briefly shown in earlier movies, but is revealed as Shiki\'s ""stalker"". He is a pivotal character that explains a lot of what happened in the second movie which was essentially the catalyst for the entire series. Once again, if I say too much, it\'ll be ruined.Enjoyment: 10/10By God! If you\'re still reading, you should know that I harbor a deep love for this series, these characters, and this movie! What an incredible experience. There was not a single moment that I didn\'t enjoy this movie. Now you\'re probably thinking ""Well because yeah, you were having a freaking orgasm the whole time just by staring at the animation"", and essentially, you could say I was. I\'m writing this to heavily suggest you watch these movies. I want to you, the reader, to want to watch this, not because it\'s gimmicky, or all the cool kids are watching it (but they are) but because it\'s simply amazing.Overall: 10/10Masterpiece.Closing note: This is my first review, and I\'m writing it because I feel that more people should know about this anime. My review may sound pretentious (which my writing may be, but not this movie) and over-exaggerated but it really isn\'t. This is truly one of the great anime epics, holding its own with Legend of the Galactic Heroes and Monster.', ""Well... this is the first time I've deviated so much from the consensus. I really wanted to like this movie, but unfortunately I just wasn't able to be entertained. I watched all seven movies on Amazon Prime video,and I liked every single entry except this one.The major problems that I had with this movie have to do with the thoroughly annoying and uninteresting villain, the forced melodrama, and some plot holes.The villain in this movie is introduced fairly early on relative to the previous movies in the series. However, this villain is also the least interesting villain in the entire series - which is saying...a lot since some of the previous movies had some really dull antagonists. His intentions and motivations are all in your face and incredibly cliche and his only purpose in this movie was to force a moral quandary onto Shiki. Additionally, his over the top personality, which consists of mainly jumping around like a god damn monkey, screaming, and acting like a maniacal pervert, got old real quick.Additionally the philosophy aspect really doesn't add much to the story compared to the previous films. In this story it mainly has to do with Kokutou's no kill rule, which I can respect. But then they add in all this fluff where Shiki feels oh so lonely, or that she loves Kokutou and she doesn't want to hurt him ... blah blah blah. In the end there's just so much of it that it just comes off as feeling forced.Additionally there was one major plot hole that kind of set me off. It has to do with a scene where Kokutou is an abandoned ware house towards the end of the film. Here it just felt like the creators didn't have the balls to complete the story with what should have been the natural progression (those of you who have already seen the movie probably know what I'm talking about). Additionally there were some other minor problems with previous antagonists being reintroduced into the story without any real insight into their significance in the plot line. Honestly, this didn't bother me too much. Also I didn't like the whole drugs subplot.There were some good things as well, like the animation and the soundtrack, but as a whole, the negatives outweigh the positives by a large margin.This is my first real review, so I know it's kind of bad and all over the place. I'll just add that if you liked the movie, then that's cool too. I'm not here to hate on anyone, I just wanted to add my own two cents into the mix. Thanks for reading! a lot since some of the previous movies had some really dull antagonists.

Thanks for reading!"", '(Before reading, I would like to say that this is my first review in MyAnimeList and any criticism or feedback would be great. In addition, this is a review of the entire KnK series not just the 7th one. Any recommendations from fellow Kara no Kyoukai fans would also be appreciated. There might be spoilers so WATCH OUT. THANK YOU!!!)Story:The story has been deemed confusing as I cannot myself disagree with this notion. However, I believe this vagueness at the beginning of the anime was meant to interest readers as the anime overall had a mysterious aura to it. If the entire story were explained...linearly, then the story would just not be as compelling. Kara no Kyoukai is instead presented like a puzzle or a detective\'s case, in which the audience must piece together all of the clues and stories that these movies provide. Once the audience reaches the climax of the story, the puzzle starts to form the picture that it was gradually working towards. The picture itself is emotionally impactful and I personally felt rewarded for the effort that I put into the anime. The ending answered the major questions the anime brought up earlier, such as ""What exactly happened to Shiki after she attempted to kill Mikiya?"" This anime ended in a rollercoaster of emotions that were released all at once due to the complete understanding of the story after the answers given to the audience.The small pieces of the puzzle that were provided before the conclusion were outstanding as well. Each piece had its fair share of food for thought.  The first movie\'s unique and poetic take on suicide and the the 5th movie\'s take on how life can sometimes be described as a habitual spiral are some examples of philosophy that made these first 6 movies not only bearable, but enjoyable. In addition, each antagonist before Lio had his or her own intriguing story that kept me entertained while trying to decipher the anime. Fujino, Souren, etc. all had their own different motives behind murdering, making murder a recurring theme throughout the series to set up for the conclusion.Art and Sound:Ufotable\'s art does not fail to impress once again as Kara no Kyoukai\'s art was simply beautiful. The fight scenes, as unrealistic as they may actually be, were transformed into realistically fluid scenes that were visually appealling. The art formed the foundation for the dark mood that broods over this anime. The dark undertones of the art and animation bolstered the depressing feelings through the series.The sound produced mostly by Yuki Kajiura and Kalafina fit the anime well whatever the scene may be. The most common song ""In the Garden of Sinners"" and most other songs set the tragic tone of the anime from the start to the very end. When the action scenes occurred, the more upbeat songs added to the epicness that was already there from the gorgeous animation. It was obvious to me that Ufotable was selective in their choosing songs for the right moments in the anime.Even though the story was impressive alone, its effectiveness came from the backbone that the art and the sound created.Characters:My personal favorite part of the anime are its characters, mostly the two main ones. Ryougi Shiki is a type of character that I have never encountered in any form of media as her character is unique. It is not only this uniqueness that attracted me with this character, but also the execution of it. Through her internal and external conflicts, I began to empathize with her gradually while watching the anime. Also, by this process, I experienced the change that she was going through as a character.Kokutou Mikiya was also interesting because of the way he interacted with Shiki. In a way, he was the perfect complement to Shiki, the most righteous and nice guy who simply had hope regardless of the situation. The hopeless and conflicted Shiki transformed over time because of her affection for Kokutou Mikiya. When the two needed each other the most, the relationship flourished as the story concluded. The relationship became clear and satisfying.Enjoyment:I finished this anime three days ago and I cannot stop thinking about it. Those past few days were full of going through reddit posts and Youtube to find any KnK related stuff to explore. Well, you should get the point already that I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. I never loved animes but simply watched for entertainment purposes. However, after watching Kara no Kyoukai, this has made me want to explore more about this medium. This anime was more than just enjoyable, but it drew me in into the entire world that is anime.I highly recommend that everyone at least tries to finish through the 7 movies. However, I know that this anime is not for everyone as it is not very accessible. Even to me who loved this anime, there were still scenes that could only be answered by experts of the Nasuverse. This is probably one of the few flaws that I could find with the series. However, these flaws were far outweighed by the quality and complexity of Kara no Kyoukai.Despite all that, if you can put the time and effort into understanding the plot, this anime will simply blow you away. I have yet to discover any movie or TV show of any country that can top this one. The way it drew all of its elements together in a beautifully orchestrated fashion made this one of the best experiences in my entire lifetime. linearly, then the story would just not be as compelling.

Whether or not you\'ll watch this depends on what you thought of the previous movies, not on these reviews. Yet, I feel like reviewing it anyway.This could have been an excellent anime if there was money left over from the apparently massive animation budget to hire a decent writer. Conversely, this could have been entertaining if the animation and voice acting matched the writing. As it is, I give this a rating of ""what.""Fighting scenes are animated well, but ridiculous. I can handle super mecha, and I can handle people crossing swords all the time, but constantly ending up with crossed...pocket knives is too much. Really, there\'s only so much you can do with that. New and complex powers can be interesting. For example, in Code Geass, there are no ends to the way some Geass can be used. Conversely, more realistic knife fighting could have been interesting. Kara no Kyoukai has nothing but glowing slashes, jumping about, and crossing pocketknives over and over again. I am also left wondering why nobody ever uses a gun.Oooh, a long still shot of an answering machine as it says to leave a message, and no message is left. Ahhh, people talking about something mundane, done in a way that\'s usually used to make it seem like the conversation will be significant, when it\'s not. Like the previous movies, this could have been shorter, or better yet, had a writer that would make good use of that time. Lots of time spent on things that are totally irrelevant. Scenes that have nothing to do with the voiceover they go with. People that act in absurd ways. Conversations that are supposed to seem deep but don\'t actually mean anything and are too long to take as a standard pseudoexplanation. These are things I can describe clearly, but the writing is subtly insane in a way that transcends such and even normal kinds of insanity.So, this was the last of these movies. In the end, I felt like nothing was explained, everyone\'s actions were arbitrary, and the previous events were pointless. I gave this a 7, but on my rating scale, that does not mean this is ""good"" per se but rather that, in its own ""special"" way, it was worth watching. pocket knives is too much.

Gazing at the screen in disbelief in some moments, shock and dismay in others and appreciation in still others, I began to wonder about a variety of things.Having read the novel twice, I know the ending in the movie is happier. Despite of whatever happened, the movie managed to squeeze out a happy ending. Actually, I almost had the same critique for the novel, except the novel described an unavoidable loss; a much stronger displacement or blank where the male Shiki (織) once existed. That, and...there is something about the current Shiki that Mikiya will never quite reach.There is much blood and violence in the movie, not to mention one strongly sexually charged scene. It is nothing like erotism; it is rather like a scene of a butterfly or a certain prey struggling, as it is being overwhelmed and at the same time, strangely fascinated by its helplessness in facing a certain death.Indeed, much blood is spilt, much like in John Woo films where much shell casings and sparks fly and bodies tangle in the dance of death. As the blades cross, bites and scratches each other, one wonders for the similarities and differences between Shiki and the anti-Shiki, the latter seeking to find a companion in the world; anyone would do; anyone would do? Right?Being I, being a self-proclaimed Otaku (most likely just another geek in a geek culture), I struggled much as the antagonist had. Throughout the movie, the anti-Shiki seeks solace, seeks salvation of a sort by his effort of trying to find and to seduce Shiki and others to his side. It is his belief that Shiki can go back to the side that he believes he resides; it is his downfall that Shiki is no longer the same Shiki four years ago.However, as perhaps only the audience could observe and be sure of, Shiki was not the person the anti-Shiki wanted to be with four years ago, and after everything that happened after that, Shiki became something closer to a sense of believed normality. The novel hints that the “believed-ness” but the movie forgoes the key conversation in favor of a gentler and loving ending. Perhaps to provide a crutch to people like me, who seeks normalcy in a world where the definition for it is becoming more and more blurred. But the fact remain is that I am still broken.The novel seems to confirm that, as Shiki muses the lost of the male part of self and the conversation that affirms that musing. The movie doesn’t ignore it, but it is certainly portrayed in a more positive light. The male Shiki is the killer urge, thus as he is gone, it is better. But the loss is there. Both the novel and the movies come to terms with that fact, but somehow, I am slightly dissatisfied with the movies. However, with all the wonderful animation, superior voice acting, camera direction and music, the movies are masterpieces in emotional intensity and psychological searching in their own right. there is something about the current Shiki that Mikiya will never quite reach.There is much blood and violence in the movie, not to mention one strongly sexually charged scene.

Cool characters designs, but given nothing to do. Just silly people doing silly things for silly reasons.Pretty drawings, but that\'s about it.This makes me want to take 10 deadly marijuanas and die.', ""Kara no Kyoukai has been my favorite TYPE-MOON series and will always be. Creating a well-sculptured storyline that presents its meaning of life and death and a small cast of characters brings such an incredible impact. The 7th chapter has done nothing but present such a brutal and gloomy journey and ends with a bittersweet ending.The story continues to present the relationships between Shiki and Mikiya and how they interact with each other during a chaotic event in 1999 after Shiki knocks out 5 major threats. Shiki’s greatest challenge is to not kill a single human being and there’s one who’s completely out of control...and thus, killing a lot of citizens while drugging a handful to become his henchmen. This disaster was all thanks to the mysterious Souren Araya, who died at the hands of Shiki a year ago. Mikiya trusted Shiki to not kill that one person as long as there are ways to cure him. The story in this movie felt really natural and nicely toned. The relationships and conversations are very organic, especially when it comes to how the cast struggle to find ways to achieve happiness. Yeah, the fights are great and all but regardless of Kara no Kyoukai being action-based, it was never meant to have a lot of fight scenes. The series focuses on exploring its themes and ideals and it truly excels at it. This chapter truly did an excellent job of further emphasizing Shiki’s characteristics and its elements.Speaking of which, this leads me to the characters which are my personal favorite parts of the series. Shiki Ryougi is a young adult lady who used to have a male personality in her teen's age and now without him, she’s still herself but she doesn’t feel any of that and she still sees herself as a monster which results in her hunting down any inhuman enemy she sees. Mikiya Kokutou is a friend of Shiki who believes that killing is wrong and comforts those who are trapped in a horrific prison. The main cast is overall fantastic. They have incredible relationships and chemistry with one another. Shiki may be badass, cold, and independent but she’s profoundly believable and outstandingly structured both in her growth and her interactions. Not only does she have amazing dynamics in Mikiya but she struggles with her problems which are quite complicated but show the results of how Shiki deals with life and death. Mikiya may not be a badass fighter or something but like Shiki, he has incredible growth and relationships. He’s a pacifist but a human and well-created one.Of course, that “one person” I mentioned earlier is nonother than the last living obstacle Shiki has ever faced, Lio Shirazumi. He was a classmate of Mikiya in the early years and now, he’s an infamous murderer who is hegemonic and has an obsession with Shiki. He also reveals the number of murders he committed in the past and does it again after Araya’s death in addition to drugging certain people. Is he a disgusting bastard? Yes. Look at it this way, he’s like Shinji Matou from the Fate series, both being selfish monsters who have done a lot of messed up things. But the major difference is that unlike Shinji, who was a punching bag for the sake of being a punching bag, Lio plays such a great role to overwhelm Shiki’s journey. What’s really interesting is as the ‘Bloodthirsty Killer’ granted by Araya, Lio attempts to resemble some ghost of Shiki’s male personality. It’s really scary if you think about it. This results in Shiki struggling with her own problems even more.Shiki tries her best to not fail her greatest challenge, even if it means being harassed by Lio but after Lio harms Mikiya despite not killing him, Shiki felt nothing but rage within her. Shiki then proceeds to end Lio’s life, only to feel gloomy after. Shiki may win a physical battle but also loses that said challenge. The world may return back to normal but she can’t even find anything to celebrate. When Mikiya is still alive and went up, Shiki confesses to him that she has lost everything after killing Lio. Mikiya replied that it doesn’t matter as long as they still find happiness. Kara no Kyoukai brings some of the best endings in anime. Chapter 7’s conclusion shows that Shiki may fail one thing but still moves forward alongside Mikiya. The amazing dynamics between the two main leads during a chaotic event result in a bittersweet ending. What makes the ending even better is that instead of kissing, they just hug each other. Kissing scenes aren’t necessarily bad but they can be quite oversaturated. Those last 10 minutes truly left a delightful taste.As for the superficial aspects, the art style that the first six movies age is unique and unforgettable. The newer art style for Mirai Fukuin isn’t bad. After all, it stays consistent with what Fate/Zero established. But the older one just feels more fluid. It reflects the atmosphere and visuals very well. The animation, like a lot of shows adapted by ufotable, is great. The fights may not have a lot of magic shown but they’re still well-focused on the action happening. Character designs are very solid but the aesthetics of Shiki and Lio are fantastic. The OST is legendary and the 7th movie never misses on it. Like the art style, it reflects the designs and environment very nicely. Great character voice acting in Japanese as well. Although I wish there was an English dub for the whole series.Overall, Kara no Kyoukai always never disappoints me. The storytelling remains to be fantastic and so is the character writing. I know some of you may not like it (or the series as a whole) but I just enjoy the presentation of what the light and darkness mean in there. It’s confusing but the amount of depth in there really means a lot to my eyes. Kara no Kyoukai is one of my personal favorite animanga series and perhaps one of my overall favorite fictional series. Let me know what you think. Compliments and criticisms are always welcomed! Thank you for reading. and thus, killing a lot of citizens while drugging a handful to become his henchmen.

He was a classmate of Mikiya in the early years and now, he’s an infamous murderer who is hegemonic and has an obsession with Shiki. He also reveals the number of murders he committed in the past and does it again after Araya’s death in addition to drugging certain people. Is he a disgusting bastard? Yes. Look at it this way, he’s like Shinji Matou from the Fate series, both being selfish monsters who have done a lot of messed up things. But the major difference is that unlike Shinji, who was a punching bag for the sake of being a punching bag, Lio plays such a great role to overwhelm Shiki’s journey. What’s really interesting is as the ‘Bloodthirsty Killer’ granted by Araya, Lio attempts to resemble some ghost of Shiki’s male personality. It’s really scary if you think about it. This results in Shiki struggling with her own problems even more.Shiki tries her best to not fail her greatest challenge, even if it means being harassed by Lio but after Lio harms Mikiya despite not killing him, Shiki felt nothing but rage within her. Shiki then proceeds to end Lio’s life, only to feel gloomy after. Shiki may win a physical battle but also loses that said challenge. The world may return back to normal but she can’t even find anything to celebrate. When Mikiya is still alive and went up, Shiki confesses to him that she has lost everything after killing Lio. Mikiya replied that it doesn’t matter as long as they still find happiness. Kara no Kyoukai brings some of the best endings in anime. Chapter 7’s conclusion shows that Shiki may fail one thing but still moves forward alongside Mikiya. The amazing dynamics between the two main leads during a chaotic event result in a bittersweet ending. What makes the ending even better is that instead of kissing, they just hug each other. Kissing scenes aren’t necessarily bad but they can be quite oversaturated. Those last 10 minutes truly left a delightful taste.As for the superficial aspects, the art style that the first six movies age is unique and unforgettable. The newer art style for Mirai Fukuin isn’t bad. After all, it stays consistent with what Fate/Zero established. But the older one just feels more fluid. It reflects the atmosphere and visuals very well. The animation, like a lot of shows adapted by ufotable, is great. The fights may not have a lot of magic shown but they’re still well-focused on the action happening. Character designs are very solid but the aesthetics of Shiki and Lio are fantastic. The OST is legendary and the 7th movie never misses on it. Like the art style, it reflects the designs and environment very nicely. Great character voice acting in Japanese as well. Although I wish there was an English dub for the whole series.Overall, Kara no Kyoukai always never disappoints me. The storytelling remains to be fantastic and so is the character writing. I know some of you may not like it (or the series as a whole) but I just enjoy the presentation of what the light and darkness mean in there. It’s confusing but the amount of depth in there really means a lot to my eyes. Kara no Kyoukai is one of my personal favorite animanga series and perhaps one of my overall favorite fictional series. Let me know what you think. Compliments and criticisms are always welcomed! Thank you for reading."", 'I have no idea what this show is doing anymore, it\'s become too hard to analyse. This movie/episode was both good and bad, parts of it were kinda fun, but there were countless bad parts mentioned below. Overall, it was fun riffing on it while watching. All good points and bad points mentioned before remain.SPOILERS AHEAD:- 10:00 just fuck already! Or at least hug and kiss I don\'t care, but this status quo relationship is getting too ridiculous for a show seemingly so serious and mature.- 16:15 what is this Saya no Uta soundtrack doing in my KnK?! Can\'t say it\'s not appropriate......- 18:18 Really? You\'re gonna follow her even after what just happened? I\'m not sure which one of them is supposed to be the psycho anymore. ...hey wait, was that the point all along?- 24:48 lsd and pot? I hope this wasn\'t supposed to come across as \'\'junkies are getting murdered\'\' because to me it came across as \'\'people who enjoy life are getting murdered\'\'.- 25:12 link between drugs and murders? Thematic message better not end up being \'\'lsd and pot are bad\'\'.- 29:03 Their idea of tripping on 1/10th lsd dose is everything fades to black? Please...- 30:52 She\'s the hero this city needs, but not the one it deserves- tripping - you\'re doing it wrong. Also, \'\'he doesn\'t really reccomend it\'\', right... I guess no other line would be acceptable to the publishers. I like how his friend is cool with it.- 36:00 TIL: \'\'lsd mixed with pot destroys your body\'\', oh wait let me rephrase that, TIL: \'\'Kara no Kyoukai sucks hairy ballz\'\'.- 37:19 Why exactly is she trusting him with all this free info? He\'s just a random stranger asking drug dealer suspicious questions. Oh right, same reason as above. .- 37:42 Oh! Oh! Lipreading time! Hei...sen...berg!- 43:00 Action scenes have been feeling weightless for a while, like nothing is at stake anymore. I guess that\'s what happens when writer calls back his shots, like that artificial arm deal, and especially the \'\'bringing characters back from the dead\'\' part. Why should I care if protagonist gets cut or killed when I know it won\'t matter? Why should I care if antagonist gets cut or killed when I\'ve been watching people cut up and kill people, and far worse, for hours and hours already, since it\'s practically what the show is about. This is a serious problem.- 48:00-56:44 To many ridiculous stuff to keep count.- 1:12:28 Jack...pot! ...I\'ll show myself out.- 1:20:30 We\'re really hammering in this idea that murder takes away one\'s humanity aren\'t we. How about hammering in the idea of smoking murdering your lungs? Since, I mean, there\'s about as many cigars smoked in this show as there are murderers, and just as viscerally. It\'s a show about smoking and murdering at this point.- 1:23:43 ...man... if anyone ever needed a shower...- 1:24:30 \'\'This how you sex right? I\'m no longer virgin right? Right?!\'\'- 1:27:15 And here we go again calling back punches using random fantasy magic. Now I won\'t even care the next time someone starts salivating all over someone else.- 1:29:10 And now drugs are also magic, why did I expect that not to be the case? I can almost hear the writer thinking \'\'my ignorance about drugs is hereby redeemed!\'\'- 1:31:08 \'\'10 times more potent than pot, you\'ll die if you don\'t do anything about it\'\' Ok this is officially so bad it\'s good again.

Even if it kills you!- 1:34:18 I\'m not buying it until I see his head on a stick. Actually I\'m not buying it even if I see his head on a stick.- 1:50:00 \'\'I won\'t let you go as long as I live\'\', he meant to say kiss.Well that was a pretty epilogue, beautifully contrasted to the rest of the show.

The other 6 movies were great but this was boring from start to finish and the ""heroes\'s message"" is really really childish and does not ring at all with rest of the series. BravoThe investigation is really dragged out and it seems like the hours will go by and nothing will happen, only for the very distasteful and childish climax where people are forced to hear the same ""no violence EVER"" message that artworks seem to rely when they can\'t think of anything better and with actual substance.I think I will try to forget this...chapter in Kara no Kyoukai existed, but that will be as hard as watching this movie, as this is supposed to be climax we were building towards. How did the autor feel this was better than Araya\'s story? Sure it\'s more personal to the protagonist and less shounen-ish, but it\'s really really bad. chapter in Kara no Kyoukai existed, but that will be as hard as watching this movie, as this is supposed to be climax we were building towards.

I'm not really going to touch on the artwork, animation, or the sound. Beautiful stuff as usual.One of the core mysteries of the series is the question of Shiki's involvement in the multiple gruesome murders that took place 4 years before the events of this film. The main focus of this film is the culmination of this plot-line and I think for the most part it's handled really well. Even now as the final entry in the series, the movie takes its time...and allows the viewer to make their own connections between the tidbits of information that are laid out piece by piece. And as deliberate as the pacing can be, it all leads up to an awesome and very satisfying climax and conclusion. Pretty much all the loose ends are tied up, Shiki has a fine character arc, and I was (mostly) satisfied with how the events played out. Despite all of this, there's some pretty silly elements of the film that bog it down a bit, namely the parts having to do with drugs. I also couldn't help but feel an undercurrent of dissatisfaction with the emotional foundation of this film, that is, the moral conflict between Kokutou and Shiki. In the interest of avoiding spoilers, I'm not going to get into it too much, but the reasoning for their conflict just feels inconsistent in light of the 5th film and much frustrating drama could have easily been avoided. Honestly, I'm just going to chalk it up to Nasu contradicting himself like he usually does. Still, I overall really enjoyed their intimate relationship and how they play off one another.This leads me towards the characters and the dialogue of the film. There seems to a be a common thread throughout many Type-Moon works, and that is of characters being the embodiment of extremes. From Araya and Kokutou, and from Kiritsugu to Sakura, many embody some extreme personality trait or ideal, and their dilemmas often stem from how they reconcile these traits or ideals with the harsh reality around them. Personally, I'm somewhere in the middle for these types of characters. They can certainly be interesting, but they often stretch my suspension of disbelief and can really try my patience. Shiki is great however and one of my favorite characters. She's complex and mysterious but not just for contrived mystery's sake, there's very real and understandable reasons why she acts the way she does. I also just really love the way she handles her business, she's definitely got major style. However, I feel like I enjoyed the character interactions in the other films a bit more than this one, partly because of the dialogue, which was pretentious at times. I was more forgiving towards the other films because despite how overwrought the dialogue could be, it was still generally very interesting. However, they really do lay it on a bit too thick for this one. Indeed, there's like a five minute philosophical discussion on the difference between murder and slaughter and I swear my eyes rolled all the way back into my skull.Despite all my complaints, this is definitely a quality film, and I feel like the Kara no Kyoukai series is a quality watch, especially so if you like moody and atmospheric anime. Especially Paradox Spiral, which after a needed re-watch is now one of my favorite films ever. It's also a good watch if you're even a casual fan of Type-Moon, as it lays down the foundation for a lot of the important lore and concepts that came later. and allows the viewer to make their own connections between the tidbits of information that are laid out piece by piece.

However, it being a story with various intriguing concepts is undeniable. First and foremost, this is a very dialogue heavy show – minimal action, plenty of talking. In addition, the show also starts rather slowly; it takes quite a while for the scenes to set up. Thus it is not surprising that some may find it insipid. Hence, unlike other Fantasy/Magic series, Kara no Kyoukai is not about Magic in the manner of casting spells and fighting, it is more concerned with the inner workings. Nasu seems...to love giving details about how Magic work, though this is more prominent when playing the visual novels of Tsukihime and Fate Stay/Night than reading the novel or watching the movies for Kara no Kyoukai.One key aspect that made it engaging is the narrative style. I have a soft spot for shows done in anachronistic order and since this only consists of seven movies, it's not that confusing to piece the events and timeline together. Also presenting the story in a non-chronological manner helps enhancing the mood of mystery throughout the show. The ending is cliché but this is probably one of those cases where it is the most appropriate way to end it. Indeed, I might add that it is the perfect way to end.From this work, we can certainly see some of the various prototypes that will later become part of the now already famous works of TYPE-Moon. My one qualm with TYPE-Moon's works however, is that they all contain a certain level of rather dark, explicit elements. Sure, it is one thing that the works are intended for older audience to begin with, but it is another thing to have Magic, and generally Magus (Magicians) being portrayed as unpleasant in nature– I'm not really a fan of shows with elements of gore.[Characters: 8.0] Ryouggi Shiki herself is an unexpectedly beguiling character. Her development from a sociopath with nihilistic tendencies to a, well, someone with more emotion is excellently explored, particularly in the 5th and 7th movie. The characters in TYPE-Moon verse tend to have overpowered abilities, of which characters like Shiki possessed plenty potential for abuse. Yet, there are little of those, for her abilities are used mostly as plot points rather than deus ex machina for the plot to progress. If anything, Shiki’s ability is probably what made Kara no Kyoukai senjoyable. Because, once again, as mentioned unlike most magic series, Kara no Kyoukai is more interested in the metaphorical interpretation than the literal fanciful explosion.Nevertheless, in terms of its characters, this show is relatively weak. Other than Shiki, the characters are rather lacking in personality or rather, development of their personalities. While it is true that Mikiya is supposed to play the part of the normal guy (and morality pet for Shiki), he really is too bland.[Art: 10.0] Naturally, the art is superb. While I don’t recommend people to watch this series of movies if they’re looking for action-based shows, the fight sequences themselves are short but incredibly well executed. For a story heavy on symbolism, visual quality has thus become more of a prerequisite. Hence, the filming technique is expectedly one of the strong points of this show, with elements such as environmental symbolism helping to create the image that is simultaneously beautiful, whimsical and haunting, while the choreography and the way the camera angles are directed gives some of the scenes a more dynamic feel.[Music: 10.0] Needless to say, with Yuki Kajiura behind the scores, the music featured are nothing short of fantastic. The music flows well with the show, reflecting the various melancholic setting perfectly. And Shiki’s battle Theme is addictive. Kalafina, being a band formed by Yuki Kajiura herself along with some members of Fiction Junction, carried on several of its signature styles.[Summary] Naturally, Kara no Kyoukai is not recommended simply for anyone. Aside from the fact it is a rather dark show with a fair amount of gore and other mature themes (some of which contained rather graphic details), this is a show that is more concerned with delivering a story than showcasing action. With that said, this is worth the watch.Personal Overall Rating: 9.0 to love giving details about how Magic work, though this is more prominent when playing the visual novels of Tsukihime and Fate Stay/Night than reading the novel or watching the movies for Kara no Kyoukai.One key aspect that made it engaging is the narrative style.

Can\'t believe I managed to watch most of the movies without feeling bored. I never even thought of dropping KnK because they were so good.(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)[Story]: (9.5/10) (SPOILERS)The 7th movie of the Kara no Kyoukai series now takes place a month after the events of the 6th KnK. Shiki has awoken from her coma and is now living her new life. During this time, a series of murders are occurring after 4 years of silence. Shiki launches an investigation and searches...for the suspect. Meanwhile, Mikiya launches an investigation on his own.I seriously had high hopes that the this movie will beat the 5th movie out of the water but unfortunately, it didn\'t. Don\'t take this the wrong way. I still love the 7th movie and I think it\'s a great finale to the KnK series but it didn\'t have that......vibe... that made the 5th movie a perfect one.The pacing of the first half is extremely slow. It wasn\'t until the 2nd half where the plot finally gets moving at a normal pace. I gotta admit though, I do love the interaction between the main characters at the first half.There were scenes in the movie that, again, I found disturbing. This time, Shiki was being raped and it\'s not as explicit as the 3rd movie. At this point, I was hoping that Mikiya comes to the rescue but my god was he slow. Not a very useful boyfriend if you ask me.The ending of the movie was great and satisfying but I was expecting a kiss. I mean, they are a couple right? What a pity. I guess a hug will do.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Art/Animation]: (10/10)This is my final review for the KnK series so I guess I\'ll just write the same thing like I did with my past review of the animation.The animation is perfect, it\'s very well done, and it\'s visually stunning. As of right now, I don\'t think any company can beat ufotable in terms of visuals and animation. Just like the previous movies, the character movements and the fighting scenes are fluid.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Sound]: (9/10)The soundtrack wasn\'t as great as the 5th movie but I still love the background themes and the battle themes. The ending theme is ""Seventh Heaven"" by Kalafina. I was quite disappointed that the song didn\'t really stand out like the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 6th movie ending did but I still like the song. All the VA\'s are still the same and they have done their jobs very well.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Characters]: (9/10) (SPOILERS)No new characters were introduced for this movie but what we get is more focus on Mikiya and Shiki. Truth be told, it\'s more focused on Shiki and I\'m glad they did that. They finally explained and showed us exactly how Shiki got involved in an accident and why she or rather, ""he"" got hit by a car. We also learn a lot more about Shiki and her ""murderous lust"". Notice the quotation marks? Mikiya and Shiki\'s relationship was also shown here and it shows that they pretty much care for each other. Not the best relationship(compared to other romance I\'ve seen) but it\'s satisfying enough to watch.The antagonist of the movie is Lio Shirazumi, an asshole who has a crush on Shiki and he even proceeds to rape her. I still liked Araya as the villain of the series. I just don\'t like this villain, to be honest.I just find it a bit disappointing that Touko is taking a backseat on this film. Her use of magus power would have been interesting to see but she\'s literally just sitting on her office and smokes like usual.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Enjoyment]: (9/10)I would be lying if I said that I perfectly enjoyed this film. Compared to the 5th film which balanced dialogue and action, this film is mostly them talking. I still managed to listen all the way through but the lack of action really bothered me.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[OVERALL]: (9.1/10)This was a fitting end to the Kara no Kyoukai series. It may not be better than the 5th movie but this movie is placed on my Top 3 favorite KnK movies. 5th being the first one and this film on second place. for the suspect. Meanwhile, Mikiya launches an investigation on his own.I seriously had high hopes that the this movie will beat the 5th movie out of the water but unfortunately, it didn\'t. Don\'t take this the wrong way. I still love the 7th movie and I think it\'s a great finale to the KnK series but it didn\'t have that......vibe... that made the 5th movie a perfect one.The pacing of the first half is extremely slow. It wasn\'t until the 2nd half where the plot finally gets moving at a normal pace. I gotta admit though, I do love the interaction between the main characters at the first half.There were scenes in the movie that, again, I found disturbing. This time, Shiki was being raped and it\'s not as explicit as the 3rd movie. At this point, I was hoping that Mikiya comes to the rescue but my god was he slow. Not a very useful boyfriend if you ask me.The ending of the movie was great and satisfying but I was expecting a kiss. I mean, they are a couple right? What a pity. I guess a hug will do.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Art/Animation]: (10/10)This is my final review for the KnK series so I guess I\'ll just write the same thing like I did with my past review of the animation.The animation is perfect, it\'s very well done, and it\'s visually stunning. As of right now, I don\'t think any company can beat ufotable in terms of visuals and animation. Just like the previous movies, the character movements and the fighting scenes are fluid.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Sound]: (9/10)The soundtrack wasn\'t as great as the 5th movie but I still love the background themes and the battle themes. The ending theme is ""Seventh Heaven"" by Kalafina. I was quite disappointed that the song didn\'t really stand out like the 1st, 4th, 5th, and 6th movie ending did but I still like the song. All the VA\'s are still the same and they have done their jobs very well.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Characters]: (9/10) (SPOILERS)No new characters were introduced for this movie but what we get is more focus on Mikiya and Shiki. Truth be told, it\'s more focused on Shiki and I\'m glad they did that. They finally explained and showed us exactly how Shiki got involved in an accident and why she or rather, ""he"" got hit by a car. We also learn a lot more about Shiki and her ""murderous lust"". Notice the quotation marks? Mikiya and Shiki\'s relationship was also shown here and it shows that they pretty much care for each other. Not the best relationship(compared to other romance I\'ve seen) but it\'s satisfying enough to watch.The antagonist of the movie is Lio Shirazumi, an asshole who has a crush on Shiki and he even proceeds to rape her. I still liked Araya as the villain of the series. I just don\'t like this villain, to be honest.I just find it a bit disappointing that Touko is taking a backseat on this film. Her use of magus power would have been interesting to see but she\'s literally just sitting on her office and smokes like usual.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[Enjoyment]: (9/10)I would be lying if I said that I perfectly enjoyed this film.

It may not be better than the 5th movie but this movie is placed on my Top 3 favorite KnK movies. 5th being the first one and this film on second place.', ""When I reviewed the first Kara no Kyoukai film, I thought that would be the end of it. I had no intention of continuing through the other six, but I changed my mind because the fan base was surprisingly cool and reasonable. I'm glad I did because the next five films ranged from decent to really superb. This week let's look at the seventh film in the series, Kara no Kyoukai 7: Satsujin Kousatsu (Kou).Story:Japan's been experiencing a series of grisly murders with scattered body parts being left mutilated and strewn about. For Kokutou Mikiya, the incidents remind him of the series of murders...four years ago. The ones that Shiki's now dead second personality seems to have been responsible for. To make matters worse, Shiki is acting strange and disappears from her apartment without leaving any way to contact her. Mikiya heads for the area where the crimes have been occurring to investigate the incident. He'll find more than he bargains for as he seeks answers.Let's start with my issues with the film. The first, and more minor gripe, is that this film uses a lot of flashbacks. While it's obvious that they're being used to connect this film and the second more intimately, they also go overboard with it, spending more time with the flashbacks than they need to. My big gripe with the film, however, is with the philosophising. The film makes an effort to comment on the nature of killing. The problem is that its commentary is overly simplistic and really not well thought out. Basically, the answer we get is that murder is done when someone's emotions for another person overflow and need an outlet and that slaughter happens when a being that no longer qualifies as human kills a bunch of people. Really? Because I'd love to see where people who kill in self defence land. Soldiers, for that matter. Someone who kills a relative, not because of any feelings they harbour towards that relative, but because they stand to inherit money, where do they fall? How about Asagami Fujino from the third film? You may remember her as the one who completely justifiably killed a bunch of guys. She wasn't inhuman, nor did the film's narrative treat her as such. If anything the rapist bastards she killed were inhuman. This philosophy is bollocks and yet the film treats it as though it's profound and significant.Moving on to the positives, the film is really well paced and it excels at building tension. The first third is dedicated to Mikiya's investigation and then it proceeds very naturally from there. The story, overall, is really well done with mystery and suspense elements that work really effectively. The climax is really good working on multiple levels. There are also some skilfully done creepy moments, particularly towards the end. The film also brings several plot threads from the prior six films to their own resolutions and does that really well. The romantic tension between Mikiya and Shiki being the one that gets the most focus.Characters:One thing this film is really good about is building off of the characterisation from the prior films. One of the positive aspects of the flashbacks is that we get to see where the characters were when this whole affair began and how they've developed since. There are some really strong character moments for both Shiki and Mikiya. There's not as much with Touko and Azaka but the stuff that Touko does get is really good. If anything, the weakness here is Azaka since she shows up for all of one scene and only slightly contributes to Touko's character arc. Aside from that she does bugger all.Art:The artwork and animation are as stunning as ever. Ufotable does a stellar job at using the artwork to build the atmosphere in this. When they want to show something disturbing, it looks really disturbing. When they want to show an amazing & intense action sequence, they deliver an amazing and intense action sequence. When they just want to draw a background, they give you a really detailed and impressive background.Sound:There's a strong cast in this. Suzumura Kenichi, Sakamoto Maaya, Honda Takako and Hoshi Soichiro all give strong performances. The music is really good and atmospheric as well.Ho-yay:Really isn't any in this.Final Thoughts:Kara no Kyoukai 7: Satsujin Kousatsu (Kou) is actually a really good film. There are certainly issues with it and there are some things that could have been better, but the story and characters are still really well done and accompanied by some really strong vocal performances and artwork. My final rating on this one is going to be an 8/10. Next week I'm looking at a series that was requested quite a while ago, Kyattou Ninden Teyandee. So, join me in looking at a series intended for children. four years ago. The ones that Shiki's now dead second personality seems to have been responsible for.

Very wordy and not enough action.Show passion, like you really mean it. ', ""This review is on Kara no Kyoukai as a whole as well as the final episode. I wasn't sure what to expect when first starting these movies, but after watching the first I was hooked. Each movie was unique while still having its own purpose to the true full story. Each story grew and began to place the puzzle pieces. Speaking to the final movie it was in my opinion the best of the series. It expanded finally on the relationship between the characters and tied up the loose ends and gave the viewers some closure as well as letting us see the true nature...of the characters. While having both sadness and joy at the end the viewer is left exhaling with relief that this mind bending ride is over but happy at the conclusion given to the characters. They finally can be at peace.The series itself was very dark and intense, but served a purpose more than just blood and gore. This was a look into moral values and the nature of people. It showed people who fight to do what's right, people who fight to stay away from their fears and nature and people who give up on life and give in to evil. This is a story all its own and was filled of mixed emotions to the viewers. At times you were happy, then the next moment you were disgusted, not to mention confused for much of it.I must say the art in the story was spot on. The colors were fantastic, a very dark story filled with spots of color gave a dramatic feel to the situations when needed. of the characters.

After finishing the fantastic ""Fate stay/night"" series i stumbled upon one of  it´s original creator Kinoko Nasu´s other work and decided to give ""Kara no Kyoukai"" (The Garden of Sinners) a go. This review will not only cover this final 8th movie but the entire series.I watched it in the official order. If you are a first time watcher i would suggest you do the same thing. You can then go back and watch it all in chronological order during a potential...rewatch.My ranking for the movies goes as follows (Note that the number in brackets signifies the official watch order suggested by the author himself) :1. A study in murder - part 2    (7)2. Remaining sense of pain       (3)3. Paradox spiral                      (5)4. Oblivion recording                 (6)5. A study in murder - part 1    (2)6. Overlooking view                  (1)7. The hollow shrine                  (4)Story - 7/10First of i got to say that this is one of the most unique and interesting concepts for a story i have ever seen. It manages to thematize things like murder, multiple personality disorder, sexual  abuse and drug addiction in a way that i´ve never seen another show do it. The supernatural elements are continiously beeing woven into the narrative giving the series a very heavy psychological feeling during it´s entire run. However the problem that i have to adress here is the way the show communicates information to the viewer. There were lots of things left unexplained or just simply glossed over that would have been vital information later. The pacing also seems off because some of the movies are simply a string of conversations and dialogue (Movie 2) while others can be described as full on action-packed rides (Movie 5). There are also issues with the tone of the story. Sometimes it´s all happy and funny for one movie, and the next one introduces a new horrible psychological issue. However i do plan to read the original novels that this show is based off, mainly because i think a lot of explanation might have been lost during the adaptation. That means my opinion on the story can change wildly in the future.Animation - 9/10This is the category that Kara no Kyoukai exceeds most of the anime of it´s time. Ufotable did an amazing job at conveying the cold, dark atmosphere of the story through their animation. The character designs are unique and memorable. Where the show really shines is during it´s fight scenes. The creative way the camera is used makes every fight unique and the effects animation makes every use of magic a treat to the eye. Of course ufotable developed as a studio and has improved wildly up until today but it was really interesting to see where it all began.Music - 9/10The music was outstanding. It mixes the energetic songs during the fight scenes with the eerie and dark tones of the rest of the show seemlessly.There was never a moment where the music felt out of place, which is admirable considering the weird tone shifts during the story. After this show, composer Yuki Kajiura would go on to make amazing soundtracks for other shows like Sword Art Online and Fate/Zero.Characters - 9/10The star of the show is definitely the main heroine Shiki Ryougi. Her development over the course of the show was outstanding and she quickly became one of my favorite characters  (I currently use her on my profile picture :D). The change of her psyche and her multiple personalities make for very interesting dialogue and her banter with Mikiya Kokuto was always a treat to watch. The other characters, while not beeing developed as much, where also interesting. Aozaki was a ton of fun and although many might disagree with me, i enjoyed the character of Azaka Kokuto very much.Enjoyment - 7/10Watching this show was a very unique experience. The different problemes i had with the pacing and tone are apparent though. Also be prepared for some heavy psychological drama, blood  and sexual themes. If you are just an average shounen fan who likes fast paced action and sport shows, this series of movies is not for you. I would recommend this to everyone who likes deep psychological stories with a lot of dialogue and metaphors.I will review the original novels after i read them- Marco YoooFINAL SCORE - 8/10 rewatch.My ranking for the movies goes as follows (Note that the number in brackets signifies the official watch order suggested by the author himself) :1.

I do think though my thoughts a certain amount of weight, not going to say in truth because this medium is Very subjective. Now onto the actual movie Kara No Kyoukai/Garden of Sinners as a movie series (except movie 6 that movie is doodoo garbage) and they all form a cohesive journey of the main protagonist who has become my favorite protagonist of all time which I shall explain later. This is the conclusion to Kara No Kyoukai and everything after is an epilogue but I digress...they should all be watched and taken into account (except 6 cause fuck that movie) as the whole story. Kara No Kyoukai to go into detail is bleak and dark there is no sugar coating what happens in these movies drug use, gore, sexual harassment and assault as well as the R word (don\'t want to trigger anyone) so do not watch this if you are sensitive to these things. Now while Kara No Kyoukai is dark, and bleak there was always that one character who always made me hope for the best. Shiki Ryougi is that character who gave me hope within this story of her being able to find herself and her place within the world and this movie reaches that answer.Quick summary of the storyMurders are happening all over again just like before Shiki was run over a car 4 years ago and she must figure out who in order to save herself from the temptations of wanting to kill.Shiki Ryougi (MAJOR SPOILERS FORWARNING)I know I should talk about the other character and while I do like most of them I think personally this story is more about Shiki more than anyone else within the 7th movie. Shiki still suffering to an extent from her loss of her other personality is still trying to find her place in this world and the reason to keep on going. She wonders what it means to her to life without this part of herself that she used to always have and really the only one she had until Kokutou came into her life. These murders from the same killer spark that idea that she once had that if she can\'t find herself in a normal way maybe she a bad person maybe she\'s a killer just like that murder thus she goes out to find him, she\'s very loss in this movie never knowing really what to do or who Shiki Ryougi really is under that cold exterior shell. A lost soul who does not know what her purpose or why she exist. However Shiki comes towards the end of the movie that she is someone who will improve herself to be a better version of Shiki as well as become the person who she wants to be, and that she never really wanted to kill someone in the first place she was just trying to find a purpose some way. However for a moment that comes all crashing down when she\'s told Kokutou was killed she then becomes even more lost at that moment and then gives up, She kills and in that instance she blames herself for everything that happened all the problems in the other movies all the deaths, she places all that blame on herself and simply lies there in the snow. Kokutou is alive thought and knows while Shiki couldn\'t forgive that man for ""killing"" Kokutou she still did it and she still gave up. Thus we get to my favorite scene from all these movies combined the cold act drops and Shiki shows how vulnerable she truly to the person she loves, she never wanted to kill someone deep down inside she just wanted to find her place in the world, and Kokutou assures her she still can she always has been a good person underneath that cold exterior she just didn\'t want to accept it and thus she begins to cry. Shiki is my favorite protagonist cause of her journey in how she finally finds out who she is and it\'s really stuck to me personally in how well its done. I love this character her finally reaching the end of her journey to finally realize who she is one of my favorites of all time.Literally everything else.Ufotable animation is top tier even back in 2009. The soundtrack for this movie is one of my all time favorites and the main theme is beautiful and epic. Side characters are good for how they setup the story and their personality. camera work and direction are superb and really where it started for other studio\'s to pick up the quality of their camera work.VerdictThis is definitely not for everyone, this is a dark and bleak series all around and you really need to pay attention to all the dialogue (except movie 6 lol fuck you movie 6) to understand characters and motivations since this is a heavy dialogue driven series. But underneath that cold dark exterior there\'s a nice warm story about a lost girl trying to find herself. they should all be watched and taken into account (except 6 cause fuck that movie) as the whole story.

Mikiya wants to think that this alleged ""Homicidal Maniac"" is not his love, but she has no other explanation to support that notion. After a few days, Shiki becomes unreachable.Did Shiki begin to accept her murderous intentions at this point? Her desire to commit murder? What connection do these most recent killings have to her lost memories?Another ""movie"" in the series, however, this one is a little bit of a stretch...compared to part 5. There are a lot of empty pauses between dialogues that have no purpose other than to fill the silence. The film\'s final hour, or around 50 percent of the film, just drags on a lot which is a bit boring.Now leaving that aside, this film is completely focused on three characters.""I can kill anything that exists, even if it\'s a God"". - ShikiA lonesome, quite fearless, and badass knife/sword-wielding heroine who shows quite psychotic behavior throughout the entire series. While most of the series portrays her as nothing more than an unstoppable force (aka a 14-year-old definition of a \'Good female character\'), this film flips on its head, and I\'m talking about part 3 levels of flips, and probably even more graphic than that film. After regaining her memories, she becomes imprisoned in a bubble of misery where she is forced to confront her past and guilt, that she has a desire for murder. And the one that makes her face this is,""Yeah, a homicidal maniac"". - LioHe makes a very forgettable appearance in part 2 and in the post-credits of part 6. Lio is a personification of what Shiki thinks of herself about her past self, though a tad bit exaggerated. He\'s no different from a clichéd predator-type villain, making him the least compelling antagonist in this series. His awakening is also somewhat basic; he merely receives Shiki\'s rejection and physically goes bonkers for her. And unlike, all other films, the antagonist actually prevails in this entry. Lio is meant to question Shiki, that he and she are just a bunch of murderers. He wants her to approve of that, and she basically does that by killing Lio in the end, becoming the very murderer she constantly rejects to be. Quite the irony really. What sets this otherwise tragic story into a not-so-tragic or you could even say beautiful is our hero.""I\'ll bear your sin in your place"". - MikiyaHe\'s one of the most intriguingly written \'normal\' guys for such a dark story. On the surface, he\'s the kind of guy who hates crimes but not criminals, the stereotypical kind, dense, and basic guy, but oftentimes throughout the story, he\'s shown not to be the case. There are moments depending on the way he reacts to certain situations that just make you question his sanity. His normalcy and weird love are what save Shiki throughout her life and give her hope that she can achieve that normal life. Though this consistency in his writing gets a bit sloppy in the end.He warns Shiki that if she kills, he won\'t forgive her, and in the end, she does. However, despite the fact that the harm had already been done, it was never given much attention. ""What are the consequences? Did Mikiya force her to atone for her sin? Did Mikiya consider that hearing about his death was what forced her to kill him?"" The film was more interested in providing this Cherry-blossom scene between two lovers and ending on a very joyful note than it was in providing answers to questions. It\'s good, but I\'m not completely satisfied (Maybe these get answered in the epilogue).The dialogue in the entire series is one aspect that has generated a bit of controversy. There will be several instances where the strange dialogue that frequently becomes philosophized will force you to repeatedly rewind the sequences. The conversation will truly be the deciding factor in whether or not this series succeeds, as I stated in my part 5 review. The series explores various topics and concepts, like mortality, death, and human nature, and provides enough ethically ambiguous characters for you to wrap your head around, yet more than often, it just complicates a straightforward concept with odd word choice. Like when Shiki says ""She killed her arm"" instead of ""She lost"", ""She broke"" or ""She tore,"" in part 3, and its odd word choices like these that turn off a lot of people. It\'s stunning and consistently well-animated from a production standpoint, with some excellent directing and foreshadowing.Though there are other entries as well, this film is pretty much the closure for everything in this series, with some minor loose ends.The series is certainly not for everyone because of its foundation upon disturbing themes and imagery (this doesn\'t matter to you, does it?), a pretty confusing narrative, and oddly philosophical and confusing dialogue that can make it very hard to sit through. It, however, has solid production and animation with a very cool aesthetic that can easily provoke interest. If that\'s all you want, the series has more than enough in store.The watch order I followed is the chronological order, 2-4-3-1-5-6-7. I\'m not really sure how the release order works but I heard the release order makes it more confusing which in turn makes it a tad bit more interesting as well. You are free to decide. compared to part 5. There are a lot of empty pauses between dialogues that have no purpose other than to fill the silence. The film\'s final hour, or around 50 percent of the film, just drags on a lot which is a bit boring.Now leaving that aside, this film is completely focused on three characters.""I can kill anything that exists, even if it\'s a God"". - ShikiA lonesome, quite fearless, and badass knife/sword-wielding heroine who shows quite psychotic behavior throughout the entire series. While most of the series portrays her as nothing more than an unstoppable force (aka a 14-year-old definition of a \'Good female character\'), this film flips on its head, and I\'m talking about part 3 levels of flips, and probably even more graphic than that film. After regaining her memories, she becomes imprisoned in a bubble of misery where she is forced to confront her past and guilt, that she has a desire for murder.

An that it delves you deeper into provocative thinking.the relationship of Shiki an Mikiya has always kept me thinking what is going to happen at the end of 7th movie?*slight spoiler alert*I don't know if anybody here got a euphoria watching this anime like i did.In all the violence,gore, and mystery when you peel the onion away it is still a love story,but it was all brought to that one...moment at the end of the movie that made you root for Mikiya that he can make it, he can do it you can feel his struggle an emotions, it almost had the same feeling in Samarai X that embrace an longing.I wont give anything away but it was quite a shocker,an you`ll go threw this roller-coaster ride all to see the ending. An a good hint watch everything even after the credits stop rolling because you`ll get a nice completed ending .The music was nicely knitted into the fabric of the atmosphere the scenery was mostly dark an low lit ambiance. the antagonistic personality's of Shiki an Mikiya come full plight you have one conclusion in your mind but it ends up being different in the end that not all is what it seems.Everything makes more sense when you see this movie questions that you had in the previous ones are answered threw flashbacks.

Overall i must say i simply loved it"", 'That was a great conclusion to the series, KnK 5 is the peak of the plot and KnK 7 is the peak of emotions and development for both Shiki and Mikiya. This series is not for everyone, at first I thought I wouldn\'t like it. But now, it has become one of my favorite anime. Each individual movie range from good to mediocre, but Movie 5 and 7 are amazing. As a whole, I think KnK has a solid character driven story.The plot is nothing wow, it\'s just a bunch of murders starting to come back and taunt the main character to get consumed by...her unstable murderous impulse. This movie has a very fitting villain that act as a contrast to Shiki, not as interesting as Araya but still served his role very well. But what I love about this movie is how the story developed Shiki and Mikiya relationship. Shiki is murderous and Mikiya is too kind & naive.No other normal man would probably spend their time with a girl like Shiki who is mentally unstable, doesn\'t talk too much, and can probably kill you at any moment. But Mikiya accept her as who she is, he keeps believing in her and turns out he is right. This movie confirmed that Shiki has only killed one person which was Araya who is considered by the main villain of this movie as an inhuman, not a human. All those four murders was done by someone else to tempted Shiki\'s murderous impulse. On the other side, Mikiya is very positive and too kind to the point he is called dumb by Shiki herself. Shiki is not the only imperfect human being in the story, Mikiya can also be counted as one. His too positive attitude will only get himself killed. Shiki\'s sharp instinct will protect Mikiya from all the danger and Mikiya\'s kindness will hold Shiki from getting murderous. They are the opposite of each other and complete each other, their dynamic are amazing in my eyes.This movie also gave more insight to ""origin"". Shiki\'s origin is nothingness just like Araya and movie 8 mentioned, therefore she sees everything meaningless and seek the death of it. The main villain of this movie surrendered to his origin and used it as an excuse to justify his crime while Shiki manage to resist it. We should accept our origin but that doesn\'t define who we are in the present. Shiki did it by letting Mikiya enter her life, she can finally live a normal life.Shiki is such a great character. The other characters like Enjou, Fujino, Araya, and Touko was also done quite well. Some characters lack more fleshed out, but overall I really enjoy it. her unstable murderous impulse.

199,"[""Karuta! Arata! Taichi? K-karuta!!Twenty five more episodes worth of charming romance and competitive karuta fun? Yes please. But don't expect a balance between the two; there's more latter quantity than the former, and whether you should be satisfied or not is up to your preference!Who expected, or even acknowledged beforehand, that the true presence of competitive karuta would be ever so fierce and exciting from its outline? Well, I sure certainly didn't when I started from season one. Karuta is more of a complicated sport than popular ones such as baseball and basketball, and the entirety of season one teaches that it requires much more...than just reaction timing and memorization to win against other players. I enjoyed season one thoroughly, but watching karuta itself doesn't just hold its exciting entertainment factor by itself; there's a much larger insightful fulfillment that keeps its presence in each and every match. It's certainly more complicated than just slapping cards in front of people.And that's what the second season is all about: Karuta, karuta, karuta! Chihayafuru 2 is a direct sequel to its previous entry, Chihaya and her team now in second year of high school. Chihaya is determined to, not only win the individual matches tournament upcoming to earn the Queen title, but to win the team tournament too, as well as establishing more members for the Mizusawa Karuta Club. It sounds difficult, and possibly silly considering it's still studying period, but this is Chihaya we're talking about; the pretty tomboy with a mind of karuta and karuta only. Who's going to stop her?Despite being a direct sequel in terms of story, it does have its noticeable differences. Hardly any distinct features are involved mind; it's more of taking a step up on its previous features that made Chihayafuru for what it is. The central feature of the second season is the sight of karuta matches itself. If you wished for much more screen time on people competing in karuta from the first season, then you'll be delighted to know that your wish has be gracefully granted. If you're for the romance and sweet relationships though, as well as full development between the childhood friends Chihaya, Arata and Taichi, then you might be a little more unfortunate than Taichi himself.The execution of each specific karuta match are all intense as ever. I'd say that probably more than half of the entire season covers the moments of the involvement of karuta matches, and without its sole execution the series wouldn't have been as exciting throughout. Its execution is graceful yet powerful, as well as being a little in-depth in its playful manner, from thought processes of the players themselves to tackling particular cards pronounced from the reader. Some scenes, preferably the opponents winning their cards against one another, can be striking in a single movement, maybe even breath-taking. The careful use of atmosphere and enthusiasm of winning or playing makes use of, and surpasses, the original Chihayafuru style from the first season. With the accompany of animation and the soundtrack, as well as different sorts of techniques and tactics used from each and every player, the passion and spirit created from these matches are very sensational whilst keeping the original, youthful atmosphere of the series.But karuta isn't all just intensity in its matches. Season two explores the sport in a more exhaustive manner than the former season, and not just directly but indirectly too. Karuta is exciting because of the players themselves, but not solely because of their different levels of skill, style and tactics; it's more so as to why they're playing in the first place. Motivation, determination, pleasure, teamwork, whether its for a special someone or a particular goal, is all present in the characters of Chihayafuru. And karuta itself explores the different reasonings for lots of different players involved in the matches, which branches up the pasts and difficulties those characters have inside themselves. Realization can succeed to develop a character in a flowing manner, and that, despite it being a win or a lost, they learn something precious and important for their lives by their opponents.It's the reason why this season, or the entirety of the series in this case, are filled with a great amount of extremely heart warming and tear worthy scenes. You'd love to cheer on one of the characters, like Chihaya, in a match to achieve her dreams, but that can't be entirely the case when the determination and reasoning of the opponent is involved too. Even when one seems in a tight or hopeless situation, you know how slump you're going to feel if the lost is given instead of a win. The motivation for each characters, even and especially side characters, are real. They're hardly one dimensional, and the match doesn't only determine if one has won or lost, but if their hard work and conviction has really paid off. The character's important speeches and actions boil down to karuta, even if slightly, and proves that the competitive sport has created a new light for these people; for something to devote and work towards to and be proud of it.It's a plus too that the characters are in a wide range of variety, in both their motivation and personality. I can say without doubt that every single main and side character are likable and interesting, or at least from my preference. Nevertheless, there's a good deal of depth spiraled in each character, and most aren't so evidential until later on. They appear as mere opponents, not cardboard cut-outs but ones you wouldn't actually feel for if they lose. To be likable or not, they have distinct tropes that creates their characters, which are also for comedic factors which is a plus. But when their matches start, their pasts and goals begins to establish, and despite rooting for the other opponent because you've spent more time with them, your understandings for the character gets established as well. I find that the characters of the series all play out with interesting personalities, mysterious or not, and that their love for karuta is evidentially taken care of, rather than just written on the spot.The series doesn't actually consists a whole load of content you'd expect from a two cour season. The speed of pacing is evidential throughout the series, as some matches can actually last longer than a episode or three. To consider it a problem in the fact that a little more content could've been included wouldn't be hugely anticipated, but it hardly is a problem if you consider wisely. Matches are, as explained earlier, made extremely well with a great deal of enjoyment factor, and the long scenes allows the different insights of each character to develop and to be explored. The pacing is necessary for this, as well as being able to build tension and anticipation on who would win or what will happen next. Though some of the matches can be predictable, the series focuses more on the depth of the players instead of the actual results itself, and plus it relies heavily on execution rather than shock factor, in which was a sensible decision to choose for a series like Chihayafuru.As for the romance side of Chihayafuru, season one definitely contains a bigger portion of it. That doesn't mean to say that this season doesn't consist of no romance, but unlike the first season there are no episodes that fully dedicate the love between Chihaya, Taichi and Arata. The story behind all this continues, but doesn't develop so much throughout the series, rather it's used effectively throughout the minds of the stated characters; which leads to the motivational stories behind them that connects them to karuta in the first place. For those who side for more karuta though, it's presented in a manner that doesn't greatly effect the drama and tension in the series, so enjoyment factor would hardly be bumped down because of the romance.Production values for the second season are not the greatest and grandest, although this is to be at least expected for 50 episodes altogether. However, animation is handled with great care and is used efficiently; both animation and sound are created well for the distinct atmosphere and style for Chihayafuru. Often, still shots are used for the usual swings and hits on the cards, but with great speed and accompany of sound and different textures of colours, as well as various effects in the scenes, it doesn't fail to look awkward or slow in any of them. Budget can look pale from far distances in shots, but when the more graceful or powerful scenes come along, the backgrounds and detail can look anything as beautiful with a fluffy aura or tension effect surrounding it, depending on the scene. It does this when necessary and makes the scenes even more memorable than it already was.The youthful atmosphere is also accompanied by a very expressive soundtrack, applying brand new songs as well as ones from the first season. They are often orchestrated with light instruments like piano and strings, though does consists of acoustic guitars, bass and drums, and even pipes, flutes and traditional drums comes in the soundtrack. It gives a wonderful personality for the actual series to use, and although most are light-hearted or light-weighted, they're used really effectively in contrast of its atmosphere. The volume is oriented carefully so that the sound effects makes the karuta matches a lot more practical and engrossing for the viewers, building up a better experience to watch.I'm glad series like Chihayafuru are still being aired. Produced by Madhouse and presented from the director of Cardcaptor Sakura, Chihayafuru manages to be an extremely enjoyable series with what it has to offer, not holding back with its execution on the theme of karuta. Anime doesn't necessarily need shock factor for a viewer to be surprised, and this series proves that execution is anything but less important than surprises. It's quite astonishing for me as to how much love I can express for a series I certainly didn't expect to ramble about, and especially one about a sport I have never heard of in my life until I started season one. It goes to show though that even such premises can contain a lot more potential than anime ideas that are more accessible for viewers, but fail to deliver because of its execution or lack of exploration in its concept.I don't regret starting Chihayafuru and its sequel; the only regret I'll have is not being able to play proper competitive karuta because I'm in the entirely wrong place. But at least Chihayafuru was a charming experience, and I hope it inspires even more people out in Japan to compete in karuta than season one already has. than just reaction timing and memorization to win against other players.

On the surface there is little that separates it from typical sports anime, from the focus on the team and team spirit to rivalries to tournament story arcs where you\'re typically served the main characters\' opponents\' motivations and reasons for participating in this sport. Through tears and joy we follow the main characters\' journey through the world of this sport,...and Chihayafuru very much follows this trend. As for the sport in question, the series focuses on a rather obscure (at least to a Western audience) card game known as karuta, where one has 25 cards with the first verse of poems on either side of the field, and as a reader reads the second verse of one of those poems, you have to remove the corresponding first-verse card from the playing field. The first to empty their side (25 cards) wins the game. A very coarse explanation but that\'s the gist of it.While it follows many of the traditional recipes for the sports genre, they are pulled off quite well in Chihayafuru, alleviating many of the issues doing so can present. It does in no way lift it off the ground and up to stardom, and if you are not a fan of sports anime to begin with, chances are you won\'t find Chihayafuru that very interesting. For the sports anime fan however, Chihayafuru offers a loveable and passionate experience, with some twists and differences. I already mentioned ""passion"" as a way to describe the series, and this is one of the aspects that sets it apart. From the at times striking visual and auditory imagery used - it is poetry after all - to the many ways of love for the sport that are presented, Chihayafuru delves deep into a world of passion, and while at times it seems a little too alien or cheesy how much of it the characters have for a single thing, it can also draw the viewer in and afflict them with a desire to do something they love, which is, at heart, what the sports anime genre is all about: Communicating passion and love for something.Another thing that sets Chihayafuru apart is that unlike most sports anime, which are made to appeal more to a shonen audience, it leans more towards the shojo genre, evident in its at times flowery animation and colour palette, and more significantly, in its larger focus on emotion and romance. It forgoes some of the most intense focus other sports series has on the game itself and rather focuses on the inner world of the characters and their emotions - the full spectrum of it, not just the ""I want to win""/""This is my motivation!"" portions that you are often limited to. Often you see characters cry significantly, in joy or sadness, in defeat and victory. The series also builds up a solid love triangle between the main characters, without really forcing its and in its treatment, as well as adding these feelings and moments of love to the secondary characters. Of course, with a large cast it\'s a near-inescapable fact that some side characters are more bland than others, relying mostly on a singular trait or two to provide comic relief or interaction, but for the characters that matter there are for the most part many layers and aspects presented - and developed - in an intriguing manner.Aesthetically Chihayafuru is stunning. The soundtrack builds up around the atmosphere very well, from the heart-warming to the bittersweet, from the passionate to the suspenseful. It applies a rich orchestral instrumentation that fits very well with the oft-poetic art and animation. Meticulous attention has been paid to the quality of the card reading, and listening to the voice actors\' performance in this regard is absolutely fantastic, especially for the most skilled readers in the series. Visually it frequently applies imagery as befitting of a series focusing on a game of poetry: The voice of a reader like sakura petals, the flow of a match like that of water, the flowery feeling of romance; such feelings are expressed visually and beautifully, though, as can be expected, some come across as more cheesy than others, but for the most part it is a boon rather than a detraction.When all comes to all, Chihayafuru definitely isn\'t a series for everyone. Karuta can come across as boring, the emotional layer as sappy or over the top to many sports anime fans, and for those who do not have a taste for sports anime in the first place, the story and the series\' focus can seem unappealing. To me, personally, the series is a heart-warming and moving story that spreads a lovely feeling of passion, filled with lovely aesthetic value and likeable characters. It very often brings a smile to my face, not necessarily because it is outright funny and makes me laugh, but because it warms me up on the inside. At times cheesy, yes, but far from such a degree it spoils the series. It presents a lovely and different sports anime that quickly has earned a spot as one of my favourite series. and Chihayafuru very much follows this trend.

Well, I mean in terms of not really being the best but to try your best. Then, you realize that you journey to success is a lot harder than you ever imagined it to be. There are obstacles such as competition, stress/anxiety, and other factors that can influence your path to that destination. However, there are some people who just loves to try in order to become the best of the best no matter what the outcomes are. For a certain young girl named Chihaya, the journey continues with this brand...new sequel by the name of Chihayafuru 2.Finally, Chihayafuru is back with the sequel known as Chihayafuru 2. I was quite excited when I heard the making of a sequel. When Winter 2013 came, I was even more thrilled. Indeed, the series comes back full force with its card game of karuta. Make no mistake, Chihayafuru 2 is the direct sequel of the original series (season 1) written by Yuki Suetsugu. The series continues from season 1 with Chihaya and what she does at best: playing karuta. Now, not everything is the same of course because there are various changes to this season. However, this sequel still achieved satisfaction for me and I am grateful to say that I enjoyed this series quite a bit.The series still adapts the same theme of karuta. It\'s a game played in Japan based on traditional anthology style of compiling Japanese waka poetry. Of course, the idea of card games incorporated into animation form isn\'t anything new to the entertainment realm. In fact, series such as the popular Yugioh franchise and Cardfight Vanguard have already adapted these themes. What makes Chihayafuru 2 stand out though is the way the games are played. Rather than just mind games being played between players as a way to gain dominance against one another, karuta also tests the wits of competitors in ways they\'ve never done before. It requires quick thinking, skill, memorization, and a little luck to pull out victories. For Chihaya, victory is something she always aim for between herself and her teammates. It\'s may just be a game but for her, it\'s also a dream and she hopes to reach make it into a reality; a dream of becoming the best karuta player in Japan.As expected, the competition and intensity is high this season especially with both new teammates and adversaries introduced. Among some of the returning characters includes both Chihaya\'s childhood friends Arata and Taichi. Both of them are skilled karuta players although they have conflicting views on one another. Fresher new faces includes Sumire Hanano, a fresh new face who makes her debut. Unlike Arata or Taichi, she lacks the skills or experience of a pro. In fact, she is one of those girls who is much more interested in boys and her appearances rather than the game of karuta itself. Her eyes is set on a particular character in the series and often tries to win his affections. At the same time, she views Chihaya as a sort of \'love rival\' despite the fact that there is nothing going on between her and Sumire\'s crush. Needless to say, the romance of this sequel is somewhat higher than its original series. Oh and who can forget about the love triangle between Arata, Chihaya, and Taichi? The one in the middle is Chihaya and she\'s the center of it all.Among one of the key components to succeed not only in karuta but also in life is teamwork. Sometimes, you can\'t rely on everything yourself. For a certain individual, this is especially true. Yes, I\'m talking about Sumire. Teamwork is important no matter what a task is. Without teamwork, a team will fall apart and conflicts will arise. As thus, this season has a lot of that expressed through directly in the form of karuta matches. There is also this feeling of suspense I get throughout each and every karuta match. It\'s hard to tell sometimes who will win when both teams are so dynamic and focused in their ambition to win. Each team in fact is also unique and has their own trademarks. Among some of these trademarks can be humorous but dangerously effective at the same time. Then, there\'s the concept of strategies involved in karuta. It takes practice to perfect these strategies in order to succeed. After all, Arata wasn\'t born as a prodigy and Shinobu wasn\'t born as the Queen. You get the idea.The karuta games itself stays consistent and once again brings back the nostologia of this sequel. Honestly, I miss it. I also liked the concept of the game as more strategy, intensity, and anticipating your opponent\'s every move in order to respond accordingly. The game itself also seems to be difficult to master as it requires memorization and various strategies. Just like in the real life game, karuta also requires quick movements and intuition. This is especially true for taking your opponents\' cards in order to gain the advantage. To add to the serious atmosphere of the show, most players has his or her definite style of play. It even comes with a unique outfit too sometimes with pretty kimonos, team headbands, or in the case of Shinobu...that adorable T-shirt that you can\'t help but keep your eyes off of.The bond between the various members of the team is also an important aspect of the sequel. In fact, throughout later episodes, members of Chihaya\'s team demonstrates skills like they\'ve never done before. This is seen in both their team and individual matches. It\'s the results of their practice and competing against other members throughout the series. At the same time, we can also trace their emotions through the bonding they have and the passion they share with karuta. Whether these emotions are joy, tearful, romantic, or intense, all the members of Chihaya\'s team shines through some way. As that being said, it\'s a good idea to keep watching this show and appreciate what they\'ve gone through.The plot direction of sequel seems to be a bit sluggish. It seems that some of the karuta matches are extended and the pacing becomes almost unbearing to endure. It certainly does not help with an recap episode at one of its more crucial points of the series. Additionally, despite the initial romance being set up somewhat in the beginning of this series, it seems to fall apart and remains more as a background theme. There are moments when the \'love triangle\' is bought up again but most of it remains more as as minor setback. It\'s no surprise though as the majority of the show is focused on karuta as that\'s what the series is about. It puts karuta to test for the characters and develops them both physically and mentally. Finally, the show seems to also play on an idea of anticipation. It\'s clear that some fans from season 1 would like to see some potential matches or rematches. However, some of these left me mixed impressions by the way they were executed in particular of a rematch later on. The shows\' pacing pushes that anticipation so it takes some patience to get through.As for the artwork, the series remains artistic and natural. It doesn\'t\' try to force any fan service at all nor does it make the characters look outstanding. Even with the looks, Chihaya looks like a normal girl but with a powerful dream. The rest of the casts also remains consistent. In particular, some of the younger players of the show gives off that look of innocence and youth. It symbolizes youth in the case of growing up and playing karuta as a way to achieve success. The josei like backgrounds and atmosphere gives off that ideal atmosphere of karuta game. Additionally, the fast pace and camera angles reflects on the intensity of the competition.The soundtrack gives off that feeling of nostologia as well. The OP song ""STAR"" by 99RadioService gives an impression of some of the potential competitors in the series. The background music leaves behind that feeling of intensity and also rejoice throughout each karuta game. Finally, I thought that the VA did their jobs right in particular some of the more experienced players such as Shinobu and Arata.For fans, this show is definitely something worth time to enjoy and appreciate. It is also essential to watch season 1 before picking up this sequel as this series continues directly from its previous season. If you\'re looking for a colorful cast of characters, then you\'re definitely at the right place. Even if you don\'t like the idea of card game themed series or in general, karuta itself, it should could be a refreshing watch. It\'s about learning how to appreciate dreams and to walk a path to success with yourself and your teammates. I appreciated this sequel and definitely did not regret watching this. Chihayafuru 2 is worth the watch even if you\'re not into the sports genre. It\'s refreshing and takes on the idea like karuta like never ever before. new sequel by the name of Chihayafuru 2.Finally, Chihayafuru is back with the sequel known as Chihayafuru 2.

I started off watching the first season, and I just thought that the art was pretty good, it wasn't the best but the main characters attracted me, Chihaya mostly. So therefore, I really people out there to watch this anime too, or give it a try because it's not too shabby.So this anime you might think, is just a plain old Japanese card...game. It's not, well too Chihaya it isn't. When Chihaya was younger, her school had karuta tournaments which means she would know how to play it a little because their shcool taught her. One day, a new transfer student arrived. and he was in Chihaya's class, his name was Arata, he didn't really talk much, then Taichi started bullying him because he never talked.I know this Anime isn't finished yet, well it's at 16 episodes, for me, but when you read this the series might have already finished.Story [9/10] - I gave this anime a 9/10 for story because I like seeing the main character just own people, people at the same time, it's funny, maybe a little romance. I hate it when the main character is completely hopeless and the story line makes no sense, as if for this anime, every thing made sense from the start.Art [8/10] - The art is very good, it's not like super professional but it works. The art is kind of unique, I don't see this art much at all. The only thing that made me not give the art 9/10 or 10/10 was just the eye lashes, I don't know I guess it's just a pet peeve.Character [10/10] - The way they made it so Chihaya had a goal in life made it more interesting, from the first episode [ season 1 ] to now, it actually explain a lot about most characters, un-like some animes.Enjoyment [9/10] - I really did enjoy this anime series, even though this whole anime is about a bunch of people who focus on playing a card game to become the best, it some action in it, like sometimes Chihaya would get in sticky situations where she doesn't know what to do, but if she loses the game, she tries to learn what she did wrong and try to over come it to become a better karuta player.Overall [9/10] - Overall this anime was great, most people might no know about this anime because I don't see this on top animes, but don't underestimate it, it's very good in my opinion. game.

I dove into this second season with high expectations from the first, and *most* of those expectations were satisfied. We follow Chihaya and everyone else into another year of karuta, drama, and romance. This season explored new themes and served as a lovely follow up to the first.Story: 9/10Chihayafuru's story is mostly known for two things: romance and karuta. If you were looking forward to more romance between our three main characters this season, then I suggest you look somewhere else. This portion...of the story has a huge chunk of karuta and focuses mainly on Chihaya and her friends' abilities, motives, rivals, and passion. While the romance may be minimal, the amount of drama and emotion has not changed a bit. The matches have gotten more intense, to the point where you feel the character's pain, pressure, and happiness. Each new enemy gives our team more experiences and lessons, making them stronger and stronger. The story for the second season lived up to the first and did well.Characters: 9.5/10The characters of Chihayafuru make the show pleasant and fun to watch. They're portrayed in a way that makes you feel like they're your friend and all you want is the best for them. Chihaya, the main heroine, is the same as always: hyper, passionate, ambitious. This season we really see her grow as a karuta player and as a friend as she faces trials and challenges. Taichi, the first main hero, goes through development as well. A seemingly perfect boy with his own problems, we come to see him for what he truly is and wish for nothing but his happiness. And finally, Arata. Portrayed as a karuta prodigy but also a dear friend to Chihaya and Taichi. His relationship with these two is heavily explored upon and is very pleasant to watch. Overall, the characters in Chihayafuru are full of life, growth, and development.Sound: 9/10The sound effects and soundtrack for Chihayafuru 2 are incredibly breathtaking. The opening and closing songs are sweet and calming, matching the tone of the show. The music played throughout scenes and matches bring out the emotion even more, serving its purpose well while being a delightful treat for the ears. Every sound effect throughout the anime is spot on, from the heavy breathing to the whack of hands to the tatami mat. The sounds of Chihayafuru are beautiful and help tell the story even better than expected.Animation: 9/10Chihayafuru has a reputation for being an aesthetically beautiful anime, and its animation quality and colors help uphold this reputation. I can't describe it as anything else other than clean and beautiful. The small details, colors, shadings made me feel like I was watching a painting in motion rather than an anime. The quality was beautiful and the designs were fantastic. However, there were some scenes where the character designs looked sloppy and quickly done. Rather than that, most of the art in Chihayafuru 2 left a great impression on me.Overall: 9.1/10The animated sequel to Chihayafuru did justice to its predecessor. Although the main reason for the animation was to bring in more sales for the manga, it still gained high respect and a lot of good feedback. Mostly everything about the show was done in a way that compliments the themes of the story. It's unknown whether or not a third season will be made, but many (including me) hope so. of the story has a huge chunk of karuta and focuses mainly on Chihaya and her friends' abilities, motives, rivals, and passion.

They're portrayed in a way that makes you feel like they're your friend and all you want is the best for them. Chihaya, the main heroine, is the same as always: hyper, passionate, ambitious. This season we really see her grow as a karuta player and as a friend as she faces trials and challenges. Taichi, the first main hero, goes through development as well. A seemingly perfect boy with his own problems, we come to see him for what he truly is and wish for nothing but his happiness. And finally, Arata. Portrayed as a karuta prodigy but also a dear friend to Chihaya and Taichi. His relationship with these two is heavily explored upon and is very pleasant to watch. Overall, the characters in Chihayafuru are full of life, growth, and development.Sound: 9/10The sound effects and soundtrack for Chihayafuru 2 are incredibly breathtaking. The opening and closing songs are sweet and calming, matching the tone of the show. The music played throughout scenes and matches bring out the emotion even more, serving its purpose well while being a delightful treat for the ears. Every sound effect throughout the anime is spot on, from the heavy breathing to the whack of hands to the tatami mat. The sounds of Chihayafuru are beautiful and help tell the story even better than expected.Animation: 9/10Chihayafuru has a reputation for being an aesthetically beautiful anime, and its animation quality and colors help uphold this reputation. I can't describe it as anything else other than clean and beautiful. The small details, colors, shadings made me feel like I was watching a painting in motion rather than an anime. The quality was beautiful and the designs were fantastic. However, there were some scenes where the character designs looked sloppy and quickly done. Rather than that, most of the art in Chihayafuru 2 left a great impression on me.Overall: 9.1/10The animated sequel to Chihayafuru did justice to its predecessor. Although the main reason for the animation was to bring in more sales for the manga, it still gained high respect and a lot of good feedback. Mostly everything about the show was done in a way that compliments the themes of the story. It's unknown whether or not a third season will be made, but many (including me) hope so."", '""Impassioned gods havenever seen the red that is theTatsuta River.""-Poem 17 of the Ogura Hyakunin IsshuThe poem now most well known to viewers of Chihayafuru was written by Ariwara no Narihira, detailing his unsuccessful relationship with Fujiwara no Takaiko. After falling madly in love with each other, the two would be lovers attempt to run away from the palace. Naturally, given the rather wispy and nostalgic tone of the poem, this attempt failed in a spectacular fashion. Despite this, Ariwara no Narihira became well respected much later on and was most likely the basis for the nameless hero of ""The Tales...of Ise."" His name, along with other famous poets, such as Ono no Komachi and Kakinomoto no Hitomaro, were later included in the Thirty Six Immortals of Poetry.History lesson aside, the poem invokes an impression of a deep crimson color, both literally and figuratively. The literal reflection of the water and the red of passion and emotion. The second season of the sleeper hit ""Chihayafuru"" certainly adds to the overall experience of the series, building on the budding character relationships and the surprisingly intense matches of karuta. Virtually unknown to most before watching ""Chihayafuru,"" I can say with confidence that the game of karuta depicted in the series is as action packed as a card game based around classical Japanese poems can get. ""Chihayafuru 2"" builds largely on what made the first season successful, but seems to crank up the intensity to sweltering levels.Of course, if you happen to be reading this review and have not yet seen the first season of ""Chihayafuru,"" do yourself a favor and watch the first season before naturally going on to the second season.The story continues the adventures of karuta-obsessed high school girl Chihaya Ayase and the Mizusawa High School Karuta Club, as they reach greater heights, challenging themselves and the swarms of intense competition around them. Highlights of their karuta careers involve the high school and national tournaments, events that are a central focus to the members of the karuta club. The first and second season differ in that the second season focuses much more attention on the tournaments and the individual mindsets of the characters. Character development takes place during the fierce matches everyone plays and the interactions during down time. Karuta, despite the rather simple premise of matching one half of a poem to another, takes a surprising amount of stamina, speed, and strategy. Chihaya comically seems to immediately fall asleep at the conclusion of her matches, a cute way of relating the tremendous physical and mental endurance needed to play competitively.A popular dilemma for club based shows are the disturbingly small amount of members becoming a major problem for school administration, and of course, the club will be disbanded if they don\'t find new members. Chihaya and the team manage to find two freshman to fill the empty spots, managing to find two people with very different reasons for joining the club. The two new members, Sumire Hanano and Akihiro Tsukuba, are honestly overshadowed by the beloved returning members, but their presence gives interesting contrast to the veterans of the team. For Sumire, who joined only to get closer to the club president, Taichi Mashima, and for Tsukuba, who joined to learn the mainland version of karuta, their growth and development towards their love of the sport and the team is a wonderful journey.While karuta remains the main focus of the show, another major focal point of the show is the love triangle between Chihaya, Taichi, and Arata Wataya. The first season introduced this romantic subplot and highlighted mostly Arata\'s struggle to come to grips with his grandfather\'s death and the return of his old friends and Taichi\'s exasperated attempted to get his dense childhood friend to notice his sincere feelings for her. As Chihaya\'s love for the game of karuta grows, she begins dedicating more and more of herself to becoming the best she can be, coming to terms with her current relationships and her shortcomings as both a karuta player and as a normal person. Romance is definitely in the air, with looks of longing from Taichi, Chihaya\'s fascination with Arata, and Arata\'s desire to reunite with his old friends. There are some very beautiful scenes involving bringing the poetry to life and trying to understand what the poet was trying to convey, using images of summer days long past and flowers adorning the trees. Romance amidst classical poems can only add to the flowery nature of this series\' romance and the passion for both others and the game itself.In regards to animation quality, it is still excellent and crisp. Set in everyday places like school and classrooms give little room for diversity, but the artwork for ""Chihayafuru 2"" is vibrant and rich with color and light. Sparkles of sunlight bask the rooms of competitors and drops of rain accent the storm outside. Some of the most beautiful scenes concern explaining the meaning of the poems, invoking rich metaphors of ancient Japan, with calligraphy, flowers, and the gradual changing of seasons. Flashes of red, mountain ridges, the ever expansive sea and falling snow are just some of the images portrayed. It adds a more literary and poetic beauty to a show set in modern times.A familiar soundtrack accompanies the show, and adds to the mood of the show. The opening theme is ""STAR"" by 99RadioService, who also did the first season\'s opening, and the ending theme is ""Akane Sora"" by Asami Seto. Regarding the ending theme, it is played in different fragments at the end of the episode, and eventually the whole song can be heard if you string together the related parts. It was a fun way to get a glimpse of the wonderful full song, and the sweet, emotional music was a great way to end another intense day of karuta.""Chihayafuru 2"" is my personal winner for this season of anime, and I am sad to see it go. Remembering my thoughts all the way back to the first season, I am surprised that a show with such a niche game could engross me so much. I looked forward to this show every week, and my Fridays are going to be a little less cheery with ""Chihayafuru 2\'s"" absence. Shows like these invoke emotion and transport viewers to the heated world of sports and makes the characters so much more likable, so much so that we will be cheering for their victories and feeling down at their defeats. This sequel builds on the world of karuta so expertly built in the first season and adds another layer of intensity and beauty, sometimes even exceeding the success of the first. of Ise.""

Each poem in this collection is by a different poet, and split into two halves: the first half for reading, the second for grabbing. In a match, the reading halves are then called out, and pairs of players must race to grabbing the corresponding second half of the poem. Chihayafuru excels by making this game of stratagem into something too human to ignore. It has no regard for how silly or strange a passion for the game may be, because the only thing it's...concerned about is engrossing you as if you were a part of the deck itself.Whereas the first season primarily concerns the importance of friendship, the second is purely about self-improvement. A recurring theme is now the conflict between working for yourself versus working for others, and that is carried by the overarching nature of the storyline. It's  nothing extravagant, but gives a new side of maturity to a cast that was originally unrealistic or, in some cases, delusional. More notably, it makes it seem as if the characters are actually learning from the mistakes they commit—not only in karuta, but in life. Arata also has to make some tough choices between his reputation and friendship with Chihaya, all thanks to the perpetually active nature of the game. His motivation through loneliness goes directly against Chihaya's love for teamwork, but the schism continues to drive them forward. Always nice, huh?Still, there is an unshakable feeling that this package wouldn't hold up on its own, or that the handling is the only thing keeping the show afloat. Don't get me wrong: it's pretty decent, but I firmly believe that this series only works as television. The suspense from episode to episode would be completely nullified in the continuous nature of a movie or manga volume, or even the pages of a book. It is dancing on a sheet of thin ice that it never manages to break through, where a breakthrough would be more than welcomed. That aside, the experience you'll get here is fairly lovely.That's mostly thanks to presentation. As always, this show can stretch out mere in-universe minutes over an hour without becoming boring or too slow, more so now than ever. The art remains crisp and pastel, animation is consistently steady, and Madhouse never slips up. Music is seen as a way to add suspense or atmosphere and not much else, but it's a perfect way of handling things in a game where sound can be key. Some of the poetry readers sound better than ever, so I even have to ask myself if they hired actual professionals to do it. Either way, it should be enough to keep you happy.Basically, the second season of Chihayafuru shows notable improvement over the first while offering a promising future for the franchise. It continues to take its time with story and characters, but given the manga's sales, I wouldn't be surprised if a third anime season was soon announced.

Oh, and you might wanna prepare to binge watch it."", ""Chihayafuru season 2 is pretty disappointing.This season is incredibly slow compared to the first season. The main characters were developing well last season but they ground it to a halt in this one. Every match feels exactly the same, just with a different set of faces. The Mizusawa gang seemingly loses all confidence at the start of every match, but by the end of them, win or lose, they've got Superman levels of confidence. EVERY match.This season has got more inner monologue per 26 minutes than any single human is capable in a day. The directors insist we know what all 100+ characters are...thinking at all time, even when they are completely irrelevant to what's going on in the episode, and they insist on making every thought as detailed as a doctorate's thesis. The directors also insist on making every single emotion, positive or negative, super dramatic, as if our characters are trying to defuse a bomb. ALL THE TIME. Chihaya could be about to fart during a match, you would've thought she just received a letter informing her that her mother died with how intense her reaction is. It takes so much away from the more genuine moments of the season. thinking at all time, even when they are completely irrelevant to what's going on in the episode, and they insist on making every thought as detailed as a doctorate's thesis.

Chihaya could be about to fart during a match, you would've thought she just received a letter informing her that her mother died with how intense her reaction is. It takes so much away from the more genuine moments of the season."", ""Combining my views on both seasons-A straight 10 for everything in this show.Story: The topic is difficult. Karuta is not a sport that any of the people outside Japan can relate to. And I don't think even in Japan this sport would be too famous. But this game has an extremely interesting concept of combining the Japanese poems with cards. For any sports anime the matches of that sport need to crafted extremely well for the show to get noticed and appreciated. This show does exactly that. The pacing of the scenes aptly builds up the atmosphere of an exciting match.Art and Animation: Well...drawn characters and backgrounds. And fantastically animated matches. A card game like Karuta which involves fast moves on taking the cards which have poems written on them can be quiet a difficult challenge. If the animators would have tried to bring in too many slow motion scenes in trying to explain the moves, the matches would have looked dull. Also if only fast moves from the players were shown to showcase their skill in taking the cards, then it would have been too difficult to understand the sport at all. This is where narration by the characters from time to time on the moves helps understand their opponents moves. The animation has a very good balance of the fast+slow motion scenes to make the match look convincing and very exciting.Sound: Do I need to even say anything about this department? I have always experienced that Japanese voice actors express their characters emotions extremely well. The most important characters to voice in this show- the readers of the Karuta matches- they need to have the perfect pitching and tone for the Karuta players to recognize the letters being spoken clearly to take the cards as fast as they can. All voice actors do a brilliant job in voicing the readers. I loved that part in the show where 3 certified reader examiners are examining a reader during a match and under pressure he loses his rhythm. Actually till that point I didn't realize how important consistency in reading would be required for the players in general to focus.I'll admit here, Miyano Mamoru's voice always catches my attention immediately.  He has done a brilliant job once again in voicing Taichi who is perhaps the most complicated character to voice in this show after the readers, since there needs to be the perfect pitching and tone for expressing his emotions throughout the show.And yes the background music for this show is just awesome. hats off to Yamashita Kousuke-sensei for a wonderful treat for the ears. Plus the OPs and EDs for both seasons are beautiful ! I personally loved the Akane Sora EDCharacter: I loved all the character personalities. Chihaya the airhead, Kana-chan the literature freak- I loved hearing to her explanations of the poems! You really do start to like the poems in the show once their meaning is explained so beautifully. maybe some of you can even make out while they are being read if you pay close attention. Komanu-kun's meticulous data collection and analysis of his opponents is another interesting way to build up strategies within Team Mizusawa to beat their opponents. And Taichi- I always felt his memorization skills are out of this world. To be able to keep track of all the poems that have already been read out during the match and then build a strategy for taking the cards was just awesome. I also loved his indirect way of expressing his feeling towards Chihaya. I really really hope his feelings are reciprocated by her someday >.< Arata is also a sweet person with godly skills. His cross countering wne taking cards against the match with Nishida and Queen was excellent !!  All the opponents in the show also have unique skills which have been nicely showcased in the show.Enjoyment and Overall: Though it was difficult at the beginning I loved watching this show for its excellent direction, pacing, animation, sound, some very meaningful dialogues, poems, the characters, the exciting matches and the relationships especially between Team Mizusawa's players. Each player supports their team members wholeheartedly. their were 3 occasions where I was crying like an idiot- When Chihaya suddenly cried after the Concert band gave their best wishes to the Karuta Club via their performance (in ep 07 of s2) before the nationals started 2) when Mizusawa won the Tournament as a team (ep 19 in s2) 3) when Taichi made to Class A (ep 23 in s2). All three scenes showcasing the emotions powerfully and very subtly !!Overall I had a wonderful time watching this show. And am praying hard that the story will get a closure with a season 3.

A must watch !!"", '(This has been slightly adapted from my reddit thread)(This is a review for Season One and Season Two)Here comes spring, now the flower blooms. A simple phrase that is said multiple times throughout the show, but truly invokes many different feelings: anxiousness, trepidation, excitement, confidence. What lies within Chihaya Furu is a spectacular show which has now become one of my all-time favorites.STORYChihaya Furu has a simple story. Our main protagonist Ayase Chihaya is looking to become the Queen, or the best ""karuta"" player in the world. I think the phrase ""it is not the destination that matters, but the journey"" fits the show perfectly....The show gives us Chihaya\'s goal early on. But it is not this goal that truly matters, it is what she encounters along the way that defines the story.So, why is the journey so important? What I found to be the most compelling was the struggle. Nothing ever comes easy for Chihaya and crew, and it really shows. Every match is a battle. Every match counts, whether it is for practice or it is their chance to advance to the next Class level. They all experience incredible highs and soul-crushing lows. During the matches, you are rooting for them to win, you want them to succeed. But a lot of the time, they don\'t. And that\'s what I liked the most; it was real. Chihaya isn\'t some karuta God right out of the gates. She experiences these amazing fights that test her both physically and mentally, no matter the opponent. However, when they do overcome their tough obstacles, you feel elated and revel in their glory right alongside with them.At this point, I need to talk about the game they are playing. ""Karuta"" or Hundred Poets, is a game that pits two players against one another in a game of quick reflexes and memorization. Being from America, I had no idea what karuta was at all before watching. But now, I feel as if I have a complete understanding and could even attempt to play others at the game. Granted, I would not be that good! But this is another strength of the show; it does a fantastic job of explaining all of the rules, all of the penalties, and all of the scenarios. Each match is looked at in-depth, and it never gets boring. You never feel as if they are repeating their motions, despite doing the exact same thing for 50 episodes.ANIMATIONChihaya Furu is definitely a feast for the eyes. It becomes apparent right from the OP that the quality of the show is high, and it never falters all the way through. Starting with the environments, the show actually has quite the variety of set pieces, from cherry blossom roads to the shrine at Omi Jingu. The majority of the show takes place within buildings and on tatami mats, but when it is, the show loves to peer into the players minds, giving us beautiful, intense, or serene backgrounds to fit the mood at that moment.Something that I don\'t say about a lot of shows is how well done the lighting is. I was always amazed by how the sun struck the characters faces or how the lighting affected the scenes at night or within the rooms.In terms of animation quality, the most important part and coincidentally the best part, is when they are playing karuta. In particular, the swinging and motion of the players\' during every match was always well done. There would be quick-motion stills and slow-motion segments. There were in-real-time swings shown as well. Basically, witnessing the actual playing of the game was never boring and I was always hooked to the matches.The character designs were actually quite different from what I have seen in most shows. The best way to describe it would be ""mature"". Sure, there are some who are slightly more ""anime"" then others (Desktomu, Retro, etc.), but the main players (Chihaya, Taichi, Arata, etc.) seemed like ""proper"" people. It simply added to an already amazing experience.CHARACTERSBy far the strongest part of the show is its characters. I cannot stress this enough; EVERY character is good. And there are a lot of them. Why is this the case? This is because that not only are the main players heavily developed, not only are the supporting characters heavily developed, but also the other sub-characters are developed to a great degree. As I said earlier, every match matters, and in the same vein every OPPONENT matters. The show actually takes considerable time to explain many different character backgrounds to let us understand where they are coming from and how they go about playing the game. And in this way, you care even when the one\'s you are not rooting for lose.On that note, Ayase Chihaya has become one of my all-time favorite characters. She is funny, beautiful, friendly, passionate, strong, emotional, and any other descriptor you can add on to her. She experiences the most change throughout the show, and rightly so. What I loved about the show in particular is how she doesn\'t grow simply by playing more. She grows as a person and especially as a player by learning from those around her. She becomes better at memorization through Taichi. She loves the poems through Kana. She utilizes the data gathered by Desktomu. She becomes stronger thanks to Porky. She gets more accurate by watching Shinobu. She takes every match seriously and because of that she constantly betters herself throughout the entirety of the series.And this is true for all of the characters. They use one another to eliminate their weaknesses and develop new strengths. You care about all of them, especially the gang from Mizusawa High. Each of them has their own style of play, even Chihaya, but it\'s their sense of family and teamwork that elevates them beyond their opposition.SOUNDI actually thought the ED for both seasons were nice (season 2 more so than season 1), and the second season\'s OP was good, but I have fallen hard for season 1\'s OP, which can be listened to here. It always got me pumped up for the episode to come and I would always find myself singing along (or at least trying to!) with the lyrics and bobbing my head with the beat. This is now also one of my top OPs all-time, too.But what the show does great sound-wise is definitely the rest of the soundtrack. The battle music, the winning anthems, the ominous tones of imminent defeat; each piece of music fits perfectly with the mood they are presenting and really helps to give each scene a better overall atmosphere.Finally, the voice actors and actresses did a wonderful job in their roles. Chihaya, Taichi, Kana, Desktomu, Porky, Sumire, Tsukuba, etc. all had did their roles beautifully. Especially Arata, he and his Grandpa have this somewhat unique voice/way of talking (it\'s apparent when he says ""Chihaya"") that stood out the most. Among all of them, Chihaya shines again, and she was always a joy to listen to.ENJOYMENTIf it is not already apparent, I love this anime. I think I would go so far as to say it is now in my top three all-time. Everything about it is fantastic, and I can\'t really seem to find too much of a fault with it. Season 2\'s pacing is somewhat slower (for obvious reasons I will not mention), but I never felt as if the show was going too fast or too slow.There are genuine, real moments that will make you cry. There are heartwarming moments that will make you appreciate the characters on the screen, and make you think about similar experiences in your own life. And the show is also surprisingly funny, too. The humor is not in your face, but situationally relevant and always made me laugh.I would often find myself breathing in deeply with Chihaya to calm my own nerves. I was constantly rooting for Taichi to overcome his terrible luck. I was smiling alongside Arata as he played the game he loved. The show really got to me, not only as a fan of anime but also as a person; I really care about these characters and want them to succeed no matter what may come there way.SUMMARYStory: Great, Chihaya and the crew\'s journey is filled with every emotion possibleAnimation: Great, beautiful scenes, lighting, action, it has it allCharacters: Great, some of the strongest characterization I have seen in a showSound: Great, season 1 OP is to die for, entire soundtrack fits everything perfectlyEnjoyment: Great, this show needs to be seen by allFinal score (both seasons): 10/10 The show gives us Chihaya\'s goal early on. But it is not this goal that truly matters, it is what she encounters along the way that defines the story.So, why is the journey so important? What I found to be the most compelling was the struggle. Nothing ever comes easy for Chihaya and crew, and it really shows. Every match is a battle. Every match counts, whether it is for practice or it is their chance to advance to the next Class level. They all experience incredible highs and soul-crushing lows. During the matches, you are rooting for them to win, you want them to succeed. But a lot of the time, they don\'t. And that\'s what I liked the most; it was real. Chihaya isn\'t some karuta God right out of the gates. She experiences these amazing fights that test her both physically and mentally, no matter the opponent. However, when they do overcome their tough obstacles, you feel elated and revel in their glory right alongside with them.At this point, I need to talk about the game they are playing. ""Karuta"" or Hundred Poets, is a game that pits two players against one another in a game of quick reflexes and memorization. Being from America, I had no idea what karuta was at all before watching. But now, I feel as if I have a complete understanding and could even attempt to play others at the game. Granted, I would not be that good! But this is another strength of the show; it does a fantastic job of explaining all of the rules, all of the penalties, and all of the scenarios. Each match is looked at in-depth, and it never gets boring. You never feel as if they are repeating their motions, despite doing the exact same thing for 50 episodes.ANIMATIONChihaya Furu is definitely a feast for the eyes. It becomes apparent right from the OP that the quality of the show is high, and it never falters all the way through. Starting with the environments, the show actually has quite the variety of set pieces, from cherry blossom roads to the shrine at Omi Jingu. The majority of the show takes place within buildings and on tatami mats, but when it is, the show loves to peer into the players minds, giving us beautiful, intense, or serene backgrounds to fit the mood at that moment.Something that I don\'t say about a lot of shows is how well done the lighting is. I was always amazed by how the sun struck the characters faces or how the lighting affected the scenes at night or within the rooms.In terms of animation quality, the most important part and coincidentally the best part, is when they are playing karuta. In particular, the swinging and motion of the players\' during every match was always well done. There would be quick-motion stills and slow-motion segments. There were in-real-time swings shown as well. Basically, witnessing the actual playing of the game was never boring and I was always hooked to the matches.The character designs were actually quite different from what I have seen in most shows. The best way to describe it would be ""mature"". Sure, there are some who are slightly more ""anime"" then others (Desktomu, Retro, etc.), but the main players (Chihaya, Taichi, Arata, etc.) seemed like ""proper"" people. It simply added to an already amazing experience.CHARACTERSBy far the strongest part of the show is its characters. I cannot stress this enough; EVERY character is good. And there are a lot of them. Why is this the case? This is because that not only are the main players heavily developed, not only are the supporting characters heavily developed, but also the other sub-characters are developed to a great degree. As I said earlier, every match matters, and in the same vein every OPPONENT matters. The show actually takes considerable time to explain many different character backgrounds to let us understand where they are coming from and how they go about playing the game. And in this way, you care even when the one\'s you are not rooting for lose.On that note, Ayase Chihaya has become one of my all-time favorite characters. She is funny, beautiful, friendly, passionate, strong, emotional, and any other descriptor you can add on to her. She experiences the most change throughout the show, and rightly so. What I loved about the show in particular is how she doesn\'t grow simply by playing more. She grows as a person and especially as a player by learning from those around her. She becomes better at memorization through Taichi. She loves the poems through Kana. She utilizes the data gathered by Desktomu. She becomes stronger thanks to Porky. She gets more accurate by watching Shinobu. She takes every match seriously and because of that she constantly betters herself throughout the entirety of the series.And this is true for all of the characters. They use one another to eliminate their weaknesses and develop new strengths. You care about all of them, especially the gang from Mizusawa High. Each of them has their own style of play, even Chihaya, but it\'s their sense of family and teamwork that elevates them beyond their opposition.SOUNDI actually thought the ED for both seasons were nice (season 2 more so than season 1), and the second season\'s OP was good, but I have fallen hard for season 1\'s OP, which can be listened to here.

I fell in love with this amazing anime because it is simply different. It steps out of the majority of it's genre stereotypes and appeals to it's audience in unconventional ways.Story:The story works so well for me because it takes something as generally dull as a competitive card game, that is accessible to a huge variety of people- and uses that diverse range of characters and their different reasons for loving karuta to make the viewer falls in love with the game...as well.I'd never heard of it before watching the series and now playing it one day is on my bucket list.Art:I have little to say on the art other than- it's beautiful. It's attention to the content works extremely well. Using karuta and the poems as the inspiration for the artwork and animation serves to immerse the viewer into the story and feelings of the characters.Sound:The sound is very well done- I don't know enough about it to go into a detailed analysis, but it works to enhance the humor, the gravity, and environmental atmosphere that the characters are in. It makes me want to cry in frustration, joy and amusement at all the right moments.Character:This is where this anime really stands out for me. Not necessarily in the main characters (who are brilliant in their own right) but in the supporting characters as well. Very few of the characters that get even a little bit of screen time are in anyway dull or generic.The main character- Chihaya is possibly the most endearing female lead I have come across (she's a close rival with Koizumi Risa from Love*Com). She isn't the most original female lead character- predictably beautiful and kind and silly- but she has an intensity that makes it impossible to dislike her.The two main male characters- Taichi and Arata play off one another in a really great way that makes what could have been two very generic characters- the quiet, intense, glasses boy with talent, and the popular intelligent perfect prince, into something much more than that. This love triangle *that appears pretty much in the first episode so I wouldn't consider it a spoiler* is also something of a reversal of the norm- instead of the prince being the unattainable, it is the intense glasses boy- and he is unattainable in ways other than in romance, which makes Chihaya's relationship with Arata much more interesting.The more minor characters are all fantastic as well- Chihaya's teammates, rivals, and teachers are all substantial characters that interact with her and each other in tangible and touching ways. A lot of them are not stereotypically attractive- they are really a bunch of oddballs that Chihaya is able to reach through Karuta, and they all develop and grow and enjoy their lives because of it. They aren't your stereotypical oddballs either. They're all a rather different breed.I thoroughly enjoy watching this anime and recommend it to anyone that's looking for a refreshing take on the sport/shoujo/shounen genres. as well.I'd never heard of it before watching the series and now playing it one day is on my bucket list.Art:I have little to say on the art other than- it's beautiful.

If I had to choose one word to describe this show, it would be that. Only very rarely do sequels get to be as good as the first season, and this is one of those. If you have seen the first season then I am sure you can agree as to just how masterfully the producers create the world that Chihaya lives in. It makes you want to play and learn along with her!All the wonderful characters are back in Chihayafuru 2, and they even introduce a few newbies. I will admit however, that the new...characters aren't as enticing as the original cast. What really keeps me waiting for the new episodes to air is Chihaya's love life. I find myself rooting for her to finally open her eyes and realize! The writers keep hinting and as the viewer it kind of drives you nuts! Haha, but that just may be me though. Becoming the top team, and the drive to beat the Queen are another big storyline factor this time around. I'm desperately hoping one of those two things happen by the end of this season!The storyline aside, the imagery and sound are a HUGE part of what makes this anime so special. I had to give it a 10 for on both counts. You really see the passion in their eyes, every sweat, every piece of magic behind the game ....the art really pulls you in! You feel what they feel.Overall, I'm left wishing there will be yet another season to this anime and it does Chihaya and her friends justice. characters aren't as enticing as the original cast.

In this review I'll be covering both season 1 and 2, since I cannot imagine anyone who has finished season 1 would not immediately rush out and watch season 2. Spoiler free review and thoughts to follow.If you ever wanted a sports anime to actually have some romantic elements in it (although fairly subtle/light) then you cant go past this one. It is a top notch sports style anime in the tradition of Haikyuu, Kuroko no Basuke and Hajime no Ippo, just written from a Josei/female protagonist perspectibve. Such a perfect match, with the tension of the games,...mixed in with distinctive likeable and diverse cast and such strong character development.You can't help but fall in love with each and every character. You will laugh with them, feel their pain and joy and just have such a good feels trip watching this series. As they grow through failure and defeat, you will share their bond and savour their victories and successes.The art is top notch with great character design and a beautiful colour palette. There is some slightly distracting CG sequences but I honestly didn't mind it too much. The music, OP and ED pieces suited the show perfectly. I loved all 4 pieces. I also loved the seiyuu who played Chihaya - just a beautiful voice. If you enjoy a classical type of voice, in some ways like Hayami Saori - both spoken and singing voice you'll enjoy this performance.The only downside as is typical in josei, rather than sports anime is the open ending. I have yet to see a series that just ends with some closure - perhaps because the manga is actually still ongoing. I can only hope that a season 3 is produced at some stage.So what are you waiting for? One of my favourite anime, easily top 5 in any list of sports anime out there. Watch this one. Highly recommended. mixed in with distinctive likeable and diverse cast and such strong character development.You can't help but fall in love with each and every character.

Highly recommended."", ""A bit disappointing after Chihayafuru.Don't get me wrong, Chihayafuru 2 is still very good anime.  Of the ~200 anime series I've seen, I'd easily rank it in the top 10%.  However, it is pretty much a sports/fighting anime, whereas the original series was more about story and character development.  So if you got hooked on the original for those reasons, consider yourself forewarned - you're not gonna see much of that in the sequel.In the original series, most episodes were a self-contained story.  A character(s) would encounter a problem or a situation, struggle with it, and overcome it, and grow in...the process.  Meanwhile you got to learn more about the characters, the game, and there was some movement on the meta-plot involving the love triangle.  Occasionally there was a 2-parter with a cliffhanger in the middle, and there was one multi-part storyline if I remember right.  But overall the series covered a lot of time and subplots in 25 episodes.There is very little of that in Chihayafuru 2.  It has eschewed the endearing character-centered formula from the original, and replaced it with the standard sports/fighting formula of long, drawn-out confrontations.  The focus is now on the matches and how they play out.  The vast majority of the episodes are play-by-play sequences of the tournament matches.  There are even one or two matches which span two episodes.  That's right - whereas the first series would spend at most two episodes to cover an entire *tournament*, the sequel spends that many episodes on a single *match*.It's all very well executed, and I've been glued to every episode so far.  That's why I still gave it a 8 for enjoyment and overall rating.  But that's almost entirely because I've seen the original series, care about the characters enough to patiently wait for the meta-plot to progress, and now understand enough about the game to follow what's going on.  If I had watched Chihayafuru 2 first, I probably would've dropped it after a few episodes - sports/fight anime are really not my thing.I can understand why they did it.  The original series did a pretty thorough job covering the basics of karuta, so all they have left is the meta-plot and showing you the finer points of the game.  Well, if they move the meta-plot too quickly, then the series is over.  So they have to create most of the drama using the finer points of the game.  It's done very well, and if you like sports/fighting anime you'll probably love this.  But as someone who was attracted to the original story by the characters and their development, I was only able to rate the story a 7.The art is just like the original.  Could be better, but very good with no major flaws or annoying quirks.  Well, the faces have no noses when viewed from the front, but that's pretty common in anime.The sound is better than the original.  Maybe it's that the focus on matches that allows for more dramatic music.  I dunno.  But I felt the music added a lot more to the series than in the original.Character development as I explained is minimal.  They add new first-year students to the club (in fact the first few episodes where they're added are very reminiscent of the original series).  But then the series quickly shifts focus to matches.  In the last dozen or so episodes (only 22 eps have aired so far), the new characters have been limited to a few reaction shots.  They probably could've been removed entirely without drastically affecting the series.  The original characters are developed, but mostly in the context of the game (e.g. learning new strategies for playing).  Ironically, the character who seems to be getting the most personal development is the background-character/symbolic antagonist Shinobu.Still a very good and recommendable series, but very different in tenor than the original. the process.

Indeed, who huh. If I did, I\'d have gone and taken all the credits. Ah well.I have written the review for Chihayafuru as well, and when I did, I was quite glad that the second season had begun as soon as I had finished the first season. Pretty fortunate of me if you asked.Now that I talk about this, let me just tell a little story about my God-given timing. For those who haven\'t seen Steins; Gate, just ignore this and...go to the review written below.My brother is also an anime lover (He\'s not really Otaku...cuz, well, he\'s not that serious) and told me to watch Steins; Gate if I didn\'t want my life wasted.However, I fell asleep right at the end and told my brother that STEINS GATE WAS BORING. (Blasphemy! Burn him! oh wait I said it...)My brother was shocked. ""It was? But...there\'s no way!""""Yeah it was boring.

Just make sure your hands are empty cuz you might throw them into the monitor.Story: 10Need a question? Really, the story was so densely packed and perfectly  fitted that I was swallowing my saliva from just watching them. And mind you, I was watching this in my school, with a teacher behind me. The way the author creates a godly suspense and ""event"" after another made me almost spew my heart out (means my heart was thumping too fast in my country\'s dialect). I really didn\'t like where the romance seemed to go, but still this is another way of capturing audience, so I will allow it....probably.Speaking of romance, the romance did elaborate itself more in this season than the last one, and, according to other reviews, ideas are pretty much divided with romance being an important part of story and unnecessary ""annoying"" part of the story. However, I don\'t see why romance can be annoying to some people. Chihayafuru was never a series of karuta battles. It was a development of a character who likes karuta. If the author wanted to show karuta over the development of the story, the author would\'ve created a shounen anime that illustrates the epic sportiness of karuta. That wasn\'t the case. The author wanted to develop both Chihaya and karuta. Either was important. Moreover, since romance became a strategy to develop karuta, it was never an annoying factor.Simply put, don\'t underestimate the power of love.........huh?Art: 8Loved it, I\'ll admit. However, I didn\'t quite get the feeling I got from watching season one. The first season was as if I was in naniwa river, listening to the beautiful melodies of the certified karuta reader, looking into the blooms of ""such blooming autumn red"". For this one......I don\'t know, it felt a little too rushed. It was as if the anime production studio was no longer focused on its aesthetic beauty and more on the production benefits. In other words, while the first season\'s art felt like a beautifully designed katana that took years to finish, the second season\'s art felt more like mass-produced katana. It felt too ""artificial"" (I\'m putting quotation because it is really artificial).Of course, I can\'t be biased and say that the art was artificial for all of the anime. It was near the end I felt this ""artificialness"" As mentioned earlier, the production profit had a lot to do with it.Still, the art was lovable...just not as much as the previous.Sound: 8Although I haven\'t said it, I have three musical talents: absolute pitch, perfect memorization and tuner pitch. Most people are probably aware of the first term, but maybe not the second and third, because they are terms I just came up with. First, absolute pitch is ability to tell the pitch of the sound with just hearing. Second, perfect memorization (which I came up with) is 1) ability to memorize song fastly or 2) ability to memorize every single details of the song in a short period of time. Fortunate or not, I\'m both (I say \'or not\' because when I memorize a song--be it a sexual song or political song--I never forget it). I consider, therefore, sound aspect of an anime quite seriously. I don\'t live in Japan, and so do not really care about the background or the adversary of the anime, but I do care about sound quality. In the first season, I gave ten for the sound because of its dramatic timing and proper tune. For this season too, I would have given a ten if not for two things--one, the ending doesn\'t fit to karuta. The ending of the first season is so loveable that I listen to it even now. It might be because I\'ve never listened to the full version of the song, but the song was in six eights, giving it a rather upbeat rhythm. It was not something you\'d want to give as an ending for a traditional anime such as chihayafuru. I\'m not saying that I didn\'t like the music. I just mean that the song didn\'t fit the occasion. Opening too, was rather irritating. If there is one thing I hate the most, it\'s ruining the song of a good singer because of the horrible tune he/she sings. Imagine LiSA or linked horizon singing hare hare yukai. Does it ever fit? The singer for Icon/Takaroni has a wonderful voice and I like how he mild out his voice when he reaches a high tune to give a peaceful melody, very much like karuta. This song wasn\'t as bad as LiSA singing hare hare yukai, but it was like her singing crossing field. Crossing field is a good song...at the start. However, it ruins itself at the climax by repeating G and A. Repetition of a short melody is NEVER a good idea. When Chihayafuru II did the same thing...I almost threw the computer away. The chord didn\'t fit or have complete coherence to each other.Another thing I didn\'t like was the BGMs. I didn\'t expect the second season to have a completely different sound from the first season. Still, the BGMs were exactly the same! I wanted to hear at least one or two new rhythms. Listening to same BGMs for nearly 50 episodes is both boring and tiresome. Also, the dramatic timing and appropriate choice of sound was a little flawed. It\'s not that it was no longer there, but it was that compared to the first season second season had less dramatizing by sound....A little disappointed I was.Still, this could only apply to me, so rather than giving my desired score, I compensated it with 8. After all, not many audiences are as hard on BGMs and op/eds as I am.Character: 10Chihayafuru did it again.One thing I said while writing the review for the first season is that greatest animes rarely have extras. Another thing I haven\'t said is that I am also a writer and I don\'t like any of my characters being heard for ten seconds and no more. Chihayafuru, of course, had such characters, but that was natural, given the genre of the anime. This isn\'t exactly shounen. However, all the characters who had been named were developed wonderfully. For example, Retro (he might have different name in accordance to the tlr) deployed some beautiful scenes that, I can almost say, was main-characterish. He is an obvious minor character, but the words he used and ideals he had touched me and changed the anime as a whole. An anime with all the characters getting involved...now we don\'t get to see those too often, do we.Enjoyment: 10What can I say? It\'s karuta. It\'s more breathtaking than watching boxers kill each other.For all of you who came all the way down here, I just wanted to tell you something; I don\'t write as much in aspects with high scores because I don\'t see the need to elaborate on it. While it\'s true that I have to explain the reason for their high scores, it is very difficult to elaborate on their outstanding quality without spoiling. So...sorry, but.JUST WATCH IT.

IT\'S GREAT, I\'M TELLING YOU.', '***Before talking about Chihayafuru, I have a few words to say about Studio Madhouse*****Studio Madhouse has been nothing short of a powerhouse ( hehe ) in the anime industry for the past decade, having churned out a plethora of excellent anime series and films. I have been particularly impressed time and again at how diverse their works have been, ranging from dark and violent series such as ""Death Note"" and ""Black Lagoon"", to mahou shojo series like ""Card Captor Sakura"" and life dramas like ""Nana"".Lets also not forget about their long standing partnership with the great Satoshi Kon, as well as Mamoru Hosoda, whose...latest film ""Wolf Children; Ame & Yuki"" (I wrote a separate review on that film ) has only furthered his legacy as great director in his own right.****  Now the real review begins *****All this being said, I can say that Chihayafuru/Chihayafuru 2 is nothing short of another brilliantly crafted series in Madhouse\'s long history of excellence, and another stepping stone in Morio Asaka\'s career, having previously directed both ""Nana"" and ""Card Captor Sakura""Story: 9The plot may feel underwhelming at the start, being a story about a group of high school students playing a card game (Karuta). But instead of dealing with mythical creatures going to life and over powered millennium items, these card game more closely resembles a sport. To that effect, Chihayafuru is indeed a uniquely crafted sports drama in the form of a card game about Japans ""100 poets collection"". In addition to its divergence from the status quo, the excution of this concept is handled with both grace and precision, utilizing just enough suspense to keep the audience coming back for the next episode while still leaving enough simplicity and smoothness in the plot to satisfy them, a feat that is either gone too far one way with a slow paced series, or too far another with a series littered with ill-placed plot twists.Art: 9The main character, Chihaya Ayase, goes by the nickname ""Beauty in Vain"" for being socially awkward in spite her being physically attractive. That nickname however, could hardly be further from the truth in the context of character design. Aside from our main heroine, each of the primary characters in the series a drawn with great detail and attention, sparing no resource to make the characters look original and at the same time absolutely gorgeous. I will add that the main character\'s Chihaya and Taichi do have unusually large eyelashes compared to the rest of the case which may disorient some; nevertheless I contend that it is an aspect of josei manga that one simply has to adjust to in order to appreciate. Being a slice of life series, most of the action sequences are limited to the Karuta matches; even so, the animation for those matches are both crisp and fluid. While stock frames were likely used, they were used with tact to the extent that I couldn\'t tell. Moreover, there was a multitude of clever symbolism, especially with the poems written on certain cards the I suggest audience members pay close attention to as the series progressesSound: 7There is a simple whistling tune from what I believe is a flute that gets quite catchy as the series goes on. Along with that, the rest of the atmosphere sounds synergizes quite well with the events that transpire, whether it is a tense match between two evenly skilled players or a leisurely afternoon walk through town. The opening theme from the 1st season I personally found more memorable, and that theme does make a return in the second season.Characters: 9As some of you may already know, this is character driven series. I give Chihayafuru a perfect score on character simply for going above and beyond even my strictest requirements for good character development. In addition to providing us with 3 multi-dimensional, deeply relate-able main characters, the creators introduce to us an ensemble of supporting characters who each gets their own side-story. It is fitting that no side character is left out of the picture, what with the great detail that was put into generating a unique narrative as well as extravagant character designs. Moreover, as the series progresses, and as each Character changes, we see how their developments affect the way their interact with each other as a whole. The one reason I do not give this a 10 out of 10 is simply because I normally have low tolerance for melodrama, and at rare momenets, I believe that the melodrama does go somewhat overboard.Enjoyment: 10I personally had a lot of fun watching this show. It\'s blend of drama, comedy, and enticing cliff hangers allowed me to marathon through both season 1 and season 2 in just a few days. The amount of content that I feel goes unnoticed on the first watch through also leads me to give this show a high re-watch value.Overall: 9For those of you who are familiar with sports series like ""Prince of Tennis"" or ""Hikaru No Go"" I am willing to promise you that you will enjoy Chihayafuru (and I rarely make promises).For those of you who enjoy slice of life series or dramas, I extend that same promise to you as well.For those of you who are bored with the anime that\'s out there, I will only promise if you can get through the first 4 episodes of season 1.For everyone else...give it try, and if you don\'t like it, that\'s fine by me.

It makes you want to do your best at whatever it is that you do, despite any odds you're up against. I am currently on episode 21, so I'm not exactly finished, however, I still recommend this show to everyone.Just like it's predecessor, Chihayafuru 2 has an air of realism surrounding it. It's not super cliche, and I appreciate that. Chihaya's team's struggle is clear and inspiring. This is a warm show, and once the games begin, you find yourself...once again on the edge of your seat.For some reason, even though this season is very enjoyable, it wasn't able to stand head to head with the prequel. It's great, but for some reason it fell a little short. It does get better around the fifth or sixth episode, however.The art is as good as always. The sound is cool and the characters are good. You don't get to know the new ones as well as you did the original 5, but I still love them. If you were a fan of Chihayafuru's first season, then you will definitely love the second season ;D once again on the edge of your seat.For some reason, even though this season is very enjoyable, it wasn't able to stand head to head with the prequel.

Another one of those seasons where an additional third could completely redeem and change my opinion of the second. The suspense in this season was almost unbearable but awesome at the same time. A few story elements that were main arcs in the first seemed to get blown over in this season which was a bit disappointing. With all of that said this anime is still very good and really delivers on the action and suspense front. I also found myself really getting into the...rhythm and tone of the readers and the game overall, it was a really engaging experience. The characters develop well but I would have liked to see them go just a bit further. I will likely dig up the manga on this one, I think this series would be much better had I read the manga first. rhythm and tone of the readers and the game overall, it was a really engaging experience.

Bit of a shorter review than im accustomed to but here ya go hope ya like it and agree if ya scene it.Story- Read the synopsis but if you have already watched s1 your not really missing much. Chihaya is now in her 2nd year and aims to become the individual highschool champion in japan as well as have her karuta club with 2 new members along the ride become the highschool national karuta...team champions. Not missing much from the sports/game playing side of the story but alot of new things as well as the love triangle progression between the three main characters Chihaya,Arata,Tachi. The romance isnt really prevalent but there are many scenes were it seems like something shouldv'e happened and its obvious who likes who.Art- Ive said this once i will say it again madhouse studios and the other studios but mainly madhouse have this anime just great looking like the previous season it is great. Vibrant colours, fluent animation everything is great. 10/10Sound- Same ost as season 1 however different opening and different ending they are both good although i prefer season 1 in terms of the op and ending its not to different. Voice actors fit the characters old and new everything is insync so there should be no complaints with characters speaking and sound playing at the exact moment. One dislike i have and ive had for some time is Aratas voice mainly cuz it sounds like he is always prolonging a single word idk how to explain it but it sounds weird.Character- Very good sums it up more characters and lots of character development for the club members mainly chihaya and taichi but to sum it up lots of development and likable characters. 8/10Enjoyment- Funny, Dramatic left me with cliffhangers on certain episodes where they were competing in the tournament between both seasons i dont really have a preference but ovr needless to say i enjoyed it.Overall- 9/10 a well deserved score for everything the show offers give. team champions.

Like Hikaru no Go, it takes a game few people play and it builds characters.  I can honestly say, even after watching two seasons of the characters playing karuta, I still barely know anything about the game.Overall, it's an excellent series.  It is exciting, emotional, humorous, romantic, relaxing, and tense.  Great story telling and character development.  If I had to find an issue, it's the endless love triangle, but the main character is completely oblivious to anything...else besides karuta, so it's okay.Fully recommended: Two Thumbs Up else besides karuta, so it's okay.Fully recommended: Two Thumbs Up"", ""So, this is my first review. I never planned to make any but i wanted to share my views on this show. I hope i help at least one of you. I started watching this show out of lack of anime to watch. I never expected myself to fall hopelessly in love with this show.This show is mainly about a game called karuta and it follows the karuta playing adventures of three people who grew up playing it and their friends who they have met along the way. I did not honestly think that i would like a show about a game...that i never heard about so much. But i did. From the quirky, fun, determined characters to the artwork to the story line. I loved it all. And the thing about this show is that its so very realistic. That's one the things i admired most. Yeah, there were points in time when i wished things were more unrealistic and easier for the karuta players, but everything that they went through, including their loses helped them grow. I loved watching them grow and hope you will too.The characters were all so very unique.  None of them were alike and that helped them to grow together. Some people might get turned off by an anime about a game, but i hope you guys give it a shot, because if i hadn't i wouldn't have known there was a great anime like this one out there. that i never heard about so much. But i did. From the quirky, fun, determined characters to the artwork to the story line. I loved it all. And the thing about this show is that its so very realistic. That's one the things i admired most. Yeah, there were points in time when i wished things were more unrealistic and easier for the karuta players, but everything that they went through, including their loses helped them grow.

At early, im sure i never imagined that i would had enjoyed this anime so much, at earlier i can only see poor anime art, horrible chara design, but as i keep continue to watch, really its story makeup for all of it, its really nice.These are the reasons why its story is a top notch:1. Its not exaggerated...at all for considered sport anime, not just other out there with godlike shot, tiger shot, ping pong ball, etc2. Its really very realistic, the protagonist and her team often lose and we can see their progress to get better and overcome their weakness. Hello, this is not anime with godlike char who always win 100% without any defect3. Its story so detail and tightly packed, no jumping and easy to follow4. Telling about karuta? this anime is the best, i think im getting to like karuta now after i wathed this anime even im not japanese and know nothing of karuta!!Passion of karuta, meaning of each card, every tech, strategy nicely pictured here5. So deep character story depth and their relationshipArt => 6Well its the weakness, so sad to see that this anime have very poor art, its almost the same like manga art but animated, thats all, so many defect like char not proportional, etcSound => 7Well i can say that this is so so, op ed have deep meaning but not too pleasant to hear, backsound got some nice one if i might add and good enoughCharacter => 7As told earlier, poor chara design art and not satisfying to see but as explained earlier too, its nicely backup by strong chara depth story, soo good enoughEnjoyment => 8Well, i can say even there are many minus aspect, i cant lie that i really enjoyed watching and follow this anime from the start till the end because of its magnificent story stated aboveOverall => 8Good good simply goodO yea, i read some info that this anime is actually an official Japan government program to raise popularity of karuta in Japan itself because in this modern era karuta gradually drowning and vanished. So nice one from Japan Government and Go Karuta!! at all for considered sport anime, not just other out there with godlike shot, tiger shot, ping pong ball, etc2.

So nice one from Japan Government and Go Karuta!!', ""When something becomes more than what others suggest, you know its special and imperative to you. This is what Karuta means to the characters but what is more fascinating about it is not just their different ways and techniques in playing Karuta but their various stories and reasons for playing Karuta. This is the backbone of the show and I think they were successful in channeling the the material to make viewers fall in love to this anime or at least I did.Story: 9Initially, I thought that the beautiful faces of Chihaya, Arata and Taichi would require a very good material for romance. It...could have been an advantage for the show to invest on intimate relationships but nonetheless, I think the show has already a direction and that is to showcase a different side of an average teenager who has a talent and passion that aside from your typical romantic comedy and falling in love stories, the ability to love can also happen between a person and a thing like Karuta for example. It doesn't necessarily mean that the less priority on intimate relationship between characters is a minus and you will know this as you go along the episodes. Moreover, I love how the story remains natural and realistic to me. It wasnt a smooth and easy way for the characters to win and this was backed up by a lot of personal issues, doubts, hardships and hardwork that have made their road bumpy but lesson and fun filled. The story of success is greatly painted in this show and you can feel it in every episode. Bonus? You also feel hyped and positive in real life!Sound: 9Im not that particular to the music used in anime but I have to say that I get chills listening to Chihayafuru sound track. The season 1 op is better tho.Art: 10You know that an anime is great in art if you feel whatever theme or atmosphere is portrayed in the scene. As for Chihayafuru, I am connected to the intensity, genuinity, and even sorrow of the characters. I like how they put emphasis to certain details of actions in the game that makes it interesting. Moreover, the art itself is very good in general.Character: 10I have to admit that later on the show, I have realized that I want to see the growth of Arata in the story. But I guess, Im just too busy being entertained by other characters and the story itself so its compensated already. But on a serious note, the character development in the story is by far the strongest feature of the show. Chihaya who loved Karuta because Arata introduced it to her has grown her love to sharing the fun of Karuta to others without knowing how huge she has grown in life after accepting defeats and success and trying to be a better Karuta player and a better person who is reaching for her goals. It may have started from wanting to become a Queen to sharing the fun and experience in team category whilst aiming to champion it too. New characters also play important roles to the growth of main characters and it is safe to say that season 2 is funnier and partly this is due to the new members/characters. So in totality, the season 2 has better and wider story and plot. Moreover, the interaction between characters in the game is more intense and breath-taking.Enjoyment: 10Was it fun? It was more than that. In fact, I'm lured into their world and I just caught myself situating beside them playing Karuta. Thats how the show hit me. I love the ups and downs and the troubles they have to face together. Just when I thought playing Karuta was cool, what became cooler was the fact that they were giving out their best and doing their club a favor because they understand that they werent just playing for their own sake but theyre playing as a team. Moreover, I also like the single match. I was so thrilled and hyped watching all the episodes that I begin imagining what would it be like to be in your rhythm while doing the thing that makes you happy.Overall: 10It not just some fine anime. Its more than that. It can be about you, about your neighbor, about the one who sits beside you in your algebra class or anyone, everyone. As you sit and watch this anime, you begin to appreciate Karuta, what they are doing, the things that they need to do to make it. Its about having a dream. A goal that defines you and pushes you to your extreme. Its as simple as that but as precious as that. Its fun but its more than that. Its life.PS: This is my first review, please be kind.

A truly captivating show and a very successful mix of the sport genre, with exciting competitions and the subtle sophistication of the Shoujo genre through friendship bonds. If you enjoyed the first season, this gentle, yet passionate continuation of sport and drama is sure to appeal to you too.Story: funny - doing the same thing, but a bit different (9/10)In the first season, the story is in the foreground and introduces both the characters as well as the traditional Karuta. Now that we know the setting and the characters a little better, story and...plot take the opposite path, and that is exceptionally well done, by the way. What I really appreciate about this sequel is that the plot is emphasized but not in the foreground. The pleasant pace also gives each character enough time to develop their own convincing and interesting personality, which was created for them in the first season. The common thread of the story ties in seamlessly with its predecessor. The series shows how all the members of the Mizusawa Karuta Club prepare for the group tournaments and the individual matches. Its their second year and they have trained hard for a long time. Chiyaha has high goals for all members as well as for herself. There are nice side stories, such as gaining new members and a reunion with an old friend will also be included. Everything garnished with all kinds of small and bigger obstacles as well as exciting matches, with opponents who are up to the challenge. So it will be exciting!Characters: The characterization & the bond of friendship are brilliantly deepened (9/10)One reason why the series is so much fun is the passion that every member of the team has for Karuta, as well as their very different personalities. They complement each other and yet sometimes they quarrel. Now, new characters are added in this nice mix. The main cast only briefly, because in my first season review I already described them a little, but a few words more about the new characters.Hanano, Sumire:Her character is a good example that a book should not be judged by its cover. The first impression is superficial, vain and her main concern is to find a good-looking friend quickly. It is obvious who is the right candidate in her eyes. She is direct and doesn\'t mince her words, but nevertheless it quickly becomes clear that there is more behind it than the sometimes wayward nature and sarcasm. Her jealousy also shows a sensitivity, and some of the Hyakunin Isshu\'s poems can affect her. Give her some time and I am sure that a very nice scene with Kanade will reward you for it and that a little light of sincere interest and responsibility will shine through.Tsukuba Akihiro:Also the second new addition, is a bit strange. Actually, Akihiro is a nice guy, if it weren\'t for his imposing behavior and his pride, which at first glance seems unjustified and exaggerated. He is talented and has already successfully played a local subspecies of Karuta in his home community. However, his exaggerated ambitions drives him to use underhanded methods to achieve his goals. His skills cannot yet match his ambitions, but once again it is clear that the Mizusawa team is indeed a team and will integrate his skills.Ayase, Chihaya:A gracious, quirky, a little stubborn karuta enthusiast who alone makes the show worth seeing. She is the driving force and also provides much of the comedy. On the other hand, her straightforwardness and honesty are also the backbone of the team.Ooe, Kanade:Kanade is the best example of the series\' clear connection to the reality in which we all live. She is not a catwalk beauty, like many of the other characters, but a sweet, wonderful, kind, brilliant girl with a big heart and a lovely soul. Her character can also develop in regard to the first season. Her great passion for Japanese poetry is further strengthened in her effort to read the verses aloud.Komano, Tsutomu:A very similar fate is shared by Komano, who may not really correspond to male ideals of beauty, but who is blessed with an excellent mind and understanding that will show him completely new ways in human terms. He develops new skills and refines his style. In my opinion, his development is particularly well designed. He realizes his progress with realistic speed and convincing abilities that fit his character type well.Nishida, Yuusei:Nishida is also not a representative of an ideal of beauty, but I have perceived his character as particularly positive and he also has a lot of experience in Karuta. Similar to Komano, he has a very good ability to observe, which enables him to recognize and analyze the movements and the way of playing in combination with his knowledge of Karuta. Already in the first season it showed that he has team spirit. He tries to realize his personal dream, but when the going gets tough, he stands by his comrades.Especially nice compared to the first season is the variety of capable opponents.Visuals: As the first season, the art is very pleasant & animation good, but a little inconsistent (8/10)The sequel is still strong in terms of production values and diversity of character. The character design is excellent, especially with regard to the three main characters. One is attracted by the beautiful faces and especially the eye areas with their richness of detail give them a very appealing charm and a special highlight. The adaptation of the wonderful manga by Suetsugu, Yuki was well done by the art department. Despite the emphasis on attractiveness, the series remains aesthetic and realistic. One can now object that not all the characters looked so appealing, and that\'s not entirely wrong, but it underscores the reality. Not all people have a beautiful appearance, but that makes nature up in other ways. I already explained this thought in the character descriptions. A graceful detail of the art that was already used in the first season are the charming accents that underline the shoujo character, such as falling sakura leaves and soft pastel- colour tones. Another nice side effect of the target group ""shoujo"" is, that one waits in vain for awkward action sequences, unaesthetic fan service, and in addition, the chibi effects are used rarely and pointed.The movements of the individual Karuta players in the tournaments are smooth and with the very good camera work, every match is incredibly exciting. In addition, the camera angles are perfectly matched to the panning and tilting movements to get a great shot of every card played and get the maximum effect out of every scene. The animation in the tournaments is a pleasure, but there is an imbalance to the normal scenarios of the series, so that the impression of inconsistency arises. This is hardly noticeable because the captivating characters are artfully staged, especially in the scenes that do not contain dialogues and you can only hear their thoughts. It is also apparent that the depictions that are a bit more distant are less detailed. I know, it\'s lamenting at high level, but Madhouse has the skills and abilities to provide that level.Music: emphasized in the right way without exaggeration, good VA & OP / ED (9/10)The background music was composed by Yamashita, Kōsuke, and adapts very well to the emotions of each scenario, without sliding too much into the sentimental. The way in which the musical arrangements harmoniously emphasize the overall picture of the series is impressive and creates just the right mood for the audience.In addition, the series receives a very nice OP as well as very appealing Eds.The OP is again from 99RadioService and is entitled STAR. The music is a little less rock than the OP from the first series and sounds a bit more mature. The lyrics fit very well with their reference to feelings and promises from the past. The animation for the music is structured similarly to the first season and shows places, people and offers a foretaste of what will follow.The ED of episode 1-24 is the title ""Akanezora"" and is sung again by Seiyū Seto, Asami. It is a soulful and beautiful song about a romantic autumn walk and the memory of a loved one. The song is carried by Seto-san\'s voice and has a wonderful tempo. The animation is moodily chosen and brings the memory to life by turning back the time from teenagers to carefree childhood and showing the three friends together.The ED title from the first season ""Soshite Ima"" by Asami SETO was also played in the second season as an insertion song in ep 20.In the last episode the title ""youthful"" is chosen again as ED, I love this outstanding song.The dialogues are consistently clear, the sound is balanced between music and dialogues. In addition, the pleasant animation of the Karuta matches is enhanced by a beautiful stereo effect that even makes the tension audible.Among the Seiyū, I noticed Kayano, Ai as the spokeswoman for Ooe, Kanade. I like her pleasant, gentle, yet passionate way of speaking the poems.As in season one, Ishizuka, Unshou\'s voice is one of those that caught my eye (ear). I like his interpretation of the role of Harada, Hideo, with his deep voice and paternal severity in his tembre.And this time I will also praise Hosoya, Yoshimasa, for his performance as the voice of Wataya, Arata. I wanted to do that in season one because he did it very well, unfortunately I forgot it last time. His dialect (Fukui-Ken) is very different from standard Japanese. However, some words are similar to Kansai-ben and sound nice and friendly to me. I\'m weird, I know -_oI haven\'t written anything about subtitles in my reviews yet, so I decided to add it. The subs are timely and error-free, but you should be aware that sometimes a wall with subtitles is displayed, so you will soon be very familiar with the pause button.Chihayafuru 2, straight to the point, it\'s definitely worth seeing. The second season reached the splendor of the first season. If you enjoyed season one, there is no reason not to see this show. It convinces with great characters, good art and animation, an elegant and very appealing sports anime, which merges with a really well done soundtrack to a great overall picture.I highly recommend it.As always, thanks for reading and have fun watching. plot take the opposite path, and that is exceptionally well done, by the way. What I really appreciate about this sequel is that the plot is emphasized but not in the foreground.

The animation is moodily chosen and brings the memory to life by turning back the time from teenagers to carefree childhood and showing the three friends together.The ED title from the first season ""Soshite Ima"" by Asami SETO was also played in the second season as an insertion song in ep 20.In the last episode the title ""youthful"" is chosen again as ED, I love this outstanding song.The dialogues are consistently clear, the sound is balanced between music and dialogues. In addition, the pleasant animation of the Karuta matches is enhanced by a beautiful stereo effect that even makes the tension audible.Among the Seiyū, I noticed Kayano, Ai as the spokeswoman for Ooe, Kanade. I like her pleasant, gentle, yet passionate way of speaking the poems.As in season one, Ishizuka, Unshou\'s voice is one of those that caught my eye (ear). I like his interpretation of the role of Harada, Hideo, with his deep voice and paternal severity in his tembre.And this time I will also praise Hosoya, Yoshimasa, for his performance as the voice of Wataya, Arata. I wanted to do that in season one because he did it very well, unfortunately I forgot it last time. His dialect (Fukui-Ken) is very different from standard Japanese. However, some words are similar to Kansai-ben and sound nice and friendly to me. I\'m weird, I know -_oI haven\'t written anything about subtitles in my reviews yet, so I decided to add it. The subs are timely and error-free, but you should be aware that sometimes a wall with subtitles is displayed, so you will soon be very familiar with the pause button.Chihayafuru 2, straight to the point, it\'s definitely worth seeing. The second season reached the splendor of the first season. If you enjoyed season one, there is no reason not to see this show. It convinces with great characters, good art and animation, an elegant and very appealing sports anime, which merges with a really well done soundtrack to a great overall picture.I highly recommend it.As always, thanks for reading and have fun watching.', '*CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS*This is a continue review from Chihayafuru season 1. Well, then the characters goes into second semester and tried to achieve what they lack in the first semester: high school competition, training karuta new members, achieving higher rank per individual, and winning solo championship.==============================================THE BAD SIDE FROM SEASON 2==============================================1. The season 1 is good because it covers many strategy you did not know, but in season 2, there is just a little new strategy introduced.One of the strategy is to hear multiple syllable in instant. For me it is BAD. How come human can achieve multi syllable by single syllable, no one...in the real world can even differentiate that. The anime tends to be unrealistic here. (OK, I know that you can hear from the tone. The tone might be different, but still, it is near impossible for human in real life even the karuta master in real life to differentiate that.).2. The ending for Chihayafuru 2 is also premature We cannot called that as ending. (The manga still continue though)3. The new characters (junior that join karuta club) is just a mere addition who will not affect the story much. It is a mere achievement for Chihaya Ayase.4. This season 2 tends to be like other mainstream sport anime: ""Do not give up when facing strong opponent"", or ""You can do it"", ""If you lose, don\'t lose hope"". I am a little bored.==============================================THE GOOD SIDE==============================================1. It is still good to know that the main characters here now have a rival to defeat and the struggling of losing in this anime is quite realistic. There is still emotion here in this anime. The intensity of the competition is also well executed.2. The romance parts still executed well in this season. The more episodes, the more I want to know who end up with who.3. There is twists here. Some objective sometimes should be sacrificed. Well..==============================================SUMMARY                           7/10==============================================Watch this if you only watch the chihayafuru season 1. It is still good.It is 7/10 because the reason I stated above. in the real world can even differentiate that. The anime tends to be unrealistic here. (OK, I know that you can hear from the tone.

When I read the show description back in my pubescent days I was disgusted. What a silly sounding show I thought. I'd seen the good reviews and knew people liked it, but it celebrated such a bizarre piece of Japanese culture that I found my British mind struggling to grasp at the idea of a competitive game involving poems being enjoyable. But colour me as pink as Taichi's hair I was an immediate convert! This show is a shoujo claymore, cleaving you with it's girly aesthetic till you are but paste on the...ground. It's lavish and gorgeously romantic and the main character is a pretty girl with a rock for a brain. What a mysterious female fantasy... This show definitely wasn't a favourite on first watch - some of the matches can feel like they drag, and actually understanding the game they are playing is nigh on impossible due to it's reliance on kanji. But if someone could sample those poems being sung out in this anime and put it on their mix tape, I'd be your first buyer. I've watched both seasons of this anime enough that each climactic moment makes me tear up and the shows run time just breezes past because it's familiar and homely.  This is never a story that you would see outside of anime/manga and it's outstanding. I love it deeply. ground.

There\'s suspense in just about every match and it\'s awesome when you\'re shown all the different angles and factors of karuta, the game in question of this ""sports anime"".The characters are awesome. Taichi\'s my personal favorite. He\'s a total ass in the first episode and afterwards becomes the sweetest guy in the series. Despite him being good-looking and good at everything, he\'s a self-proclaimed coward with a crush on the main character, Chihaya. I hear some people give Chihaya shit for being annoying, but she\'s not. I find her...to be the most endearing of the entire cast. She\'s the one who most strongly pushes forward the theme of growing stronger, which is one of my favorite themes in anime. The progression of strength really makes you feel proud of what she and the other characters have worked hard at to perfect.There\'s also Ooe, Nishida, and Desk-kun. All of which have moments that made me admire them, but other that, not too interesting or worth the screen time. There is, however, Arata and Shinobu, the ""antagonist"" and the antagonist.Arata was childhood friends with Taichi and Chihaya and came to fall deeply in love with the group they had formed, but had to leave soon after solidifying their bonds. After several years, they see each other again, but this time he acts as more of a mysterious obstacle, for both Chihaya and Taichi in different ways. Chihaya wants to overcome his power in karuta and Taichi wants to overcome the emotional hold he has on Chihaya. We got some sad love triangle stuff going on.Shinobu is a beautiful girl who dominates in karuta, which is why she\'s given the title of Queen, the strongest female player. She\'s a lonely girl, who spends all her time perfecting her art and growing stronger. A child who grew up isolated, as she was made to be good at karuta, so no friends... This is where you can sympathize with her, which makes her a good antagonist in my book.The art is very nice, but did take me an episode or two to get used to. It reminds me of Your Lie in April\'s art style, where actual lips are drawn on certain characters.Oh, and the OP is amazing.Basically, it\'s a good-ass show and should be viewed. to be the most endearing of the entire cast.

This second season picks off directly after the first.***This is a spoiler free review***Chihayafuru completely blindsided me when I first watched it last year. No matter how I looked at it, it looked like a Josei anime which is usually a turn off for me. After much consideration though I ended up watching it and I never regretted doing so. Now that the second season has completed, I find myself pretty much with the same feelings; pure awesomeness.Story: 6.5/10Let’s get the formalities...out of the way; this is a sports anime. If you do not like sports anime then I am 98% sure you will not like this anime at all. Chihayafuru follows the main character Chihaya as she tries to become better at the Japanese poetry card game Karuta. In the second season, the show focuses more on the Karuta club at Chihaya’s school as they prepare to compete in the district and regional tournament. Now for the second formality; like I posted in my opening statement this looks like and pretty much is a Josei anime. Josei shows usually shoots for the young to older teen girl audience and a unique characteristic that the Josei genre usually brings is its art style (read more about this in the animation section). So since this show is directed to young Japanese girls, you have to deal with the typical female lead that usually has two or three boys after her affection. This is somewhat true in Chihayafuru but the romance thankfully takes a back seat compared to the other things such as character development and the card game scenes. It also helps that Chihaya is a very strong willed and overall great lead character (more of this in the character section).The most important thing about grading the story section is how the plot flows. While the two main arcs flow nicely into each other, I feel as if some of the match scenes dragged on a little too much (I call it the Bleach syndrome). That being said, some of the matches actually had me on the edge of my seat. I will not spoil the results but there is a team match where it literally comes down to the last card and I could not believe the result. My overall feelings are if you want a flowing story with tons of character development then stay away from this anime. While it does have the stuff you want in between the tournaments, once they start it is all about the matches. This is a sports anime.Animation: 9.7/10If you look at any number of Josei anime you will see that they all pretty much have very light and bright colors and this is no exception for Chihayafuru 2. In the scenes where there is sunlight peering through the windows, there is beautiful and well down lighting. Also the character models (AND THE EYES) are so well done that even the talking scenes are beautiful (OMG THE EYES). Since this a sports anime, you would hope that the action oriented scenes flow well with great quality. I am happy to say that even the most intense matches have great quality and look extremely smooth. I honestly love the animation of this anime; all the characters (even the side ones) look unique and beautiful/handsome. Like or hate the Josei art style, this is one beautiful anime.Sound: 9.6/10Another great asset this anime has is the overall sound design. The music that plays in the background for both the dialogue and match scenes is so spot on. In an intense match you will find that the music caters perfectly to what is going on and I also love how they included so many orchestral arrangements. The voice actors also did an awesome job reprising their roles. The new characters also sounded great as each one meshed quite well with their virtual counterpart. It has been quite some time since I have experienced an anime with such a great acoustic qualities.Characters: 8/10I feel that this season did a much better job with the character interactions (since they added new people to the club) but at the same time it detracted from the characters I really like. The screen time for Chihaya and Taichi was more limited since we had to learn about the new members but this is not really a valid complaint since they still had screen time. Chihaya is a very strong female lead with an unfathomable amount of resolve to become better and better at Karuta. She wants to one day play a match against Arata like she did as a child. She is to my limited memory the strongest female anime character I can think of which is great because I am so tired of the weak willed and whiny females we usually get. Taichi in the first season made it quite clear he was crushin’ on Chihaya; I won’t spoil if he was man enough to make a confession this season but the time they had together in the second season was pretty nice. He also grew very much as a player in this season. There is a particular team match where he pretty much was the sole reason the team won. The other characters (boob girl, porky, glasses, and the two new members) really did help bring in some great moments for the team especially in the first tournament. It added a new element since the team now had people they could cycle in instead of always relying on the same people.Overall: 8.5/10This show is really, really good. The continuing story of Chihaya and the Karuta club is so enjoyable to watch unfold. If you somehow missed or just decided to skip the first season of Chihayafuru then please do yourself a favor and at least give it a try. While the show covers a sport you have most likely never heard of, the anime does a superb job pulling you in which other great sport anime have done in the past (Capeta, Prince of Tennis, Major, ext).Enjoyment: 9/10Thanks for reading my review!

If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!Sincerely,Awesome Drummer', 'Chihayafuru 2: Impassioned SeriesAfter the groundbreaking success that was Chihayafuru, an anime that introduced us to the world of karuta, it was only natural that we would see a second season. Personally, while I found the original series to be unique, it suffered from two major problems...character focus and pacing. While the second season still suffered from pacing problems, I really feel like the writers got things going in the right direction with its character focus. As an end result, I would without a doubt say that the second season is by far better than its first season...and that\'s not a slight at the first...season.The strength of this series revolves around its animation in regards to the characters. When I say ""impassioned"" in the headline, what I mean is the writers, the animators, and the seiyuu do a wonderful job of capturing the passion that this series has to offer. We can certainly feel the emotions each player from Mizusawa has for karuta, as well as the other important characters to this series like Arata and Shinobu. The best way of putting it is that everything about this series had such great chemistry. The story set the tone, the seiyuu put their heart and soul into each character\'s performance, and the artwork of this series carried that passion.Where this series significantly improved over its predecessor was in the aforementioned character focus. This series focused much more on the three protagonists, Chihaya, Taichi, and Arata, as well as the rest of the members of Mizusawa\'s karuta team. In the previous season, it seemed like the writing staff put more focus on the other karuta players and there were times where it felt like supporting characters were getting more screen time and development than the series leads. This series also put a lot more focus into Arata and Shinobu, which I found to be important since they are much more important characters to this series than, let\'s say Yumin from season 1. Not saying Yumin isn\'t an important character, but when she\'s getting more development than Chihaya, the series lead, then we have a problem.Speaking of problems, this series does still have a few and they are pretty much carryovers from the first season. The anime\'s pacing is horrifically slow. Well, I will say this...it isn\'t nearly as slow as the first season. The first half of the series seemed pretty well paced, but the second half tends to drag at times, with some matches lasting as long as three episodes. While I do find the players thought processes during these matches interesting, it had me saying ""would you please just advance the plot? I get it already."" Another problem I have with this series and this was also a problem with the last season...it has a recap episode. I am going to come out and say that for both seasons of Chihayafuru, they can be deemed the most pointless recap episodes of all-time. The way the series is paced, it isn\'t necessary. Everything that happened in the first half of the series is still fresh in the viewer\'s minds. It\'s a major beef for me as a viewer because I\'m also considering that this is practically a waste of the viewer\'s time and the producer\'s money.At the end of the day, I will say this about Madhouse\'s Chihayfuru 2. The first season caught my attention, the second season completely immersed me into the characters and story. I went from barely wanting a 2nd season to completely looking forward to a 3rd season. As far as a recommendation, I would recommend this series if you do like slower paced anime with more of a character focus much like Spice + Wolf, or sports themed but not really anime like Capeta. I would also recommend watching the first season before taking this one on. While I know there are some anime you can pick up on and I\'m sure Chihayafuru 2 is a series you can pick up on if you skip the first season, this series is strongly connected with events that happened in the first season and ends up being a driving force throughout the series. Even if the first season becomes tiring and mundane at times, I recommend you stick with it because it starts paying off in season 2. Overall, I will say Chihayafuru 2 is so far one of the best anime I\'ve seen in 2013 and I\'d give it my highest recommendation. season.The strength of this series revolves around its animation in regards to the characters.

Overall, I will say Chihayafuru 2 is so far one of the best anime I\'ve seen in 2013 and I\'d give it my highest recommendation.', 'Ok I have to admit, the first season of Chihayafuru got me hooked, I knew that season 3 was coming and I wanted to wait until it came out to start season 2. I really like the dub voice actors so I wanted to make sure the dub for S3 was going to be soon but it\'s not even confirmed at this point, here\'s to hoping but I am willing to go through and see the sub instead if that\'s what it takes. I eventually got to the point of having dreams about Chihaya and I ended up just saying ""Y\'know, I\'ve been really wanting...this, enough holding myself back, it\'s time."" And here we are, season 2. How does this season stack up against how highly I held the first season? Let\'s find out. (btw, this will include spoilers for season 1 because I assume you\'ve watched it if you\'re on this page, but won\'t include spoilers for season 2)First off, we have a new character, Hanano, she seems to be joining because of Taichi but ends up staying for more. You see we have Kanade who cares about the poems and their meaning but Hanano kind of builds off of that and ""feels"" what these poems have to offer, she can relate to what they say making them more memorable. In a way it helps Kanade see her downfalls and helps her character try to improve.Tsukuba is another new character and brings on the new technicalities and detail oriented sides of karuta. He knows another form of the game called ""second verse"" which is pretty much a whole different story because it\'s wooden cards, he has to work backwards (an interesting way to learn) and also it has different rules and such. So what\'s his motivation? To be the best? We\'ve heard that all before but here\'s the thing, he has siblings and they look up to him. Seeing a pattern? The opposite of Chihaya. For a team match, you need 5, but now there are 7 so you can imagine they explore what brings them together as a team and what splits them apart, what lineup works best and what order they should play in. It\'s a very interesting formula because they make a point of ""I don\'t want to leave you behind."" They make every single member feel welcome to every match and not just for tactical gain. It is interesting to note how each character take effect on each other\'s presence, it\'s very noticeable with Arata, Chihaya, and the Queen and how they affect each other in that triangle. It goes to show that it doesn\'t take much to have an effect on people so make it worth it. They even have these photographers that are pretty funny, they speak in synth like the \'Delightful Children From Down The Lane\' from Codename: Kids Next Door. So I\'ll rate the character category on the way the characters have grown, the new characters, and the way they\'ve worked as a team. I\'ll give it an 8.I like to see various backgrounds for the characters and how they add to the overall plot, how they work off of each other, and how they relate to karuta as a game. (Karuta or Caruta? I\'ve never figured it out, I look it up and it\'s a \'K\', but on their shirts it\'s a \'C\') Also I wanted to mention that it\'s clearer to me now that everything in this series happens for a reason, a loss isn\'t just a loss, there\'s a reason behind it, for either when they win later, go up against them again or what, it all seems relevant while last season it wasn\'t too clear of a future. Speaking of, I still can\'t decide which ship I\'ll sail.How do I talk about music when I already watched the first season and said that it complimented it and prevented it from being cringy? Well there are some new tracks that I\'ve heard and I\'m sorry because this is practically a crime but when those violins kick in...I just-I hear Randy Newman, there I said it, it reminds me of Toy Story at times. It\'s really good even without the violins though, other than one regular sang song late in the series that I didn\'t like so I\'m giving it a 9.They make a lot of reference to the last season like ""Remember this event?"" but in a way I think it\'s deserved because they use it to try and learn and do things differently. Some are obvious and they just blatantly tell you but to be honest as soon as I started watching the season, everything started flowing back to me on its own, no references needed. Another thing they bring up is team matches vs individual matches, it\'s more pronounced this time and in a way might amount to something even greater for next season.I\'ll tell you what, these episodes just go by, like each one could be an hour and I wouldn\'t mind, I get into it that much, it\'s one to binge. In some ways I think this season builds and improves on the last season but there were some big and more memorable moments last season, so enjoyment? 8I\'m not sure if it\'s just been that long since the last season but they go hard on the opponents in this season, they show all the different types of people who play karuta and I really love seeing that explored, I don\'t feel like it\'s even pandering, it just adds depth to these opponents who would be faceless otherwise.The story just follows the last season, it\'s all continuous so I\'ll rate it about an 8 (just like last season) though I forgot how inspiring it is and determined it makes me feel, I love it. Same with Art/Animation, it was about the same so an 8. Looking forward to season 3! this, enough holding myself back, it\'s time."" And here we are, season 2. How does this season stack up against how highly I held the first season? Let\'s find out. (btw, this will include spoilers for season 1 because I assume you\'ve watched it if you\'re on this page, but won\'t include spoilers for season 2)First off, we have a new character, Hanano, she seems to be joining because of Taichi but ends up staying for more. You see we have Kanade who cares about the poems and their meaning but Hanano kind of builds off of that and ""feels"" what these poems have to offer, she can relate to what they say making them more memorable. In a way it helps Kanade see her downfalls and helps her character try to improve.Tsukuba is another new character and brings on the new technicalities and detail oriented sides of karuta. He knows another form of the game called ""second verse"" which is pretty much a whole different story because it\'s wooden cards, he has to work backwards (an interesting way to learn) and also it has different rules and such. So what\'s his motivation? To be the best? We\'ve heard that all before but here\'s the thing, he has siblings and they look up to him. Seeing a pattern? The opposite of Chihaya. For a team match, you need 5, but now there are 7 so you can imagine they explore what brings them together as a team and what splits them apart, what lineup works best and what order they should play in. It\'s a very interesting formula because they make a point of ""I don\'t want to leave you behind."" They make every single member feel welcome to every match and not just for tactical gain. It is interesting to note how each character take effect on each other\'s presence, it\'s very noticeable with Arata, Chihaya, and the Queen and how they affect each other in that triangle. It goes to show that it doesn\'t take much to have an effect on people so make it worth it. They even have these photographers that are pretty funny, they speak in synth like the \'Delightful Children From Down The Lane\' from Codename: Kids Next Door. So I\'ll rate the character category on the way the characters have grown, the new characters, and the way they\'ve worked as a team. I\'ll give it an 8.I like to see various backgrounds for the characters and how they add to the overall plot, how they work off of each other, and how they relate to karuta as a game.

Looking forward to season 3!', ""The second season picks up exactly where the first left off, so start off by reading my (and others') reviews of the first season.The second season continues to follow the Mizusawa high school Karuta club as the main characters progress into their second year at school. It introduces two new freshmen who join the Karuta club: The first is Hanano Sumire, a girl with zero interest in Karuta who only joined because she has a crush on Mashima, and does not attempt to hide that fact, but is willing to learn the game just for the sake of being close to him. The second is...Tsukuba Akihiro, a transfer student form Hokkaido, who has already played Karuta before, but unfortunately the Hokkaido version of Karuta uses different (wooden) cards and different rules (only the second verse of each poem is read), meaning that as far as mainland Karuta goes he's a beginner but unfortunately he thinks he's better than he actually is. Furthermore, he has three little brothers who idolize him, leading him to frequently trying to impress them even when it's really not appropriate.SPOILER ALERT: Minor spoilers will follow, though all only about the first season. If you've already watched the first season there will be no further spoilers here.The second season follows Mizusawa as they compete in the teams tournament, hoping to become champions, and their decisions how to have the newcomers participate as well. The tournament this year happens to attract a large amount of weirdos, leading to hilarious moments.On the individual level, Ayase starts analyzing the current Queen's game (almost to the point of obsession) as she starts to become serious about her dream of claiming the title. The season also follows Mashima, as he repeatedly tries to win an individual tournament in order to advance to A rank, fighting mainly against his usual terrible luck.Overall, this season, being the direct sequel of the first, gets in my opinion the exact same scores as the first.

All of my little issues that I pointed out in the last season were pretty much swept away in this season.My number one point of annoyance was that the anime wasn't very balanced to me. Last season, it felt like you didn't know whether the main focus was supposed to be on the matches or the characters. This season managed to pull off a nice medium between the two. The matches actually had weight and suspense, and the anime let you focus in on more than just one match per tournament. I'm very pleased the karuta...matches were paid the proper attention this season. I actually got to experience the losses and wins with the Mizusawa team.The characters didn't have such a heavy focus this season since their setup was all finished last season, but that wasn't a bad thing to me. You got to see the characters develop both through their matches and outside of their matches without it taking too much attention away from the competitive aspect of the anime.On top of that, the overall storyline this season flowed a lot better. The first season was about Arata, then the club, then the character relationships, then karuta. It was kind of a mess. This season, every aspect of the story-- whether it be the new club members, the team competitions, or Chihaya's solo development-- it all flowed really nicely to be one, cohesive story. This season really reignited my interest in the series that I gained from the first few flashback episodes in the first season.I also really enjoyed that Arata was an actual character in this season rather than this ambiguous figure that the first season made you care about only to ignore the rest of the time. Seeing Arata finally be fleshed out really helped me understand Chihaya and Taichi's feelings and developments.Overall, this season is definitely an improvement upon the last. The last season, while good, was obviously meant to lay groundwork for these characters' entering into their second year as a team. I'm glad that I gave this anime a shot because it's only gonna go up from here. matches were paid the proper attention this season.

Honestly, it’s even better in my memory than it is while I watching it, so although I’ll stick with my initial impression as an 8, it’s getting closer to a 9 for me right now.Like many other anime, there is a duality between the premise, karuta, and the relationships between the characters. I will address the former first.Karuta, although it seems relatively pointless to an American person like me, is portrayed in this anime to be more intense and complex than any other sport. The matches contain some of the most suspenseful...moments in anything I watched, with superpowers being replaced by unique skills shown by each of the members in Chihaya’s karuta club. When matches between two skilled players or teams or shown, it might as well be a fight to the death with the fast arm swinging and calculated precision. The grueling tension during a match is emphasized through the character’s inner thoughts, worries, and analyzing. If there was one complaint to be had, it’s that sometimes the matches drag on for an excessively long time. For example, in season 2 the last two matches of the team tournament took up a whole nine episodes. I’m pretty sure that’s longer than what it would take in real life. However, the length is not too bad that it brings down the show.On the flip side, there is a myriad of unique and meaningful characters. One of the most important aspects of this show is about growth. The karuta club brings together misfit high school students into a competitive, tight-knit group where each person has changed since they first joined. However, the magnifying lens are focused on three key characters: Chihaya, Taichi, and Arata.Underlying the karuta, there is a heavily implied love triangle throughout the entire series. But rather than being cliche, seeing the situation through different perspectives is intriguing and effective. Arata is the least expounded upon, as unlike the other two he is miles away and really gets the most attention during the past in elementary school. Taichi is on the other side of the spectrum, with his crush on Chihaya being painfully obvious to the viewer even though Chihaya herself is oblivious. In a way his unrequited love serves to balance his otherwise perfect character (popular, good-looking, athletic, intelligent) by showing his jealousy of Arata whenever Chihaya mentions him and his own insecurities that causes him to keep silent to Chihaya.Meanwhile Chihaya is someone that immediately stands out as being exaggerated when the other characters seem more realistic. She devotes her whole life to karuta and nothing else. After ever match, win or lose, she starts crying a bucket of tears. Additionally I found the where she repeated Taichi’s name several times when they first reunited a bit awkward, but looking back her quirkiness was not a mistake-- it was an intentional decision. Chihaya, rather than just being about karuta, actually embodies the joys of youth. Whether it being committed to a goal, or having fun with friends, Chihaya is a vibrant character in a colorful world.The visuals were very nice (although I found Kana-chan’s forehead was distractingly large), and the colors really brought out the mood in each scene. Especially beautiful were the depictions of the different poems, which gave me some insight on why Kana-chan appreciates poetry so much.I have no faults with the soundtrack either. Whether it be the tension in an important match or the bonding between the group, the music says it all. The main theme might have been a bit overused, but it’s now one of my favorite anime music anyways so I don’t mind. I can’t really say much for the OP and ED, since those are not my specialty by any means, but I did enjoy both season’s ED.Overall this show was very enjoyable, and I recommend to anyone who wants to see a group of friends learning to grow closer together, a highly competitive sports game, or a little bit of both.

Although I still don't get Karuta that well. This anime is still amazing. I found myself cheering for the characters, yelling, crying, and laughing with them. Their pain and struggles became mine. I even learned from the teacher who is watching over the karuta club. The characters are amazing as well. A lot of character development. They're very relatable even if you don't play karuta. The only thing is that this season has a lot of minutes going over past episodes even two episodes reflect back to what...happened. happened."", ""This review applies to the entire Chihayafuru series.In my humble opinion, Chihayafuru does a few things very very well. The first thing that comes to mind is pacing. The pacing in this series was not necessarily perfect, but not far from it. Starting from the very first episode, the hook pulled me right into the world of Karuta.Even while Chihaya's karuta addiction might start tasting metallic due to its constant repetitive nature, the series still remains interesting due to the constant character development. Every episode is developing character(s) and the way it is done almost lets you relate on a personal level. The end...of each episode is either a perfectly timed cliffhanger, or a victory which just leaves you feeling immensely satisfied. Think of it as having the excitement of watching sport, but with rehearsed narration and looking like art.The two aspects of Chihayafuru which could perhaps be improved are sound and art. Firstly, the soundtracks themselves are very good, and despite the repetitive usage of certain soundtracks during intense moments, they still create the desired atmosphere. The only problem is variation. The lack of variation causes you to realise just how repetitive the soundtracks can become, and like any other type of music, listening to it too much takes away the enjoyment.The art could be better. However, it doesn't have to be. The art is only there to support the story, and the scenery, especially when paired with kana-chan poetry reading, is already very good. It is surprising how quickly you can get used to the uncommon art style.All in all, very good series, came from ProZD, stayed for smiling glasses boy from Fukui, Karuta Addict and handsome unlucky guy who is actually about my height. of each episode is either a perfectly timed cliffhanger, or a victory which just leaves you feeling immensely satisfied.

This was the right idea to fix its “sometimes too fast” pacing, but the execution had a lot to be desired. There was too much padding this season; the start to most episodes would be the last minute or two of the previous one. There were also multiple times where a character would reflect on their ENTIRE journey after a victory or defeat, which would take a few minutes to do. The games are drawn out more, which adds to the tension and gives the audience a chance to...reflect on the characters during their matches. The national tournament was so exciting and I never wanted the characters to win more. The romance is still not at the forefront yet, but it is bubbling more than in season one. The characters are still endearing. I love how Arata has an accent, as many anime wouldn’t care to have a detail like that. More typical sports themes, and basically forgetting the theme of how the West is influencing Japan to stray away from its roots that the previous season opened the door to. I probably overanalyzed anyway. Season two improves upon multiple aspects from season one, but doesn’t really expand upon those opened doors from the previous installment as much as I would have liked. Still a solid addition to the franchise. reflect on the characters during their matches. The national tournament was so exciting and I never wanted the characters to win more.

Still a solid addition to the franchise.', ""Chihayafuru's second season is a seamless continuation of the first, which is both high praise and criticism since it builds on the strengths of its first season yet does not really iron out any of the flaws. Although the sports side of the show is still done excellently, the heavy focus on it creates a sense of imbalance in the narrative since the josei romance is noticeably absent for most of the season. While by no means a dealbreaker since the Karuta tournaments are deeply compelling, the intense focus makes the season feel as if it is no longer living up to its promise as...both a sports and romance narrative. Though the series retains an overall sense of balance, it is becoming clear that it is ill-suited to being divided into seasons from its original serialised format.  It is really meant to be a continuously running story with few narrative subdivisions. Despite that, Chihayafuru 2 is still undoubtedly an improvement, and more importantly, understands how to build on its existing story.An essential step Chihayafuru 2 takes is to establish its new status quo for the school year instead of merely continuing the current dynamics. The introduction of Sumire and Tsukuba both excellently supports the established cast and add new dimensions to the narrative. In particular, Sumire is perhaps the strongest addition since she fills a missing female role in the narrative thus far.  She is essential in magnifying the romantic elements of the series as the only person who is overtly interested in pursuing it and as an 'outsider' to the world of karuta. Although the audience is never under the impression her affection for Taichi will go anywhere, she serves an important supporting role for his character. One that pushes him to consider his relationship with Chihaya and Arata further. Sumire also serves as a compliment to Kanade's character, who previously had no one to discuss romance with, Chihaya being as ditsy as she is. Although this season does not further the relationships of our main cast directly, Sumire's introduction and interactions with Taichi and Kanade serve as a reminder and means to examine their feelings in more detail. In this, Chihayafuru understands that the entire narrative cannot just centre around furthering the goals of their protagonist, be it in karuta or romantically.Part of this is simply good storytelling to avoid the appearance of the world revolving around the main characters. But a larger part is understanding the requirements and constraints of their setting. Although the high school environment can feel far too ubiquitous in anime, it is a significant feature of life in Japan. Instead of just using it as window dressing, Chihayafuru justifies its choice in setting by having its characters and plot involve the specific challenges of a high school student. In particular, the dynamic of becoming seniors, and to an extent leaders, as they advance each grade.  It integrates this into its plot and embraces it as an essential part of its setting that it needs to address. Perhaps this should be a basic expectation, but with so many shows surrounding high school, it is remarkable that so many fail in this step. Tsukuba poses a minor complication as the quintessential unruly junior, essentially challenging the main cast to grow as characters to better manage and understand him. This new dynamic helps propel character growth since they are no longer just dealing with their peers. With enough members to swap people out of their tournament lineup, it challenges the characters to consider why they play Karuta and their goals. It gives us greater insight into what drives the characters, like Komano's desire to be a team player and Chihaya's unbridled love for Karuta that she wants to share with everyone. This all works to make Chihayafuru's narrative organic, concerned with following the lives of students who are serious about Karuta instead of a sports show that happens to be in high school for one reason or another.Despite the superb development of the main cast, the flaws and limitations of the previous season are still apparent. While the first season established the love triangle and built tension around it, the second season neither relieves nor furthers any of that. While not necessarily a problem, it reaches a point where the show feels scared or unable to have Taichi, Chihaya and Arata interact for an extended time without detonating all the romantic tension. This bogs down the show's pacing since it draws out the love triangle instead of having it evolve as their relationships with each other change. Although it is exceedingly difficult to manage the romance and sports elements simultaneously, it feels like Chihayafuru does not even attempt to and merely alternates between the two, and not with equal emphasis. While the romance and competitive elements are still done well in isolation, it feels less and less like they complement each other with how little interaction there is. In essence, Arata's presence is almost entirely divorced from the competitive goals of the cast at Misuzawa High yet essential for the romance elements of the story, all of which creates a miuld disjoint between the story threads.Similarly, Shinobu feels distinctly underused who, along with Arata, suffers from a lack of screen time. Although she was positioned superbly at the start of the series, carrying a mysterious and overwhelming air to her, that can only last so long. Without the benefit of having an extensive flashback dedicated to her like Arata, it is hard to say Shinobu is positioned well as a rival to Chihaya. If anything, she feels like a plot device or obstacle instead of another character at times due to sheer isolation from everyone else. While this is part of her character arc, the lack of understanding from her perspective makes her seem either undeveloped or unintelligible. Only made worse by how much characterisation some of Chihaya's one-off opponents get through still rather clumsy perspective changes.  This lack of development also leaves the connection between Arata and Shinobu feeling more like a red herring than a compelling plot element. It is both underdeveloped given how little screen time the two of them have and is not explored to its full potential, either as an additional romantic complication or a rival/friendship B-plot that could flesh out both their characters.Where Chihayafuru 2 then chooses to dedicate most of its run time is in the Karuta matches themselves. Although superbly done, the overwhelming focus on them does gradually detract from other story elements. Over half the episodes in the season are almost entirely dedicated to Karuta matches. While a step in the right direction since the previous seasons feels like it skimps too much on matches, this feels like an overcorrection with too little time dedicated to character elements. The almost immediate dive into the Tokyo regionals robs the new characters of some breathing room to better established themselves. During the tournament itself, the characters focus squarely on the problem of their upcoming matches and less on their interpersonal relationships. Although this is also a testament to how compelling the individual games are written and animated since they effectively carry most of the season, it gives the distinct impression that the series focuses more on its plot elements instead of character.This further contributes to the continued choppy sense of pacing since the season does not end after its natural climax. With most of the focus on the journey of the Mizusawa Karuta Club as a group, the end of the national team tournament would be the natural place to close the season. Yet, the show still continues with the individual tournament after nationals. This is likely an unavoidable limitation as the tournament schedule in real life is established this way. However, this robs all the tension from the individual tournament as the stakes are almost non-existent compared to nationals. Worse, with Shinobu and Arata now playing, the viewer is never under the impression that Chihaya will make it very far, deflating much of the anticipation. While the show pivots to another important climax: if Taichi will win the B-class tournament and finally make it to class A, the lack of build-up compared to the team championship results in it falling somewhat flat. Although this does not come out of nowhere, it lacks an emotional throughline since this relates to his relationship with Chihaya and Arata instead of his objective as the president of the Mizusawa club. As a result, the emotional beats of the season feel off since it is trying to address two different threads that have become increasingly divorced from each other. While this could be expected in a serialised Manga, it is hard to digest in an anime since each season does not feel like a cohesive narrative.Even with some of these failings, the narrative and presentation of the show are still compelling enough to overcome them. In no small part helped by the superb and consistent characterisation of the cast from both seasons. However, some of the manga elements the show carries over, while effective, are now undoubtedly hamstringing Chihayafuru. The use of manga like text to convey the characters thoughts or information without using dialogue feels extreme unsubtle. While clearly efficient and even effective for comedic situations, some of the details delivered could be easily inferred, while others are important tidbits that feel as if they should be delivered diegetically for greater emphasis.At the same time, the constant use of head jumping and perspective changes is still an issue. Because of the back and forth use during matches, it still feels much more intrusive than simply shifting character perspective for a different scene within the episode. However, there is a marked improvement in its employment since the perspective shifts are done through an interesting lens and used with largely compelling characters. This can still feel cheap since there are times it is abundantly clear Chihaya or the Mizusawa club's opponents are unimportant characters in the larger plot. It cannot help but feel time and effort is wasted attempting to give them the semblance of a compelling background when a much simpler explanation would have sufficed. This, combined with the gradual overuse of musical stings makes certain matches feel far too drawn out. At the same time, they remain oddly compelling, which is also an indication that the series as a whole is doing something very right and that these are more blemishes than serious problems. This strong, emotional, almost nostalgic, quality still permiates the series into its second season. Perhaps best exemplified by the visuals and music in its new opening. It is this earnest quality, eminating from the show, and in particular from Chihaya's character that still serves as its foundation and the source of its compelling nature. It overrides most of its flaws to produce an emotional quality that only the best stories can achieve.Overall, Chihayafuru 2 maintains the superb quality of its first season, though it shifts some of its priorities around. While it feels distinctly imbalanced, it is also undoubtedly excellent in the areas it chooses to focus on. Being able to maintain a compelling tension for multiple Karuta matches in a row is no easy feat. In a way, it also demonstrates how the show builds off its first season since the character groundwork was done there. Although the series improvements push it into a 9 out of 10, it is just barely in that range and has definitely hit its ceiling. While many of Chihayafuru's flaws are easily forgivable or entirely understandable, it also has too much apparent missed potential to say it can ever reach a 10. While still a great show, at the pinnacle of the sports and josei genre, the second season makes clear that this is its limits, with most of its flaws established to be more or less permanent. Without melding its two genres together, its hard to say it should be a 10. And Chihayafuru seems to be content shuffling its priorities around in each season to manage them, leaving it as a great show, but not quite excellent. both a sports and romance narrative. Though the series retains an overall sense of balance, it is becoming clear that it is ill-suited to being divided into seasons from its original serialised format.  It is really meant to be a continuously running story with few narrative subdivisions. Despite that, Chihayafuru 2 is still undoubtedly an improvement, and more importantly, understands how to build on its existing story.An essential step Chihayafuru 2 takes is to establish its new status quo for the school year instead of merely continuing the current dynamics. The introduction of Sumire and Tsukuba both excellently supports the established cast and add new dimensions to the narrative. In particular, Sumire is perhaps the strongest addition since she fills a missing female role in the narrative thus far.  She is essential in magnifying the romantic elements of the series as the only person who is overtly interested in pursuing it and as an 'outsider' to the world of karuta. Although the audience is never under the impression her affection for Taichi will go anywhere, she serves an important supporting role for his character. One that pushes him to consider his relationship with Chihaya and Arata further. Sumire also serves as a compliment to Kanade's character, who previously had no one to discuss romance with, Chihaya being as ditsy as she is. Although this season does not further the relationships of our main cast directly, Sumire's introduction and interactions with Taichi and Kanade serve as a reminder and means to examine their feelings in more detail. In this, Chihayafuru understands that the entire narrative cannot just centre around furthering the goals of their protagonist, be it in karuta or romantically.Part of this is simply good storytelling to avoid the appearance of the world revolving around the main characters. But a larger part is understanding the requirements and constraints of their setting. Although the high school environment can feel far too ubiquitous in anime, it is a significant feature of life in Japan. Instead of just using it as window dressing, Chihayafuru justifies its choice in setting by having its characters and plot involve the specific challenges of a high school student. In particular, the dynamic of becoming seniors, and to an extent leaders, as they advance each grade.  It integrates this into its plot and embraces it as an essential part of its setting that it needs to address. Perhaps this should be a basic expectation, but with so many shows surrounding high school, it is remarkable that so many fail in this step. Tsukuba poses a minor complication as the quintessential unruly junior, essentially challenging the main cast to grow as characters to better manage and understand him. This new dynamic helps propel character growth since they are no longer just dealing with their peers. With enough members to swap people out of their tournament lineup, it challenges the characters to consider why they play Karuta and their goals. It gives us greater insight into what drives the characters, like Komano's desire to be a team player and Chihaya's unbridled love for Karuta that she wants to share with everyone. This all works to make Chihayafuru's narrative organic, concerned with following the lives of students who are serious about Karuta instead of a sports show that happens to be in high school for one reason or another.Despite the superb development of the main cast, the flaws and limitations of the previous season are still apparent. While the first season established the love triangle and built tension around it, the second season neither relieves nor furthers any of that. While not necessarily a problem, it reaches a point where the show feels scared or unable to have Taichi, Chihaya and Arata interact for an extended time without detonating all the romantic tension. This bogs down the show's pacing since it draws out the love triangle instead of having it evolve as their relationships with each other change. Although it is exceedingly difficult to manage the romance and sports elements simultaneously, it feels like Chihayafuru does not even attempt to and merely alternates between the two, and not with equal emphasis. While the romance and competitive elements are still done well in isolation, it feels less and less like they complement each other with how little interaction there is. In essence, Arata's presence is almost entirely divorced from the competitive goals of the cast at Misuzawa High yet essential for the romance elements of the story, all of which creates a miuld disjoint between the story threads.Similarly, Shinobu feels distinctly underused who, along with Arata, suffers from a lack of screen time. Although she was positioned superbly at the start of the series, carrying a mysterious and overwhelming air to her, that can only last so long. Without the benefit of having an extensive flashback dedicated to her like Arata, it is hard to say Shinobu is positioned well as a rival to Chihaya. If anything, she feels like a plot device or obstacle instead of another character at times due to sheer isolation from everyone else. While this is part of her character arc, the lack of understanding from her perspective makes her seem either undeveloped or unintelligible. Only made worse by how much characterisation some of Chihaya's one-off opponents get through still rather clumsy perspective changes.  This lack of development also leaves the connection between Arata and Shinobu feeling more like a red herring than a compelling plot element. It is both underdeveloped given how little screen time the two of them have and is not explored to its full potential, either as an additional romantic complication or a rival/friendship B-plot that could flesh out both their characters.Where Chihayafuru 2 then chooses to dedicate most of its run time is in the Karuta matches themselves. Although superbly done, the overwhelming focus on them does gradually detract from other story elements. Over half the episodes in the season are almost entirely dedicated to Karuta matches. While a step in the right direction since the previous seasons feels like it skimps too much on matches, this feels like an overcorrection with too little time dedicated to character elements. The almost immediate dive into the Tokyo regionals robs the new characters of some breathing room to better established themselves. During the tournament itself, the characters focus squarely on the problem of their upcoming matches and less on their interpersonal relationships. Although this is also a testament to how compelling the individual games are written and animated since they effectively carry most of the season, it gives the distinct impression that the series focuses more on its plot elements instead of character.This further contributes to the continued choppy sense of pacing since the season does not end after its natural climax. With most of the focus on the journey of the Mizusawa Karuta Club as a group, the end of the national team tournament would be the natural place to close the season. Yet, the show still continues with the individual tournament after nationals. This is likely an unavoidable limitation as the tournament schedule in real life is established this way. However, this robs all the tension from the individual tournament as the stakes are almost non-existent compared to nationals. Worse, with Shinobu and Arata now playing, the viewer is never under the impression that Chihaya will make it very far, deflating much of the anticipation. While the show pivots to another important climax: if Taichi will win the B-class tournament and finally make it to class A, the lack of build-up compared to the team championship results in it falling somewhat flat. Although this does not come out of nowhere, it lacks an emotional throughline since this relates to his relationship with Chihaya and Arata instead of his objective as the president of the Mizusawa club. As a result, the emotional beats of the season feel off since it is trying to address two different threads that have become increasingly divorced from each other. While this could be expected in a serialised Manga, it is hard to digest in an anime since each season does not feel like a cohesive narrative.Even with some of these failings, the narrative and presentation of the show are still compelling enough to overcome them. In no small part helped by the superb and consistent characterisation of the cast from both seasons. However, some of the manga elements the show carries over, while effective, are now undoubtedly hamstringing Chihayafuru. The use of manga like text to convey the characters thoughts or information without using dialogue feels extreme unsubtle. While clearly efficient and even effective for comedic situations, some of the details delivered could be easily inferred, while others are important tidbits that feel as if they should be delivered diegetically for greater emphasis.At the same time, the constant use of head jumping and perspective changes is still an issue.

It's not even so much that much has changed, but that there's a distinct lack of change on an interpersonal level. Personally, I think a lot of them have shown individual and distinct changes.

Sumire and Tsukuba have certainly shown some development, though they are also new to this season.

200,"[""Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door is a great addition to the Cowboy Bebop series, but no more. It is by no means a sequel, and after watching it, I found that it's best watched in the middle of the series, and not neccesarily at the end. If it's got a specific place or not, that I don't know, but that's not very important at any rate, and if you've watched the entire series, it shouldn't be hard to mentally place it inside the series anyway.This time, a terrorist possesses a weapon capable of killing countless people, and there's a bounty of 300 million...woolongs on him; the largest bounty ever given. Of course, this means that our heroes will chase him. And so starts the process of gathering information, meeting and getting to know people related to the bounty in some way, and eventually, squaring off against him in a final fight. Oh, and throw in a save-the-world thing this time, and there you have the movie. Nothing really new, a formula that's been used several times. There's also details here and there left unexplained, and things  may just happen for no reason at the rare occasion. Its 120 minutes might be a little too long to some, but it never came off as boring at any point to me; they certainly did a good job of fleshing out those 120 minutes.Though, that may be credited more to the characters than the plot itself, as the movie threw some really interesting characters at us. The orignal cast is, well, pretty much the same as they always are, the same characters which you (probably) got to love while watching the original series. As for the movie characters, we have for example Vincent, the main bad guy. He's quite the interesting fellow, though the more I think about it, the more I can't help but feel that I've experienced his type somewhat before - he's got a mysterious past; a forgotten love included, he's going to kill loads of people for no good reason, and he blathers out sentences about religion and whatnot. Nevertheless, he comes off as an interesting character, mostly because of him being similar to Spike - both in physical prowess and their considering themselves 'dead' men due to past events. Then we have Electra, Vincent's past love once forgotten. She remembers him though, and well, she wants him to remember her as well. We can see where that's heading...The animation quality is superb; its detail and overall quality is unmistakably a work done by people who knows what they are doing. Be it backgrounds or landscapes, they're all top-notch. Lighting effects are good, and more than I'd exect from something out of 2001, and the overall quality of special effects are great; much, much better than the original series. The character designs are the same old, with some improvements, and they work very well with this anime and movie. The character motions and their fluidity are great, and the few action scenes in the movie are done so well that I could probably learn some nice figthing moves merely from studying them.

It's not marvelous, but it's great, and a must-see movie for any Cowboy Bebop fan."", ""I'm never that comfortable with films of series.  Mostly, that's because all too often a film of a series consists of some kind of edited-all-to-hell clip show that tries and totally fails to boil down the story of a long series to a relatively much shorter film.  Knockin' on Heaven's Door isn't that, which is very much in its favour.  Rather, it's basically like a two-hour &quot;lost episode&quot; that belongs somewhere in the middle of the series - without spoiling anything, by the end of the series, there's characters missing who are still present in this film.Another point in the film's favour...is that it's pretty much equally accessible for existing fans and those unfamiliar with the characters.  While there's plenty of details that might be lost or not fully comprehensible for new viewers, by and large the film stands up well as a stand alone drama, introducing its characters and their situation.  However, this in a way exposes another major weakness of films of series.  Series are, by nature, episodic.  They devote an episode to introducing a character or exploring their personalities.  Once this is done, they generally have plot episodes, in which the main thrust of the series is pursued, and then they have one-shot episodes that have our characters in some kind of interesting situation, but which is basically unrelated to the plot - if there is one.  Films, by contrast, do all of this at once.  The proceedure is totally different, and a director or scriptwriter used to a series format adapts less well to a film format.   Knockin' on Heaven's Door exemplifies this - while the film as it is works, it's more obvious and cumbersome than a film directed by a director used to a feature-length format.The storyline, also, suffers in this way.  It's not that it's a bad story, in fact it might make a great two- or three-part episode, but as a film, the material comes across as stretched, holey and lacking in substance.  It's also remarkable in that it's not half as quirky or original as Cowboy Bebop's famously eclectic mixtures of ideas: biological terrorism unleashed by a madman with a mysterious and sinister military past, fascinated by death and bent on destroying the world, with cod philosophical pretentions to fil gaps between action and a garnish of some fashionable christian mythology. It's all very generic really, and frankly the only things that make this Cowboy Bebop and not something much more generic are the familiar characters, who are luckily strong enough to make the thing hang together.  The new characters are not much to speak of, either - Vincent the aforementioned madman, a hacker accomplice, a Moroccan information seller and, of course, Electra, a tough, wildcard femme fatale with a mysterious connection to our antagonist.  Electra comes off as the best realised of these, and, perhaps not coincidentally, closest to a series character (though she's a dead ringer for a more mature version of BGC2040's Priss as well).  Vincent seems very like main series antagonist Vicious stripped of his hatred of Spike, which is to say, not that special and a bit rabid and foaming for credibility.The film drags.  It's just too long.  What this is primarily due to is unclear; maybe an over-developed story with far too much exposition (every character seems to need every other to explain nanomachines to them, it seems.  We, however, do not), or perhaps the increasingly egregious and segmented action scenes (why are there spitfires on Mars?  Who knows, let's cut back to Spike being pursued by military jets for no apparent reason!), or it could be the ponderous attempts to fashion some sort of existential aspect to the story (&quot;I'm not insane, the rest of the world is.&quot; - oh really?  You don't look thirteen years old, Vincent, but you sound it).  Philosophical-minded action films are not especially uncommon; good and effective ones are extremely rare.  Suffice it to say that I was surprised and rather disappointed when the apparent climax occured and passed with a good half an hour left on the clock.As I say, the film hangs almost completely on the main characters.  It would have been unthinkable to not bring the original cast in for this gig too (can't speak for the dub cast, don't know), and they all acquit themselves just as well as they do in the series.  Music, too, such a central part of the series, is again provided by Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts; while the styles used in and prominence given to the music may not be to everyone's tastes, the versatility and range Kanno's score covers while still retaining a high basic quality standard is nothing short of incredible.  Visually, the quality seems to have been kicked up a notch; the animation of the series was never bad, but the film is sumptuous and extremely well detailed.However, one of my main bones of contention remains.  The art design is realistic, unapologetically multicultural and sort of grimy, very credible in its way, but under even cursory analysis, it's illogical in the extreme.  Why is Mars covered in early twentieth-century New York-style tenement blocks and labyrinthine Moroccan markets?  Has anyone remembered that it has one third of earth's gravity?  Is there, in fact, any reason for this to be set on Mars at all, other than to tie in all these diverse elements?  It's sci-fi doing what sci-fi does most often and least well - making half-baked stuff up to accomodate its ideas, with no thought for maintainance of disbelief suspension.I was never as bowled over by Cowboy Bebop as many people seem to have been.  Overall I liked it, certainly, in fact I thought some of it was absolutely excellent, but other parts I thought were pretty terrible, and it was quickly clear that the series was never going to be &quot;a classic&quot; in my eyes the way it is for lots of others.  This was primarily because of its disjointedness and apparent lack of story direction, and the same is true of this film.  Now, after watching it, I'm left with the same &quot;...well, so what?&quot; feeling a significant amount of the series gave me, but because of the length and the negative impact it has, I have comparatively more holes to pick at as well.  Perhaps if you're a real fan, this film has more to offer, but overall, for me, while I'd not actually call it bad, this doesn't reach the already kind of saggy standard the series set. is that it's pretty much equally accessible for existing fans and those unfamiliar with the characters.  While there's plenty of details that might be lost or not fully comprehensible for new viewers, by and large the film stands up well as a stand alone drama, introducing its characters and their situation.  However, this in a way exposes another major weakness of films of series.  Series are, by nature, episodic.  They devote an episode to introducing a character or exploring their personalities.  Once this is done, they generally have plot episodes, in which the main thrust of the series is pursued, and then they have one-shot episodes that have our characters in some kind of interesting situation, but which is basically unrelated to the plot - if there is one.  Films, by contrast, do all of this at once.  The proceedure is totally different, and a director or scriptwriter used to a series format adapts less well to a film format.   Knockin' on Heaven's Door exemplifies this - while the film as it is works, it's more obvious and cumbersome than a film directed by a director used to a feature-length format.The storyline, also, suffers in this way.  It's not that it's a bad story, in fact it might make a great two- or three-part episode, but as a film, the material comes across as stretched, holey and lacking in substance.  It's also remarkable in that it's not half as quirky or original as Cowboy Bebop's famously eclectic mixtures of ideas: biological terrorism unleashed by a madman with a mysterious and sinister military past, fascinated by death and bent on destroying the world, with cod philosophical pretentions to fil gaps between action and a garnish of some fashionable christian mythology. It's all very generic really, and frankly the only things that make this Cowboy Bebop and not something much more generic are the familiar characters, who are luckily strong enough to make the thing hang together.  The new characters are not much to speak of, either - Vincent the aforementioned madman, a hacker accomplice, a Moroccan information seller and, of course, Electra, a tough, wildcard femme fatale with a mysterious connection to our antagonist.  Electra comes off as the best realised of these, and, perhaps not coincidentally, closest to a series character (though she's a dead ringer for a more mature version of BGC2040's Priss as well).  Vincent seems very like main series antagonist Vicious stripped of his hatred of Spike, which is to say, not that special and a bit rabid and foaming for credibility.The film drags.  It's just too long.  What this is primarily due to is unclear; maybe an over-developed story with far too much exposition (every character seems to need every other to explain nanomachines to them, it seems.  We, however, do not), or perhaps the increasingly egregious and segmented action scenes (why are there spitfires on Mars?  Who knows, let's cut back to Spike being pursued by military jets for no apparent reason!), or it could be the ponderous attempts to fashion some sort of existential aspect to the story (&quot;I'm not insane, the rest of the world is.&quot; - oh really?  You don't look thirteen years old, Vincent, but you sound it).  Philosophical-minded action films are not especially uncommon; good and effective ones are extremely rare.

I suggest that if you’re planning to watch Cowboy Bebop – Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door, you should watch after you get to the episode when Ed is introduced. You just need to get to know all 4 major characters to understand the movie.I didn’t like it as much as the series, mostly because the series kept me interested by introducing new plot lines in each episode. Having to focus on one specific plot for 120 minutes was a bit exhausting. It has a nice plot – throughout the movie you’ll get why “Knockin’ on...Heaven’s Door” is part of the title. I also found the plot to be timely. Terrorism is a problem that’s been widespread throughout the world for years, and it’s interesting to see a group of bounty hunters trying to do something good for mankind.The characters are back, of course. They’re still the same as they were in the series. 2 more major characters are introduced throughout the movie. The villain is Vincent Volaju, a mysterious terrorist with a forgotten past. He is definitely convincing as a villain, at least I think so. Electra is also a character added to the mix. I didn’t really like her, mostly because she looks like a guy, but her presence is important to the story. The  original voice actors are also back to reprise their respective roles. I would have been mad if they changed the voice actors.I think one of the major innovations in the movie is the visuals. The visuals are 10 times more stunning than in the series, all thanks to the collaboration with BONES studio. I guess it may have something to do with the fact that it was produced in 2001, and 2001 animation definitely improved since 1998. The screenplay was also as great as before.Yoko Kanno came back to do the music again, but I have to say I’m a bit disappointed. There were less tracks than there were in the series, and there were a lot of scenes where there was no background music at all. That was a rare occurrence in the series. The opening theme, ""Ask DNA"" by The Seatbelts featuring Raju Ramayya and the ending theme ""Gotta Knock a Little Harder"" by The Seatbelts featuring Mai Yamane, were really nicely done though.Obviously, I liked the series better, but that may have something to do with the fact that I finished the series first before watching the movie.

Why would I be disappointed? Well, mostly because many episodes almost feel like fillers, they don\'t support character development and some enemies just minor criminals/bounties and those villains rarely have interesting characters.After sometime, I decided to watch the CB movie. And I would say the movie was very good. This movie has the elements that some cowboy bebop episodes lack. Mostly the well developed story and characters(villains).Story (8/10)""Which one is dream? Which one is reality? A \'deadman\', searching...for that answer, tries to endanger the society. It is up to Spike and the gang to stop him"". Yup, that was pretty much the synopsis of the movie. Like the series, the story presents a sci-fi modern era where humans has lived in other planets. Our MCs (Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed), are bounty hunters. This time, they are trying to catch an unknown terrorist. Unlike the series, which lack episodic story development because they have only 20 minutes duration for one story, the movie has almost 2 hours duration. It really has a great difference to tell a story. The story plot is very well chronologically executed, and not rushed. We got to see a complex investigation, gaining information, interesting background story and past of the main villain, good action scenes, and a nice final conclusion of all of them. The big differences i felt most with the series are this movie presents us a nice built villains, well developed plot, bigger case and conflicts that put our MCs in critical situation, which rarely seen in the series.Art (9/10)Considering the time it was aired, I would say the animations are great. The backgrounds are nice and the movements were fluid. But what I like most is the character design. It was unique in my opinion, no moe, and it gives me more mature atmosphere from it.Sound (8/10)The sountrack is like the original series, the classic ones. Nice OP and ED. Soundtracks also fit well with the atmosphere of the scenes. Though a few scenes were quiet and don\'t have BGM in it. Voice acting is also good.Character (8/10)We got our MCs back, Spike and the gang, whose characters are the same with the series. Spike being a cool badass, Faye being selfish and ignorant, Jet who is sometimes being the most sane one, and Ed is.. crazy..What really caught my attentions was the main villain\'s character, Vincent. A man with an interesting past that leads to his interesting philosophy (which one is dream, which one is reality). To seek his answes he will do anything. Interesting terrorism, which he also left mystery to be solved. Above all that, he also really got some skills to overpower the main protagonist.Enjoyment (8/10)Yeah, let\'s make this one short. From the scores above I\'d say I really enjoy this movie. It was a nice watch and it has cured my disappointment of CB franchise.Overall (8/10)Cause the majority of above scores  i gave were 8s, then my overall score would be 8, which means really good. for that answer, tries to endanger the society.

It\'s got the same style, same humour, and even the same underlying melancholic feel. The production somehow manages to look even more expensive than the production of old, with the crisp animation shining through especially, featuring some fluid, breathtaking action sequences that\'s at least as good as anything in the series.Having the ""Cowboy Bebop"" tag in front of the movie\'s title is both a blessing and a curse for the movie. The blessing is that it...gets to use the great foundation set by the series. In particular, it\'s always good to see the colourful characters that make up the crew of the Bebop once more. I\'ve grown so fond of them it\'s like meeting old friends again - they\'ve not changed a bit. This movie is good in much the same way that the average single episode from the series is good - it\'s just a really well made action/adventure story.At the same time, it\'s only natural to start comparing this movie against the series... and this is where it falls considerably short. You see, the series is far greater than the sum of its parts - although each individual episode is very good in its own right, they are rarely spectacular with a few notable exceptions, and this movie ain\'t one of the exceptions. When you add all the episodes together, then you start seeing what makes ""Cowboy Bebop"" so brilliant - its variety. When you take this aspect away, the whole idea starts to break down. The ""Cowboy Bebop"" movie is supposed to feel like a longer story, but instead feels more like a normal length story stretched out to be film length - perhaps this is due to the fact that I\'ve come to expect a certain amount of freshness from the series\' constant genre switching, and obviously this freshness is lost when it comes to this movie.Still, most of the essence of ""Cowboy Bebop"" is still here, and it\'s enough to make ""Knockin\' on Heaven\'s Door"" a very good movie in its own right... but it just can\'t match the enjoyment and addictiveness offered by the series. As the final outing featuring the crew of the Bebop, it felt like a bit of an anti climax because it couldn\'t quite compare with the grand finale of the series. So I would advise other people to watch this before episode 23 of ""Cowboy Bebop"" and allow the ending of the series to finish the franchise in style. gets to use the great foundation set by the series.

This is a difficult task, but this movie did a pretty damn good job!Plot and characters: 8/10The plot obviously didn't have the time to create the same amount of character development, background, and depth that a 26 episode series has. However, the movie introduces a pretty decent antagonist with Vincent. Vincent is a bioterrorist who happens to bear a striking resemblance to Vlad the Impaler for whatever reason. He is a man haunted by a cruel past. This includes the brutal Titan War that Vicious and Gren also fought in during...the original series, as well as enduring horrendous biological experiments much like Gren. Unlike Gren, Vincent doesn't develop female sex charactericstics and instead is driven totally insane. However, unlike Vicious he retains some level of sympathy and isn't purely evil like our favorite katana weilding psychopath. Elektra is another character introduced in the movie that was a fun character with some awesome fight scenes. The plot is essentially that the Bebop crew must hunt its biggest bounty ever while saving Mars from a bioterrorism attack. The plot wraps up nicely and doesn't leave any dangling plot threads. It isn't the deepest story ever, but it works very well for an action movie. The fight scenes and action scenes are INCREDIBLE and the movie features in my opinion the best aerial dogfight of any movie...ever! I don't even care its a cartoon. It is the best!Animation and sound: 10/10This not only gives us the triumphant return of Bebop's amazing jazz soundtrack, but smoother animation and as mentioned previously, incredible action. This movie looks great, sounds great, and is an absolute joy to watch.Overall: 9/10This is a spinoff action movie for the Cowboy Bebop series, so like I mentioned earlier it doesn't really have time to establish the same depth as the main series.

It\'s slick animation, amazing voice acting, and captivating score offer in little in giving weight to this clinical mess. It bothers me to no end how something so enthralling still manages to make me question the time I put into it. Both the show and this film seem to have elements of quality but are surrounded by flashy imagery and boring motives. It\'s as though the best of the best qualities were point into 2 or 3 elements and the rest were hung up to dry in...the middle of winter. Is there a reason why something so good at times can be so bad at others? I don\'t know, but I know that it DOES happen, and Cowboy Bebop is one such franchise that is plagued with this conundrum.To sum up a lot of how I feel: At one point Jet says that ""this is bigger than ourselves.\' in regards to the conflict they are in. However, the world feels VERY small, the conflict seems VERY limited, and their contribution feels stilted and lightweight. I shook my head when he said this because of how absurd it was. Bigger than you guys? Are you kidding me? This is nothing, and right now you guys are a bunch of nothing. Nothing has really happened with any sense of coherence other than ""Let\'s have a reason to watch Spike kick some butt and throw jazz in the background.""Look, I like fight scenes as much as the next guy, and Cowboy Bebop has a tasteful enjoyment to how they execute their combat sequences, but everything else around such flashy perfection is absolutely NOT worth it, especially with this film. I was hoping that, since this was a small narrative, the film would be much stronger in terms of story in comparison to the show, but I was misled. Instead, I watched something that, at the end, I enjoyed the fact that I\'d never willingly watch this film on my own ever again.Art:This film has some great animation but I felt there was a lot lost in the setting. Everything feels very small despite the ""consequences"" being large. I couldn\'t help but figure that the story would have been better told in a corridor rather than on, what I would describe as colorless cityscapes. Something that the art can make in a narrative emphasizes the impact of the situations taking place. This was a missed opportunity and could have enhanced the story if these had been taken.Sound:Great VA work (watched in English, of course!) and an excellent soundtrack. Although there weren\'t any memorable tracks from the film, the same essence of pizazz is still there but the fact that the story is forgettable, the art is forgettable, and now the music itself fails to enhance the film really dampens any impact this film can have.Character:And if that weren\'t enough, holy cow the characters were definitely the worst part of the film. Everyone is very one-dimensional, the main villain is really uninteresting, the new hero character is as boring as the villain, and man alive I just couldn\'t care about any of the risky events. Since the film had to throw in every leading character, paired with the fact that they\'re risking life and death, any sense of threat was extinguished. I knew they were all going to live because the events of the film are set before the end of the show, so obviously, everyone was going to survive. That said, if they had only Spike and Jet in this film, then they could have had a cast of new characters which would enhance my sense of urgency when threats came into play.But, we don\'t get that.Enjoyment:This film borders on fan-service for those who just want to watch some rad. And, in some respect, that\'s what those people get. However, I didn\'t get anything from this movie, and I wish Blockbuster was still around cause then this would have been a $2 rental instead of a $12 Amazon purchase.((If you liked this review, check out my other reviews by going to my profile and clicking the \'reviews\' tab.

Instead, I watched something that, at the end, I enjoyed the fact that I\'d never willingly watch this film on my own ever again.Art:This film has some great animation but I felt there was a lot lost in the setting. Everything feels very small despite the ""consequences"" being large. I couldn\'t help but figure that the story would have been better told in a corridor rather than on, what I would describe as colorless cityscapes. Something that the art can make in a narrative emphasizes the impact of the situations taking place. This was a missed opportunity and could have enhanced the story if these had been taken.Sound:Great VA work (watched in English, of course!) and an excellent soundtrack. Although there weren\'t any memorable tracks from the film, the same essence of pizazz is still there but the fact that the story is forgettable, the art is forgettable, and now the music itself fails to enhance the film really dampens any impact this film can have.Character:And if that weren\'t enough, holy cow the characters were definitely the worst part of the film. Everyone is very one-dimensional, the main villain is really uninteresting, the new hero character is as boring as the villain, and man alive I just couldn\'t care about any of the risky events. Since the film had to throw in every leading character, paired with the fact that they\'re risking life and death, any sense of threat was extinguished. I knew they were all going to live because the events of the film are set before the end of the show, so obviously, everyone was going to survive. That said, if they had only Spike and Jet in this film, then they could have had a cast of new characters which would enhance my sense of urgency when threats came into play.But, we don\'t get that.Enjoyment:This film borders on fan-service for those who just want to watch some rad. And, in some respect, that\'s what those people get. However, I didn\'t get anything from this movie, and I wish Blockbuster was still around cause then this would have been a $2 rental instead of a $12 Amazon purchase.((If you liked this review, check out my other reviews by going to my profile and clicking the \'reviews\' tab.

It does not outshine the show, but does not sit in its shadow either.  It holds its own against any number of the more ""exquisite"" episodes of the main series.  (Biased me: They\'re all good to begin with, but you get my drift.)The movie technically/officially takes place between episodes 22 and...23 of the series, but does not affect the events of the main show in any way (or vice versa).  For this reason, it is a very versatile entry to the Bebop universe.The plot is fairly standard for an episode of Bebop and features the crew searching for bounties on Mars.  When a truck is detonated in the planet\'s capital city causing a huge spread of a biochemical weapon, a generous bounty is posted by the world\'s government for the capture of the unknown terrorists.  Obviously in their true typical form, the crew of Bebop doesn\'t miss a beat in responding to the call.  As the crew digs deeper and chases the mysterious terrorists, they discover however all is not as simple as it should be.The entire voice cast (both Sub and Dub) reunite for the film, as well as the welcomed return of the iconic Yoko Kano and her band The Seatbelts (who composed the music for the original show).  On top of these perfect garnishes, due to a higher budget, the animation is also simply a smoother version of the original show\'s material.  What cannot be liked here in the technical department?As I mentioned earlier about this film\'s versatility, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie works on multiple levels.  If one is trying on Bebop for size due to the amount of praise they have heard about the show, this is a great in-road to go with (this or episode 5 are my recommendations for starters).  Or, on an even more general plane of scope, many consider this a great film to give someone a taste of anime in general.  I wholeheartedly agree, this movie is that good (and yes, I\'m kind of biased as this is my favorite anime of all-time, in general).Unlike the show, we don\'t get 26 episodes to watch the characters of the Bebop crew develop and grow as we piece together their backstories/flush out their personalities.  However, the movie does a good job masking this, in the sense that it doesn\'t need to do it.  Whether you are unrelated to the show or not, the movie is still enjoyable and intriguing.  The characters are their classic dynamic selves (which is what makes the show so special).  The plot does lean on complexity, in terms of exposition, for the finer points...but for a first-time watcher it didn\'t bother me (and on return viewings, I\'ve since figured everything out).If you like Cowboy Bebop at all, there is no reason you will dislike this movie....none.  It flows as well as any given episodes of the show and even has a bit more ""grandiosity"" to it because of its status as a film.  It is definitely an action-filled blast.  Whether you missed it during your original watch through the main show, or picked this up where it works in episodic order, you won\'t be sorry you missed this special outing with the Bebop crew. 23 of the series, but does not affect the events of the main show in any way (or vice versa).

It\'s 5:21pm as I\'m writing this.  What i have to say I was a little disappointed to see little in the way of either cowboys or dancing in the feature of the same name (which came out in Japan in 2001, but hit U.S. theaters briefly in the spring of 2003), but that\'s ultimately probably for the best. In the world of Cowboy Bebop, it\'s the year 2071, a time when the Earth has become almost uninhabitable and everyone has moved out to other planets in the solar system, like Mars. The plucky little band of bounty hunters who...star in the film -- the closest thing to cowboys here -- are getting restless with picking up minor thugs for chump change. Fortunately for them, a terrorist explodes a tanker truck full of some germ agent on a crowded downtown highway - apparently they haven\'t fixed the traffic problem on Mars yet - killing dozens of people and getting a massive bounty put out on him.Vincent, the ""terrorist,"" baffles everyone, as he doesn\'t seem to have much of a motive, and might just be having anger management issues. Most of the Cowboy band - coolly magnetic Spike Spiegel, gruff Jet Black, and the very capable Faye Valentine - spreads out across the city to find out what the guy\'s problem is and what exactly what was the agent that he was using. It\'s a good excuse to show off the film\'s impeccable design, which incorporates familiar elements from Earth cities and reproduces them on Mars, presumably as the inhabitants\' way of remembering their ruined home planet (several New York icons are used as background, including the Flatiron building and even, this being a 2001 film, the World Trade Center). Thus we get several scenes set in a North African-style bazaar, and even a climactic showdown on an Eiffel Tower, during a Halloween parade, no less.Some have complained that Cowboy Bebop is not much of a movie and is merely a standard-issue episode of the series stretched out to a little under two hours in length. Again, having never seen the show, this could very well be correct, and it is definitely true that there\'s probably only about an hour\'s worth of story here. And although some passages in the film drag, especially before the truth of Vincent\'s psychopathic mission is uncovered, the lustrous animation is more than enough compensation.Also, it seems churlish to make such a critique of a movie that not only has such wonderful characters but isn\'t particularly hurried to push them into drama for the sake of drama. At a time when Hollywood live-action product is so neurotic about keeping its audience glued to the screen at every possible second (jokes! explosions! no down time!), it\'s ironic that an anime feature, a genre which had originally penetrated the US market based primarily on its high-impact, anti-Disney, sex \'n\' violence approach, should be so confident and relaxed. Even the voice actors here take it low-key, often talking in quiet, hushed tones instead of the !exclamation marks! favored by most animated product (Pixar excepted).Spike Spiegel is a case in point. Not your average anime hero - he doesn\'t have steroid-sized muscles, a gun the size of a person, and isn\'t a vampire - he\'s pretty good with his kung fu and knows how to use a pistol, but seems more interested in kicking back and having a smoke.Now to finalize it all, Cowboy Bebop is one of the most popular and influential animes out there. Directed to jazzy perfection by Shinichirô Watanabe, with a brilliant score by the musical legend, Yoko Kanno, Cowboy Bebop is a must-watch. *Okay I deserve a pat on my back lol 😆😆😆* 10/10 star in the film -- the closest thing to cowboys here -- are getting restless with picking up minor thugs for chump change.

This film is the follow up to the cowboy bebop series and its a great addition to the saga. In the series were left with some unanswered things and this movie is not about answering that or tying loose ends. This is like a really long episode of Bebop with a exceedingly deep plot.You could kinda have guessed its like a episode since its named after a song by Bob Dylan like every episode in the series...with its musical themed names. This movie actually ups the production value of the show a lot with a grittier and darker style animation with some rather beautiful scenes. The musical influences of bebop is seen in the general flow of the show in how it all runs smoothly into the next scene. A great soundtrack by the seatbelts who performed the majority of the series music.The characters we all love are back together for the task of saving mars from the pathogen. What makes me happiest is that the series did not have to necessarily end on the sad notes the tv series did. Since this came out after bebop ended and it is set between episode 22 and 23 of the series a lot of people could see this as a more triumphant ending to the franchise rather than a awesome side story. I am not saying they could consider this taken place after the series but more than a better send off than the way it left spike in the stairwell.I felt this was great, i liked seeing the crew of the Bebop in one last  true victory. I liked the ending of the TV series but i wish it could have ended with a stronger sense of victory and that's what this movie gave to me in the end.If i can say anything more about this show is that it carry's with it the spirit of the series on a epic scale. with its musical themed names.

Let\'s compare it to the show and see:Story:Cowboy Bebop: 9/10Cowboy Bebop: The Movie: 6/10Anyone who remembers the Cowboy Bebop series knew that the storyline was more detailed while simultaneously comedic. The drama...and comedy blended together made the series a good anime. It\'s story revolves around a group of four bounty hunters who *desperately* seek for money by taking criminals to the cops. Spike was a stubborn, pigheaded cowboy and Jet was officially commanding. As for the other main characters, Faye Valentine is dreamy and hotheaded, Ein was naive, and Ed was technically hyper and mischievous. After the three main characters joined in, the hunters seemed to split into two teams; they did before Faye and the others got in, but it was too complex for poor Spike to handle, so you should be happy that he\'s got a team quite like ones in a scavenger hunt or something. His team takes you to a certain place where the bounty heads are placed and he kicks their butts to make it easier to capture. The other team obviously *tries* to capture the bounty heads while Spike\'s team tries to set things right, that\'s usually on Edward\'s team.Knockin\' On Heaven\'s Door, I\'d say seemed to start off with an interesting plot, but it has a lot of references to other movies and therefore, it seemingly takes place between episodes Cowboy Funk and Brain Scratch. If you are watching the show right now and haven\'t got up to episodes 22 or 23 yet, then you might as well wait until you get in touch with those episodes before you touch the movie.Art:Cowboy Bebop: 8/10Cowboy Bebop: The Movie: 7/10This really depends on what style of person you are. The music in the Cowboy Bebop series seemed to act like the music that were released between the 1950s and 1970s so if you are an old person between senior and middle aged, then you might be impressed with the art\'s activity as it *does* seem to remind people back-in-the-day (well, for me... yeah). The art and animation in Cowboy Bebop The Movie seemed to do well in its improvement. Bones had made it and Tristar Pictures and they make well thought out movies. Spike seemed to look a little different in his facial expressions as well as Ed and Jet, but the rest seemed to be just fine. The supporting characters are well, new and they seem to fit the style of the Cowboy Bebop movie.Sound:Cowboy Bebop: 10/10Cowboy Bebop: Knockin\' On Heaven\'s Door: 7/10These are both perfectly related so the VA in this film come from the series. I always thought Knockin\' On Heaven\'s Door had better Animation/Art than Cowboy Bebop did, but I\'d have to say that Hollywood studios seems to make hit T.V. series into movies which are usually, well, not topping the series and other people think the series are much better than the movie(s) they\'re making off of it. ""I think it\'s time to blow this thing and get everyone and stuff together. O.K., three, two, one, let\'s jam!"" The opening theme song ""Tank"" on Cowboy Bebop is considered to be the most awesome anime openings to ever hit the history of anime and I was wondering why it wasn\'t featured in the movie at some point. Knockin\' On Heaven\'s Door had a lot of country music rather than jazz (at least from what I remember) and I was like... ""Eh, they should\'ve stayed on the jazz style."" Although, the voice actors for both series are top-notch. Steven Blum was as good as Koichi Yomada, who played Spike making him look like a stubborn cowboy. Jet\'s VA sounded grumpy. Faye\'s VA sounded sexy. And Ed\'s VA fitted her perfectly with the sound of a ""YAO!"" and stuff like that.Character:Cowboy Bebop: 10/10Cowboy Bebop: The Movie: 7/10Like I said above, I explained how the characters were compared to the series in compact with the movie and how their personalities were. Although I think Cowboy Bebop had better supporting characters than the movie does, although Electra was a good one.Cowboy Bebop: The Movie, well, can\'t really say, I thought adding an apparent BF for Spike is kind of irritating, although not too much since if they were lovers, she would make the perfect girlfriend. And I was wondering why nobody mentioned Vicious in the movie. Vincent is a new villain for Spike and Spike, apparently got affected from his nanotechnology didn\'t seem to show his feelings for him as he did with Vicious because every time he confronts him, something bad happens.Overall:Cowboy Bebop: 10/10Cowboy Bebop: The Movie: 6/10O.K., so I compared the series to the film and it\'s totality seems to hit the series more (which I thought was better.) I don\'t dislike the film, but I was quite disappointed when I flipped through the channels, awaiting for it to come on and spent almost two hours watching an apparent average movie or some movie that people don\'t really care too much about. The story mainly revolved around bio terrorism than it did with bounty hunters. Nanotechnology, and other stuff just didn\'t top the series. I mean, I know Spike and his mates are supposed to be ghetto, and I\'m not trying to be mean, but I\'m sorry to say that the series had its potential while the movie was just ""I don\'t give a darn."" I\'m not bossing anyone around to avoid the movie; you saw what I wrote, and opinions are opinions, so if you liked it, good. if you didn\'t like it, I\'m very sorry. But if you thought it was average (or sparingly not better than the series), then you\'ll see what I\'m talking about.  it was pretty good in my opinion, but like I said: average, which makes me want to write a review about it and send it out to the public. and comedy blended together made the series a good anime.

But if you thought it was average (or sparingly not better than the series), then you\'ll see what I\'m talking about.  it was pretty good in my opinion, but like I said: average, which makes me want to write a review about it and send it out to the public.', ""It's a good film no doubt but it's definitely a bit too long. It plays like an extended TV episode (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) but unfortunately it isn't up there with the best episodes to be found in the series. Still it's always good to see Spike and the gang in action seeing as it looks like there isn't going to be a new series made anytime soon for obvious reasons! Its very stylised and is fantastically shot but it seems to drag at times. It would have been nice if it could've linked in a bit more of the Vicious/Julia/Spike backstory into...the plot too. As it is it's a worthwhile and entertaining side story but probably isn't gonna convert any non-believers out there. the plot too.

Let's jump into this review!Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is essentially a high budget, longer than usual episode of the show. And you know what? There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. This time around, we've got Spike and company going up against Vincent, an ex-military soldier turned bio-terrorist. He's launched a campaign of carnage on Mars, leaving a path of destruction in his wake. Oh, and there's a 300 million Woolong bounty on the fellow.It's a typical Cowboy Bebop story, and it...works fine. The whole gang is back, plus some new additions. Of course, you've got the villain, Vincent. He's not just an evil maniacal villain, he has motivations for his actions and everything makes sense with him character wise. He's a pretty compelling villain, honestly. Also helps that he's a complete badass, going toe to toe with Spike in hand-to-hand combat.We've also got Electra, a military agent with connections to Vincent. She's also pretty well-developed. She can kick some ass too. There are a few other minor new characters, but they're not really worth mentioning. Spike is the focus in this film, so the rest of the Bebop crew don't get a whole lot to do, but every character gets a few good moments.With a bigger budget, Sunrise went all out on this. Cowboy Bebop was a very well animated series for its time, and the movie is ten times better. And hell, this came out in 2001. The fluidity is even better in the film, everything looks natural, especially in the visceral action sequences. The final battle in the film is some of the most exciting stuff I've seen in an animated feature.The lighting effects are awesome as well. You didn't get a whole lot of this in Bebop (at least, I don't recall anything this grandiose) so it's refreshing to see such great lighting. The character designs are basically the same, with some added splendor due to the film's higher fidelity. The film uses a dull color palette, which fits with the mood of Bebop.The soundtrack is a solid follow up to the series. It's nothing short of brilliant. Yoko Kanno and the Seatbelts kill it once again. The music fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the film, and the opening and closing tunes are superb. The soundtrack also knows when to go silent, just to let character moments play it out based on performance alone.Yeah, it's just another great Bebop adventure. And I've come to the realization that this is; I don't have anything else Bebop related to watch. That makes me sad. But hey, I might just watch the whole series over again.See ya, space cowboy. works fine. The whole gang is back, plus some new additions. Of course, you've got the villain, Vincent.

Tengoku no Tobira challenges the conventions of an ""anime film"" by serving as a proper, standalone addition to a well-renowned, richly developed universe.Story (read the synopsis first!)While the story initially starts off like just another bounty, there\'s a certain amount of character to this movie that sets it apart from the original series. For one, its involves a darker, more sinister tone that juxtaposes itself to...Cowboy Bebop with a stark contrast of attitude. Further, while most of the previous bounties focused on isolated antagonists, Tengoku no Tobira concerns itself with a primary antagonist in Vincent Volaju, one quality enough to rival even Vicious.The story progresses at a smooth rate, though some viewers may find themselves uncomfortable with the length of the film. There are several scenes that are silent and drawn out, such as Spike\'s wandering around Mars, with others very sedentary and dialogue-heavy, such as various back-and-forths between Spike and Jet. Personally, I enjoy both of these types of scenes, as well as longer film lengths, so I didn\'t find it much of an issue. Just sit back and enjoy \'em!ArtMan, wouldn\'t it have been great if this is the animation we had from the start? Considering its age, Cowboy Bebop expressed  respectable animation, yet Tengoku no Tobira kicks everything up a notch by featuring considerably fluent, colorful, and realistic animation for our viewing pleasure. The atmosphere of a scene is never in question and properly made to represent a the intended tone of a scene. Certain combat scenes were considerably inventive for their time, showcasing the technical prowess of each of the three studios involved in the animation.SoundNothing surprising here. The soundtrack of the film was quite amazing. Yoko Kanno returns as the music director as certainly does not disappoint by bringing the same stylized vibe that enlivened the main series to Tengoku no Tobira. Certain tracks also assume the locale in which it is played, notably the Arabic district Spike visits at points in the film, enriching the cultural value of the soundtrack as well.CharacterNone of the characters from the main series particularly change their attitudes or personalities in this film. I think retaining a certain sense of familiarity was the better route, as the story was meant more to focus on the newly presented characters and not so much any character development from the original cast. That being said, it\'s always fun to hang out with the Bebop crew again, and there\'s enough screen-time for each of them to please any fan.While there are a handful of supporting characters, the two new additions worth mentioning are antagonist Vincent Volaju and deuteragonist Electra Ovilo.Vincent redefines what it means to be cryptic and menacing, inciting some particularly intriguing dialogues on the concepts of both sanity and morality. Whereas Vicious\' antagonism towards Spike was more one of relation, Vincent\'s was one of ideology, yet no less intense.Electra served more of a supporting role in the film, though her relationship with Vincent and Spike led to some interesting dynamics that did well to increase the value of the plot. Those who enjoy strong, independent female characters will enjoy Electra.EnjoymentIt\'s hard not to enjoy anything remotely Cowboy Bebop related. Watanabe and the crew could have put me in front of a two-hour dialogue between Spike and Jet on the merits of bonsai and I\'d have gotten a kick out of it. Tengoku no Tobira, however, sets it apart from your typical anime film in that its very standalone in terms of its depth and relevancy compared to the main series. It\'s not a simple time waster presented to fans of the original series to bait their wallets, rather we as consumers complete the film with a sense of appreciation and admiration. Simply put, if you liked Cowboy Bebop, you will like Tengoku no Tobira.Be sure to look out for the butterflies. They\'re quite beautiful. Cowboy Bebop with a stark contrast of attitude.

As an anime fan I didn't really want to watch a normal film so I was wondering what anime film to watch. I also ordered a harmonica off amazon last week which came in the post today, so I've been playing harmonica all day so when I was thinking of films, I immediately thought of cowboy bebop. Because Cowboy Bebop is so good and so loved around the world, I checked to see if there was a movie, and praise the lord there...was! However a lot of film adaptations are really bad representations of the source material, so I checked MAL for rating; 8.4 or something so I thought, looks promising. I want my friend to watch Cowboy Bebop the series so I was worried that if this film was bad it would put him off watching the series. After watching it I am soooooo happy! This film was awesome! My friend loved it, I loved it and I am just so glad this film was true to Cowboy Bebop. Truly fantastic and definitely worth watching both if you have seen the series, and if you haven't!For those of you who've seen Cowboy Bebop the series, you'll know it is acclaimed for it's art, marrying of western and Japanese styles, music, creating a whole new genre, characters, seeing things from the bad guy's side and so much more. This movie has to be commended so much because it does all of those things just as well as the series! If you loved the series you'll love the movie. It doesn't lack a single thing in my opinion. The art is the same great style we see in the series, the music is new but sticks to the same blues/rock/jazz style that I love and the characters are just as full and memorable as they are in the series, although if you haven't seen the series, you will have missed a lot of backstory.TL;DRThis film has everything you expect from Cowboy Bebop. It's a great film, with or without the series and is so worth watching. Romance, action, thrill, sci-fi, fantasy, and so much more it's beautiful. was!

It is a masterpiece! The plot is awesome. The art was really given attention, I think the artist is a perfectionist or have an OCD because in every details everything is precisely the characters and scenery from the air pressure, shakiness, firing of bullets, drops of sweat and rain and eating noodles. The sound has a perfect timing, especially in the first part in the kick that was awesome. The background music is cool and jazzy. The characters, even the main villain are as usual interesting, especially Spike Spiegel the coolness and handsome. My eyes feast in...the close counter fighting and gun scenes, especially the fighting moves were clearly delivered. Overall, I did enjoy watching this one. If you are a fan of Cowboy Bebop you should watch this. the close counter fighting and gun scenes, especially the fighting moves were clearly delivered. Overall, I did enjoy watching this one.

Unlike the show, it plays up his charming and suave compassion/skill and less his burdened past and all that.Also, Elektra is kind of this fiery sort of passionate personality which is a bit unusual in the Bebop world. I also personally was a fan of Spike being more active and focused in contrast to his usual lack-a-daisical attitude in the TV show.There were also several...really spectacular fights such as a fight on a train as well as a few other really exciting sequences. In general, I thought the movie was a compression of the interesting ideas and possibilities in the TV show but stripped of the filler and other things like that.Mostly though, never really thought Bebop was an incredible franchise, a fairly solid one, perhaps, but not on the level of some of the classics, so my attachment remains somewhat limited, would probably just have to settle for an 8 or so here although was tempted to drop it to a 7.

Spike's illusive, at times mystical lost chapter in his journey for closure is a worthy send off for fans of the original series, thanks in no small part to its grounded presentation and industry-standard technical quality. The spiritual themes and nuanced symbolism that mark some of the iconic moments of the series make themselves at home here, in turn giving some of the most intense sequences a genuine deep dive quality throughout some of the darkest waters of Spike's characterization. It's a...solid action thriller under the Bebop brand, with beautifully animated fistfights, shootouts and chase sequences, featuring some of the best tunes written for the saga, a high-stakes plot and plenty of fine-tuned lightheartedness. Still, its intriguing ambiguity and mature introspection may well be its most impressive achievements. The subtext of man-versus-self is interesting enough to carry a good few more analytical rewatches throughout the years, but it's no doubt the lush animation, smooth pace and rich interactions among the Bebop gang that'll make you keep coming. solid action thriller under the Bebop brand, with beautifully animated fistfights, shootouts and chase sequences, featuring some of the best tunes written for the saga, a high-stakes plot and plenty of fine-tuned lightheartedness.

It\'s up to Spike and his crew to get information and chase after the terrorist despite the enormous risk. Of course, other characters are also after the terrorist....The plot sounds kind of mediocre doesn\'t it? Probably the weakest aspect of this movie. The Cowboy Bebop series have average plots but are at least episodic. A movie with an average plot would bound to fail but this isn\'t the case. Despite popular opinion, I enjoyed this movie more than the series.The art and animation were astonishing considering it was made in the 90s. Fluid animation and good lighting. The fighting scenes were quite memorable. The sound is amazing with jazz masterpieces like the series. You can see the impression of the 90s recession in Japan, despite set in a futuristic setting. This is why this movie and the series will always be a timeless classic. It\'s quite historic.What\'s memorable is that Jet, a crew member mentions to Spike that the crew does not have to go after the terrorist. It\'s not their problem. However, Spike wants the bounty but more importantly to save the world. They are heroes by choice. But what\'s more interesting is that after everything is over. No one recognizes and cares who stopped the terrorist. No one views them as heroes. They\'re just another bounty hunter as Spike likes to say. This adds to the amazing cowboy and loneliness atmosphere.The reason why I like the movie more than the series is because it feels like the characters are all working together despite saying they are not. In the series, you might see a few glimpses of some characters in each episode but not here. Also, there\'s improvement in the art. The best thing about this movie is how the characters interact with each other. Lot of the interactions are quite witty, sly and most of all cowboy like. The characters sound so cool. It really makes up for the mediocre plot.When Spike flew his jet into the sunset with a lot of tall buildings. I almost cried. It reminded me of the nostalgic times in the 90s. The 90s atmosphere is really strong in this one. What other anime or other shows makes you feel this way? Almost none. Even the sad animes and movies/shows outside anime didn\'t make me close to crying (other than Clannad).Definitely worth watching.

It ended on a high, with a shootout that puts Spaghetti Westerns to shame and rode to one of my all time favourite anime with one of the most original premise in years.So why did this movie not succeed my expectations? The new setting was brilliant, unforced and wonderfully animated. The soundtrack as always is the wet dream of precocious and pretentious teenagers alike.Yet the story and characters were just flawed. I could forgive the somewhat muted interactions in the TV series because most of it...would come together at some point but nothing happened! Nothing pivotal and/or significant bar introducing a new villain who suffered from an inferiority complex compared to the more calm, collected and menacing, Vicious.Spike literally adhered to everything we expect from a heavily noir-inspired protagonist and the rest of characters did not get enough screen time to develop profoundly in any shape. There was no new character arcs that I could connect with and nothing here for the audience to generally get pumped/or invested in.Which is a shame, because outside of the predictable story and characters, the rest could have been condensed into another classic cowboy bebop episode. And that is what seems to have happened here, a setting was blown up with filler content, meretricious drama and more clocking for time as it finally decided Spike should have his confrontation with the villain.The mild disappointment is the disappointment that stings the most. A shame because I regard the TV shows to be a triumphant success in dragging people unaccustomed to the eccentricities of anime to fully appreciate the quirks in them. Better luck next time. would come together at some point but nothing happened!

If you have seen the Cowboy Bebop anime, you will probably especially like this movie, but I think it can also be enjoyed as a stand-alone movie.I would say that this movie is a smidge darker than the anime.The story is really very good, and the main antagonist is very well done. Though he is villainous, I can\'t help but feel anything but sympathy for him. It\'s that sort of touch that I really like, because I really think it adds another layer to the story if you can relate to the ""villain"" as well and the ""hero"".The music,...I think, is a tad less serious than the music in the anime, but it\'s just as well made.Overall, great movie.

If you've seen Cowboy Bebop, then I recommend viewing this before things get climactic towards the end and after the Bebop crew reaches five (including the dog).Cowboy Bebop has this slow, almost melancholy pacing and a way of measuring out its photography that makes it feel like a live-action noir. There's no exaggeration here or overt dramatization of effects. It's as real as if it were...an actual snapshot of events in a futuristic universe. This is one of those rare gems in the library of anime that takes it seriously, that doesn't just pander to certain niche audiences. (I know that's also due to budget constraints, but still.) You don't have to even think about it -- watching Cowboy Bebop, you just know it's good.

It’s got great music, interesting characters, well-choreographed action, great animation quality, and a whole lot of style. The Cowboy Bebop movie isn’t a sequel story, but rather a side story that is best treated as another episodic adventure of the Bebop crew. Note that this movie can be watched anywhere after watching Episode 9 of Cowboy Bebop and is best to watch it somewhere before you finish the series.~{Story}~Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door’s plot centers on a terrorist, who has a bounty of 300 million Woolongs, whose goal is...to exterminate everyone on Mars using a mysterious chemical disease. It’s up to the Bebop crew to save the planet (for a price!). From then on, the Bebop crew try to find clues that can lead them up to the terrorist. You’ve seen this premise many times; terrorism threatens the world, the good guys to the rescue. But because of Bebop’s stylish presentation, it feels fresh and fun. Though the story isn’t flawed (it’s actually quite well written) there’s just something about the story that just feels forgettable. Also the movie made me feel wanting more. We’re given background stories for some new character. Though they are interesting, it would have been better in they expanded on it even more. But in the end, the Cowboy Bebop movie has a fun and enjoyable storyline that is a welcome addition to the Bebop’s list of adventures.Story: 7/10~{Presentation}~This is where the movie shines, because it is heavily like its original series. Cowboy Bebop is one of the most stylish anime out there, if not the most stylish, and the movie’s no differ. The movie balances many different genres, whether it be action, or sci-fi, or thriller. The jazz and pop music adds to the style of the show. Also the pacing of the movie is well done; it starts slow and by every second, the pacing is faster until the ending becomes a blast. The movie’s opening scene (the convenience store scene) doesn’t add much to the story, but the addition of it shows Bebop fans what they love about Bebop, and newcomers what Bebop is all about. The stylish presentation of the scene itself can make Tarantino blush!Presentation: 8/10~{Character}~It’s fun to see the characters you love make a return in this movie. You have Spike, your unenthusiastic yet energetic protagonist back in the movie. Out of the four main characters him and Faye are the ones that get the most screen time, while Jet and Ed are kind of put in the back seat of the film (though Ed’s always in the back seat… or trunk). Two new characters are present in this movie. The one who plays the good girl is Electra, who manages to be badass enough to be likeable. Then we have the antagonist of the movie, Vincent, who manages to be a more developed character than the antagonist of the original series, Vicious. Vincent’s given a backstory and well enough reasons to justify his actions against society. However it would have been nice if we were given more of a deeper backstory on the two new characters. Nevertheless, the cast in the film shine heavily.Character: 7.5/10~{Art}~The art in the Cowboy Bebop movie is top notch too. The movie depicts a future that’s not easy on the eyes, just like the anime series. Cowboy bebop did a great job depicting a futuristic environment that is more flawed than good, and the movie does no less. The detailed art can make anime today feel ashamed. The top-notch production value is what happens when you make Sunrise and Bones work together. However, I did notice that the use of colour in the movie seemed better than the anime series. As a matter of a fact is that the art is an improvement over the already excellent looking anime series.Art: 9.5/10~{Animation}~The animations of this movie kept on making me check whether or not this was made in 2001. Just like the original series, most of the animation was hand-drawn, but it always felt too fluid to be hand-drawn. Scenes such as the Spike and Electra hand-to-hand combat scene or the end dogfight sequence, it makes you wonder how they accomplished that in 2001. The animation is a big reason why many prefer watching the movie after the series, since the animation difference is enormous. The cinematography is also a big improvement from the series. Since the movie uses a 16:9 ratio rather than the series’ 4:3 ratio, the cinematography feels more cinematic, such as the opening scene, where the combination of top view and wide shots make the movie feel more live-action than not.Animation: 10/10~{Voice Acting}~The same cast for both Japanese and English is back, so you can expect top notch voice acting. Just like Cowboy Bebop, the Japanese voice acting is great, but the English voice acting is outstanding. Steven Blum still manages to add the coolness (and sexiness) in Spike. For the two new main characters in the movie, both Japanese and English voice actors do a great job. However it is to not that the English voice actor for Electra is Jennifer Hale (who won more accolades than you can imagine for Female Commander Sheppard in Mass Effect). Watch in in Japanese of English, you’re not missing out on a single thing.Voice Acting: 8.5/10~{Music}~Though the same Cowboy Bebop soundtrack isn’t carried over to the movie, the new soundtracks end up being almost just as good. The opening song, “Ask DNA”, though isn’t a “Tank!”, it still manages to be catchy and it delivers a lot in style. The ending song “Gotta Knock a Little Harder” is excellent as it matches the mood of the ending of the movie. The movie has countless of soundtracks to remember, such as “Cosmic Date”, “Time to Know-Be Waltz”, “Clutch”, “Powder”, “What Planet is This?!”. “Clutch” and “What Planet is This?!” are some of the best tracks I’ve hears in any anime!Music: 9/10~{Enjoyment}~It was more Bebop, how could I not enjoy it! The returning of the cast, the music, and the stylish execution was great. It could have been shorter; maybe some of those melodramatic scenes were there to bring up the runtime. But the movie’s still great fun as it manages to deliver what we want from a Bebop movie. With a blend of genres available, it never feels boring. The movie gives Bebop fans what they wanted, and newcomers an entrance to the main series. Although it doesn’t have as much replay value as the original series, Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door is a welcome addition.Enjoyment: 8/10In the end, Cowboy Bebop: Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door ends up being a great movie that captures the spirit of the original series. The structure of the movie makes the movie feel like it was made for both fans and newcomers. Combines with improved animations and a soundtrack that represents Bebop's spirit and you've got yourself one hell of a ride!+ Stylish blend of genres+ Animation quality that tops the main series+ Some great action scenes+ Top-notch soundtrack+ Vincent is a better antagonist than the main series’ antagonist.- Makes you want more in-depth backstories for the new charactersOverall: 8.4/10 to exterminate everyone on Mars using a mysterious chemical disease.

If you think about it, Spike possesses a “lone wolf” philosophy and a cocky attitude that almost gets him killed, both of which are reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes. I can’t help wondering if the writers of Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door somehow got a manuscript of the screenplay for BBC’s Sherlock nine years before it even existed. This film has the same length and the same “diabolical mystery” plotline...as most typical Sherlock episodes, which indicates that the two pieces of media follow the same pattern. Everything seems to add up and fall into place once you see the connections. Vincent is basically just Moriarty with lady hair and an obsession with toxic Orbeez. Faye is just John Watson with flying skills and a more impressive rack. Jet is just Mrs. Hudson except... actually, he pretty much is just Mrs. Hudson. As you can see, BBC’s Sherlock and Cowboy Bebop: Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door are almost identical in story and character lineup. I don’t know why Watanabe took such direct inspiration from a seemingly unrelated British crime drama, but it pays off well. The formula fits perfectly with the Cowboy Bebop cast and Bones really brought the crossover to life with their incredible animation. As the saying goes,  “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”.I rate this movie 7/10 for playing it safe with the conventional story, but overall 9/10 for the orgasmic action scenes. Really great addition to the iconic space western series. as most typical Sherlock episodes, which indicates that the two pieces of media follow the same pattern.

The stakes are massive, but not interesting - episodes like Brain Scratch played with genre expectations and defied easy answers, but the film is a straight shot from start to finish. The antagonist is something out of an airport novel, spouting famous quotes and waltzing in a trench coat whilst spouting his half-baked ideology to anyone who passes by. Plot aside, the film is able to maintain interest with high level animation and thrilling action. Seeing the Swordfish II in combat during the last stretch was...impressive, a sentiment that can be extended to much of the set pieces within the film. The film's soundtrack is excellent as well, with Seatbelts delivering many solid tunes to heighten scenes of action and investigation alike, with Diggin' being a great track for the latter.Thematically, the original series was something of a loving elegy for analog technologies, though chiding of unhealthy nostalgia was intertwined with the message. Knockin' on Heaven's Door carries much of the same love and warnings in its quieter moments, something that I appreciated to a good degree. The cast of Bebop are great devices for this message, especially Jet, who is tastefully used. In fact, I can compliment the Bebop crew's depiction in the film on all counts: everyone gets at least one or two good scenes on their own, and it's cool watching them act in isolation. On the other hand, the film's original messages on the manipulation of soldiers and warfare are as boilerplate as they come, and are told quite clumsily. Again, it belongs in an airport novel. Just weak storytelling all around.The best parts of Knockin' on Heaven's Door are where the plot takes a backseat to characters: Spike walking the streets for info, Faye squabbling over petty problems, Edward hacking and warbling, etc. Seeing these moments in tandem with the fresh high budget action and animation make the film worth it in the end, and should be a good watch if you can ignore the abysmal story. impressive, a sentiment that can be extended to much of the set pieces within the film.

The executive producer of this particular movie is Takayuki Yoshii (from the Sunrise pictures) with Ryohei Tsunoda (from the Bandai visuals: responsible for Jin Roh~The Wolf Brigade, 1999)Mechanical design: Kimitoshi YamaneSet design: Shihi TakeuchiOn IMDB, the movie holds a rating...of 7.9/10 with 4 stars out of 5. The BBC too, awarded it 4/5 stars, calling it ‘an example of anime at its very best’ and ‘good enough to deserve mention in the same breath as Akira, Ghost in the Shell and Spirited Away.’ It was also nominated for the Online Film Critics Society Awards in the best animated feature category (2004)- Taken from both Wikipedia and My Personal Analysis as WellPlot: 7/10 (for being too ordinary, it should be rated 6/10, but the suspense that revolves around Vincent and his link to a few particular characters, it get not more than 7/10 at least from my side.)The plot rests on the bounty hunter named Spike Spiegel and his crewmates aboard the vessel named Bebop in their efforts to find a criminal who is planning to release an unknown pathogen on Mars. The title of the movie is taken from Bob Dylan’s song, which goes by the identical name. The main antagonist, i.e., the character Vincent is based on the musician (such an awesome creative mind, gotta say.)The movie includes the characters who belong to the anime series of the name ‘Cowboy Bebop’, as the name suggests, but out of the entire batch of the anime team, only a few prominent members are portrayed here in the movie with the bounty hunter named Spike Speigel, being the main protagonist (as always); supported by Faye Valentine, Jet, Edward and their pet dog Ein.The events or the plot rest in an era in the year 2071, a few days just before October 31st, i.e., the Halloween. An unknown pathogen is being released in the capital city of Mars, and the government has issued a bounty of around 300 million woolong (wish I could enjoy that provision xD)Spike and his crew take upon the case with the hopes of earning a heavenly kind of bounty like that. But the mystery surrounding the antagonist, responsible for the breakout of the pathogen lies hidden until Spike meets a beautiful (and a seductive) maiden named Elektra, who is an agent serving for the very organization which was responsible for the creation of the virus pathogen. She was sent by her organization to hunt down Vincent Volaju, who was made a target of the Bebop crew a long time back, in order to earn the heavy bounty hanging over his head.As the hunt for this man called Volaju, with no past and no possible future escalates, the fate of the entire human race rests in the hands of the Bebop crew, who themselves aren’t sure of their capability to handle and perform their responsibilities efficiently.- Taken from both Wikipedia and My Personal Analysis as WellMusic: Yoko Kanno - 8/10 (no comments)The original soundtrack was written and performed by the Seatbelts who released an album and a mini album of the film’s music entitled Future Blues and Ask DNA respectively.- My Personal AnalysisCharacter design and animation director: Toshihiro Kawamoto- 9.5/10As we all know the characters of this anime and their respective characteristics, abilities and attitudes, I don’t think I should mention anything else about them anymore. But as far as the additional characters are concerned, they deserve a bit of highlight. Rashid, an Arabian is portrayed in the movie as Spike’s nemesis, with a ridiculously funny yet mysterious personality. He seems to know everything about Spike’s intentions and objectives to hunt Vincent down. He appears out of nowhere, with an identity of an informant and guides Spike till the root of the matter, where even the government organization couldn’t make its approach. Then there is this antagonist: Vincent Volaju. I have no comments regarding this mysterious guy because there are no words to describe his personality and attitude. I can just give an idea regarding that, using the term ‘Perfect Anti-Heroic Character’ besides some other well-known characters within your knowledge. Elektra, yeah, she’s kind of a beautiful young lady, who has a direct link with Vincent, as they were once the partners in the same task-force, rather lovers. You’ll know when you watch the movie. So do it, at once.- My Personal AnalysisOpening: 10/10The stunts and the badassness along with the comedy deserve it. Before that, there was a short glimpse of Vincent, playing with the glass marble containing the virus, with the narrating these lines:“He was always alone, always by himself. Never anyone to share the game. He lived in another world. He was that kind of guy.”So, these lines are perfect assets, to describe the personality of Vincent I guess.- My Personal AnalysisEnding: 10/10The entry of various pilots in the perfect time, in order to spray the antidote to nullify the effect of the pathogen, just when the Halloween began. It was just awesome. Apart from this, the fight scene between Spike and Vincent deserves hats off. Plus, the emotion filled climax, when Elektra shoots down Vincent, in order to save Vincent’s life. Ah! No more comments. The ending lines were:“Shall we go together?” (Elektra and Vincent, both pointing their pistols at each other) *bang*Elektra opens her eyes in astonishment, as she herself couldn’t believe what happened back then. Vincent was found lying almost dead, just before Spike, with his chest pierced apart from the bullet which ran through Elektra’ pistol. Spike said, struggling, “Vincent! Why didn’t you shoot?”“I remembered… she was the one I loved. I wanted to escape from here. I searched for the door out of this world. But now I understand. There is no door.”“You should’ve known! You were frightened to open your eyes and see.” says Elektra.“Elektra… the time I spent together with you… was my only reality. I’m so glad we could meet again at the end.” Saying these lines, Vincent closes his eyes… forever…This particular scene from the movie is really emotional…- My Personal AnalysisOverall Rating: 8.62/10If the plot would be a bit more extra-ordinary or uncanny, like that of Wolf’s Rain; Trinity Blood; Berserk; Hellsing, etc. I would gladly give it a rating of 15/10 from my side. It’s just the script, stunts, artwork, animation, prologue and the epilogue, which made me, give it 8.62/10; or else I would drag it down to 2/10.I haven’t included an additional paragraph for ‘Script’ as I mentioned enough in the last two sections of ‘Opening’ and ’Ending’. I guess it’ll be okay.Watch it fellas, enjoy the review… :)*my apologies, my reviews are wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy… wayyyyyyyyyyyy… way lengthy than those posted by Kits a.k.a. Kartikeya or anyone of you*Some additional Statutory Warning(s):As we all know Faye Valentine to be one of the most attractive and seductive characters from the anime series, I want to warn the n=minors towards a few scenes related to her. Her clothing and appearances, being number one, and the particular scene when she was about to become a victim of a rape case after being abducted by Vincent, who forcefully kissed her and unbuttoned her jacket, with his knife. Unfortunately she was spared by him, as he was more inclined to the spreading the pathogen than raping a helpless maiden xD. But still, only due to that particular scene, it requires a rating of U/A and PG. That’s all for today… Enjoy your day everybody… of 7.9/10 with 4 stars out of 5. The BBC too, awarded it 4/5 stars, calling it ‘an example of anime at its very best’ and ‘good enough to deserve mention in the same breath as Akira, Ghost in the Shell and Spirited Away.’ It was also nominated for the Online Film Critics Society Awards in the best animated feature category (2004)- Taken from both Wikipedia and My Personal Analysis as WellPlot: 7/10 (for being too ordinary, it should be rated 6/10, but the suspense that revolves around Vincent and his link to a few particular characters, it get not more than 7/10 at least from my side.)The plot rests on the bounty hunter named Spike Spiegel and his crewmates aboard the vessel named Bebop in their efforts to find a criminal who is planning to release an unknown pathogen on Mars. The title of the movie is taken from Bob Dylan’s song, which goes by the identical name. The main antagonist, i.e., the character Vincent is based on the musician (such an awesome creative mind, gotta say.)The movie includes the characters who belong to the anime series of the name ‘Cowboy Bebop’, as the name suggests, but out of the entire batch of the anime team, only a few prominent members are portrayed here in the movie with the bounty hunter named Spike Speigel, being the main protagonist (as always); supported by Faye Valentine, Jet, Edward and their pet dog Ein.The events or the plot rest in an era in the year 2071, a few days just before October 31st, i.e., the Halloween. An unknown pathogen is being released in the capital city of Mars, and the government has issued a bounty of around 300 million woolong (wish I could enjoy that provision xD)Spike and his crew take upon the case with the hopes of earning a heavenly kind of bounty like that. But the mystery surrounding the antagonist, responsible for the breakout of the pathogen lies hidden until Spike meets a beautiful (and a seductive) maiden named Elektra, who is an agent serving for the very organization which was responsible for the creation of the virus pathogen. She was sent by her organization to hunt down Vincent Volaju, who was made a target of the Bebop crew a long time back, in order to earn the heavy bounty hanging over his head.As the hunt for this man called Volaju, with no past and no possible future escalates, the fate of the entire human race rests in the hands of the Bebop crew, who themselves aren’t sure of their capability to handle and perform their responsibilities efficiently.- Taken from both Wikipedia and My Personal Analysis as WellMusic: Yoko Kanno - 8/10 (no comments)The original soundtrack was written and performed by the Seatbelts who released an album and a mini album of the film’s music entitled Future Blues and Ask DNA respectively.- My Personal AnalysisCharacter design and animation director: Toshihiro Kawamoto- 9.5/10As we all know the characters of this anime and their respective characteristics, abilities and attitudes, I don’t think I should mention anything else about them anymore. But as far as the additional characters are concerned, they deserve a bit of highlight. Rashid, an Arabian is portrayed in the movie as Spike’s nemesis, with a ridiculously funny yet mysterious personality. He seems to know everything about Spike’s intentions and objectives to hunt Vincent down. He appears out of nowhere, with an identity of an informant and guides Spike till the root of the matter, where even the government organization couldn’t make its approach.

The plot is kind of generic, bad guy threatens the world, but it's done fairly well.  The main villain, Vincent, does a decent job of coming across as bad guy. He's more the quietly insane kind of guy. There's little to none character development, but that's not so bad with the main cast. Unfortunately, we don't learn that much about Vincent or Electra, an agent of a pharmaceutical company, who has some connection with Vincent. There were clearly some lost opportunities to develop their characters more; we don't care so much about them...since there's not much to care about. It's a shame, because she and Vincent had quite the past to expound on. There are some cool fight scenes, the best of which is the one between Spike and Electra, the animation is pretty fluid, and they did a great job of showing that while Spike is still boss, Electra is still awesome in a fight :). There's a dogfight scene which has really fluid animation, a really great job.There were some plot holes though that niggled at me, but nothing particularly bad. This movie takes place during the series, so watch it then. It's pretty good, so don't turn it down! since there's not much to care about.

I personally saw this film after finishing the anime, which some do not recommend but I found that it didn't impact my enjoyment of the film at all.Spike, Jet, Faye and Ed are all as great here as they always have been, with their VAs doing an excellent job in both the Japanese original and English dub. Several new characters also make an appearance in this film, and while I won't talk about specific...characters as to not spoil anything, I will say that they all fit well within the story and had interesting motivations, particularly the main villain.What really made this film stand out for me was the stunningly beautiful animation. Each scene was highly detailed and unique, making this film have some of the best animation in the whole series.The OST for this film was also good, with a new opening theme and a lot of other tracks that were not present in the original series, but some previously heard tracks did also make a return which was good to see.Overall, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is a great film for fans of the series, but also a good movie in its own right that puts it among some of the best anime films from the time it was released. characters as to not spoil anything, I will say that they all fit well within the story and had interesting motivations, particularly the main villain.What really made this film stand out for me was the stunningly beautiful animation.

In my opinion, I give it a good 8, mainly because I like the dynamic between Spike and Vincent, it basically foreshadows the end of the main show and at the end gives a similar thought provoking quote ""Are you living in the real world?"". I felt it was quite intriguing to see a character similar to Spike where they both feel ""dead"" in a sense.The animation is truly amazing, even from watching this in 2023, if...this movie was made using modern animation tools I\'m sure it would\'ve been one of the most visually pleasing mediums to watch. It shares the admirable quality with the show as well. The music also is fantastic, the songs are a nice mix which evoke various feelings and moods throughout the film such as the ending song which showed time moving on long beyond this entire movie and the beginning song which showed the daily life in the city.However this film has some striking issues, one is that the villain isn\'t properly developed, Vincent as a character is barely fleshed out outside of his interactions with Spike, Electra and Faye. I don\'t understand what I\'m meant to feel about him, his backstory is jsut too short and maybe some flashbacks of his past would\'ve been nice but all we get is a few lines of exposition that are cryptic and impossible to decipher. Another issue is that Jet feels underused and feels like he\'s taken a backseat throughout. Furthermore the film is slightly too long so the tension is diluted but the last fight does also make up for this.Overall an 8/10, a very good film that just needed some tweaking or else it would be a masterpiece. this movie was made using modern animation tools I\'m sure it would\'ve been one of the most visually pleasing mediums to watch.

There are breathtaking moments in animation, as well as scenes of ideological reflection that open up a discussion about current affairs.His animation is well done, the movement of the characters is very natural, the action scenes are also pleasing with the special effects.Without a doubt it is a top 10 film, both for the quality of the animation and for the story. Even...the soundtrack that is a feature of the 26-episode series remains fantastic in the long.REVIEW EM PORTUGUÊSO filme aborda uma caça do grupo de protagonistas por um procurado de recompensa valiosa, que acaba se desdobrando em um espetáculo de perseguição.O enredo é muito bem construído, os personagens permanecem carismáticos e o antagonista consegue manter a expectativa elevada. Existem momentos de tirar o fôlego na animação, e também cenas de reflexão ideológica que abrem uma discussão sobre assuntos atuais.A animação dele é bem feita, o movimento dos personagens é muito natural, as cenas de ação também agradam com os efeitos especiais.Sem dúvidas é um filme nota 10, tanto pela qualidade da animação quanto pela história.

More impressively, the fight scenes were fantastic, the tension beautiful and the plot nicely spaced and plotted. Cool new characters too. Excellent. ', ""Honestly this isn't that great a movie.Unless your already a Cowbop Bebop fan I don't expect you will enjoy it.The old school animation is probably the best part, Bebop has a very unique aesthetic and world with amazing animation that lends itself to some phenomena scenes that are absolutely top notch.The soundtrack is definitely unique. I'm not really a fan of whatever genre it is. But it sets a tone and defines a lot of the scenes quite well, I couldn't see myself seeking out any of the songs to listen to on their own but that doesn't make it bad not at all. Just...not my thing.Character wise every member of the Bebop crew gets some time to shine which is nice, there is something for every one to do and they all contribute.Though it does start to feel rather Spike-centered at the end.Why couldn't Jet help with the final plan? Or Edward?At least Faye got an active roll in the climax.Too bad she's my least favourite.Honestly, as you probably guessed from the above. The writing isn't very strong here. The plot is generic, something about a nonsensical sci-fi bio-weapon and the people who produced it. It's nothing special, but it serves its roll in chaining events together well enough.As for the new characters. Well, they suck.Eletrica has a tiny amount of screen time and even less development. She's your stock big booba fight girl for the protagonist to simp over.Vincent the villain is even worse. He's just your standard overly edgy villain with a Vietnam complex. Worst of all the movie tries to make me feel sad for his death.Why!? He tried to genocide the entire human race!That is so far beyond redemption its not even funny, but they still give him a sad speech. As if that alone could make his motivations seem somehow reasonable, instead of just coming off as insane and cliche.Overall I want to like this movie, I want to like Bebop but it has some serious issues that I personally just don't like and it forces me to dock some major points for them. While the movie's issues are VERY VERY different from the anime, they still exist and they still bring it down.I can't really recommend this, unless your already a Bebop fan.In which case why are you even reading reviews? not my thing.Character wise every member of the Bebop crew gets some time to shine which is nice, there is something for every one to do and they all contribute.Though it does start to feel rather Spike-centered at the end.Why couldn't Jet help with the final plan?

I'd also say that everyone but the classic cast of characters are extremely weak, Vincent is your typical mumble growling philosophy obsessed villain we've seen many times before, and honestly feels like a lazy cut and paste of the show's much better villain 'Vicious', what made Vicious such a good villain was his emotional connection to the characters and the amount of time we had to understand his character and ideology, while Vincent's character arc is crammed into a 2 hour runtime (which is extremely short compared to how long we got with Vicious and his story in the series). Electra is also your typical anime badass we've seen hundreds of times before. Regardless, the classic band of bounty hunters have never been better, Spike, Faye, Jet, Ed and Ein are always a joy to watch and this film is no exception.The colours in the film are much warmer than the series, while the series opted for colder blue and grey colours, the film goes for a brighter look with orange, brown, bright blue and blinding whites and silvers, I find it rather unique and for that I commemorate it.And how could I talk about Cowboy Bebop without discussing it's music, the franchise and it's soundtrack is regarded as one of if not the best in anime history, and the movie features some of my favourite tracks from Yoko Ono and seatbelts, one of which has become one of my favourite all round songs of all time.Overall, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is still the same explosive entertainment the franchise is celebrated for, it's a good watch and I like the film but I feel like better filmmaking and writing choices could of been made in order to make the film more refined, as in the state it's in it simply doesn't match the glory of the original 1998 series. sci-fi roots, telling a story more fitting for an anime like Ghost in the Shell, the film has barely any sci-fi elements compared to the series and goes for a more noir crime esc style of story, the film is also much more dialogue heavy than the series, the pacing of the shows episodical structure works much better than that of a feature length film, I feel like this story would of been better if it was told through a multi-part series of episodes, as the action Cowboy Bebop is known for is side lined for a more dialogue heavy story which feels duller in a feature length style.Although the film is weaker on the story side compared to the series that doesn't mean it's bad at all, it's still a boat load of fun as it's refined and sleek animation looks stunning all the way through especially when the action takes place.

This is going to be a much shorter review but to put it simpily, I really enjoyed this movie.It\'s the only anime movie based on a series that I consider to be better than the source material.Knockin on Heaven\'s Door basically took everything good about the series like the amazing animation, well produced action, good music, and incredible art and cranks it...up to 11.This time however, the plot is actually much more consistent due it being a movie and not an episodic anime that sort of has a serial narrative. The movie\'s commitement to the whole urban city asthestic I do think is rather commendable considering it adds to the whole grounded action thriller story that the movie goes for.It does make me question if Bebop was even better off for being a sci fi series but that is an issue that can apply to the series and I went to at length in my review.The villain here is much better. Where Vicious hardly had any of his motives explained and isn\'t very proactive in the story at all. Vincent\'s motivations are explained to varying degrees and there even is a scene that explains what makes him tick which Vicious never really had. The guy is basically an ""Evil Spike"" but I find that more compelling than what Vicious was. I did find his whole delimma of what is a dream and what is real  to be compelling enough. He\'s what if he was Spike but completely unhinged which is what the antagonists of the series needed. And it made me wish I knew more about the war on Titan but that is an issue that can apply to the series too.I also liked how there was even a scene where Jet and Spike had ideological differences in how they handle situations due to the former being a former cop and the other being a former gangster, which the show didn\'t have much of.Alright, might as well describe my issues, first the character of Electra, she\'s decent but she feels too much like one of those female characters in the Lupin the 3rd movies where while decent do tend to make you wonder why on earth does Spike and Lupin not hang out with them and continue to go after women who don\'t really provide much of anything for them Julia and Fujiko respectively. That and I do wonder why the series never acknowledges her again nor Spike never tries to get together with her after showing so much attachment, I am not saying this as a ""shipping"" guy, I am saying, what was the point showing Spike cared if the ending wasn\'t going to address that whole sub plot? It felt weird to me, the ending kind of felt rushed in general. The Bebop crew saved Mars from a bio outbreak and then it just...ends.That and the ending also makes the series\' ending look stranger in retrospect, I mean the Bebop crew went through absolute hell and back in this movie yet I am really supposed to believe that Jet and Faye would let Spike go on his own in the the final battle against Vicious or how Ed would just ditch Spike and Jet after everything but that is just prequels being prequels.Also, with Vincent and Vicious both being on the war on Titan really did make me wish that the Bebop series actually gave more details on it. The whole thing feels like a huge event that I barely know anything about but that is another issue that can be found with the series.Overall, if you were one of the few people that were lukewarm on the Cowboy Bebop series and are hesistant of giving the movie a shot, I say watch it, the movie isn\'t that long and if you liked the art, music, animation, and action of the series, Knockin on Heaven\'s Door is basically more of that but with a bigger budget. up to 11.This time however, the plot is actually much more consistent due it being a movie and not an episodic anime that sort of has a serial narrative.

The Bebop crew saved Mars from a bio outbreak and then it just...ends.That and the ending also makes the series\' ending look stranger in retrospect, I mean the Bebop crew went through absolute hell and back in this movie yet I am really supposed to believe that Jet and Faye would let Spike go on his own in the the final battle against Vicious or how Ed would just ditch Spike and Jet after everything but that is just prequels being prequels.Also, with Vincent and Vicious both being on the war on Titan really did make me wish that the Bebop series actually gave more details on it. The whole thing feels like a huge event that I barely know anything about but that is another issue that can be found with the series.Overall, if you were one of the few people that were lukewarm on the Cowboy Bebop series and are hesistant of giving the movie a shot, I say watch it, the movie isn\'t that long and if you liked the art, music, animation, and action of the series, Knockin on Heaven\'s Door is basically more of that but with a bigger budget.', 'This is a cult movie of the great series cowboy bepopthe story has a lack of action but all the other elements make the movie a real outstanding film that its a must if you like the series I highly recomend you watch the series first but if you watch the movie first it will be alrightbecause it is not connected with the trama in the series.the music its an amazing composition of yoko that makes your ears fly to the blue sky, see you cowboys. ', ""Oh how I love the world of Bebop. I honestly have no idea why I waited so long to watch this. Who doesn't love a good space opera? One thing is for certain, this is better than good.The animation is chef's kiss good and for 2001 it's excellent. It has the elegance of the 90s with the fluidity and smoothness of the modern era. Its pretty much the pinnacle of 90s animation. As always the characters designs are great and out main antagonist is absolutely spot on. There really is something special about our protagonists; Spike, Jet, Faye and Edward. Just seeing them again, for...one last time, hits you with a kick of nostalgia you didn't know you needed. There is a special place is a lot of people's heart for Bebop and for those who are yet to watch this film, and are a Bebop fan, you'll likely feel the same nostalgia as I did. The animated hand to hand combat in this is excellent, with the final fight sequence being a highlight. The train sequence is probably my highlight to be honest. It has everything an action sequence needs and was animated flawlessly. 10/10As far as music is concerned, it's Bebop, is it going to be anything else other than brilliant? We are back with live musicians creating the music. It just oozes cool. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't hit the heights of the show, but then again, nothing much comes close to this. Nevertheless, it elevates perfectly the moments when it choses to grace us. No other place is the more  perfect than the train scene. The performers and composer knew exactly what was required to elevate this sequence which for me, is the best moment of the film as the story finds it center here which is displayed through excellent animation and music. 9/10Story wise, it's in a similar vein to the sound. Its not the best Bebop has, but is still excellent. Though it is unfair to compare the story of this to the show, but if anything could be compared, this is it. As I said above, the moment the story sets itself is the train scene. The antagonists portrays his real danger and the Spike understands the risks of this protagonist, sadly, a little too well. This then gives us an exhilerating later half that would be a 10/10 any day. The first half is where it doesn't shine so bright. Again, it's still very good but is a little slow compared to the latter half. The writing is still great throughout, the characters have zero development but we don't need that from Bebop,  got that with the series. For me the story is 9/10.In summary, obviously I'm going to recommend this. Though it is better enjoyed having watched the show first. Its a great film and deserves a strong 9/10. one last time, hits you with a kick of nostalgia you didn't know you needed.

On Mars, a deadly virus has been unleashed on the people and the government has issued the largest bounty in history with a 300 million woolong reward for the capture of the mastermind behind it. Spike, Jet, Faye. Edward, and Ein much like in the TV series, form the unorthodox bounty hunter quintet that hopes to cash in on that bounty but ultimately...finds out that this case has far more implications than they could have possibly expected. Basically, if you come into this expecting another episode of Cowboy Bebop, you might be a bit disappointed. But if you are content with seeing a spy-action/sci-fi blockbuster in anime form with the Bebop squad saving the day in their same goofy style, then you\'ll enjoy this like I did.Visuals: A: Improved from the show. The characters all look the same, but the main improvement is the lighting of the surroundings. And the film is all located on the planet Mars, so no cheesy hyperspace film stills nor wonky-looking satellites in this one. And the fight scenes are drawn really well.Voice Acting: A+: They keep the same voices from the show, but the new characters included all have very good voices especially the antagonist Vincent Volaju. Edward is really funny in this too! And her ear-piercing Mariah Carey-like shrieks are kept to a minimum. Also, Lee Sampson\'s voice reminded me so much of Taika Waititi playing Korg in Thor: Ragnarok and I found it unintentionally hilarious.Film Score/Soundtrack: B+ *Some great moments. It\'s more soundtrack heavy as opposed to score-heavy and there are ups and downs to that. The up is the fantastic opener, which I will highlight below. The lows are there a couple meh tracks that the movie gets montages too.***Favorite Track: What Planet Is This?***(I think I could listen to this on a repetitive loop for all time and never grow tired of it.)Characters: B+: Same characters from the show and considering that it is based somewhere between episodes 22 and 23, their characteristics aren\'t expected to be very different and the writers did a good job in ensuring that the characters felt like we could plug them into another episode of Cowboy Bebop before or after this film. However, I will say that Elektra is a pretty forgetable addition. She was basically added to add a potential love interest and she didn\'t really add much to the film. But the antagonist Vincent was a really cool prescence and his fight with Spike at the end was epic!Cringeworthy Anime Moments: There were a few but it was once again the action movie cliches that were more bothersome to me. Both facility escape scenes were probably the worst examples of that. Also, who plans an execution the same day as an anticipated massive terrorist attack? That\'s James Bond villain levels of stupid.Titles:Opening Titles: A+ *The song\'s called ""Ask DNA"" and it is awesome! Not as epic as Tank! of course, but it doesn\'t make the intro any less badass. The pre-credit scene and the way the characters walked during the opening was so Quentin Tarantino-like and I loved every moment of it.Closing A+ *""Gotta Knock a Little Higher"" is just one of those songs that is the right level of catchiness while still doing it\'s main job of making you feel like you just watched a movie and giving you that satisfied sense of closure.Final Verdict: 8/10 *A great opening scene, better artwork than the show and an over-the-top but fun action film with some dorky and some cringey laughs. It doesn\'t get anywhere near as heavy as the show does, but since I\'m a fan of James Bond, I am a-OK with the Cowboy Bebop movie essentially being a highly entertaining anime-Bond movie.a finds out that this case has far more implications than they could have possibly expected.

Great character designs, camera shots and very fluid animation. The story and characters on the other hand... well the movie is quite abysmal.The villain avoids death twice, the writers didn't know how to make him escape the situation they wrote for him to be in, so they simply didn't show how he did it, he fell to his death and then exploded with a grenade.Spike gets shoot in the chest and somehow survives and after less than I week (I can only assume), fights the bad guy in the end. Also a small side note; while Spike...was looking around at the Eiffel tower, the bad guy could've shoot Spike from the shadows, instead he ran towards Spike and then shot him that way and missed his vital spot, again.Ed never told Jet where Faye was and that she was with the bad guy. For all Ed knew, she could've been dead and Ed did nothing to help, lol. Oh, and Jet doesn't do anything of note in the entire movie, all his scenes depict him as an incompetent idiot.The black guy who helps the bad guy was a one dimensional idiot, never got a sense of motive or reason he helped the bad guy.After the death of the black guy, Faye doesn't die because the bad guys motives are terrible, he saves her becuz he was horny (the only other reason you could find is that he mistakenly remembers her to be his lover, but that's stupid too, because he almost killed his actual lover in the train...). The villains motives are revealed by exposition and it feels hollow and stupid.I didn't understand how they found Spike in Arab town the second time he was there, but I could've missed what led to that part.The way Spike escaped the prison cell was laughably easy and incompetent from the part of the other bad guys. Also they are never shown to be punished by the end of the movie (seriously that part never gets resolved).The army shooting at Spike over the City (full of civilians) was stupid. The cure to the virus being thrown from planes was nonsensical, I've no idea how that would cure all the people exposed to the nanomachines. And I have no idea how there were no security guards to stop Faye from sending the rain to the parade. I also have no idea how she got away from that situation and why wasn't she arrested.If I rewatch the movie I'd probably find more nonsensical and stupid actions by the characters. But for now I am 100% satisfied by this terrible movie. 1 or 2 out of 10 for now. was looking around at the Eiffel tower, the bad guy could've shoot Spike from the shadows, instead he ran towards Spike and then shot him that way and missed his vital spot, again.Ed never told Jet where Faye was and that she was with the bad guy.

If you liked Cowboy Bebop, you'll like Knockin' on Heaven's Door, but if you didn't, there isn't much here that will change your mind.That said, most things that Cowboy Bebop did, the film does quite a bit better. The animation is particularly of note, being animated by the legendary Studio Bones instead of Sunrise, who were responsible for the TV show. Combine this with Shinichiro Watanabe's energetic direction and you have a film that keeps your eyes glued to the screen the entire time....The action scenes especially are on par with Bones' own Sword of the Stranger and if you've watched that you'll know that's some high praise.The writing is about on par with a Cowboy Bebop episode, although it is of course longer and a little meatier to compensate for the greater runtime. While I certainly wouldn't call it bad, the story is far from Knockin' on Heaven's Door's strongest point. There's a fair bit of meandering and ultimately the conclusion didn't leave me feeling particularly satisfied. The credits start to roll more or less immediately after the climax, which I found to be somewhat disappointing. A few extra minutes just to tie everything together would have been appreciated.The main cast from the show are all here and they're all just as charismatic and likeable as they usually are. The new characters aren't particularly as strong, but I feel like this is more because of the somewhat weak story they play a part in than the characters themselves.Those flaws aside, all of Cowboy Bebop's strengths from the show are present here. The soundtrack, composed once again by Yoko Kanno is just brilliant, and quite unlike what you'll hear in most other anime. The opening and ending tracks are certainly standouts, but the overall soundtrack is just as bombastic and catchy as you'd expect.To conclude, Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door is a great film and is certainly worth your time if you were a fan of the TV show. While the story is about on par with what you'd get from an episode of the anime (with all the good and bad that entails), the production values have been ramped up and Studio Bones' outstanding work with the animation really can't be understated.

Studio Bones has an absolutely absurd portfolio and this film is no exception. The movie strongly places itself somewhere in the latter half of the series unless you perform some crazzzzyyyy plot gymnastics to leap over a few holes that would stop it from being post anime. I could poke some holes in the movie talking...about the slower pace or maybe the antagonist being a little thin and the film just kind of ending, but I mean, like, what is there REALLY to complain about? about the slower pace or maybe the antagonist being a little thin and the film just kind of ending, but I mean, like, what is there REALLY to complain about?', 'The movie, “Cowboy Bebop: Tengoku no Tobira” is designed to fit between episodes 23 and 24 of the television series - and it fits there well. It’s good to see an episode allowed to fill a movie length time slot instead of the 24 minute slots designed for commercial broadcast. The characters are more fleshed out with more and longer action sequences. Edward gets to show off her hacker chops and the recurring three old men even get a significant moment in the spotlight. The animation is pretty much the same as the series but the script has more depth with a better story that...has time to develop. If you’re expecting “Cowboy Bebop: The Movie” to be something other than a movie length episode from the series, then you might be disappointed. But if you’re looking for a slice of the series that you can sink your teeth into with more complexity, action, mystery and a chance for the cast to show their stuff, then you’re gonna like this film. has time to develop.

However, this movie mostly succeeds because the solo-episode format of the series allows for this to tell its own quality story without feeling too out of place. With that being said, I do think that this story, despite its quality, could have been told in 2 or maybe 3 episodes of the show rather than a full two-hour long movie, and it doesn't have quite the same seamless pacing the show does.Still waiting on an Ein solo movie though. "", 'Cowboy Bebop: The Movie/Cowboy bebop: Tengoku no Tobira is a film by Shinichirō Watanabe, and a great reference to highlight the faults of television film adaptations.Cowboy Bebop: The Movie falls into the common pitfall of feature film television adaptations. It essentially takes what could have been a 24 minute episode of the original show, and stretches it into a 2 hour film. This results in severe pacing issues and an excessive amount of narrative padding. This alone would be enough to severely weaken a film, but Cowboy Bebop: The Movie\'s problems stretch beyond that. Pretentious, pseudo-philosophical dialogue and a terribly weak supporting cast result in...a film with a frankly crippled story that would\'ve been better left untold.The plot itself is fairly solid on paper. It\'s fairly cohesive and easy to follow. The first act starts off well, with the main cast going through the motions and setting the tone of the film to mirror that of the TV show.  However by the second act, it becomes very obvious that it wasn\'t written with 2 hours of storytelling in mind, and this is the fundamental reason why the film doesn\'t work. In order to fill the two hour run-time, the second act is padded with unnecessary scenes of exposition. Worse still is that much of the same information is reiterated over and over multiple times. When you aren\'t watching Jet get spoon-fed information, you\'re watching Spike get spoon-fed the same information instead. This results in a very dull 2nd act, which unfortunately has repercussions on the third act. The action ramps up suddenly and the tone has several odd shifts.  You\'re juggling an intense dogfight between space ships and a comedic sequence involving old fashioned aircraft, followed by a sombre gun-fu fight to finish the film. All of which comes out of nowhere and, thanks to the poor pacing, fails to engage the discerning audience member.The art is, as you would expect from a high budget animated film, excellent. I read that the Director attempted to employ live-action Cinema camera techniques into the film, and you can tell. The shot composition is excellent, particularly in the fight sequences. It\'s almost like watching a Bruce Lee film at times. The art style of the show is perfectly replicated and the shift to the  cinematic 1.85:1 aspect ratio instead of the series\' 4:3 means there\'s a lot more picture for the audience to enjoy this time around. The celluloid shots ooze with detail not often seen in today\'s digital animation. Certainly a great improvement to the show\'s already excellent visuals.The sound design is decent although I noticed a slight drop in quality in the English dub of my Blu-Ray copy compared to the original TV series, particularly noticeable in Jet\'s (Beau Billingslea) lines. The music, produced by series composer Yoko Kanno, is of a high standard, although there\'s a notable lack of Big Band or Bebop tracks this time. The film\'s best track ""What Planet is This?"", being the sole exception. Performed by The Seatbelts, the same outrageously skilled band that recorded many of the show\'s best tracks, and it ranks among the best pieces of music the franchise has to offer. It\'s a real shame that this track is the only one that bears semblance to the classic Bebop sound that defined the show. The other tracks are relatively forgettable, and none of them wow me the way that the show\'s Tank, Rush, Space Lion, Road to the West and even Ave Maria did.The characters are unfortunately one of the show\'s weakest elements. As stated before, the film runs for 2 hours, and a lot of the responsibility for keeping things entertaining falls to the primary cast, who return from the TV series. Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed and Ein are present and are just as they were during the early third act of the show.  Unfortunately, they lack some the charisma and energy they possessed in the show. I suppose it\'s to be expected. No cast, regardless of how strong, can hold a film up on its own. Things only get worse when you look at the film\'s original characters. Most of them are bland archetypes and not worth the time it would take to discuss them. Only one is important to the plot; Elektra. Elektra is a secondary protagonist, initially introduced as a obstacle in the way of our heroes. She ends up fighting alongside them by the end of the show and she plays an important part in deciphering the nature of the film\'s villain, a menacing terrorist known only as Vincent.Vincent is a complicated character to talk about, but certainly not for the reasons Watanabe likely intended. He\'s frankly a bit of a mess. His dialogue is baffling. He speaks in lofty pseudo-philosophical prose. This would be bad enough, but many of his lines are also written rather inelegantly. At one point he compares the notion of dying to ""dreaming in silence"". I can\'t help but wonder if it\'s the result of a bad translation from the original Japanese. It sticks out a lot, especially when compared to the TV show\'s excellently localized script.  Another odd choice is his character design. He bears an extremely strong facial resemblance to protagonist Spike Spiegel. So much so that I initially assumed it would be a major plot point. Think about it. This is the Cowboy Bebop movie! Of course there was going to be a great villain! What better opponent could there be for Spike to face than a member of his own family? Or even a clone? The possibilities are endless! Overall, Vincent is a very underwhelming villain. He doesn\'t compare to the TV show\'s Vicious, who while also being rather 2 dimensional, had an elegant menace to him that made him a joy to watch.  He was a perfect mirror to Spike\'s unkempt charm.Overall, the film is a passable watch the first time through, but it holds very little rewatch value and the enjoyment factor fades before the halfway mark on repeat viewings. As a fan, all the film really managed to do was make me sad and bitter that we hadn\'t gotten a better film. It\'s not bad enough that I actively dislike it, but it doesn\'t entertain me anywhere near as much as the show does. On it\'s own it\'s a decent enough film, but it pales so much in comparison to the show that I can\'t encourage any series veterans to seek it out.If you\'re looking for a good action flick, you\'ll do better looking elsewhere.If you\'re looking for a good Cowboy Bebop experience, you\'re better off rewatching the series, and saving yourself the disappointment of seeing how this franchise went out. a film with a frankly crippled story that would\'ve been better left untold.The plot itself is fairly solid on paper.

She ends up fighting alongside them by the end of the show and she plays an important part in deciphering the nature of the film\'s villain, a menacing terrorist known only as Vincent.Vincent is a complicated character to talk about, but certainly not for the reasons Watanabe likely intended. He\'s frankly a bit of a mess. His dialogue is baffling. He speaks in lofty pseudo-philosophical prose. This would be bad enough, but many of his lines are also written rather inelegantly. At one point he compares the notion of dying to ""dreaming in silence"". I can\'t help but wonder if it\'s the result of a bad translation from the original Japanese. It sticks out a lot, especially when compared to the TV show\'s excellently localized script.  Another odd choice is his character design. He bears an extremely strong facial resemblance to protagonist Spike Spiegel. So much so that I initially assumed it would be a major plot point. Think about it. This is the Cowboy Bebop movie! Of course there was going to be a great villain! What better opponent could there be for Spike to face than a member of his own family? Or even a clone? The possibilities are endless! Overall, Vincent is a very underwhelming villain. He doesn\'t compare to the TV show\'s Vicious, who while also being rather 2 dimensional, had an elegant menace to him that made him a joy to watch.  He was a perfect mirror to Spike\'s unkempt charm.Overall, the film is a passable watch the first time through, but it holds very little rewatch value and the enjoyment factor fades before the halfway mark on repeat viewings. As a fan, all the film really managed to do was make me sad and bitter that we hadn\'t gotten a better film. It\'s not bad enough that I actively dislike it, but it doesn\'t entertain me anywhere near as much as the show does. On it\'s own it\'s a decent enough film, but it pales so much in comparison to the show that I can\'t encourage any series veterans to seek it out.If you\'re looking for a good action flick, you\'ll do better looking elsewhere.If you\'re looking for a good Cowboy Bebop experience, you\'re better off rewatching the series, and saving yourself the disappointment of seeing how this franchise went out.', 'At this point, I am just a sucker for anything Cowboy Bebop.Honestly, I have always been skeptical of anime movies that come out of a ongoing series (eg. the likes of Naruto movies). My experience with them had been this: since the movies are not allowed to add anything to the storyline, they all have a similar plot structure, sequence, and a general lack of urgency.However, Cowboy Bebop doesn’t really have an ‘ongoing storyline’ (while there is an overarching plot to the show, the anime does not revolve around that storyline). That’s why - for the most part - each episode of CB...retains its individuality.If I had to give an analogy, most anime series are like a knocking down a set of dominos: one leads to the other to create a linear storyline with a start and a finish. On the other hand, CB is like cooking a meal: there is generally an accepted way of preparing the meal, but you can add/subtract ingredients to enhance the dish and play around with the order. Ultimately, you’ll get the same dish with different depths of flavor. In that sense, the Cowboy Bebop movie is one such ingredient.It’s really captivating and artful. It does not necessarily add to the overarching story, but it definitely enhances it - just like any other episode. The plot is dynamic, the music is catalyzing, the art is vivid, and … well … the characters are as good as usual.I read in another review that the movie should be watched alongside the middle of the series. That person’s advice definitely isn’t wrong, but I wouldn’t say it’s not quite right either. Why? Once again, Cowboy Bebop has an affinity to it that isn’t linear. So, any real fan of the show can watch a movie like this whenever and really appreciate the beauty of it. retains its individuality.If I had to give an analogy, most anime series are like a knocking down a set of dominos: one leads to the other to create a linear storyline with a start and a finish.

It's not perfect, but it gets really close to being that. I love how this movie, (and by extension the show) can balance a very laid back atmosphere which feeds off the main characters while also including an overarching sense of tension.It's great to watch the characters interact in an extended format in contrast to the show. The antagonist isn't completely amazing though, but on a surface level he works. The movie doesn't really expand upon any of the pre-established characters, rather using what we already know of them to focus on the plot.

Because of that, there wasn't much of an emotional payoff in the end. The ending to the plot is satisfying, but there isn't much character payoff.I do really love how this movie is paced though. It strikes the perfect balance between action scenes and quieter moments, giving the actions scenes more emphasis and the quieter moments greater weight. Even though the movie didn't do a particularly good job in making the two newer characters' relationship feel important or entirely believable, the scenes where the film reveals those elements to the audience were well done. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the scenes didn't achieve the overall purpose they were meant for, but in it of itself, they were good scenes.And my goodness, the animation. I love watching movies that are spinoffs of a show because most times the higher budget in a more focused runtime really shows. The character animation especially is super engaging. Although I view Ed as a glorified plot device in most of the show and this movie, I absolutely love how the directors and animators bring that character to life.

It introduces the characters from the show and establishes their personalities without seeming tedious to the ones who have already seen the show it's based on, and it showcases the tone right from the opening scene; kind of serious (in a pulpy, kick-butt way) with some moments of levity.It's really difficult to write about this completely separately from its preceding TV show, but it gives the same cool, jazzy vibes while still being fresh, and they do a great job at translating a Cowboy Bebop story into the length of a film while keeping the shenanigans you'd...see in a typical episode of the show sprinkled throughout. It's fun, engaging, and just really neat.That being said, if you haven't seen the show, it really is as good as everyone says it is.

I know there are so many shots that make for a good gif and #mood post, but between that and some of the dialogue not really fitting the characters, or even feeling too stereotypical, I do think this is a step back from the show, but a small one. The music is as good as ever, mainly paired with action scenes that you can't take you eyes off of like Spike flying the Swordfish or the ISSP raid on the water treatment plant. On...the YouTube video for that last scene there are comments about how realistic the police move in teams and check corners, and that applies to the whole movie with its emphasis on people's clothing, moving in crowds, or small little things they do with such a careful fidelity.The movie's plot reminds me a bit of Halloween III: Season of the Witch and The Batman with the Halloween inspired terrorist attack. Vincent's backstory is also a bit of a mix of Spike's and Faye's, but his plan to kill everyone and sort the wheat from the chaff and get into Heaven is a bit flimsy and too abstract. All in all its a good time and worth watching whether you've seen the show or not in my opinion. the YouTube video for that last scene there are comments about how realistic the police move in teams and check corners, and that applies to the whole movie with its emphasis on people's clothing, moving in crowds, or small little things they do with such a careful fidelity.The movie's plot reminds me a bit of Halloween III: Season of the Witch and The Batman with the Halloween inspired terrorist attack.

Something about people getting sick from nanomachines? The story didn't seem to do the TV series justice. It takes place around Halloween and the characters are off to try and defeat Vincent and there's a tower that looks like an Eiffel Tower. The Halloween plot just seems to be unnecessarily added in there just to make Vincent look freaky than he already is.Characters:It was nice to see the characters especially Spike again, but I always felt that this movie was was disappointing compared to the series. I felt that something was wrong...with the characters like Spike. He just seemed quite persuasive. Vincent is a terrible villain. He's just a Spike copycat for Spike to try and relate to and also defeat.I didn't really think much of Faye and Jet, but Faye in here was annoying with her talkativeness about going out on the race track or something.Electra minus her know-it-all personality seemed like she could be a good character but the end ruined it for her. If Vincent was the guy who wanted to terrorize other people, why was she still in love with him? She's beautiful but this whole love story at the end was contrived.Animation:The Cowboy Bebop animation looks more exciting and surreal than the series. There is some fast camera movements. Though, Spike's clothes look darker than in the TV series. But the problem is that one minor character kept moving his arms around when he was frightened and he was talking to Vincent before he shot him.Voice acting and music:The English dub was probably the best part of the movie. I liked how well Steven's voice captures Spike's interest for Electra, and like the series, the other voice actors did well capturing the characters' personalities. Though, I don't know about Vincent, I think he still needs to shut up. The music captured the emotions well. Though, the music isn't jazzy, disappointingly, but oh well, it sounds more country-like and the music sounds catchy. I don't like country music but the country music here sounds pretty catchy.OverallIt's pretty good for a Cowboy Bebop movie.

196,"['Watching Welcome to the Ballroom throughout its six month long, two cour run was one of the most disheartening experiences I’ve yet to endure in all of my years. I watched with dreadful attention as the industry titan, Production IG themselves, those who’ve defined high-quality TV animation even after relegating their most legendary among an already packed house of unrivaled talent into the realm of exclusively theatrical productions, as they brought to air a shounen manga adaptation in much the same vein as their previous successes with the genre, Haikyuu and Kuroko no Basuke, only now with the same CG extras and panning over stills...which plague any other garbage studio as opposed to the ceaseless sakuga and lavish key animation which we’ve all come to know them for—and only them for. No matter how handsome, no matter how sharp the male designs; no matter how sexy, no matter how shapely the female designs; no matter how lively the color palette popped and setting design shined; no matter how elegant the soundscape nor how powerful the dialogue, the show as a whole simply could not contend with the gripping, inspiring, elating aura its predecessors captured their deservedly massive audiences with whilst being stained by such—not even poor—just lacking animation. Now, call me a wishful thinker, but they’re back. Production IG’s TV Animation Team is back in a big way with Run with the Wind.Run with the Wind boasts such a splendidly rich animation production, it really reminds you just how impressive, how downright humbling this division of the studio is at its best of times. The character designs are as clean, sharp, and all-around attractive as those of Haikyuu and Welcome to the Ballroom, fit with a level of orate detail which was incessantly impressive to see in such fluid movement. The design-work of the main cast in particular, as well as the voice actors chosen to play them, clearly had a lot of thought put behind them, as you can see exactly why they dress the way they dress, walk the way they walk, accessorize the way they accessorize, and how such distinct appearances representing such well-realized personalities can really benefit the immersion of the work as a whole. And as the show progresses and you come to understand the characters more intimately, you’ll slowly start noticing more and more of those little details that had been there the entire time. It’s as brilliant as it is beautiful, and the background art never slacks either, as expected of the committed craftsmen and women of IG who would never sacrifice one facet of production on behalf of another’s quality—they just make it ALL that good. The astounding level of hand-drawn details, expertly mixed manual and digital shading, color variation and gradients, and well-researched setting references all work in tandem to build this gorgeous aesthetic of naturalistic beauty balanced with realistic subtlety.On top of the impeccable visuals, the sound design is so nuanced and ever-present, when I noticed it I would become so absorbed and distracted as to miss entire lines of dialogue and have to rewind. And I can say without hesitation the soundtrack is an easy nine out of ten, as the composer was the same talent behind the monumentally epic, blood pumping score for Haikyuu, the emotionally gripping yet hyper-stylized Studio Trigger tracklist for Kiznaiver, and the music for Death Parade, which reached the heights of contemplative character dramaturgy and exciting psychological thrillers both. I simply cannot praise the production of Run with the Wind any more without it coming across as hyperbole, and as for the narrative which gave the beauty its heart and the solid writing which firmly held it all together, it was pretty damn good itself, even if not as breathtakingly perfect as the production values were. The main characters made up one of the most grounded ensemble casts in all of anime, easily competing with and outclassing legitimately good shows like Durarara, Hajime no Ippo, or Assassination Classroom, who’re all known for their ability to deftly juggle enormous casts whilst developing those within them. Unlike those aforementioned and most others which aren’t even half as good, Run with the Wind managed to not merely manage the large cast, but to actually mete out character development in a down-to-earth manner which didn’t challenge the realism of the story’s structure.At no point in this show is there anything that could be described as an “arc.” Never does the narrative take a break for drama, nor does it ever feel like one character in particular is being too overbearing or stealing the spotlight, with any necessary character building sneaking its way into the narrative subtly. Such sensible pacing works wonders for any conflict too, since all confrontations are built up to naturally. Nothing ever comes out of nowhere and is usually born from within the main character, Kakeru, who you get to know well enough to both sympathize and empathize with the anxieties of. While it’s not hard for me to image someone having a problem with the blunt spright-man bringing all the conflict to the table being the main character himself, his deep-seated motivations are so well-written and intrinsic to his character which we’ve come to understand, I totally got where he was coming from whenever he blew his top. That said, this brand of discord is by no means unique to Kakeru. All the characters have insecurities and hangups which feel truly genuine. Most anime will have characters ranting and raving about a bunch of out-of-this-world garbage the viewer has no reason to care about, but Run with the Wind does nothing of the sort. The character Nico-chan (a play on the word “nicotine”) has difficulty running for his addiction to smoking and his unhealthy BMI. The character King has trouble being committed to the team because he has to find work to pay for college. The character Shindo has doubts about his involvement with the team because his girlfriend dumped him after feeling he had neglected her. All the characters are real, with real scripts, with real problems. It’s a seriously wonderful cast who brings the relatively straightforward story to life, and there were a number of times I had tears in my eyes watching them cross the finish line.The final point I wanted to discuss before concluding is the villain, Sakaki. Sports anime, simply put, NEVER commit to real villains. They always pussyfoot around the issue with mutually understood competition wherein the opponents are never genuinely malicious and are only causing conflict for the sake of sportsmanship. The only time truly antagonist villains appear in sports anime is like Jabberwock from Kuroko no Basuke, or Bryan Hawk from Hajime no Ippo, or the Blue Mars from One Outs, or any other one-dimensional villains out there who are just evil assholes for the sake of being so. Out of all four thousand anime I’ve seen, I’ve yet to see a wholesale ill natured antagonists who truly wants to beat the protagonists solely out of hatred. Sakaki, the main villain in Run with the Wind, is the first character I’ve seen in a sports anime who truly earned the title of “villain.” His history with Kakeru makes for a heavy motivation for conflict, and his vindictive attitude comes across as being deserved, even if you take Kakeru’s side. Again, Kakeru may not always be righteous, so the idea he has some skeletons in his closet isn’t all that far fetched. As you learn more about their pasts, and you get both sides of the story, you’re naturally invested. It’s just another really, really good aspect of the show which I wanted to make a point wasn’t under-appreciated at all in my review since Run with the Wind is a fantastic show I highly recommend for what I hope are now obvious reasons, and that’s not even mentioning the fact this point is what begins to illuminate the refreshingly unexpected psychological core behind it all. As I’ve said no shortage of times, the main character Kakeru is a really flawed person. He’s impulsive, irritable, and outright violent, and it’s not even anyone’s fault, it’s just who he is. So, he runs. He literally and metaphorically runs away from his problems and is constantly accused of doing so by many characters in the show. As said problems continue to pile up despite his speed, he realizes the problems are within and running simply won’t escape them. When he finally stops and turns around to see all the people he’s hurt along the way, all the mistakes he’s made and regrets he has, and all the people still trying to support him in spite of all he’s done, he sits down and confronts reality in a poignantly human fashion, and it’s this emotional courage that frees his spirt, so to speak, so he can truly move forward and run with the wind.Thank you for reading. which plague any other garbage studio as opposed to the ceaseless sakuga and lavish key animation which we’ve all come to know them for—and only them for.

Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru (also known as Run With the Wind) is an actual book adaptation and features competitive running as part of its plot. Like most competitive sports, the show delivers storytelling to feature the journey of characters to accomplish their goals. Thankfully, this show delivers a promise that won’t leave you disappointed.To check off the bucket list, you should probably ask yourself if you enjoy a story driven by drama with sports elements. Because make no mistake, this anime contains a great deal of realism...while selling drama at every chance it gets. It will try to evoke emotions out of the viewers and between the storytelling, you’ll experience a story with its insightful character cast.Meet Kakeru Kurahara, the 1st year former elite runner at Kansei University. The first episode shows his daredevil actions as he is caught stealing. Thankfully, he is saved by 4th year student Haiji Kiyose who has an ambitious dream of competing in the Hakone Ekiden. The Hakone Ekiden is considered an important relay race taking place btween Tokyo and Hakone in Japan. Kakeru seems like a perfect candidate to be on the team. Upon being invited to the Kanse University Dorm, he quickly discovers it’s a place for the Track and Field team. The show sets up for huge amount of story and character development as we quickly realize how weak their team actually is.Now I’ll say right off the bat that I am a sucker for an underdog story. It has potential to develop characters on many levels. The problem here is that Kakeru isn’t a noob compared to the rest of the team. He already has experience in running but lacks the enthusiasm. This is explained through some very complicated and dark background storytelling. Apparently, an incident from his former Track & Field team caused him to doubt himself. Nonetheless, I believe Kakeru’s personality to be one that people can understand after seeing what he’s been through. This is a sharp contrast to Haiji, who is always enthusiastic about the team and his dream. The main problem is that the team requires a lot of training and commitment to compete at the Hakone Ekiden level. Still, I appreciate the character bond of the team. As the show progresses, Kakeru begins to realize that he’s not running alone and that he has friends to run with. A main selling point about Kakeru’s own journey is how he conquers his personal demon and move beyond his past.You better get used to seeing a lot of Kakeru and Haiji’s character bonding in this story. Interestingly, the rest of the cast get their spotlights too as they reinforce the show’s themes. Characters such as Takashi and Akane (aka Prince) are inspirational for their dedication and realization to succeed. Remember, most of the guys in Haiji’s team aren’t experienced or very athletic. It takes a strong will, determination, and attitude to become succesful. The show carries character development as its team members strives to be the best they can be. It’s a relatable concept that can be applied to real life with goals being accomplished through hard work. I personally find the show’s attitude to be very inspirational with many of its character cast conquering their fears and running toward their dreams.As dramatic as the show can be, do also expect a decent amount of lighthearted moments and comedy. The Jo twins are a prime example of this with their playful personalities. The man service also adds in some cheek humor when the team have bonding moments while discussing about their goals. When the drama picks up though, definitely be prepare to experience the real deal. Teams such as the Rikudo University is no pushover for their reputation. Haiji’s push to get his team to succeed also comes at an immense amount of effort considering the requirements for this dream race. It’s revealed in the show that the team must rank into the top 10 teams and meet personal records. So by all means, it comes to no surprise the amount of pressure the team can feel while training. This is where the main amount of drama drops in with characters feeling how difficult is to reach their goals. Nonetheless, I confess to say that a show like this meets the satisfaction of “the journey is more important than the destination”. People may have hard this phrase many times before but as a driving force in the show, it suits for it perfectly. The amount of character development is expanded to most of the main character cast that you can easily recall their names and some of their memorable moments. No one is truly left out in favor of the main cast even as they seem featured more prominently at times.As a Production I.G. show, this definitely reminds me a bit of their other sports projects. Haikyu especially comes to mind for its similar character designs and competitive atmosphere. More importantly, I felt the great deal of realism for its character designs. Throughout the show, the characters evolve physically and mentally. Their character expressions and reactions carries an emotional weight that can easily be felt throughout the show. It’s the type of feeling when you finally earn a sense of pride and accomplishment after all the hard work. And don’t forget, the team is consisted of cool guys so the man service can be a treat for the ladies.With 23 episodes, I confess to say that it’s the perfect amount for this particular anime. Why? That’s because it managed to develop its character cast while staying consistent with the storytelling. The amount of realism made me realize how inspirational this show can be. With every episode, I felt compelled to see just how much the characters can succeed for their future.

The execution is where the anime shines, there is never a wasted moment at all, every episode either focuses on the growth of a character, the growth of the team, or a major cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more. The anime outside of some unrealistic dramatic scenes, felt very relatable and refreshing,...the college students felt mature, but not to mature, just the way people out of high school should feel. There weren’t to many stupid scenes involving walking into a bathroom that was unlocked or getting into a fight with some rival school or team like you would see in a show set in a middle school or high school. The setting was executed effectively, the jokes were solid, the pacing was consistent, and the story did not ignore anything that was very important.The last part is important because it allows the viewer to actually believe a team largely comprised of people who have never run competitively before could somehow actually qualify for the hardest college marathon in their country and perform well in it. The story focused on their training, on the amount of suffering they went through, on the support they had from their community and family, and most importantly on how each character overcame their obstacles one at a time instead of suddenly being a top tier runner.The story is a strong execution of a sports anime plot, it will keep you wanting more, it will make you feel excited for the team and their performance, and it will make you actually focus on all the subtle scenes that are thrown in and connected to the characters in the final race.Art: 8The animation is smooth and clean, there were no major problems with it, the running choreography was some of the best I seen in anime, especially during the final race. Character designs did feel a bit basic, like the characters were just remodels of other shows done by Production IG, specifically Haikyuu. There is not much else to say, it was a good production, but nothing super amazing, it gets an 8 just for the angle and animation quality for the running scenes.The sound: 8The second opening was a very fun song especially the last 30 seconds. Overall the music suited the series and was designed to get the viewer hyped up for major scenes, worried during dramatic scenes, and focused during training scenes. The sound could have been better yes, there wasn’t any part of the OST I would listen to outside of watching the show, but for a sports anime this is good enough.Characters: 10At first, I thought the characters were just Haikyuu clones, with Kageyama as the main character, but I was totally wrong. The character development between the team started pretty slow however it was the right pace for a 24 episode show. The characters were funny, charming, interesting, well written, and extremely real, despite the very large cast by the end of the show you will know them all by name and know them as people. Although some of the characters did not get any real development until the very last episode outside of a few small scenes through the show, their final performance added up to so much more.We had a character quit his addiction to smoking and got to watch it slowly build up in the background until he could run, we got an otaku who couldn’t even jog run a marathon over time, we even a pair of twins each with very distinct personalities coming to terms with each other’s talents and how they should chase separate goals. This was easily the best part of the series, the characters were absolutely amazing, they had good chemistry, great inside jokes, and they even managed to bring an African character in and not have him be 1 dimensional fast runner because he is from Africa.The show also has a very strong MC who grew from a cold expressionless results-oriented person to someone who cared more about his team than his own performance. Overall the characters were simply the best part of the series and even if you don’t like sports anime, I would recommend watching this just for their growth in the series.Enjoyment: 8Being straight here, I never thought a show about running could be this exciting. I really enjoyed this series, it’s so far, the best sports anime I seen in the last year, and one of the strongest I ever seen. The characters, the drama, the growth, struggles, the successes, all of it resonates with me and anyone else who has ever attempted pursuing any competitive goal before. This is a much watch if you seen any other Production IG sports anime and wanted more.Overall: 8I give this show an 8, it was really hard deciding whether or not to give this show an 8 or 9 since it was very close, however I will give it an 8 for 2 reasons. One because although the main characters were great, the ending did not tie up all the loose ends for their development, I really wanted to know what happened to some of them given that one had injuries, one had a thing for a girl in the cast, and one that was graduating soon.I also wanted to know more about the future of their running club however that was left unclear and open ended.The second reason why I did not give this show a 9 was because the show required a bit much on unrealistic drama, for example a member is sick before the last race, another gets injured before the race, Kakeru’s argument with his rival also seemed really stupid and I can’t imagine anyone being angry for so long over something like that. But overall everything else was very good and this was one of my favorite recent shows, I still highly recommend it, and its definitely a high 8. the college students felt mature, but not to mature, just the way people out of high school should feel.

That said, values and priorities in regards to a story and technical features may differ dependent on whom you ask. Well thought out plot, compelling characters or perhaps a focus on visual storytelling-you name it, all of us have preferences whose omnipresence ultimatively dictates our viewing habits and the enjoyment we receive out of something. There\'s still one attribute I view  as vital in order to appeal to the audience, namely heart and even more so when it...comes to the sports anime. Kaze ga Tsuyuko Fuiteiru essentially embodies the spirit which made me such a big fan of the genre.It is also a show that exceeded preexisting expectations. Expectations mainly based on a single name.  Brought to us by Production I.G a studio renowned for their outstanding record regarding anime that revolve around physical activities. Ok not quite tbh, but if we take a look at some big hit\'s from this decade like Kuroko no Basket, Diamond no Ace, Haikyuu, Ballroom e Youkoso then it shouldn\'t really surprise that I.G has earned a certain reputation in this field and everyone familiar with their sports adaptations of this decade might fully agree.The story revolves around Kakeru and Haiji who met by chance. One is an ex competive runner and a prodigy, the other a guy desperate enough to trick his dormmates with the objective of letting Kansei University enter the  Hakone Ekiden. Sounds like a solid premise for this genre. Although there\'s a notable difference in direct comparison with the title I mentioned above.  The show\'s in question used a narrative that rather focussed on the sport and elemental technicalities, Kaze ga Tsuyuko Fuiteiru on the other hand went more for a character and drama oriented approach. Running in a club served more or less as a catalyst to induce conflicts, trials and self-exploration on the steep road to reach the ""top"". Then there\'s the fact that it\'s setted in university. Good, that doesn\'t  sound like a major change up at first , but it allowed to showcase harsh circumstances accompanied by sacrifices which can only occur if you\'re in one of the busiest stages of your life. Moreover, I thoroughly enjoyed the cosy ambience of a lively dorm and the seemingly deeper bond of the cast, similar to that of a family. Especially the first episodes capitalized on  that aspect and  it was easy to get warm with the characters.Speaking of them, the easiest way to sum up the lot without spoiling much would be to describe them as a diverse bunch or if I take this a bit further maybe even as a group that consists of people whose personalities almost couldn\'t contrast more.  While this made up for engaging character dynamics it was at the same time also the ideal breeding ground for several disputes which put the common goal at risk. There were times where it was hard for some viewers not to get aggravated by some actions or attitudes that were displayed. This doesn\'t sound very appealing, but rest assured.  After a bit of patience you will get rewarded with amazing individual as well as collective development emotionally striking enough to wash away all unpleasant memories. However, conflicts weren\'t limited to be solely of external nature, each Kansei member had his own struggles to deal with and the show dedicated a decent amount of screen time on depicting those in a tangible manner. At this point I might fairly add that time spent on fleshing out characters wasn\'t alloted equally and this could\'ve evoked the impression that some of them were lacking significant growth. Thankfully,  this most definitely wasn\'t  the case. The final batch of episodes in particular took care of that task. They presented a gratifying conclusion to each individual journey. The boys reflected on their past and the last months devoted to running . This ultimatively enabled them to become aware of  how running, an activity most of them were initially indifferent about brought a change to their lifes. These moments truly hit close to home as they were able to convey a wide array of emotions along with a level of relatableness that surpassed everything I had expected. All this made the already enjoyable ride more than just worthwhile.What struck me most besides the raw emotional impact I experienced while watching characters I\'ve gotten fond of fight against the competiton and themselves was the technical finesse put to display. The running segments were beautifully composed, ranging from expressions of the runner, spectator reactions, inner monologue, animation and OST, everything was in tune.  Regarding the overall animation and art quality, well it was mostly conistent throughout the entire course of the show. Some CGI here, some minor inconsistencies when it comes to the faces ther, but nothing that warranted major criticism in that area or took me out of the experience. It fulfilled the standards you would expect of I.G.Outstanding in that department was how realistic the running motions looked  and the effective use of imagery. The director did extremely well there and this became already apparent during the first episode. The first encounter of Kakeru and Haiji was without a doubt one of the strongest opening scenes I\'ve ever scene and immediately captivated me.Coming to the music department and I\'m going to make this short. Fantastic! It always fitted to the scene, enhanced the mood and correspondingly the enjoyment by a large margin. The theme songs, especially the first ones, Catch up , latency and Reset were exceptionally good.Now onto something, many, especially those who care about accurate depiction and realism when it comes  to technical aspects would most likely take an issue with. Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru didn\'t put much emphasis on elaborating details of running nor did it provide a logical explanation how admittedly more or less fit novices were able to perform so well on a high level. Team Kansei surely put lots of effort into their training, but others must have done so as well. Potential viewers gotta ask themselves whether they can stomach a dose of idealism or not. Personally, I didn\'t have much trouble to overcome my disbelief  due to plenty of other merits. Foremost, the sheer endless energy the whole story and characters emitted. Then also the fact that an anime about a solo sports had some of the best team chemistry is nothing short of praiseworthy.Lastly, I\'m gonna talk about my personal enjoyment. Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru was by far the most entertaining show I\'ve seen from the last year and it turned out to be way more than I could\'ve hoped for. I was totally invested in the characters, I laughed, I felt joy or cried with them. I even started to integrate running in my workout routine again.  On top of that it managed to recreate the exact feelings of the times when I\'ve seen my first sports and I hope everyone who\'s going to check this marvellous work will experience a similar sensation.I gave it an overall rating of 9 due to the set rating system for reviews, but  in my heart it gets without a doubt a full score. comes to the sports anime.

Are you a college student like me who wants a sports anime they can relate to ? If any of those describes you then I welcome you to the world of Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteru. As an athlete in college, this show has given me the motivation and strength to practice hard everyday and not slack off. Why is that you ask? Well here are the reasons why.Story : 9/10The story like most people would say is pretty standard but what differs it from the...rest would be the charisma and passion exhibited from the main character. 11 episodes in, the story in general is the main character is passionate and dedicated to join an event but since it requires 10 members, he cunningly recruits 10 students by giving them a place to stay while offering them luxurious food . Each episode is amazingly well paced and shows how each character develops. By the time each episode ends, I am already looking forward to see how the story progresses.Character: 8/10What i love about this anime is the fact that there is at least one character that anyone can relate to. Each character has their own quirky personality as well as their own personal issues to deal with. With each episode we get to know each character more personally, and empathize with their struggles in life. It teaches me that everyone is different in their own way and we should not judge a book by it's cover.Sound : 10/10This is the best part about the anime. Out of all the winter anime, this is one of the two OPS and EDS I cant skip apart from bunny girl senpai. The OP is played by one of my favourite bands, Unison Square Garden who has played other amazing songs like kekkai sensen ED and ballroom e youkoso OP. When the OP comes on, I immediately have a burst of motivation to run as much as possible till i am satisfied. On the other hand, the ED gives you a sense of nostalgia as you appreciate what youth is all about and makes me want to enjoy the most out of my youth. I can easily say that the ED is the best of 2018.Art: 9/10The artstyle reminds me so much of Haikyuu and it is not an over exaggeration when i say one of the characters is the literal copy of Tobio Kageyama. If you are a fan of Haikyuu, i would recommend watching this anime. The artstyle is highly realistic and makes me feel like I am a part of their world. The characters expressions and emotions are well shown and I can feel each character's motives and passion flowing out of the screen.Enjoyment : 10/10Each episode is equally enjoyable and not even a second have I feel bored with the anime. Each episode I go through a roller coaster of emotions ranging from laughter to sadness all the way to anger. Even though it has a simplistic storyline, due to the team having 10 different personalities, it makes it fun to watch how each of them interact with one another and helping each other out while dealing with their personal problems. It is so good that I had to write a review to make sure people are not deprived of such an amazing anime.Overall : 9/10I am only halfway through the show, but I can tell that this anime will be one for the history books as one of the best sports anime. Before that happens, watch the first 11 episodes and be amazed by how amazingly beautiful and motivational this show can get. It is not meant for a specific audience and anyone at any age can enjoy it equally. Don't let this masterpiece be left out as a hidden gem.

The difference between us humans from animals is that we have dreams. Dreams we set as our goals with. We chase down our dreams in the road of life, hoping to reach self-satisfaction and eternal happiness. Sadly, not everybody has a solid resolve to chase down their dreams, while some don’t have an end goal in their life, making the destination of life confusing and frustrating. But even with those odds, we still continue to move and keep on running in different directions. We still chase down the unknown answer we seek. This is what Kaze...ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru, better known as Run with the Wind, is about. This anime is not just an anime about track and field. But this anime also about our struggles in life, instead of walking forward, we decide to run-away aimless.(Short Synopsis)The show started off on one faithful night when Kakeru was being chased down by the convenient store for shop-lifting, this caught Haiji attention, after chasing down the culprit, Haiji realizes the potential of Kakeru in running, He then immediately offer Kakeru free residents in Chikusei-so apartment which Kakeru impulsively accepts. We are then introduced with 8 other college students residing in the apartment studying in the same university Kakeru’s attend to, which is Kansei University. After the welcome party of celebrating Kakeru’s residency as the 10th resident of Chikusei-so, Haiji later revealed that the apartment was formally the dormitory of the Kansei University Track Club. This further reveals his true intentions, the sole purpose of creating a 10 person track and field team to participate Hakone Ekiden, a prominent university marathon relay race in Japan, this explains why the apartment provided cheap rent and free food. Residents that sign the contract permitting them to live in Chikusei-so apartment are required to participate in the track and field club activities, or if they refuse, they immediately need to pack-up and leave. Unfortunately, the resident of the apartment cannot afford to move to another apartment so they have no choice but to participate in the club activities. This sparks the start of the main plot of the story. Honestly, the first few episodes are slow and boring for me. Around this duration, the plot focuses on introducing uninteresting and not so impressive batch of college students that has nothing special going for them. Frankly, in the first episode, it makes me believe that they have no chance of winning and they are too far away to reach their goal in reaching Hakone Ekiden.  For the reason, not all of them are willing to join and given that the majority of them are not even runners. It is kind of funny and interesting for me to see how this show will go on later episodes since this kind of joke will die out fast in a few episodes.Content Below Contain Spoilers.(The Analysis)Plot & Characters (9/10)>>> 6.3ptEverything changes during the latter half of the series when some serious team exploration and internal conflicts take place. The narrative of the show drastically changes, from having an easy-going, light-hearted comedy narrative, about a lackluster team blindly aiming to the top. To a bona fide character-driven narrative that focuses on self-discovery, confrontation of one’s doubts and fear, and an inspiring drama story about mediocre individuals working together, to become something they never imagine they can ever be. This is the time where I got myself immerse and felt invested in Kansei University team efforts, as further I go to discover their struggles, and better know them as a person. As the series progresses, my entire viewpoint of the show changes for the better. I like what the show\'s narrative is aiming for. As the show continues to flesh-out its character you will discover that each character has a purpose. Their personality and life issues are relatable and easy to identify with. I admired the dedication of the show in representing each character, including the supporting cast, on how important they are in the team, each individual’s contribution matter and everyone is equal. Everybody is important and special on their own rights. This is another thing that impresses me in the show. It actually explains to us the importance of teamwork. It casually explains teamwork, even a person who doesn’t play a team base sport or play sport, in general, will easily understand the message the show is trying to convey. It promotes trust and faith to your fellow men. Life felt more meaningful when someone trusted you and give your life meaning. It always felt good when people rely on you and admire who you are. It is always reassuring that somebody got your back on critical times; this is how the entire Kansei University team felt over time, every time they run. Even though they were forced to run in the first place they gradually soon discover the hidden benefits and joy of the entire scheme. They realize that running gave them the opportunity that they never have the chance to experience before, and that is to live and spend your life with a purpose, without worrying or thinking too much. Even though the interpretation varies from each individual team member, the general message of living your life the fullest in the present is solid. Each individual character of the team has a solid development and resolution, it felt satisfying. I like how organic each character grow and mature towards the end. The show truly respected its character.  Starting from the not so interesting and mediocre individual, developing to highly inspiring and respectable figures, we can look up to. The show truly did a good job of handling its basic story and basic character direction to the fullest. In the end, the entire team runs with an open heart, no longer forced to run. They eventually succeeded in their goal to reach and be the top of Ekiden.  This makes the ending the show more impactful memorable as a whole. They didn’t just win the battle but they won the war! They open the path of a bright future that awaits them to chase down, on the never-ending road of life.Music (7/10) >>> 1.4ptIn connection with the overall theme of the anime about teamwork and inspiration, the soundtrack, OP and ED music add-up with the emotional soul of the show. I always like the soothing atmosphere the soundtrack provides, it is relaxing on calm times. The soundtrack impacts me the most when a certain point is reached; especially when it comes to character resolves, the music presented it in the fullest form. This provides characters internal monologues and achievements memorable. Music is always the best way to convey emotions to its audience. It always felt good that you can comprehend the character\'s current emotional state by just listening to the theme of the music. The show did a good job with this technique. Even though some moments are objectively dull, but because of the carefully chosen musical score, that dull moment becomes impactful moments of the show. Personally I like the soundtrack and ending theme of the show. ""Reset” by Taichi Mukai and ""Michi"" by Taichi Mukai is certainly going to my playlist. The ED music provides motivational and inspirational good vibes, every time I listen to it.Art Style & Animation (7/10) >>> 0.7ptThe art style and animation are alright. It fits perfectly with the theme and characters. I always like the simple design of characters, since I focus to identify them more on their personality. Its mundane atmosphere during calm times is alright, it blends well with the slice of life theme. But I do give it credit towards critical scenarios. The well-crafted change of pacing between mundane backgrounds to colorist/white atmosphere during important character moments, combine with monologues and impactful music composition certainly creates a good formula. Overall the art and animation it’s good for a slice of life, sports anime standard. Even though I found CGI Cars or CGI running men rather disturbing to look up but that’s my personal preference.Enjoyment (7/10)Personally I am not a sporty person. I prefer indoor activities more than outside. I like to play on board games than physically exerting myself. I just got interested in the synopsis of the series. And it is a kind of sport that I haven’t seen before. It’s not about boys playing with their balls but rather boys running marathons that are 10km to 20km so I gave it a try. My expectation of this anime direction would be somewhere in the line of ballroom e youkoso about a mediocre character going for the top. Considering studio I.G is adapting it from a material that I certainly never heard off, made it more interesting. Studio I.G had never failed me before when it comes to basic slice of life with sports before.It’s a good thing I trusted my instincts and experience. Turns out I like the show. Even though it started barely weak in the first few episodes but became more solid as it goes on. I love the moral lessons this show provides, I like its characters, I love the ED music and the animation style. I really enjoy it from the middle to finish.Overall Impression (8.4/10)>>> A Solid Very Good ShowI always prefer a show with a slow start but with a solid foundation from the middle to ending, than a promising start with unstable middle and ending. Run with the Wind proves, that even with a basic plot and a basic set of average individuals characters can present a narrative that can rival the sophisticated stories with complex characters. It proves that a deep and meaningful message can be made on the most mundane of setting. I admire the flow of the writing of the story, how it presents and develops its characters overtime is certainly commendable. I wish more anime like this are produce and more people support this type of shows. Run with the Wind is certainly a rare gem for me. The message it represents to me is a tear-jerking a life change experience. ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru, better known as Run with the Wind, is about. This anime is not just an anime about track and field. But this anime also about our struggles in life, instead of walking forward, we decide to run-away aimless.(Short Synopsis)The show started off on one faithful night when Kakeru was being chased down by the convenient store for shop-lifting, this caught Haiji attention, after chasing down the culprit, Haiji realizes the potential of Kakeru in running, He then immediately offer Kakeru free residents in Chikusei-so apartment which Kakeru impulsively accepts. We are then introduced with 8 other college students residing in the apartment studying in the same university Kakeru’s attend to, which is Kansei University. After the welcome party of celebrating Kakeru’s residency as the 10th resident of Chikusei-so, Haiji later revealed that the apartment was formally the dormitory of the Kansei University Track Club. This further reveals his true intentions, the sole purpose of creating a 10 person track and field team to participate Hakone Ekiden, a prominent university marathon relay race in Japan, this explains why the apartment provided cheap rent and free food. Residents that sign the contract permitting them to live in Chikusei-so apartment are required to participate in the track and field club activities, or if they refuse, they immediately need to pack-up and leave. Unfortunately, the resident of the apartment cannot afford to move to another apartment so they have no choice but to participate in the club activities. This sparks the start of the main plot of the story. Honestly, the first few episodes are slow and boring for me. Around this duration, the plot focuses on introducing uninteresting and not so impressive batch of college students that has nothing special going for them. Frankly, in the first episode, it makes me believe that they have no chance of winning and they are too far away to reach their goal in reaching Hakone Ekiden.  For the reason, not all of them are willing to join and given that the majority of them are not even runners. It is kind of funny and interesting for me to see how this show will go on later episodes since this kind of joke will die out fast in a few episodes.Content Below Contain Spoilers.(The Analysis)Plot & Characters (9/10)>>> 6.3ptEverything changes during the latter half of the series when some serious team exploration and internal conflicts take place.

If you slightly like sports or into it, this anime will make you wish that it never ends.In my opinion, what makes an anime great is the ending and the desire to watch it one episode after another. BUT, i just realized that might not apply on all of them. Sometimes the process of waiting and building into a good story with a direct legit art, is all what it takes.Beside when it comes to sport anime, you need to have faith in Production I.G, hope to see more of their works... ', 'Time to review another one of the MAL top 100! At least at the time of this review it\'s in the top 100. Run with the Wind is being hailed as one of the greatest sports anime of all time. While I feel it got a little overhyped and overrated, it\'s certainly a good anime and well worth checking out!Wind is the 2nd novel from author Shion Miura to be adapted into an anime. The first was The Great Passage back in 2016. Remember that one? It was about a 30 year old guy with autism that struggled with interpersonal skills, but found an...ideal career editing a new edition of the Japanese dictionary. It was an extremely unique and ambitious anime, but my old buddy Zeph said it was boring and it got absolutely crucified here on MAL. Since Zeph is MIA, Miss Miura\'s 2nd novel got a much warmer reception here...despite actually being even slower and more boring than Great Passage!So what is Wind about? This is an anime about a ragtag team of college misfits trying to enter into a marathon relay called the Hakone Ekiden. The H.E. requires 10 runners for each team, with each athlete needing to run between 18 and 23 kilometers. The guy trying to make all this happen is a literature major named Haiji. Haiji is in his senior year and only has one chance to assemble a team and try make this happen. His father was a great track athlete and Haiji himself was an incredible prodigy back in high school. However, he injured his leg and had to take a break from running. A mere injury couldn\'t kill his love of the sport though and now he\'s determined to gather a team no matter what...by pressuring and pestering his dorm mates.The first 10 episodes go like this. Haiji: ""Hey, you guys should run the marathon with me"". Everyone: ""No! We don\'t wan to run the marathon. We\'re out of shape!"" Haiji: ""Come on guys! It will be fun! At least practice with me!"" Everyone: ""Ok...we\'ll at least practice, but we still aren\'t running in the stupid marathon!""That\'s literally all that happens for the first 5 hours. This is the slowest sports anime I\'ve ever seen. To be fair, it\'s much more of a character study and drama than it is a traditional sports show. It\'s adapted from an actual novel after all, not a shonen manga.One of the recurring themes of Wind is simply how daily exercise can improve your life. Each character has their own struggles and issues, but the seemingly simple task of running each day manages to help everyone. Daily exercise instills discipline and increases the ability to delay gratification. It also boosts self confidence and improves health.Like any drama, Wind is heavily focused on character development. Sadly, I don\'t think Miss Miura wanted to actually write 10 characters. She just needed 10 to fill out the H.E. requirement. So we get 2 identical twins who just want to have sex. We get an otaku whose character is that he\'s an otaku. Some of the characters like King, Kakeru, and Haiji get wonderful character moments and development, but it\'s not evenly spread. To be fair, it\'s really hard to properly flesh out 10 characters in just 23 episodes.The art by production IG is one of the highlights of the series. This anime looks absolutely GORGEOUS. Not only is it fluid and bright, but also very consistent. Another IG anime I\'ve been watching is Vinland Saga, which looks great one minute and then you get smacked in the face with some AWFUL CG. Fortunately, Wind is a lot more consistent. Whoever was animation director really did their job. What\'s even more impressive was that this is an entire series about running, which is hard to animate. Walking in general is hard to animate. Why do you think cheap anime like to show characters from the waist up? It isn\'t just bad anime studios that fuck up walk cycles. Studio Madhouse back in the 1990s use to do it all the time. Watch an episode of Trigun and wait for any scene with a crowd. Random characters will be moving across the screen at a different pace than their footsteps, leading to what my offline buddy has dubbed ""The Madhouse Moonwalk"". Basically, Wind\'s animation is stellar. No complaints there.Overall, this series starts out slow but grows into something pretty damn good! While I prefer Great Passage, Wind is still a great experience. I tried really hard to avoid any spoilers in this review, but just be prepared for one of the most random, out of nowhere romantic confessions I\'ve seen in anime. I don\'t want to talk more about that and spoil it, but it REALLY should have had more time play out. Other than that, it\'s an anime I recommend. If you like Wind, be sure to support Miss Miura and also check out Great Passage. ideal career editing a new edition of the Japanese dictionary.

This is an anime that has touched my heart more than any other work of art I have ever experienced in my twenty years of life. I\'m writing this review immediately after viewing the final episode, and I am truly grateful for this series.The underlying theme of this series concerns youth. In college, we are pulled in so many directions, and...have to focus on our futures and our careers more than ever. This series has taught me that these are the years of my life that I cannot allow to slip by. I must take full advantage of my youth, and live it to the fullest alongside my friends and my family. I believe that any college student, or soon to be college student, can learn much from this series and these brilliant characters, and I sincerely hope that my words will reach at least one person in this world.I was a runner in high school, I loved it and I hated it. I love to run, but I don\'t love to race. I quit after two years, and didn\'t run once my entire senior year of high school, and freshman year of college. This series reintroduced me to the joy of running. Since episode 1 aired last October, I run almost every morning with the show\'s beautiful OST on repeat.I vehemently recommend this series, and rate it 10/10; a masterpiece.The Merriam- Webster dictionary defines a masterpiece as ""a work done with extraordinary skillespecially : a supreme intellectual or artistic achievement.”I cannot express enough with words how truly this defines Run with the Wind, a series that showed me in just 23 episodes the most interesting and inspiring character development I have ever come into contact with.I laughed, I cried, and after 23 episodes I feel that this series will stay with me as long as I live. When watching a weekly series, I always used to wait, and let them stack, so that I am able to binge and more easily digest a show, but never could I do this for Run with the Wind. Never once could I wait even a second to watch the show that moves me more and more with each episode. The three week hiatus in the middle was so frustrating that when the series returned I cried uncontrollably, to my family\'s dismay and amusement.""I finally understand. Whether I run or I don’t, it hurts just the same. Even if I fail, I want to do what my heart desires here.""Haiji, Kakeru, and the rest of the team feel like truly important people in my life, and amazingly I am able to deeply relate to all 10 of them. I think that any runner, that any college student, that any youth can relate to these masterfully written characters, and experience their triumphs and their misfortunes as one\'s own. Never have I enjoyed a cast of characters so much, and learned at least one valuable lesson from 10 individual characters in a work. Prince and Haiji will forever inspire me!""This world is too beautiful.But that’s okay.My love hasn’t changed. Never has. Never will.I like running.I love it.""I like Run with the Wind, I love it, and I think both socially and philosophically it is one of the most important artworks of our generation.Don\'t waste another second of your youth, get out there with your friends and strive for something greater than yourself. Never doubt yourself, and never act like someone you\'re not. These phrases are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the vital life lessons to be learned from Run with the Wind, but don\'t take my word for it. I insist that you view this series for yourself, and maybe, just maybe, you\'ll have the same beautiful experience as myself.What is strength? What is running? What is living?

So great to fall asleep to :)', 'I never really enjoyed any sports anime ever before watching this anime. The reason I never liked any sports show was simple, you see all any sports anime ever did was just putting so much effort on the sports itself that they forget to develop the characters who are the essential part of the anime(looking at Haikyuu, yuri on ice and free).I was really shocked to see a anime about running that does not show any character running until ep 5 or 6, I mean how sports anime do that these days. Rather then making us show the characters running from the start it takes...that time to develop the characters itself, because what good a shallow character is to the show. And mind you this anime has a lot of characters that need ample to develop and shine in limited amount of time, but damn not a single minute of any ep is wasted and its pure story-telling and good characters dynamics.I wish I had anything to complain about this anime but this anime does not let me do that because its that good, I really like how Haiji interacts with with other characters and how genuine he is. Also how kakeru goes from being a antisocial to just being friendly with everyone, its just  heartwarming. And akane is my soul animal, really he is so relatable and puts so much effort to come out of his comfort zone for something that only benefits other the most.This is how a sports anime should be done and every other sports anime should take notes from this.

Among all of the shows I\'ve seen so far, Kaze ga has got to be one of my favorites. And I\'m surprised at how underrated this show is right now, considering how enjoyable and good it is. I haven\'t watched a lot of sports shows AND I\'m only writing this after watching 6 eps (I\'ll probably update this when I have more things to say), so of course take my opinion with a grain of salt.First, probably the weakest aspect of the show so far: the story. Now, I don\'t want...you to think that the story is trash or anything like that. It\'s actually pretty good. The thing is that we\'re only getting started and taking things slowly, which is certainly not a bad decision since this show is gonna run (heh) for 24 episodes.Moving on to the art and animation, I gotta say that this is one of the better looking shows of the season. The art style is very similar to another show adapted by Production I.G.: Haikyuu!!, but what really stands out to me is some of the shots and little scenes, like at the end of episode 1 and one of the scenes with Kurahara in episode 4.The ""sound"" aspect is also pretty good, the OST fits nicely with the tone of the shows and the scenes and it\'s generally very pretty and calm. The OP by Unison Square Garden is one of the best (in my opinion of course) of the season, with some nice visuals too. The ED is also really good, with it\'s nice, catchy electronic/modern vibe.And now, probably my favorite aspect of the show: the characters. Usually if you\'re not going to have a super flashy or original story, then I\'m hoping you\'re going to show some good characters. It\'s hard to describe what exactly makes these characters so good, but one of my favorite things is how they interact with each other, especially Haiji with the rest of the members. Their personalities are also pretty distinct and good, matching some of their designs and shit. Plus, it\'s refreshing to see a sports story with characters that are on college and not on high-school.Thanks to the characters, the show is very enjoyable and actually doesn\'t have a lot of dull or boring moments. I had a good time watching them practicing or doing every day stuff. The animation and OST also help to make some of the scenes more enjoyable and interesting. I could see the lack of really important events turning off some people though.Overall, Kaze ga is one of the better shows of the season so far, thanks to it\'s large cast of characters and good technical aspects. While there\'s not a lot of exciting running stuff happening, the story is building up and could end up being really good. If you haven\'t watched this show, please give it a chance because it\'s one of the most underrated shows in the season and deserves some attention. you to think that the story is trash or anything like that.

Personally, I try and watch for enjoyment instead of picking apart every little thing within an anime. Anime, in my opinion should be watched with enjoyment rather than be slammed down by little tiny flaws that lowers the overall ""score.""Now I am going to tell you why I enjoyed this anime, instead of breaking down every detail.I must admit, the synopsis is bad. However, if the synopsis is holding you...back from watching this anime, fear not. I feel as if they included some of the most irrelevant information possible. If you are even considering watching this anime, I hope that I give you the push to watch it.This anime sort of follows a very ""sports"" arc where they train and hope to go to nationals. However, when watching the anime you find that instead of focusing on the ""sports"" aspect, you are more focused on the characters. That is what set it apart from any regular anime. I love each of the 10 main characters and their personalities make it easy to like them. They all are struggling with something in their life within the sport and outside. Although they don\'t like to show the weak side of them, each of them makes a commitment to change, especially our main character, Kakeru. When characters grow in anime, I think that has to be the most satisfying thing ever. Even though the anime After the Rain and Violet Evergarden have nothing to do with ""sports"" I still felt similar vibes from them.When the anime tells you about who they are as individuals, seeing them succeed makes me happy/satisfied. Seeing things not go as smoothly as I thought was a nice change of pace. Within a race, anything can happen and if you aren\'t feeling 100% it won\'t change the fact that you are going to do the race still.If you aren\'t sold at this point, this anime was developed by Production I.G. I am sure that you have watched other anime that have been made by them such as Attack on Titan, Kuroko no Basket and especially Haikyuu!! So why not watch this one as well? On top of that, this anime went from around a 7.4* rating from week one to 8.24* rating.This is for the people who want individual marks on the aspects of things.------------------Art - 9.5Never gets in the way of things which is all I really care about. *It was beautiful*Sound - 9Opening 1 was amazing and Opening 2 was forgettable.

The only reason this wasn\'t a 10 is because at times I felt the ending of an episode was a little bit lackluster.------------------To everyone. At least give this anime a try as I think it won\'t hurt. What is also kind of weird is that the main character looks a little like Kageyama from Haikyuu!! I also liked the little bit of comedy in there as well, made it an added bonus. The drama is also totally justifiable instead of just starting random fights with no reason behind it.

Without spoiling too much, we find out early on that Haiji, one of the main characters is injured and goes through a phase in his life where he is completely unmotivated.  Any sports anime that has a character that I can relate to is always nice since I can feel as if I am not alone in the situation that I am in.

Maybe it wasn't such a great idea to watch a new sports anime right after watching one of my all time favorites, but my opinion would probably remain the same regardless: it was underwhelming.The premise is promising and its characters are strong but its execution of plot elements and overall execution is underwhelming. It relies too heavily on the viewer's innate suspension of disbelief to progress the story where it wants to go. It was a bit of a...struggle to get through the beginning third of the anime because it presented a lot of conflicts but had no satisfactory solutions for them. The characters were the strongest aspect of this anime but I felt that there could have been a lot more background and character development with them. I rarely cry but there was one moment near the end of the series that was incredibly emotional and moved me to tears.There were good moments but there were too many moments that I disliked that prevents me from rating this higher. I am aware that this is an anime but you can't simply introduce very realistic stakes and parameters and choose to disregard them when it's convenient. I don't think I would recommend this to anyone. struggle to get through the beginning third of the anime because it presented a lot of conflicts but had no satisfactory solutions for them.

Questions such as ""What is running?"" and how characters use the activity to solve their emotional problems is something that is presented in the series, which is not necessarily something bad, as any series about ""Sports"" that is worth its salt, comes in with well defined motivations for its characters. But the sport is just as important to me as are the characters participating in it, and the activity needs to be interesting to keep me engaged. And running is simply just not interesting to watch and the show puts in very little effort to make it such. I am very intrigued by how a sport works as a competitive endeavor, and all I consider running is a good exercise for endurance and the show does nothing to expand my knowledge on it. I\'m not holding the series accountable for not making one of the most basic actions humans are capable of interesting or not having something worthwhile to present that would blow my mind on it, but all I am saying is that I need the sport to actually be a sport. If the characters partake into an activity, I need to understand the activity and find it interesting. It\'s the driving factor for how much fun I have with a ""Sports"" series and that is missing here.""Then you are wrong and you should shift your perspective. As you said, the series seeks to explore what the characters value. You should treat it as a drama.""That\'s a fair thing to say. If the series doesn\'t focus on the sport, perhaps it focuses on characterization and story. Which is true for this series. Its merits are not gonna lie within the sport because its large focus is on the characters and how the group is being formed to participate in this marathon. And with the theme of the show being able to move forward and find motivation and running is merely its tool, I shouldn\'t criticize running for having that function. The problem is that I am not interested in the series as a drama, and I have seen shows that use the very same theme, while also engaging me with whatever activity they present. As a result, I cannot forgive any writing shortcomings that the series has because there\'s nothing to distract me from any flaws or anything else I might dislike or feel is lacking.And what I do feel is lacking is an element of individualism and that is because the group itself is more valued than the individual characters, because this is a story about how a group forms and moves forward. And I hate that approach when someone attempts to explore what the characters value. Regardless of whether you want or not or like it or not, if the group complies, you also do, and that is a very lazy start. And that\'s what happens to most of the characters within the episodes I watched. They roll over, accept and participate regardless of how they feel and what they actually want. And that\'s my issue. The series maintains too much stability and despite the characters being against the idea, they barely put any fight, because it is more convenient for them not to, and perhaps having their emotions and motivations explored on the way or at a later time. As long as the team keeps moving forward, we can accept showing some individuality piece by piece.I do get that this is a series about finding motivation, so having motivation from the start to do any of what the series requires for its endgoal is counterintutive. But the way they accept running doesn\'t feel natural. They simply seem to be stuck doing the activity until they will feel like ""I guess this can be useful to me."". With proper characterization and good individual focus, I would be able to immediately accept them and how they act. And I don\'t think that even currently the way they act is not understandable, I simply dislike that the characters are forced to it and they eventually just decide that it motivates them.However, I can see how this series can be very appealing if you are interested in the dynamics of a group, rather than individual people. One benefit the show has from this approach is that you see how the group is being formed and what the group collectively values and how they interact with each other. This is not the story of a single protagonist, but rather the team he is stuck with, his pack, and who they will become moving forward. How he and everyone will move forward through a healthy activity in a healthy way, and how their lives will become better. A group can be a lot more interesting than a few characters that are well developed but the others get the short end of the stick. It is not the case here because to me, every character seemed to get equal treatment. While I do think that the series overrides the identities of the characters by forcing them to run essentially, I won\'t deny that I am disliking this series for its strengths, rather than weaknesses. I personally would enjoy if the show was more character-driven, but its approach to be group-driven has its own merits for other people I am sure. And I can see its highly optimistic approach be very endearing to many. Other people might also enjoy the controlled pace of the series and how each character finds their own motivation to participate in the marathon as the series goes on.To people like me, the lack of a well defined sport will make the series feel preachy, and as if there is nothing worthwhile to explore due to the fact that the characters were not built to achieve something, but rather to find something they want to achieve. But to other people, the slowly directed pace and focus on the collective put on the entire group might make them feel comfortable while watching the series and keep them around for more, giving the series a big enough shot for each character to be built for the marathon. The series has a deeper meaning and it is not made for sheer entertainment value. Unfortunately I don\'t seek that deeper meaning and I needed that sheer entertainment value to be interested. I recommend this series if you want to watch a group of people move forward, and find meaning in their lives. Do not watch this if you seek what I seek from this genre: what will people do to achieve their goals and through what difficulties they will go in the process. Also the show has a lot of manservice. Lots of naked boys that seem to have a sensitive softer side.

The problem is that I am not interested in the series as a drama, and I have seen shows that use the very same theme, while also engaging me with whatever activity they present. As a result, I cannot forgive any writing shortcomings that the series has because there\'s nothing to distract me from any flaws or anything else I might dislike or feel is lacking.And what I do feel is lacking is an element of individualism and that is because the group itself is more valued than the individual characters, because this is a story about how a group forms and moves forward. And I hate that approach when someone attempts to explore what the characters value. Regardless of whether you want or not or like it or not, if the group complies, you also do, and that is a very lazy start. And that\'s what happens to most of the characters within the episodes I watched. They roll over, accept and participate regardless of how they feel and what they actually want. And that\'s my issue. The series maintains too much stability and despite the characters being against the idea, they barely put any fight, because it is more convenient for them not to, and perhaps having their emotions and motivations explored on the way or at a later time. As long as the team keeps moving forward, we can accept showing some individuality piece by piece.I do get that this is a series about finding motivation, so having motivation from the start to do any of what the series requires for its endgoal is counterintutive. But the way they accept running doesn\'t feel natural. They simply seem to be stuck doing the activity until they will feel like ""I guess this can be useful to me."". With proper characterization and good individual focus, I would be able to immediately accept them and how they act. And I don\'t think that even currently the way they act is not understandable, I simply dislike that the characters are forced to it and they eventually just decide that it motivates them.However, I can see how this series can be very appealing if you are interested in the dynamics of a group, rather than individual people. One benefit the show has from this approach is that you see how the group is being formed and what the group collectively values and how they interact with each other. This is not the story of a single protagonist, but rather the team he is stuck with, his pack, and who they will become moving forward. How he and everyone will move forward through a healthy activity in a healthy way, and how their lives will become better. A group can be a lot more interesting than a few characters that are well developed but the others get the short end of the stick. It is not the case here because to me, every character seemed to get equal treatment. While I do think that the series overrides the identities of the characters by forcing them to run essentially, I won\'t deny that I am disliking this series for its strengths, rather than weaknesses. I personally would enjoy if the show was more character-driven, but its approach to be group-driven has its own merits for other people I am sure. And I can see its highly optimistic approach be very endearing to many. Other people might also enjoy the controlled pace of the series and how each character finds their own motivation to participate in the marathon as the series goes on.To people like me, the lack of a well defined sport will make the series feel preachy, and as if there is nothing worthwhile to explore due to the fact that the characters were not built to achieve something, but rather to find something they want to achieve. But to other people, the slowly directed pace and focus on the collective put on the entire group might make them feel comfortable while watching the series and keep them around for more, giving the series a big enough shot for each character to be built for the marathon. The series has a deeper meaning and it is not made for sheer entertainment value. Unfortunately I don\'t seek that deeper meaning and I needed that sheer entertainment value to be interested. I recommend this series if you want to watch a group of people move forward, and find meaning in their lives. Do not watch this if you seek what I seek from this genre: what will people do to achieve their goals and through what difficulties they will go in the process. Also the show has a lot of manservice. Lots of naked boys that seem to have a sensitive softer side. Have fun with that piece of information.', 'My favorite kinds of sports anime are those which are not sports anime, but more of a character drama. this show was one of those shows that i couldn\'t stop watching. i marathoned the first 8 episodes in one sitting. i then decided to go to sleep but the show invaded my thoughts to the point where i couldn\'t, and i needed to catch up fully and watch the other 2 released episodes at 4am :Dproduction I.G. always does such a good job with ""sports"" anime so it makes me upset that people are ignoring this show.the character development in the first 10 episodes is...honestly a lot better that some character development in 40 episode long or ongoing anime. i genuinely enjoyed seeing Haiji soften everyone around the edges and making the 10 boys seem more like a family than a band of misfits like they seemed at first. Also, watching Kurahara gain confidence, take charge, and make friends was heartwarming to say the least. At the end of the currently aired 10 episodes i found myself wanting more and craving more as i did when catching up with other shows this season. even more so which surprised me because it doesn\'t seem to have the large critical backing that i would expect from a show of this quality. speaking of quality, the music is amazing and the only problem i have with the animation is the use of CG during the running sequences (but i have never been a fan of CG in any anime).

But...it\'s not really a ""sport"" anime and I\'m going to tell you why.Well, I looked up the reviews on this anime before writing my own and I found an interesting one, to clarify I really love this anime but there are some cons in it. As I said before, I found an interesting review where was said that this anime is not realistic in terms of sport. For example, there was one character who was the weakest in the team and he was running 5km in 35+ minutes, but only in about half and a year or a year he was able to run a 5km track in 16 minutes which is not possible in real life. An amateur can achieve a 5km in 20-25 in a year or more and it is already very difficult. So sport\'s stats are not the strongest part of this show.But that\'s not why I love this anime, this anime is about passion, drama, hard work and power of the friendship, there are so many things that made me cry while I was watching it that I couldn\'t even count. I cannot tell you why this anime made me feel this way otherwise it would be a spoiler, but if you want to watch some slice-of-life drama that is happening on the running track, this anime is definitely for you.Btw I rewatch this anime every year and it\'s motivated me to start running it\'s not really a ""sport"" anime and I\'m going to tell you why.Well, I looked up the reviews on this anime before writing my own and I found an interesting one, to clarify I really love this anime but there are some cons in it.

This review is about the anime 'Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru'. It is animated by the studio Production I. G., a studio that exceeds in making great sports anime. And this is one of them. The anime consists of 23 episodes and now that that's all out of the way, to the review!Plot/Story: The story revolves around a group of 10 guys who follow a goal of running in the Hakone Ekiden, a running spectacle only the best runners can get qualified for. It all starts...with Kiyose Haiji witnessing a guy running away from a convenient store after he stole something from there. Haiji immediately follows the guy with his bicycle and asks him right away if he likes running. This thief is Kurahara Kakeru, one of the key plot points in this show. After some events Haiji who wants to run in the Hakone Ekiden manages to get together 9 other guys to complete the minimum number of team members for a track field club. With those 9 Haiji goes into training in order to get the participation.So the plot doesn't sound very amazing but that's okay. A goal doesn't have to be incredibly amazing. It is the journey to that goal that is of importance, that forms you into the human being that you are going to be at the end when you reach your goal. Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru, or with its English title 'Run with the Wind' is about that journey, about the commitment to a goal. While the core plot isn't anything masterful the anime thrives from its rich characters and their story, their reason. On the other spectrum one needs to have good writing skills to construct a story with a simple concept but with a build of characters (or other aspects) that are strong enough to support the simple story and and make it into what it becomes in the end.Art: There are two reasons why this anime looks so good. 1st. It's done by Production I. G. and 2nd. It's a sports anime done by Production I. G. This studio is very well known for another great sports anime called 'Haikyuu'. They also were responsible for the sports anime 'Ballroom e Youkoso', both shows being great sports anime. I. G. is the king of anime when it comes to sports anime. Honestly they should animated all sports anime, period. Because of them the animation and artstyle is the same as Haikyuu and Ballroom, so if you like that style and you probably are then you will like this show's artstyle as well. Because it's the same. Production I. G. as they are in their regular fashion don't lower down on the quaility of animation or artstyle. There isn't a single drop in quality that I could find. That's not something that's a given in the anime industry, especially when nowadays it's more quantity over quality. There is CGI involved in the show but only for cars or background runners. This makes it easier on the animation and drawing board team. Thankfully they didn't settle for bad CGI and they don't feel out of place.Sound: Sound is great, honestly. Both openings and endings are greatly chosen and the BGM is equally as good. Talking about the sound in an anime is often not as easy as the others because the only things you can say about Run with the Wind is that it has good musical compositions and all that, but after watching the show it did not stick out in that.Characters: This is the best part of the show and I feel it's one the points I can talk least about. All 10 teammates and even other charcaters would deserve to be talked about big style. But that would just increase the length of this review needlessly. Therefore I will try to limit it as much as I can. All characters are rich in personality and ambitions. In favor of the plot all the charcaters are in college which is a very refreshing change for once. Haiji is a man with a big but small dream. And for that dream he looked for people he could achieve that with. The sport is  the main center of the anime and the characters do that sport. Around and during all this each of the characters has to come to terms with their own inner conflicts. Obstacles they have to overcome. It didn't feel at all that any of the teammates got less screen time than the others. Each one was highlighted at at times where it was needed. Everyone was important for the story, for the team. Kakeru, one of the more central points in the show. A great runner with a love for running. But his love comes into conflict with himself. At times like these it is to lean on others for help. The characters are all equally as strong.Enjoyment & verdict: One of the best sports anime I have ever seen and possibly one of the best sports anime out there. I was deeply motivated by the show, I even started to run a bit myself. And when the sports anime manages to make you interested in the sport itself then it achieved exactly what it wanted to. I thoroughly enjoyed every episode of this show and I am quite sad it's already over. A truly great show. I highly recommend everyone to watch this show. It is one of the best things to have come out in the last year, maybe even last two.And with that I will excuse myself. There are other reviews waiting on the shelf.

Until the next time!"", '""Do you like running?""Run with the wind is a sports anime about a group of University students forming a team to enter the Hakone Ekiden. I\'m going to keep this review short  and as spoiler free as possible.Story- (7/10):It\'s a simple story, nothing special. It\'s offers a nice change of pace from your typical sports anime considering the characters are college students and their goal isn\'t to be the number 1 school team, but simply run in Hakone.Characters- (8/10):The crux of this show is the characters. If you\'re not connected to the characters then this show probably won\'t be for you. We spend...a lot of time with our main cast watching them grow as runners while deal with their own personal issues e.g. Kakeru\'s traumatic past, King\'s struggle to find a job, Nico rediscovering his love for running. A lot of the character stories are relatable and makes you want to root for them, especially Prince. The character interactions are great and everyone gets an ample of screen time.That being said, I think some of the characters could have been better developed e.g. Sasaki, who\'s Kakeru\'s old team mate is a dick with no redeeming qualities. Fujiwara who\'s the top runner is pretty bland as a character. There\'s no focus on anyone else in their school teams aside from those two characters. The coach does next to nothing for most of the show. Hina is kinda of the manager, but doesn\'t really have any depth besides being the supportive cute girl. Also, the twins comedic relief is a bit annoying.The drama and conflicts could have been handled better too e.g. Haiji gets away easily for persauding everyone to join the team. Kakeru\'s rivalry with Sasaki and  the reason Sasaki acts like a dick is petty. King having no other option to get a job so he runs with the team is unrealistic. One of the members of the getting sick right before the race had no foreshadowing. However, my main problem with the show is you need to suspend disbelief at times. Aside from Kakeru and Haiji, the team consists of a group of rookies trying to enter Hakone in a couple of months compared to elite runners who have probably been running their whole lives. I can suspend disbelief for most of the team because it’s a sports anime despite it being illogical for them being able to compete, however Prince throws logic out the window. Prince is a otaku who reads manga and can\'t run to save his life. I like him, but under no circumstances would he realistically be able to qualify, let alone run in Hakone.Animation & Sound- (7/10):The animation is fine for the most part, though it does get derpy at times.

The ending as said was satisfying and...wrapped up pretty nicely. However, I would have preferred to get the clear picture of the romantic interest of particular characters but it was left for the audience to guess.Character (9/10);“What does it mean to run?” Is it running away from your past or from your responsibility or is it simply to leave everyone behind to reach the eternal glory? The answer to this simple yet puzzling question is what drives the characters forward. Each character from the main cast has their own story to tell. From a physically weak weeb to the best runner of the team. Everyone gets sufficient amount of development and all of this happens through running. As our main cast runs, they search for the answer which ultimately guides them to their future career at the end. Very satisfying character development, loved the way they wrapped it up in only 23 episodes. My only complain is some interesting characters not getting enough screen time to shine. Other than that A class character development.Art (8/10):Not much to say in this department. Both art & animation were pretty decent. Especially the last race was animated really well. Some less important race felt kind of rushed but overall a job well done.Soundtrack (9/10):Some of the osts were top notch & blended with the overall atmosphere. Especially the soundtracks during the competitions were satisfying to hear. Also both op & ed are pretty goodEnjoyment (7/10):Would have preferred one or two more episodes for satisfying conclusion to some race & character arc.

The writing is phenomenal, and is beautifully told with the help of choreography, cinematography, great voice acting and beautiful art.I want to stress that this anime is not only for people who enjoy running. This anime addresses deep philosophical questions that can be applied anywhere in life, and will always be relevant.The art and character design is flawless. The characters are memorable. So much so that you could determine what character you are looking...at simply by looking at their posture. Subtle expressions, or lack thereof, can reveal to you exactly what the character is thinking. That's something that even professional actors struggle with, yet is achieved in this animation.Running with the Wind does not have flashy or over-the-top animations, though the animation achieves what it should and never looks cheap or out of place.

I will compare Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru with Haikyuu so it doesnt matter if you have not seen the show, as you will understand my review if you know whats Haikyuu about.One of the most important things a spokon anime has to succeed at is to convince the viewer that the sport they are watching is interesting, to show the appeal of that sport. When I watched Haikyuu I was amazed of how enyojable volleyball seemed to be, but...this show had a more difficult task.Unlike football or basketball, athletics is a sport which lacks of excitement in some of its modalities, specially in long duration ones, as they consist of a person running for hours. Thats why, while the most important part of other spokons is the action and the games, this anime relies more on the characters, exchanging the electric scenes for internal speeches.This show starts as every other spokon I know does. It has a promising protagonist, an underdog team and some cliche main cast.One of my main issues with Haikyuu (and spokon in general), is that the characters only have their respective sport in mind. If you are not told that they are high school students, how would you know? They spend every minute in the court, training for several hours everyday. So, where are they examns? And their problems? Where are the injuries? There are no family issues, they dont think about love relationships, they dont care about exams, they are just there for the sake of playing volley.However, Kaze ga tsuyoku fuiteiru is about college students, about adults. These guys are worried because they wont find a job, because they cant stop smoking or because they are gaining weight.Everyone who has practiced sports in their life know that it encompasses a wide series of concepts so training isnt everything that concerns a sporty.If you have seen some spokons, you will be used to the ""I want to be better"" plot device to develop characters. Well, you wont see that in this anime. Every character has his own arc to question themselves ""why am I running?"", and the show portrays the personalities and problems of every character in a perfect way. There are a lot of enyojable characters in this show but the most remarkable one is Kiyose Haiji.Although we see the story from the perspective of Kurahara Kakeru, the protagonist is Haiji. He inspires Kurahara and the whole team, he moves the plot forward, he helps every character to surpass their problems while recuperating of a knee injury. In case you dont know, knee injuries are the most dangerous in almost every aerobic sport and depending on what type of structural damage you have, the recovery and  rehabilitation can last for several months or even years. I relate a lot to this guy.When I saw the first race and I noticed the CGI animation I was disappointed. Production IG always have great animation, but I guess that hundreds of athletes running was too much. Anyway, the CGI wasnt that bad (Im not an expert, but if it does not make me want to stop watching the show as Overlord or Re Zero did, I dont consider it bad).Character designs are detailed, sharp and pretty well done overall and I bet some anime movies would like to have such detailed backgrounds. In the summer vacation arc, the scenes where they are running around the lake are so fucking precious.The best tool for a spokon anime to hook the viewer is music. When you are watching Haikyuu and ""Battle of concepts"" starts to play, you know something big is coming and you start getting chills through the spine. This show doesnt have that great soundtrack, but it has pretty good songs too. The first opening is catchy and I love the first ed because it reflects PERFECTLY what injuries feel like. The seiyuus did a great job expressing how the characters felt (Haiji almost make me cry with his last speech) and for 20 episodes, I thought the twin\'s VA was the same lol.In conclussion, it doesnt matter if you are a spokon fan or not, as the perfect balance between action and character development this anime offers will satisfy you anyway.

One of the underrated shows of Fall 2018.', 'This anime does such a great job of capturing character emotion and depth. It\'s outstanding how hype this show portrays running, a sport that can often be marked as one dimensional. I\'m beyond impressed by the story development — nothing is overly dramatic or unrealistic in its progression. Each character is exceptionally dynamic with their individual quirks. Surpassing all of my expectations, Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru earns a well deserved 10 rating in all criteria.I would recommend this anime to anyone but especially to the runners that understand the relentlessness of a long distance sport, the compelling spirit and bond of being on a team,...and the feeling of ""I hate running"" but continue the self inflicted suffering anyways. and the feeling of ""I hate running"" but continue the self inflicted suffering anyways.', ""Ahh, I finally get to review one of my favourites of the season. My mate and I loved watching this weekly and discussing it at university, the quick message of: 'it's out!' honestly brought joy to my Tuesday!Story, 7: The story is your standard underdog sports anime. 10 people from different backgrounds and different interests are roped into joining the running club. The story is nothing special... but it also does nothing wrong either; it simply enjoyable. The pacing is fantastic with potentially too much backstory, but with 23 episodes, I think it gets away with it.For once, the anime is set in...a university, so the themes and issues dealt with tend to be more mature and allowed me to sympathise with it more as I am in university.Art, 7: Again, the art is your standard sports anime, there is nothing distinctly different about the art style. In parts, the running animation is a bit janky, but this rarely detracts from the actual races. The crowds and backgrounds are all drawn to a high standard.Sounds, 7: I liked both the ops and ending songs from each season. The ost is nothing special but serves it's purpose well. The sound design for the races and voice acting is faultless but not amazing either.Character, 10: The most special attribute of this anime is definitely the characters. They are the reason I continued to watch every week. Each character feels real, they are not archetypes stuffed into a 2 dimension drawing. Each character has their own merits and personality, some quite surprising to see in anime. The character design is flawless. I will say the typical antagonist, and rival runner could have been developed more, but it was very cool to see an African character be portrayed in a very positive light.Enjoyment, 8: I thoroughly enjoyed this anime, sure it is not the best sports anime I have ever watched, but is does the fundamentals well. It is just a sweet and endearing anime, with a nice overall message.Overall: 8. a university, so the themes and issues dealt with tend to be more mature and allowed me to sympathise with it more as I am in university.Art, 7: Again, the art is your standard sports anime, there is nothing distinctly different about the art style.

The first is the one in which the main character is a genius who excels in all aspects of the game and the rest of the cast is just there trying not to become a liability. The second type is when the main character is a complete and utter noob who just crawled out from underneath their rock trying their best not to be a liability to their more experienced upperclassmen. However there also exists a little known third type in the sports anime world. This rare third type is called Run With The Wind....Run With The Wind certainly came as a surprise to me. All I knew was that it was being made by Production IG, a studio known for making good sports anime. This was the only reason why I decided to watch this. Soon I had another reason to watch it, the story. As I explained above the thing that makes Run With The Wind a rarity is that it’s realistic. When you try a sport for the first time, you are not going to be a master at it. If you want to get good, you have to work hard and practice repetitively. What I like about Run With The Wind is it takes an accessible sport like running which pretty much anyone can do and gives our characters a realistic yet seemingly unattainable goal. Run a marathon. Naturally our characters laugh it off as impossible, but through determination and consistent practice, they build their bodies and minds to get to that point where they are race ready. Now this is where the third type is relevant again. Normally when characters go through a training arc they exude this dominance as if they could take on the world and win. Run With The Wind gets our characters to their first goal but then throws reality in their face. They must compete with other athletes who have dedicated their lives to running. Naturally they perform as expected. This sets the stage for even more grueling hard work and physical exertion getting them ready to face their ultimate test. When they get there it delivers. That’s all I will say on that so as to not head down spoiler alley.The characters in the show is something I have to mention as this show features a large cast of at least a dozen or so relevant characters. Not uncommon for a sports anime yet the way Run With The Wind goes about developing them is something I have to applaud. First off, they are in college. Bravo to a non high school setting. Second I found all of them to be pretty like able. Everyone plays off of each other really well. When it comes to running, naturally not everyone is going to be good at it, and it takes a while for them to even get passable. What I like about them though is as I said before, they are realistic. Every character has some sort of baggage slowing them down whether it be mental or physical and they must work with each other to overcome it.The art and animation is pretty good. Once again this was made by Production IG who are known for some good looking sports anime and Run With The Wind continues that trend. There is some cgi used during the races but it doesn’t look bad nor does it detract from the viewing experience. All of the openings and endings are good with the openings setting the pace nicely no pun intended and the endings calming down our excitement levels giving us a chance to breathe. Together the animation and sound create some breathtakingly beautiful scenes.Overall, I greatly enjoyed Run With The Wind. It was probably the most realistic sports anime that I have ever seen. It was an absolute joy to watch and I highly recommend checking it out. Run With The Wind certainly came as a surprise to me. All I knew was that it was being made by Production IG, a studio known for making good sports anime. This was the only reason why I decided to watch this.

All of the openings and endings are good with the openings setting the pace nicely no pun intended and the endings calming down our excitement levels giving us a chance to breathe. Together the animation and sound create some breathtakingly beautiful scenes.Overall, I greatly enjoyed Run With The Wind. It was probably the most realistic sports anime that I have ever seen. It was an absolute joy to watch and I highly recommend checking it out.', 'SpoilersI\'ve watched plenty of sports anime in my life. To name a few, there\'s Haikyuu, Kuroko no Basket, Diamond No Ace, All Out, and Eyeshield 21. With every sports anime that comes, there was always the same sort of formula. Unrealistic ""superpowers"", a character talking in his head for a solid 20 seconds that add up to 2 seconds in ""real time"", and a main character with one overpowered ability that came in clutch. Coming into Kaze ga Tsuyoku, I expected more or less the same. An anime that would not, in any way, represent how it\'s like to actually play the sport, and some...sort of impossible win where the small fry school somehow ends up beating the number one team for 20 years or something like that.Well, I was pleasantly surprised.In Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru, you start off with what appears to be your main character, Kakeru. Kakeru seems to have been an extreme track athlete in the past, but stopped running due to some traumatic experience. This sort of character isn\'t unheard of in sports anime, and they usually end up regaining their will to play the sport after their teammates call out his name really loudly or something like that.Instead, we see Kakeru stagnating. We see the true struggle of an already proven athlete, which was the feeling that you couldn\'t get any better than you already were. We go through his struggles in trying to get better at running, and his dilemma where no matter how hard he practices, he always gets the same time over and over again. We see him develop not only as a runner, but also as a character, person, and teammate. Watching Kakeru grow was something special, something that no other sports anime managed to show.The real beauty of this anime, however, is the fact that it never focuses solely on Kakeru. While Kakeru was the best runner, the star on the team, the man under the spotlight, the anime chooses to give his nine other teammates the exact same attention that they gave him.We see Musa\'s struggle, being an African exchange student as an Engineering student, despite most African exchange students being runners and the adversity he faces. We see Prince\'s unwillingness to grow and become a runner, and eventually growing the most as a runner from everyone in the group. We see the twin\'s struggle in figuring out what the purpose of running was if they couldn\'t even beat the other top colleges. We see Akihiro\'s desperate pleas to get his weight down, to even resorting to outright skipping daily meals to make sure he isn\'t the anchor dragging down the team. We see King, probably the most relatable character, who\'s just trying to get by while also wondering what the purpose of his life was. Shindo, the guy who gave up his girlfriend for running, the guy who always seemed to be the most constant and reliable teammate, and how in all irony it would be him that would put the team in most jeopardy. And finally we see Haiji, who despite not knowing what his purpose in running was, banded a team of 10 misfits, most who have never ran in their lives, and brought out the goal to reach the biggest college marathon in Japan.If I had any regrets with this anime, it would be how little attention they gave to Yukihiko. It was apparent that he had problems with his family and was apprehensive on why he had to run, but the anime scarcely talked about it besides a couple of scenes, and the last part during his section.Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru is the first sports anime I\'ve ever watched where the main character\'s team didn\'t get first, and weren\'t disappointed. They had received 10th place out of 20, and the team celebrated like they had gotten first. Hell, them getting 10th was probably more of an achievement then to whoever got first.I never thought that a sports anime could be a masterpiece. Before this, a sports anime was at most, slightly memorable and at worst, completely forgettable. This anime, however, is gonna stick in my heart for a pretty long time. sort of impossible win where the small fry school somehow ends up beating the number one team for 20 years or something like that.Well, I was pleasantly surprised.In Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru, you start off with what appears to be your main character, Kakeru.

Before this, a sports anime was at most, slightly memorable and at worst, completely forgettable. This anime, however, is gonna stick in my heart for a pretty long time.', 'Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru: How to face the race of lifeFor some time now, Production I.G. positioned itself in the market as a ""specialized"" studio in offering the spokons of the season. Known for animating major titles such as Kuroko no Basket, Haikyuu or the first seasons of Diamond no Ace, it has also tried with anime with less traditional sports themes such as Ballroom e Youkoso - entertaining anime about ballroom dancing. For this reason, it was no surprise that between the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 they decided to adapt an animated series based on the novel written by Shion...Miura (Fune wo Amu), which told the story of a newly formed athletics group focused on relay race. From the hand of Kazuya Nomura (Robotics;Note, Joker Game) in the direction, Kohei Kiyasu (seiyuu and first in the script field) in the composition and Takahiro Chiba (Haikyuu, Ballroom e Youkoso) in the design of the characters, Production I.G. embarked on a narrative that ended up surprising people of the genre with an anime that possesses the most emotional and suggestive results of the season.This spokon starts telling the story of Kakeru Kurahara, an experienced and talented runner who, by some blows in life, decides to abandon the sport and continue with his recently initiated university life. After several unfortunate events that drive our protagonist to rob a convenience store and run away like a soul that is owned by the devil and tries to not get caught, the life of Kakeru will end up crossing with Haiji Kiyose, a 4th year university student who, after seeing tremendous display of talent in such a strange situation, he will propose to join his athletic club. Although at first our protagonist rejects it without hesitation and murmuring, he will soon discover that Haiji is the landlord of his new student residence - Chikuseisou - and that, in addition, this guy will not leave him alone until he fully involves him in his dream: Forming a team of relay runners who participate in the Hakone Ekiden, one of the most famous marathons aimed for the top university teams in Japan.Kakeru finds the idea of \u200b\u200bHaiji even more far-fetched when he reveals to him that the team he has assembled consists of all the residents of Chikuseisou, a diverse group of college kids with no experience in the sport. The anime narrates, in this way, the tortuous but emotional path of all the members of this newly formed team to reach a goal that seems - in the beginning - utopian. In this journey we will see the conformation of a team and the individual evolution of each member of it. In the course of the story each character will face his worst demons and, through this, will answer big questions that will allow them to continue advancing as individuals and as a collective.From the world of Japanese animation, we met the work of Shion Miura with an adaptation that was made to a work that told the process of making a dictionary (Fune wo Amu). Production I.G. chooses to animate another story of the novelist, centered on a team of relay runners that brought another proposal with overtones of overcoming with more adult airs in ingenious contexts. Run with the Wind takes a slightly different route than the prototypical spokon. First, the most obvious element is the stage of life in which its main characters are: Young university students who go through a stage of self-discovery and transition to adulthood. Far from the schoolgirl burden that gives many spokons a vitality of positivism, drama and eternal freshness, we find in the cast young people who are in a stage of life whose main characteristic is to achieve self-knowledge and self-acceptance of what you are and what you are not, leaving little by little that schizophrenic stage called adolescence. Likewise, it takes subjects more focused on the collectivity and individual development within a sport that is new in the genre.The anime is structured in two large arcs, each fulfilling a purpose and developing important themes. At first we followed the story of the conformation of this new athletics club. Haiji has been recruiting - albeit without anyone\'s knowledge - a group of kids that would be the team of his dreams. The anime begins with the revelation of Haiji\'s dream and his laudable effort to convince each of these newcomers to join his goal. After displaying an unwavering spirit, Haiji - as leader and guide (I would even say spiritual rather than sporting) indisputable of the whole series - starts with the rigorous training whose first major objective is to get each of the boys to achieve a record that allows them to classify to the Hakone Ekiden as a team. In this first part of the process we will not only get to know each of the characters through the small individual dramas that come to light in the recruitment and preparation stage, but also we will delve into our protagonist.Kakeru is probably the character whose evolution gives him more emphasis in this stage. It is a moment where he manages to connect with a team that gives him the strength to continue with a sport that he no longer understands if it produces happiness or not. Through finally being part (really) of a collective, Kakeru manages to heal his traumas through the constant guidance of Haiji and the strong friendship with his other colleagues, learning that the relay race is much more than a path that one travels alone. After all, there are other people you depend on and who depend on you to move forward and meet your goals. Even though one travels the road alone, one learns from others to see them walk the same path as you with different nuances, perspectives and / or objectives. In this process, a sense of belonging and familiarity is born that is also positioned as a motor of personal growth. Although, due to the personality of Kakeru, to focus so much on him and his drama can become something heavy and slow to see. However, the anime that in a first arc did not appear as promising or even relevant in the season, achieves a closure of its story that saves any complaint.After the presentation of each of the characters and the narrative of their effort to be one step ahead of reaching their goal, the second arc is the final sprint of an anime that knew how to present its endearing cast, not only in individual way, but also as a collective that the viewer could see conform and solidify from its inception. The Hakone Ekiden arc closes the individual story of this group of runners in a way that was quite tattooed in my heart.It is therefore the staging of a healing process for each of the characters that involve varied topics such as, for example, the reconciliation with family that you left behind, with oneself for having thought about giving up for not having talent natural in the sport that makes you happy, with the frustrations of a life that seems not to have shone as much as we dreamed, with a team that you learned to love as if it were your family and for what the effort is worth, with the traumas they made practicing this sport come to seem like torture, etc. What this anime did best is to show us the weakness of each of the members of this club and provide a closure for each of their stories in an emotional sequence that had the audience with the heart in the palm of their hands and eyes dampened in each of the final chapters. After all, the race of Hakone Ekiden is a moment in their lives in which they reflect on their main weaknesses, managing to accept them to move forward, being a critical point in their lives that makes them evolve as people.""Why do you run?” Is the guiding question in this anime. It is the question that Haiji constantly asks to his companions. It is not a question that has a single answer or that he himself can answer. It is a question whose answer depends on oneself and that each character will find along the way, always driven to reflection and self-improvement by the guiding figure of the series: Haiji.The strength of this series is precisely how each of the characters is self-discovering and accepting their limitations and potentialities. Not all run for the same reason but through this sport they manage to find themselves. In most spokons there is an emphasis on teamwork and the importance of friendship. Although Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteru has an element of conformation of friendships and even the conformation of a family; Much of the proposal takes real weight by the personal battles of each member.A sport like relay races allows the correct development of two dimensions. On the one hand, we are in the conformation of a team that will have as maxims the values \u200b\u200bof friendship and camaraderie. After all, first of all, the team depends on each of its members to reach the goal. If one gets hurt, gets sick or does not finish his route, all the team will be disqualified; and, therefore, trust in the other was maximum. Second, the formation of bonds of friendship and familiarity among all the characters also involved that the triumph of one is the triumph of all. It is a friend that you have seen suffer in each training, improving every day without stopping and you know how much this race can mean. The feeling of happiness shared by seeing his friends finish their race was also comforting and meant a lot in the development of several of the characters who found in the others a family and sense of belonging that drove them to keep going despite having, sometimes , everything against them.On the other hand, it should be noted that the sport itself forces the characters to develop their individuality as well. While there is a significant team load, one of the most powerful parts of the anime is the development of the individualities of each team member. One runs alone by that path, and like life itself, it is in this journey that one learns lessons, knows oneself and evolves. There are friends, there are mentors, there are different goals or dreams, but finally who runs this race is yourself. The most powerful part of this anime focuses on showing us this self-discovery, this self-acceptance, and with that, seeing how people continue to advance. Each of the characters, therefore, develops its own narrative on how it goes through this process. This makes them close a chapter in their life and with that they keep moving forward, and - finally - those scenes were the best of this anime.Little by little this proposal is tracing a charming path that leaves the viewer committed to the story of each of these guys and, therefore, at the end of the series, the feeling of empathy and admiration for each of them is real. While it is clear that it is unrealistic for a group of novices to participate in the most famous university relay race in Japan in such a short time (having someone like Ōji, a manga fanatic and a sporting nullity, in the team), it is clear that they knew how to grow their story slowly to present one of the best results of the year.With a cast of characters that makes you like them: Not only did I feel identified with Ōji and his spokon references, with King and his hard labor search, with Nico-chan and his resolve to do what he likes despite not having the to do it, with Yuki and his reconciliation with his family, with Musa and his extreme warmth as a human being, with Shindo and his tremendous dedication, with the twins and their growth as individuals, with Kakeru and his newly rediscovered love, and of course, Haiji. The productive value of the anime will not be the best of the studio but it is clearly presented with a narrative and a construction of characters that distill humanity and whose chemistry as a cast is enviable. Definitely, a recommendation for those who want a fresh air in this genre. Miura (Fune wo Amu), which told the story of a newly formed athletics group focused on relay race.

Definitely, a recommendation for those who want a fresh air in this genre.', ""This is a highly recommended, 23 episode beautiful series about running/slice of life of college students. Well, the first factor that draws me in this show at first was it’s produced by I.G. production. And since I am a big fan of Haikyuu (produced by I.G. production as well) I gave it a shot. And throughout my viewing experience every week, I have to say that it was totally worth it. The studio delivered in expressing the main point of the story’s journey and if I was the author of this novel, I will be so proud of this adaptation.It even came to a...point where I can’t wait to watch the next episode for next week so I keep on re-watching the previous episodes. Surprisingly, it never gets boring for me although it might still boils down to a person’s own preference considering that when I recommended it to a female friend of mine, she did not finish it since she find it boring. I was glad though since another friend of mine (male this time and a runner to boot), was really hooked to it.Well, my point is this gem is not a mainstream anime that can please everybody but having experienced the bliss and inspiration from watching it makes me want to share it to anybody who is feeling down from losing a dream, uncertain with what their future entails, unmotivated or even just stuck with just the simple daily norm of life. The characters interactions are very dynamic as well that somehow it makes wish I am resident of “Chikuseisou” drinking with these fellas. I have to commend the soundtrack/bgms used in every episode as well since they really fit the atmosphere of each scene; be it emotional, joyous, triumphant and at the same time, sad. It's a perfect mix of those different elements that for me added to the appeal of this show.There can be some flaws or “unrealistic” achievement of the goal in their running time as what others say but I don’t really mind since in my opinion, the show was still able to portray a clear message of what it want the viewers to feel and understand. They say it’s not the destination but it’s the journey that matters and this series definitely lived up to that.I hope more people will watch this anime and appreciate its true meaning and beauty \uf04a point where I can’t wait to watch the next episode for next week so I keep on re-watching the previous episodes.

The characters all seems to offer something different, the twins offer the narrative  how we often compare ourselves to our siblings and how if...their efforts create slightly better results, we are quick to dismiss our own, however it is important to realize your own self worth. Another disclaimer, I don\'t have any experience dissecting films or other related entertainment and use words like ""narrative"" with a basic understanding of the word, these are simply my opinions and what I took away, but I digress. Akihiro Hirata shows us a man who rekindles his passion for a sport which he once dreamed he could pursue further. Kakeru Kurahara shows us the transition of someone who has always been separated from others for his skill learn the enjoyment of accomplishing something with teammates. There are messages to be found with each character and it is a reason I love this anime.The next topic and last topic I want to talk about is the overall message and its importance and correspondence to the story. The overall message I took away from this anime is it\'s the journey that counts. I really like this message and unlike other sports anime where it like ""I WANNA WIN NATIONALS"" it is more about getting to the big stage rather than taking it all. I know, they want to win the big marathon, but they also accept the overwhelming odds facing them and realize committing to training for something like a long-distance running relay is impressive itself, which I really like.This was my first review, and I know I only covered characters and the main message but I thought these two things were the most important parts to talk about and the two things that shine most brightly in this anime. Of course I really enjoyed the animation, but did you noticed? I was able to say that very quickly and wasn\'t going to write a whole paragraph about it. I enjoyed writing this and putting my thoughts on this show into words, so if anyone reads this and wants to talk about other anime, feel free to add me.Thanks for reading, sorry if my grammar is bad, and hoped you didn\'t feel like you wasted time reading this. their efforts create slightly better results, we are quick to dismiss our own, however it is important to realize your own self worth. Another disclaimer, I don\'t have any experience dissecting films or other related entertainment and use words like ""narrative"" with a basic understanding of the word, these are simply my opinions and what I took away, but I digress. Akihiro Hirata shows us a man who rekindles his passion for a sport which he once dreamed he could pursue further. Kakeru Kurahara shows us the transition of someone who has always been separated from others for his skill learn the enjoyment of accomplishing something with teammates. There are messages to be found with each character and it is a reason I love this anime.The next topic and last topic I want to talk about is the overall message and its importance and correspondence to the story. The overall message I took away from this anime is it\'s the journey that counts. I really like this message and unlike other sports anime where it like ""I WANNA WIN NATIONALS"" it is more about getting to the big stage rather than taking it all. I know, they want to win the big marathon, but they also accept the overwhelming odds facing them and realize committing to training for something like a long-distance running relay is impressive itself, which I really like.This was my first review, and I know I only covered characters and the main message but I thought these two things were the most important parts to talk about and the two things that shine most brightly in this anime.

There's no superpowers or hidden ability from the main characters, no successes by chance that help the team make it through, no expectations or incredible history of Aotake, and no unnecessary characters with an extensively explained backstory.I loved Run with the Wind from a Sports Anime perspective. You can watch and see and hear and feel the pain and effort they take to reach the top. The pained expressions, the ragged breaths, the faces...drenched in sweat; all of it.You have a definitive GOAL that the team chases after - there's no successively introduced title or competition they reach. From the very beginning it's Hakune-or-nothing.You see the impact of sports on the lives of the members because they're REAL PEOPLE, with lives and commitments outside of the sport. You see the characters become conflicted between the choice to run or to quit.You see them gain a following, becoming recognized by the community of their efforts and become rewarded through the support of their fans.But most importantly, you see them make it. You see them train and practice, over and over and over, and one by one you see them succeed. You see them take the grueling steps to begin running and you see them improve, reaching greater heights than before. And each goal is met not because of some ridiculous ability or because the opponents dropped out (see that too often), but because of the HARD WORK and preservation of each and every member of the team.And it is through this combined effort, the persistence and encouragement of one another, that they discover what it means, to run. drenched in sweat; all of it.You have a definitive GOAL that the team chases after - there's no successively introduced title or competition they reach.

I think this is the fastest I’ve ever watched an anime, which is saying something. I don’t know what it was; I even found the beginning to be unrealistic and lackluster.I don’t really care about that now, though, because everything that followed was so compelling. Even when it was rocky, there was just something about it that kept pulling me in, whereas with other shows, they’ve started really strong but they didn’t give me a reason to care...about them. This show rewarded me for staying. The later episodes, wherein the characters’ individual struggles were touched upon, hit really really close to home; they made me reconsider what I value in life and what I’m missing.

As of the moment I\'m writing this, I finished the last episode two minutes ago so this review is 100% raw and fresh and probably overly positive, since those are the only feelings I\'m left with.The first thing I fell in love with in this series was the fluid animation, and, speaking from an artist\'s point of view, the authentic movements and anatomy of the characters. Of course, it is an animation, so I\'m not saying that it would look natural if we...moved the same way, but I was really mesmerized by how natural THEY looked when moving.And then I fell in love with Haiji. And then I fell in love with Shindo. And Yuki. And everybody else followed like dominoes, and before long, I felt incredibly connected to them.Then I just kinda sat here in my chair, cheering for them, enjoying the absolutely stunning music, the sceneries, the animation and the backstories that eventually unfolded.Then there were the last episodes, in which I was smacked in the face and punched in the chest with feels time after time, countless times in every episode. This was where I truly, truly felt these characters\' authenticity and I swear to God I nearly broke my expensive art supplies in two as I anticipatingly watched the episodes tick by. My heart was legitimately hammering in my chest, and I have never felt this kind of excitement toward a show since season 3 of Haikyuu.On a more technical point of view though, there are some specific moments I remember I especially appreciated. For one, in episode 22, the transition from Kakeru looking at the world in a matte/grey tone to the world around him exploding into bright colors, was absolutely beautiful. Gave me chills. And the sound effects used for Haiji\'s knee in episode 23; The creaky, rusty and unpolished sound, really good use of sound effects. Absolutely loved it. It effectively had me physically cringing, something I believe is 100% positive.To summarize:""Run with The Wind"" has everything from loveable and relatable characters, to top tier animation, to a spine-tingling story. If you miss feeling some rough, raw and real feelings toward a show, this is where to go. But don\'t go breaking pencils like I did, because that stuff is expensive. moved the same way, but I was really mesmerized by how natural THEY looked when moving.And then I fell in love with Haiji.

He is obsessed, confused but curious for life and what Haiji has that sparkles so much. On the other hand, you get captivated by Haiji’s hunger for running and his way of seeing people. He genuinely wants to be there with that team mates and more importantly what his own dreams are made of. Also, is interesting how Haiji sees so much potential and inspiration in Kakeru in a realistic way. It was really fun to watch how this both characters grow and change throughout the story.It is lovely...how you get to get attached to the personalities. I personally loved Oji and Masa besides the protagonists. The team has a good dinamic and jokes are all about real deals they are passing as they face running together and individually. The reflection of keep running as keep fighting at life is really interesting.Kaze ga talks about motivation in different levels: when is envolving people, the past and even hope, in a light way. Weirdly, it kinda like a gentle wind.It is slow passed anime, but really worth it to check it out. how you get to get attached to the personalities.

That, and the end-goal of the club members that isn\'t winning the competition (like usual sport anime), instead they just aim to be able to enter competition together, as a whole team. I think it\'s interesting to see if this series will focus more on...the slow developing of friendship or the improvements of the club members trainings.Character: 10/10This is probably one of very FEW anime that I love for its characterization instead of its plot story. As I\'ve said, (in my opinion) the plot isn\'t the strongest point. But its characterization IS.One of the two MCs, Haiji, isn\'t your usual optimistic naive lead character. Though outwardly appear quite optimistic, he still has his doubts, but doing his best to not dwelling on it in order to keep moving forward towards his goal. As you\'ve expected, he\'s quite the persistent character. Not only in his training, but also in getting (and manipulating) every person that he needs in order to make his goal a reality.On the other hand, Kakeru, as the guy with traumatic past here, is quite stubborn and not easily swayed by sweet words from caring friends. BUT what I love most about this character is that he doesn\'t try to run (no pun intended) from his problems, but instead acknowledge it as a bitter experience. He still can\'t forgive his past and he\'s made it known, but despite everything he\'s still doing what he loves because he simply loves it, and doesn\'t try to hide that fact.The other club members has their own interesting personalities. From the manga-obsessed, physically-weak Ouji, that somehow got roped into running, to the nicotine addict, seemingly unmotivated guy, Nico-chan, this series gave its side characters a time to shine on their own and a chance for the viewers to understand the side characters\' point of views. And that, in my opinion, is the most AWESOME part of this series.Art: 6/10Nothing great, nothing bad either. The art-style isn\'t exactly what I preferred, but if you like realistic-looking anime then you\'ll like this one.Sound: 8/10The voice of each character fits their personality. The soundtracks suit the moods. The opening theme\'s good, the ending\'s lovely. Yep. I\'ve got no complaint about the sound.Overall Enjoyment: 8/10I\'m going to give it 8 for now. It\'s an enjoyable ride up until now.

However, the way they captured the characters emotions, their own uniques goals and their reasons for running was very impressive.The animation was also amazing apart from some CG that looked slightly wonky in some places, but the quality remained strong throughout which is what I have come to expect from...I.G.I would 100% recommend this anime to anyone looking for an anime more grounded in reality or looking for something different to what they usually watch.

The music in this show is super inspiring and a lot of the time also really fun. I've listened to this...OST a bunch of times and highly recommend.- Interesting characters.

Please don't judge me...--- Story - 9/10 ---Since i started my journey in this anime and manga world, i have to admit that this is my first running genre anime/manga that i see... It's curious, because an hobby or sport that millions of people like, doesn't have too much works on this industry. So, it's great to...see this type of innovation.

The Ending it's just beautiful, with an simple song and animation, that combines to a super 1:30 min of pure enjoyment. The transition it's simple, and the Opening is beautiful aswell...--- Character - 9/10 ---The reason that i gave a 9 to the character topic is because, at least until Ep.9, some characters haven't yet been developed, as much as Akihiro, Kurahara or Haiji, that we already know their past problems, present issues and future projects. King, the twins and Yukihiro are characters that haven't been much developed, but we already know their present situation, aswell some problems. But, we haven't seen nothing from some characters, like Musa, Takashi or Akane, and that's a problem that i believe will be resolved, soon enough.--- Enjoyment - 10/10 ---In this topic, i will talk about my enjoyment, as a person who runs 4-5 times a week, and just loves this sports, even if i don't compet. As the story develops more and more, we get to know the athletes' issues, such as physical problems, or social problems. We can see aswell they're routine, specially in they're hardest moments, like Akane' issues with his new life, King's problem with getting or not getting a job, and the most recent one, Haiji's health, that looks weak. With all of this topics that the anime shows us, we can get into this new running world, and even enter ''their'' world, getting worried(at least me), with this new Haiji's health problem.--- Overall - 9/10 ---Well, with 3 9/10, and 2 10/10 evaluations, i guess it is fair to give a 9/10 in the overall, but that doesn't meen that is going to be 9/10 until the final episode.

Why did it leave me empty? because I wanted more of it and didn\'t want it to end. If you like all that than you should defiantly watch this anime.Story: 10/10It\'s an amazing story about a bunch of students trying to find their way in life, running and being together helps them find what the future holds and what path they can take. I feel like its a nice coming of age type of story, with strong characters and a range of personalities...of sorts.Plot: 8/10Though I do understand the plot I feel like sometimes it got off track, but I feel like it was trying to be realistic that way. We can\'t always staying on the right path, sometimes we need to go off track and come back to things.Animation: 8/10I find all the Animation in sports anime\'s to be similar, the only parts i tend to get off track is the animation that looks like they got someone to do the sport and that traced over it.Characters: 10/10Each character has their open personalities, likes, dislikes, family, lives and even are going after something in school that doesn\'t really involve running. I never was bored if an episode focused on one character, i just wanted him to succeed!Favorite Character: Kakeru and Heiji for sure, both characters are frustrating sometimes and have faults, but their good heart outshines those bad qualities.Least Favorite Character: Kousuke is face punch worthy, even if Kakeru did what he did, and he was distant. You never see anyone reaching out for Kakeru in his past. Kousuke should be ashamed on how he acts tbh.Music: 8/10I felt like the music did set the mood in scenes, and i really likes the songs for the openings, both were equally good and made me pumped for the episodes. Even the endings were nice, it was very somber to how the openings were but it made me calm if something bad was happen which is good.Favorite Music Piece: The first ending song ""Reset"" It\'s very pretty and it gives me the feels of sad stuff in this anime.Enjoyment: 10/10I really really liked this Anime, I mean the ending was so bitter sweet and there are tons of things left open in the air. I was actually sad to see the characters go! I wanted to see where they were going, what they were doing now, How far in running will Kakeru go? Does Kakeru love running or a person? Who does Hana really like? and tons more. Is this Anime a hidden shonen ai? or is there just a strong bond between characters? So much I want to see, but I\'m unsure if I will see them.It seems like the ending was up in the air, It ended on a good note and kinda with characters already gone and on their own paths, but it also left stuff open for more things to happen.overall: 9/10My conclusion is, this type of sports anime if a good one, even though its about running it was never boring, characters are fun, music in nice, you will cry by the end tho for sure. I did feel as i said at the beginning, that i was empty, but that is because I wanted more and it was sad that the anime ended. It\'s a good anime and you should give it a try.Rewatch Value: 10/10 would rewatch the anime in the future, for the reasons i stated above. of sorts.Plot: 8/10Though I do understand the plot I feel like sometimes it got off track, but I feel like it was trying to be realistic that way.

Every detail, both major and minor, that is introduced is addressed within the show\'s duration, meaning that when we reach the ending, we aren\'t sitting there thinking ""But what about that thing that happened to [character]?"". Each plot point...is neatly wrapped up with enough detail for us to be satisfied, but not so much that we\'re overloaded or even bored with information. The story progression is very character-centric (more on characters later), and the overall mood of the series develops and grows alongside our main character, Kakeru. Early on in the series, while he\'s still tense and warming up to everyone, that tension is transferred to us as viewers, who just want the gang to get along. As Kakeru\'s relationships with both his teammates and himself improve and he opens up, that tension gradually dissipates. That build and release of tension isn\'t just with Kakeru either; each character has their moments, whether it\'s on the race track or back at Aotake. By the time we reach the Ekiden, all that tension is released, and all that\'s left is for them to enjoy the fruits of the hard work we\'ve seen them putting in. Just by reaching the Ekiden, they\'ve already won regardless of finishing position. This freedom allows us to see the conclusion of each character\'s arc during their section of the marathon, and these were by far the best episodes of the show\'s run - we go from seeing the ten of them as one big unit to ten individuals, all running their own paths.ART & SOUNDThe character art was actually what got me to try the first episode of this - as a big Haikyuu fan, the familiar art style is what hooked me in. The character designs are very Haikyuu, but that\'s to be expected since it\'s Production I.G. in charge. The similarity isn\'t a bad thing, though, as the designs are genuinely reflective of each member\'s personality, and those personalities are unique enough that you completely forget about the Haikyuu lookalike thing. The backdrops and scene designs were all very good as well, with some stunning scenery in the ""woodlands training arc"" section. The running animations were all very well done too, but the most outstanding work on this front was the ""Zone"" style running, where we see vivid visualisations of a runner\'s high. Episode 22, which was probably the best of the series, made use of this runner\'s high to great effect and produced some stunning visuals. Other than that, everything was clean without being outstanding, and the facial expressions were very fluid and well animated. There was also a fantastic scene in Episode 4, where Kakeru is reliving tough situations in his recent past, literally running from one scene to another. The cuts and transitions in this scene were smooth, and the mixture of foggy and clear visuals evoked the feeling of being inside Kakeru\'s memories.The OST was good without being outstanding, too - it served its most basic function as a tool for adding emotion in the right places. Openings and endings were also well done, with the second OP/ED combo being the stronger of the two - the second ending theme was probably the strongest piece of music on the soundtrack. Visually and sonically, the show falls into the ""very good"" category, with no noticeable declines in quality.CHARACTERSRun With The Wind\'s strongest point, however, was its main cast. All ten of the main cast were well-developed, distinctive and unique characters that had magnificent chemistry. Each member had their own clear, complete arc through the series, and none of them felt neglected at any point. Whilst Kakeru and Haiji\'s arcs were the core which the plot revolved around, the subplots for each of the other members were given the proper time and space to breathe and develop, and ended up feeling equal in importance to the central arcs. The highlight of the show\'s stunning character work was re-iterated in the Ekiden ""arc"", which has considerably raised the show\'s MyAnimeList rating, where each character gets their moment in the spotlight as they run their section of the marathon. We spend a bit of time with each of them, finding out how running has changed them, and their reason for seeing this Ekiden thing through to the end. Each member wants to do their best for the team, but at the same time, each of them has their own motivations, and their own ""finish line"" that they\'re striving to reach. Whilst they\'re running alone, each and every one of them knows that they couldn\'t have got to where they are without the hard work of the other nine members of the team.But most importantly, each member of our main cast feels ""real"" - like someone that you\'d actually meet at university/college. There\'s nothing outrageous or unrealistic about any of their personalities, struggles or motivations, and that makes them that much easier to relate with. By having a group of identifiable characters, the themes that the story presents through their struggles resonate with us that little bit more. Most of us have been through King\'s struggle of not being able to land a job. Most of us have been in Shindo\'s situation where we try and please everyone, only to lose someone important in the process. And I\'d say that almost all of us have been through Kakeru\'s struggle of regretting something we did in the past to the point that all we want to do is run away.The small supporting cast is also used to good effect, ticking all the sports anime trope boxes excellently. The most notable character of the support group is Fujioka, the captain of the running team that have won the Ekiden three years running and is Haiji\'s old highschool friend. Both incredibly strong and wonderfully eloquent, he provides a benchmark for Kakeru in terms of running standards, but is also somewhat of a mentor for him - his earnest support of Haiji\'s dream catalyses Kakeru\'s change in heart.FINAL THOUGHTSOverall, Run With the Wind is a show that starts off well without being noticeably outstanding, but improves with each episode until it delivers a finale that\'s one of the most gratifying of any anime across any genre - the Ekiden episodes are genuinely masterpiece quality. The show tugs on the emotions at all the right moments, and whilst it doesn\'t over-rely on funny moments, it knows when to use them to good effect - we don\'t have any major emotional moments ruined by an awkward joke (even Your Lie in April got that wrong once or twice and I consider that the ""gold standard"" for ""feelsy"" anime). There\'s a likeable main cast that are easy to get behind and invest in, and the problems they face and their eventual solutions to them are ones that any one of us watching can achieve.It took me a while to decide on the score for this - watching a show almost weekly for 23 episodes means that events in earlier episodes can be forgotten and their quality forgotten. However, re-watching a few of those episodes re-affirmed what I\'d felt at the end of the series, which is that this show is one of the standouts of its genre, and sets itself apart from its more well-known peers. Sure, it uses tropes that we now see as ""generic"", but it executes them that little bit better than the rest. After watching a few early episodes, I watched the last 2 episodes again and those confirmed what score I\'d give it.All in all, I feel that Run With the Wind is a real sleeper hit from its season, and is thoroughly deserving of a 10/10. is neatly wrapped up with enough detail for us to be satisfied, but not so much that we\'re overloaded or even bored with information.

Sports animes like Haikyuu, Overdrive, and etc really get you in the mood. If you want to feel those emotions again, definitely watch this.Story -- 8/10Right, it\'s an alright story. There\'s nothing really that outstanding or special from it but I enjoyed it. However, I do like the fact that it builds up overtime, as in where people don\'t improve dramatically over just one episode.

Art, sound and enjoyment aspects of my rating are not going to change but story and character might depending on how the story develops and on how it concludes (since the source is completed & it\'s a two course...show I do expect that what we are getting is completed story i.e. no s2).I will talk about story & characters last since they are  the variables and are arguably the most important parts;Art 9/10;While I do admittedly have fetish for most of I.G.\'s art styles the art/animation fit the show very well. There is no part of the animation that would seem out of place and there are some seriously gorgeous scenes. The reason it\'s not a ten is the fact that there are anime series/movies that set the bar extremely high. So again and in conclusion, the art fits and does what it needs to while making the show look nice.Sound 10/10;Sound&soundtrack fit the show and there is not a piece of the sound design within the show that I could point out and call bad or/and out of place. Both OP and ED are memorable. The soundtrack is enjoyable even out of context i.e. on it\'s own.Enjoyment 10/10;I sat through 11 episodes without a stop and didn\'t even notice it which is very rare thing for me.Story 8/10 & Characters 9/10 (spoiler free)The character cast is on the outside very nice and fairly diverse. I\'ve noticed that the show has 2 characters marked as ""main"" and rest as ""supporting"" which I\'d have to disagree with, while the show does have two distinctive MCs the entire group of characters should be taken as a main cast. All of the characters have seemingly distinctive personalities, ways and interests which actually do make them feel human what\'s more, they (their personalities and actions) do react to what\'s happening around them all of that together makes it very easy for you to actually sympathize with them & what they go through during the show.There are some weird ""blunders"" when it comes to it but it\'s all within reason. As it is, I am torn between 8 and 9, I can\'t give the cast a 10 because while atm. it\'s all coming nicely together it heavily depends on how they move&change with and throughout the rest of the story since there will be very little time to ""give"" to the individual cast members (that said, it might end up being a 10 ^-^).The story while being surprisingly good is at the moment the weakest part of the show. The setting is extremely fresh which is weird considering it takes place at a college but it does seem to be a rare specimen ^-^. The story itself feels believable which is without a doubt partially thanks to the cast but it\'s overall very realistic It\'s hard to put into words because while the show is more or less ""sports anime"" it\'s not exactly about the sport itself, rather than that it\'s about people living their lives with the sport being a part (bigger and bigger part as the story goes on) of it. As mentioned before, the characters have different interests and while all being college students they are at different points in their lives, the show manages to highlight their differences and how they deal with them, their problems and each other extremely well, there are moments of both happiness and sadness but it all comes as heartwarming. The show also manages to shift  between comedy and drama smoothly which makes the ""process"" feel natural. The story has a rating of 8 mainly because there are some dull moments and the story does focus on some ""uninteresting"" things from time to time which becomes an issue when you have fairly limited amount of episodes while having wide repertoire of themes and moments you could be showing the viewer. The story might end on a 9 but it could also be a 7 or a 6 depending on how it continues and ends, the final arc of the show and it\'s conclusion will be vital for both the story and the character cast.To add little something to the ""sports anime"" thingy I abruptly ended, the anime isn\'t about people coming out of nowhere trying to be the best and whatnot, rather it\'s about people who have their own lives to live and the sport itself is becoming a part of that.To conclude, I would suggest the show to pretty much anyone. It\'s hard to pinpoint how much time you should give the show before deciding to either drop or watch it all (since it\'s a 2 course and thus a fairly large time investment) so watch an episode or two and if you find yourself enjoying it stick with it. While the show needs few episodes to show you what it really has to offer if you find out that you are forcing yourself half-way through the second episode it\'s not very likely that the show is for you. show I do expect that what we are getting is completed story i.e. no s2).I will talk about story & characters last since they are  the variables and are arguably the most important parts;Art 9/10;While I do admittedly have fetish for most of I.G.\'s art styles the art/animation fit the show very well.

That's all I can say about this series.I never thought an Anime could make me cry like a baby like this one did. What a beautiful story! It's my new favorite anime of all time, and it's not even close.So many unique and great characters, and such an emotional story of friendship, team spirit and overcoming everything in the porsuiit of a dream.This anime deserves a lot more love than it gets. Just watch it and get ready for the ninjas cuting onions.Absolutely amazing! Stuning! What else can I say? I had to delay the finale as much as possible because...I didn't want it to end.

And so begins Kaze Ga, I could easily compare this show with Haikyuu !! But I think it would be unfair, after all Kaze has a brilliance of his own, the characters are as diverse in so many ways, but at the same time as the Prince (Ouji) presents sleeves to Kakeru, until that time they were people who form some would get along. Not only do they, but like all the other characters are iconic, it\'s easy to like everyone, even the twins who seemed to be just comic relief manage to bring in questioning and content for the anime....Personally, my favorite character is undoubtedly Haiji, the guy who managed to gather so many different characters and made them run in the marathon with persuasion and light threats. Production I.G did not disappoint in the anime look, it is so beautiful and fluid. Another important point is the development of all the characters, I repeat, from everyone, from quitting smoking, the job you want to follow, an improvement in family relationships to a life goal.

Não só eles, mas como todos os outros personagens são icônicos, é fácil gostar de todos, até o s gêmeos que pareciam ser só alivio cômico conseguem trazer questionamentos e conteúdo para o anime.

In essence, this is simply a show about some amateurs running and somehow ending in a top national competition, it isn't all that special, and not that believable either. However, the feeling the show gives is just special. Running doesn't sound like such an interesting sport, but this show makes you feel as if it's truly a spiritual path, and this is the only anime that has convinced me to actually practice the sport . I hope to one day be able to look...back at this show, and to finally realize the overlying question asked in it: ”what does it mean to run?”That said, the main strongs of this show aren't the sport or hype of it, it's mainly the characters and their wonderful relationship to one another, and the way they had such great realistic character progression. Just like this show convinced me to run, it also made me feel kinda jealous I don't live in such a dorm as theirs, because the way they lived together felt so realistic and true.The characters in this show are a solid 10/10The show itself lies somewhere between an 8 or 9/10, but I'll give it a 9, since it was truly enjoyable. back at this show, and to finally realize the overlying question asked in it: ”what does it mean to run?”That said, the main strongs of this show aren't the sport or hype of it, it's mainly the characters and their wonderful relationship to one another, and the way they had such great realistic character progression.

Being the sports-anime loving fanatic that I am, I was excited for this anime to air because it involved the sport that I have dedicated my life to: running (long-distance running, specifically). I am a long-distance runner who ran cross country, indoor/outdoor track throughout high school and am currently continuing my running career at college. Needless to...say, I love it, and this anime captures the pain, confusion, and desire to run perfectly all together in one place. My relatability to the character’s emotions, thought processes, and competitive spirit was all too real. Not only did the show capture beautifully the mystery behind “why we run”, it succeeds in telling a heart warming, moving story about ten characters, all fighting with their own personal struggles and coming together to run the Hakone Ekiden, finding their own reasons as to why they run in the process.Story 10/10Original and executed with hardly any flaws. The story was unique in comparison to other sports anime I’ve seen. For instance, it takes place at university while a majority of sports anime takes place in highschool. This is interesting in the sense that you get to see characters throughout the anime deal with more serious and relatable life issues (for example, King’s struggle to obtain a job) or characters dealing with the lack of communication they have with their parents. Other than this, the story flowed and never felt awkwardly or oddly paced. The gradual development from a team of characters who mostly have never ran before to running at the highly esteemed Hakone Ekiden was remarkable to watch. I was brought to tears, laughed, felt anger, and every emotion at several different points. This anime takes the concept of running and makes it complex and admirable simultaneously. Memorable and well-written, this is a story that you want to invest in.Art 10/10The character designs are all unique from one another and I feel that the art is really well done. With this, the animation is fluid, I loved watching the characters race, the way every member had their own running form and the different angles they showed made it interesting to watch.Sound 10/10The soundtrack for this anime is lovely. The music emphasizes certain scenes and pokes at your emotions as you watch certain moments. The soundtrack definitely has an impact in heightening every type of scene in the anime you could imagine whether it be intense, sad, anger, excitement, or even humorous.Character 10/10Probably one of if not the highlight of this anime. Every single character is incredibly unique and diverse. Even the twins, who may seem to be indistinguishable, have different desires and wants as revealed later on within the anime. I love how this anime made sure to showcase every character and their backstory. At first, you find yourself questioning why certain characters act in a certain way, but the anime makes sure to reveal the character\'s motivations in a seamless, beautiful way. Every character is likeable and I am able to empathize/sympathize with them. Seeing the character development, especially in the main character, Kakeru, made this anime all the more wonderful. With this, the characters are realistic, and this is especially noted in each of their backstories. Every character had a reason to run, and finding that reason lead to them confront their flaws and insecuritiesEnjoyment 10/10I was always at the edge of my seat by the end of every episode as it aired, wanting more and awaiting for Tuesday to come. I never felt bored or disinterested, the characters and plot line always kept the anime moving and I always found myself craving more. The excitement from watching the characters race and interact with one another brought a great deal of enjoyment to me.Overall 10/10One of if not the best anime I have watched. As mentioned beforehand, being a runner myself really connected me to this anime. I always ask myself the same questions: “why do I run?” “why am I making myself go through this pain when I don’t have to?” As Haji says within the anime “I’m still looking for that answer.” Running has changed my life for so many reasons, and in the anime, running does the same for the characters.

A good sports anime has an exciting plot, lovable characters, twists and turns, and heartwarming themes of ""friendship"" (Jk Jk I\'m sorry) Run with the wind has all of these and more.Most sports anime I have seen take place in high school, thus, giving Run With The Wind (which takes place in college) an added edge. It takes sports into the real world, where jobs, money and cost of living, are obstacles as much as the opposing teams are. Another difference is the variety of characters. Unlike most...sports animes, Run with the wind has characters of varying ages, appearances, and attributes. With the added bonus of an excellent ending theme, an amazing main character (whom I adore), and decent animation, it certainly meets my personal expectations for a good anime.Now, Im not saying this makes Run with the wind the best sports anime ever, but it certainly brings something new and exciting to the genre. I\'m definitely looking forward to seeing what this anime has in store for us. sports animes, Run with the wind has characters of varying ages, appearances, and attributes.

It even me me want to run.Story 10 -- The story was overall pretty predictable, but it was executed so well. The stakes were always clear and I cared about it because the characters cared about it. I think this story finally had an interesting take on the classic sports anime question of nature v nurture or more specifically natural talent v practice. This and Ping Pong are the only shows I can think of that actually engage with that idea in a satisfying and interesting way. The story fulfills all the goals it sets out to at the beginning...and completes them all well. Luckily, this show doesn\'t feel the need to take an episode to solve every single problem it introduces like Yuki\'s home situation and King\'s job hunt. Both of these problems are dealt with to different degrees, but the solution is brief and in King\'s case off-screen, providing time to work with the most important story elements. This is apparently characteristic of Shion Miura who also authored ""The Great Passage,"" but the adaptation is also to be praised for putting the story into this format.Art 8 -- This show lived in its backgrounds. The beautiful vistas really sold the appeal of running every time they showed up. That said, the animation itself was generally excellent considering the monotonous kinds of movements the characters were producing. There were a few moments of awesome character movement which really paid off emotionally and visually like Haiji\'s biking scene at the very beginning of the show. The character designs were awesome and expressive, showing exactly who the characters were before they delivered any lines. I believe that the character designer Takahiro Chiba was influenced quite heavily by his work as animation director on both ""Haikyuu!!"" and ""Welcome to the Ballroom"" which also have great character designs. The only reason this category is losing points is because of some strange animation errors in the last third of the show. I remember in particular Musa going far off model for a good part of Ep. 20.Sound 10 -- The music being excellent should be no surprise considering Yuuki Hayashi\'s previous work, including works like ""Kiznaiver,"" ""Death Parade,"" and the ""My Hero Academia"" franchise. The score did everything it needed to and helped the payoffs hit even harder. The voice acting throughout was excellent. Ootsuka Takeo led the cast as Kakeru and provided an amazing performance which developed with the character in beautiful form. Worth noting is the fact that Ootsuka is nearly brand new to the VA industry and it is not noticeable in the least. Another interesting fact that I never realized while watching is that the seiyuus for Jota and Joji are two people, Enoki Junya and Uemura Yuuto respectively, but I couldn\'t tell them apart.Character 10 -- The characters were the story and since the story was strong, so were they. A good percentage of this show was a character study and each of the cast was fleshed out a great deal and were realistic, grounded people. The whole cast had real motivations that fed directly into their actions and this agreement of ideas really helped both parties. The attention to making characters real came out in spades with Sakaki. He was a very difficult to like character for the entirety of the series, but even though I didn\'t want to see him succeed, I understood why he was the pain the neck he was. Finally, these characters interacted so well. They were thrown into different kinds of situations and every time they related in a way that was true to themselves and was entertaining to watch. I especially loved how the character dynamics changed as the series progressed. The best example of this is Kurahara and Prince\'s relationship. Watching their first interactions v their final episodes is night and day. All that said, Nira is such a good girl and her midcards give me life.Enjoyment 10 -- This show worked for me in every way. All the things it promised at the beginning of the show were delivered and I was always invested in whatever my boys were doing. The show knew how to deliver a payoff and while the journey matters more than the destination, the destination was pretty darn beautiful as well.Overall 10 -- I cannot recommend this show enough. The only reason I would steer you away is if you have a hard time empathizing with animated characters as this show is never about the spectacle, but the people who are part of it. This came from a director(Kazuya Nomura) with few things I like and a script writer(Kohei Kiyasu) who is new to the market, but they pulled together a story that I loved for every second. and completes them all well.

They work harder than all their friends, their rivals, more than they even thought possible. It\'s exhilarating. But sometimes, they lose sight of what they wanted. Sometimes they don\'t even know what it is they are looking for.""Run with the Wind"" is another in a line of anime about a sport that you wouldn\'t think would translate to an interesting, entertaining series. ""This Fall 2018 entry comes from \'Production I.G.\', a studio that has already found great success in this genre with ""Haikyuu!!"" and ""Welcome to the Ballroom"". This time,...they are bringing cross country running to the forefront.""Run with the Wind"" is heavily influenced by it\'s studios predecessors. The characters, the music, the general themes are all similar in concept. The main character is so strikingly similar to one of the main characters of ""Haikyuu!!"", you would think they were the same if you didn\'t know any better. Despite the similarities, this is very much it own series with it\'s own style, and surely stands up next to all of \'Production I.G.\'s wonderful works.The series main focus isn\'t so much on it\'s plot, but on it\'s colorful cast of characters. Their convictions, their comradery, and their individual reasons for wanting to be the best cross country runner they can be are at the forefront of what makes this a worthwhile watch. Each of the 10 main cast have their own unique qualities, as well as their own hurdles to climb. They have their reasons to run, but ultimately they share the same one. Each other. Everybody is trying their best to improve for the sake of the others around them. These characters go above and beyond, and sometimes too far, for each other. It\'s this bond they share that is the driving force of ""Run with the Wind"".The music for the show is also spectacular. Yuki Hayashi does the music for this series, and if you\'re familiar with his other work (Haikyuu!!, My Hero Academia, Death Parade) you already know what to expect. His music is atmospheric and mostly melancholic for ""Run with the Wind"", and it\'s just what the doctor ordered.It\'s a good thing the characters and music is so good, because this series falters ever so slightly otherwise. The animation is good, and the art is pretty to look at, but consistency starts to fall the further into the series you get. Moments that should be more impactful fall short near the end due to the over reliance on still shots. The use of CG becomes more prevalent as well, but luckily it isn\'t too distracting.The story is where the brunt of the issues lie. It\'s by no means incompetent, but its far too cookie cutter. It doesn\'t do anything to shake up the sports genres typical tropes. It\'s predictable, and doesn\'t do anything to break that predictability. It tries to, but any attempt to do so gets glossed over within an episode, never to be addressed again.

Would it be worldbuilding? The overall plot? I believe that it's the characters and how they interact with not only themselves but the world itself. Kaze ga Tsuyoko Fuiteiru is the prime example, the shining image, of true character development.TL;DROverall impression: 8.4I feel like the focus of the show is on the character and character growth more than it is about pushing the narrative of the story. I’d recommend it but I’ve found that several people have problems with certain aspects that I’ll go into detail later.True Review:Story: 7At face value the...story is probably a 5, it gives what its supposed to for a narrative, nothing more nothing less. However, in practice with all the great characters the story feels “better” but still not AMAZING. The story follows a group of University students who, for some reason or another, was suddenly part of a track team. They then train for a really important race that’s coming up and… that’s actually it. The story isn’t complex in the slightest but since all that characters are so different and interactive the story feels like a really long training montage that takes up the entire runtime of the show. Not bad, but people might not like itArt: 9As I said in my other reviews, I’m not an artist, I have almost NO experience with art except for a couple high school and college classes. That being said even though I can’t tell you exactly how hard it is to produce such a masterpiece I can tell you… that well… I think it’s a masterpiece.Every movement: seamless, every character: expressive. Even Prince changed facial expressions more than some of the best anime I’ve seen. Every scene feels a notch above the rest in terms of animation, even in some scenes where an ordinary studio might just animate the mouth and nothing else Production I.D. said: “well screw that! let’s just animate EVERY SINGLE PART of the character!”.Sound: Hmm… 7Top notch intro, but that’s really all that stood out to me unlike Made In Abyss with 100 different sounds, each deserving of some type of award. I had originally planned on giving the sound a 6 since it really didn’t stand out BUT it didn’t ruin the experience, however, it didn’t seem to fair to give it that low of a score.Characters: 10Outstanding, REALLY outstanding. There are few characters out there in anime with the amount of character depth EVERY single character in this show has. While at the time of writing this review I’ve only seen 11 episodes and only a couple of characters have had the pleasure of getting an arc I already feel like I know them. Not a lot of shows, both animated and real, can say that kind of thing.  Even though this is by far the greatest part of the show, I can’t really say enough that’ll do it justice.Enjoyment: 10This really makes my day worth it to be honest. Not much to say but this is one of the most enjoyable series I’ve seen in a while.Overall: 8-9Now here comes the hard part: In my review, it seemed like I’d give this show a 10/10 and I really do believe that it comes close, however in order for a show to get full points I believe it needs a 10/10 in all 5 categories and I don’t believe there is a show like that in existence (apart from Hunter X Hunter of course).I hope you enjoy the show as much as I am right now, The End story is probably a 5, it gives what its supposed to for a narrative, nothing more nothing less. However, in practice with all the great characters the story feels “better” but still not AMAZING. The story follows a group of University students who, for some reason or another, was suddenly part of a track team. They then train for a really important race that’s coming up and… that’s actually it. The story isn’t complex in the slightest but since all that characters are so different and interactive the story feels like a really long training montage that takes up the entire runtime of the show. Not bad, but people might not like itArt: 9As I said in my other reviews, I’m not an artist, I have almost NO experience with art except for a couple high school and college classes. That being said even though I can’t tell you exactly how hard it is to produce such a masterpiece I can tell you… that well… I think it’s a masterpiece.Every movement: seamless, every character: expressive. Even Prince changed facial expressions more than some of the best anime I’ve seen. Every scene feels a notch above the rest in terms of animation, even in some scenes where an ordinary studio might just animate the mouth and nothing else Production I.D. said: “well screw that! let’s just animate EVERY SINGLE PART of the character!”.Sound: Hmm… 7Top notch intro, but that’s really all that stood out to me unlike Made In Abyss with 100 different sounds, each deserving of some type of award. I had originally planned on giving the sound a 6 since it really didn’t stand out BUT it didn’t ruin the experience, however, it didn’t seem to fair to give it that low of a score.Characters: 10Outstanding, REALLY outstanding. There are few characters out there in anime with the amount of character depth EVERY single character in this show has. While at the time of writing this review I’ve only seen 11 episodes and only a couple of characters have had the pleasure of getting an arc I already feel like I know them. Not a lot of shows, both animated and real, can say that kind of thing.  Even though this is by far the greatest part of the show, I can’t really say enough that’ll do it justice.Enjoyment: 10This really makes my day worth it to be honest.

""', '""You can\'t go back in time... Sometimes it makes me sad, but that\'s..."" - Episode 23*STORYI have a pleasant relationship with Kaze ga. It reminds me of coming home from school as a kid and turning on the TV to watch the latest episode of an afternoon cartoon. Only this time, it\'s coming home from work on a Tuesday evening and opening up Crunchyroll to watch a bunch of cute boys running around in jerseys. And this time, you see part of yourself in some of the cute boys as well (even though you\'re actually not a cute boy). I\'m a little sad the series...is over, and my Tuesday evenings will now be a little more empty.What sets Kaze ga apart from anime like Free! and puts it at the same table as Cross Game, is its characters. More specifically, it\'s in the patience and calm surrounding these characters. Yeah you have cute boys doing cute things, but the anime spends less time focusing on the sheer physicality and athleticism required in running, and more time on what the sport of running is all about: striving, earnestly, to improve yourself, little by little. The main story is in the quiet way each character works towards their individual goals despite everyday obstacles.CHARACTERSSpectating a marathon can only get so exciting, so Kaze ga is very much character focused. But the show takes advantage of that; some of the most memorable scenes are of the characters spending time together outside of running, and conversing with each other over topics that have nothing to do with sports to the backdrop of beautiful golden hour scenery. The characters themselves steer clear from sports anime tropes. They\'re all cute boys, but not overly quirky and blatantly written to be fujoshi/fanfic material. They live fulfilling lives outside of running and outside of each other. You quietly support Prince and his manga addiction, and King as he job hunts and gingerly navigates through college life, Nico-senpai as he goes cold turkey, and Haiji in the kitchen as he carefully cooks the most well-balanced meals ever. Much of the show focuses on these scenes of solitude and wholesome as fuck, slice of life tasks.Perhaps the best-written character of all is Musa, an African exchange student who is the kindest and most supportive wingman for all the other characters. He may also be the only character with a truly fleshed out personality, while subverting typical Eastern stereotypes of black/brown folks. The only thing I\'m still iffy about is Kakeru himself, as well his relationship with Haiji. Both fall flat, and Kakeru\'s character development relies too much on cheese. The romanticized nature of the series can be too much at times, but only briefly.SOUNDI have no complaints. Yuuki Hayashi composed the score, so you know it\'s real good, and the score plays such a huge role. It makes up, like, 80% of the emotional weight of each emotionally charged scene. The main theme, ""We Must Go,"" is surprisingly ambient and melodic, sort of like a more orchestral version of ""You Can Become a Hero"" from MHA (and better imo), and he builds on it throughout the entire OST. It\'s soothing, something that encourages self-reflection and such--something I wasn\'t really expecting at all in a sports anime.ENJOYMENTWhen I finished the last season of Kuroko no Basuke, I teared up because I\'d binged all the episodes in the span of 2 weeks and therefore felt emotionally attached in some way. I\'d spent literally, like, 100+ continuous hours with them (it was winter break of college, so like), so I teared up out of happiness for them as a team and their achievements, and nothing else. The characters of Kaze ga strike more of a chord. At the end, you realize you\'re not only leaving behind the world of Kansei and the Hakone Ekiden, but also a group of characters who can exist outside of the sport that they are a part of. So...you know, it\'s almost like you\'re saying goodbye to a friend.OVERALLStory: 7/10Art: 8/10Sound: 8/10Character: 7/10Enjoyment: 8/10Overall: 8/10*My fave quote from the anime, and also super relatable.

As well, as many kinds of sports animes exist. But because the most sports animes are shounen (and released in Weekly Shounen Jump), and those were created for 10-14 year old boys, most of them are far from reality, and those animes close out the older anime fans, who prefer not only the reality but which are free from typical japanese samples.So, to find a realistic sports anime is hard, but those few mean much. And I dare to write: Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru is the king...of the real sports animes.The characters are not high school students, but university students, which also gives the base to this anime to be serious. Kurahara Kakeru was a runner in his high school years, but he finished it because of certain happenings. At the beginning of the anime, he steals a sandwich from a glocery store, and Kiyose Haiji saw him running. When he caught him up, Haiji made Kakeru to return the sandwich to the store, and apologize. After it, he asked Kakeru, that he likes running. Because he ran quite fast, Haiji wanted Kakeru to join to his running group to enter the Hakone Ekiden. Only 10-member group can enter to that running contest, and with Kakeru the group would have 10 members. Haiji made Kakeru to enter to the group, and they 10 together prepared and practiced much to give their best in the contest.And this is main different: They give their best, and not to win at any cost. It also refers the character's age they think more serious, because they see the things of life as it is, and in this reality they do their best. Every of group members have different personality, and sometimes it's hard for them to work as a group or practice, because most of them have their own life, not running is their biggest hobby. Sometimes, they have enough of it, and ask what is this all for, but later they find each other, and practice even harder.The animation is beautiful. If you liked the animation of Haikyuu!! or Ballroom he Youkoso, well, I'm pretty sure that, you will be fascinated of the animation of the Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru. The characters are well-drawn, the background and surrounding is detailed, the colors are realistic. And the music... I think, it's enough to say, Hayashi Yuuki's name, his name is guarantee for the quality original soundtrack, because he proved with Haikyuu!! and Boku no Hero Academia, that he's a great composer. He wrote funny, happy, even dance songs to this anime as well as sorrowful, depressing soundtracks. He felt the guys' adult-like personality. Sometimes they feel the pressure of the weight of life, despite they can laugh, feel themselves well, and do their best in running. Hayashi Yuuki sensed the harmony of this dual personality, and he wrote not only great music for this anime, but the songs harmonize to each other. I listen to the OST very much.This is really one of the greatest sports anime. And if Haikyuu!! is the king of the high school sampled animes (in good way), then Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru is the king of the realistic animes. Highly recommended to very anime fans. of the real sports animes.The characters are not high school students, but university students, which also gives the base to this anime to be serious.

I\'m a runner myself so I\'m probably more biased than other reviewers in myThis anime\'s primary strength is managing to balance the solitary aspects of running by using the Hakone Ekiden to justify the formation of a team. Yet, within that team, are 10 distinct and developed characters that feel real and genuine. While most of the focus is on running prodigy Kakeru and master-of-psychology Haiji, every member of the running team is given sufficient screentime to explore their motivations and what drives them all to do something as crazy as running the Hakone Ekiden.Along the...journey, the show explores such questions as ""What is running as a sport?"", ""Do runners compete for themselves or for the prize?"", ""Should sports be limited to only the elite?"" and ""Why the hell do runners do this to themselves?"" It never answers them fully, but it does provide possible answers that gave me something to ponder.This show\'s other major strength is in creating dramatic tension. By investing me in the characters, it made me care about their journey. The small human-scale stakes of whether or not the running team will get anywhere are more understandable than world-shaking fantasy battles where civilization itself is on the line. I found myself white-knuckled in more than one episode wondering if a quirk of fate or just being out-classed was going to end this team\'s dreams forever.Overall this is a great anime for anyone who\'s ever had a dumb idea that someone told you was impossible or for any runner questioning why the hell they put themselves through training when they could be taking a nap. journey, the show explores such questions as ""What is running as a sport?"", ""Do runners compete for themselves or for the prize?"", ""Should sports be limited to only the elite?"" and ""Why the hell do runners do this to themselves?""

It’s then questioned without being challenged, which I like while at the same time disliking, but with time and more episodes, I guess I love how it becomes just them trying to figure out what running means to every one of them, and it’s mostly very well done with each chara, and I love the endingI more or less enjoyed every character (some exceptions) but especially Kakeru as a character and his evolution, it really is done with time and sensitivity without forcing things (except at the beginning).Even tho the first cour bothered me a lot with its BS, it is a really good and beautiful story, most of the chara grow from it and feel shit. Also like the open ending with no real answers to the themes about sports/competition asked (because there is ultimately none) kinda forgotten and they decide to do it just “because”.

Also like the open ending with no real answers to the themes about sports/competition asked (because there is ultimately none)', ""Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru is a strange and lovely creature, always moving elegantly forward, never missing a step or faltering in its pace. Its best attribute is its maturity compared to the shonen screaming of most other sports anime, but I feel like that also takes from it a certain energy or je ne sais quois (compared to, for example, Prod. IG's own Haikyuu), which is maybe its only real flaw.KazeTsuyo starts with one of the best first episodes I've seen, unafraid to play around with nonlinear narrative and doing so effectively, but the rest of the series refuses to take risks in terms of...narrative and cliche. KazeTsuyo sucks at creating tension from competition itself, but really isn't trying to do so -- long-distance running, of course, is not the most exciting of sports, a fact that probably turned many fans away from the series. But what KazeTsuyo understands better than most sports anime is that drama and emotion need to be inculcated during the non-sport moments to make the competitions meaningful, that the context and milieu of the team's races is the best tool in a sports anime's arsenal and not, as so many other series have opted for, weaponized backstories delivered just before the finish line. This lets races be mercifully short -- an episode long at most. The actual backbone of the series is fairly cliche: underdog sports team blah blah blah training hard blah blah rival blah success. If you want an original story, look elsewhere; sports isn't really where you'll ever find that anyway. But KazeTsuyo does atypical things within that typical story, and that is where its strength lies.The real surprise was the animation quality. Production IG have always been capable of great things visually, but are inconsistent at times. I've always felt that too few of their titles actually get the TLC they need and end up looking fairly samey as a result. Not so with this one. Among anime that aren't going for distinctive styles or art direction (and weren't made by KyoAni), Kazetsuyo is among prettiest ever made. This is especially apparent in the forest in eps 12 & 13 and with the qualifier in ep 16; you have to see this stuff to believe it. Sound quality is good but the music is outstanding. Each track balances well with the scene it serves, and if any song repeated during the entire series, I didn't notice it.Character is extremely important in sports anime, and KazeTsuyo realizes this, giving us ten-plus characters, each with a fair quantity of depth and with none (save perhaps the twins) falling into cliche territory. Haiji is one of the most deeply original and intriguing characters in recent memory; I can't think of another character in any anime that I watched as intently as I watched him whenever he was on screen. Toyonaga Toshiyuki did an amazing job bringing this character such a unique blend of vigor, mischief, and general hardassery. Our protag Kakeru starts out generically angsty (a la Haru or Kageyama), but the gradual revelation of his backstory slowly builds him into something significantly better. His flashback in episode 13 is the most shockingly good moment in the entire series -- masterfully handled, with audiovisual static and color that fades as it progresses, only to shock back to reality at the pivotal moment.KazeTsuyo is a series a lot of people slept on these past two seasons, and to their detriment. It lies on the border between very good anime and art, and fully deserves its current spot on MAL as one of the best sports anime in recent memory. In fact, it's somewhat restored my faith in the genre itself, after several years of forgettable series since the debut of Haikyuu and YowaPeda. If you're even tangentially interested in sports, or just want a good character-driven story, give this one a chance -- it's a series that will give you a run for your money. narrative and cliche.

Our protag Kakeru starts out generically angsty (a la Haru or Kageyama), but the gradual revelation of his backstory slowly builds him into something significantly better. His flashback in episode 13 is the most shockingly good moment in the entire series -- masterfully handled, with audiovisual static and color that fades as it progresses, only to shock back to reality at the pivotal moment.KazeTsuyo is a series a lot of people slept on these past two seasons, and to their detriment. It lies on the border between very good anime and art, and fully deserves its current spot on MAL as one of the best sports anime in recent memory. In fact, it's somewhat restored my faith in the genre itself, after several years of forgettable series since the debut of Haikyuu and YowaPeda. If you're even tangentially interested in sports, or just want a good character-driven story, give this one a chance -- it's a series that will give you a run for your money."", ""I got a recommendation from a friend of mine to try it out.

It stands out among the other sport anime that I have watched due to its realistic and emotional take on running.Warning: There are mild spoilers below.Story:This series peaked my interests as during high school, I also did cross country and the reviews that I had read stated that it was realistic and emotional. Cross country or competitive running is a sport that is simultaneously an individualistic and team-like sport. Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru tells a story with a basic premises: a group of 10 individuals forming a...team to try achieve a near-impossible goal of running in the Hakone Ekiden - an elite running competition in a relay-like format for college students. Why is it seemingly impossible? Well, that's because, only 1 out of the 10 aforementioned individuals actually want to run in the Hakone and only 2 out of the 10 individuals have prior running experience. The other 8 are amateurs to running.While Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru has a simple premises, the execution is magnificent. It accurately explores the world of running by tackling running through the question of what it means to run. Every single one of these 10 individuals have a different reason from running the Hakone, ranging from running for manga heroes to searching for the answer of running competitively. Through the simple question of what it means to run, all 10 characters are thoroughly explored and are given depth.However, like any other team that is trying to achieve a near impossible task, sacrifices must be made. The anime not only focuses on the sport of competitive running, but also explores real-life problems the team faces by training for the Hakone. A lot of time is needed to train and with that, there are less time for the time to do other things. The team must put training for the Hakone as priority if they want to qualify for it.Although the anime mainly explores the team, there are many other factors such as support (both during the race and during training) are also thoroughly explored. Topics such as injury recovery and overwork are also explored.Characters:Each of the 10 individuals mentioned have a chance to 'star' within the show. However, the main character is Kurahara Kakeru - a first year college year student who is recruited by Kiyose Haije, when Haije sees him run past him with a stolen piece of bread from a convenience store. He turns out to be an elite runner. He at first, refuses to run with a group of people, due to some issues with his past. Throughout the anime, he changes from a person obsessed with cutting down on his time when running to caring more about his teammates and even, putting his teammates first.Haije is a fourth year college student who is desperate to run the Hakone Ekiden. He is the team's captain and is initially, the only person who wants to run in the Hakone. He then proceeds to persuade all 9 of his teammates to run with him.There are other notable characters but for the sake of spoilers, I will not be talking about them here.Art;The art is solid and it is beautiful.

It mainly follows the boys as they train and improve to hopefully make it into the race.

So do yourself a favor and watch Run with the Wind""Hey, do you like running?""', ""this anime primarily deals with how peoples' perspective of running affects their motivation to do it, to achieve some tangible result.the anime is 4d in that how the viewer sees running will affect their view of the people running. If you are a competitive runner, perhaps the initial phases will piss you off because everyone sucks at running and are seemingly weak-willed and unambitious. If you hate running because of the feeling of your body getting winded, then the sudden transformation of the cast may seem unrealistic, shallow and dumb.Personally, I have a neutral stance and am not very competitive but have run a marathon...in a mediocre time of 3:56 so I know how peer pressure can affect one's lifestyle in training like a madman since you don't want to embarrass yourself. Though, I recognize that it is a superficial reason and a more solid one is exercise. And, there are even resume reasons.My perspective is mostly one of an existentialist in that I don't have a solid desire to gain anything as I understand l will one day lose it. I'm loss averse like Haruhiro from Grimgar. Otherwise, I run for exercise to maintain appearances and am a hardcore introvert who runs at night or inside.I think that my journey of training and fear of running is embodied by all the characters. We have the just do it twins, the too busy king, the hedonistic Yuki, there's the cynical kakeru, plus the addicted haiji. Theres also the genetic loser programmer. So many reasons stop us from running and maybe running with the wind means to let your desire flow if you truly like running over the alternative.Beyond the analysis, the production quality is high. The pacing, storyboarding, and music are incredible.

Run with the Wind focuses on a university relay marathon team with 10 members who will only get to run together for a year. More importantly, since most members are only amateurs, what is the point of running if becoming the champion of Hakone Ekiden seems unreachable? This anime is relatable for many people (especially those who are graduating from university) because it touches on various kinds of struggle...and question that we face in our everyday lives. Although it doesn't specifically give the audience an answer, it offers both hope and encouragement. Another major reason why I like this anime is that it makes each character the protagonist - everyone is essentially irreplaceable. I really enjoyed watching how each member keeps influencing and inspiring one another. In addition, I personally find the art very nice. Many scenes and messages are delivered in a subtly beautiful manner. Last but not least, it is impossible to ignore Yuki Hayashi's wonderful OST as it really helps convey the message.In fact, I would like to give Run with the Wind 100 out of 10. and question that we face in our everyday lives.

Believe me, however, when I say that despite my skepticism I was pleasantly surprised by what Run with the Wind had to offer, which is an interesting change of pace after the mind-numbing and uninteresting run-ins I\'ve had with the sports genre.The story centers around a first year college student with a prominent track & field background, Kakeru...Kurahara, who happens upon the enthusiastic and reliable Haiji Kiyose after being caught stealing a loaf of bread and chased down the street by a local shopkeeper. Haiji, impressed by his ability, offers him a place in Chikusei-sou, the dormitory of Kansei University\'s track & field club along with eight other university students. Haiji later reveals his plans of having the cast compete in an annual track event: the Hakone Ekiden; an annual relay race spanning from the edge of Tokyo to the town of Hakone. The plot is then centered around the Kansei University track team\'s advance towards their goal of participating in the race, and the endeavors and challenges they overcome along the way.The visual quality of Run with the Wind proved particularly volatile throughout the viewing experience. The colorful and vibrant backgrounds compounded with the detailed scenery and impeccable artwork, while proving particularly conspicuous, were inhibited somewhat by the poorly executed CGI vehicles and characters. In spite of this, the visuals of this anime proved memorable, and made for a fairly pleasant viewing experience.The strong point of this anime, however, are its characters. Despite the cast consisting of a good ten members, the writer successfully balances prominence and narrative impact. No character is left behind or underrepresented, while no character seems to take the spotlight at a frequency that proves repetitive or detrimental to the rest of the cast. The characterization, in addition, was splendidly done. The entirety of the cast had distinct and distinguishable character traits and temperaments, and for the most part, a degree of depth of character and development: ranging from Kurahara\'s acceptance and overcoming of his tragic past and developing team spirit, to Prince\'s physical and mental growth. Additionally, while the temperament and specious one-dimensionality of the twins caused me to raise an eyebrow at first, the pair themselves were shown to be more than gag characters, presenting issues of motivation and skepticism towards the end of the narrative. Overall the character writing was well done, although if I were to criticize any aspect of it, it would have to be the characterization of Kamara Musa, the Tanzanian transfer student. Musa is introduced as a kindhearted, calm, and intelligent young man, but that\'s effectively all he is throughout the course of the narrative. Although his issues regarding discrimination are explored, I feel that he himself was never actually developed character-wise, or explored to the extent he could have been. That being said, Musa still proved a prominent member of the cast, aiding in the development of the protagonist and serving as a keystone for some thought-provoking interactions.Despite my hyperbolic praise, there was an issue that I as (formerly) something of an sportsman had with Run with the Wind: It is ostentatious. It fails - as honestly, most anime do - to realistically portray some aspects and dilemmas presented by the lifestyle of an athlete. One of Kakeru\'s points has stuck with me since the first episode: ""How are we, in a mere eleven months, supposed to match the aptitude of athletes who have spent their lives honing their skills and working towards the Hakone Ekiden?""Despite playing the devil\'s advocate, Kakeru is right. Haiji\'s expectation was not only naive and idealistic from the start, but physically impossible in every sense of the phrase. When I ran my first 5-kilometer run, I did so in 26 minutes. It took me months of constant training to break the 20 minute barrier, and from that point onwards the skill curve only steepens exponentially. These athletes on the other hand, were expected to, and did successfully achieve sub-16 minute 5k times in under 11 months of training, despite most of them having no running background whatsoever. In reality, achieving what they did takes years upon years of practice with effectively no exception. There were some minor issues in regards to realism in addition to this, such as the inability of both the coach and anime to realise the physiological detriment of overwork (keeping in mind that absolute beginners were running five kilometers daily with no adverse effects whatsoever) and the lack of emphasis on the importance of diet (training for long distance race, but drinking beer and eating snacks on occasion?). As much as this lack of realism irks me as a sportsman, I can accept that Run with the Wind still manages to effectively deliver its messages in the form of a very solid narrative with well written characters. It was an absolutely enjoyable watch and is in my opinion, nearly on par with the first season of Haikyuu, another one of production I.G\'s works.Final Judgement: 8/10 Kurahara, who happens upon the enthusiastic and reliable Haiji Kiyose after being caught stealing a loaf of bread and chased down the street by a local shopkeeper.

I'm someone who doesn't enjoy running. By watching this anime I've opened my mind by understanding how people can love it.It starts off slow paste, and takes a while before we get to see any competition. A lot of scenes are light hearted, nothing emotionally draining, which is partly why I continued watching it.I ended up really appreciating the anime for it's lightness and it's depth of meaning. Later on, it got really good. When they run, we get to hear their internal dialogue as they...talk about what running means to them, why they do it in the first place.

Since the classics, recent ones have been dry, cliche and overly dramatic, with little sense of realism. However, Kaze ga Tsuyoku surpasses all my expectations and then some.To start, the score is an absolute marvel. Waking up at dawn, embracing pain, expressing light-heartedness and joy as well as hope and achievement. It brings all that to the table at such appropriate moments that you can't help but want more. The openings are optimistic and teases the team reaching their goal -- running at the...Hakone while both endings are bittersweet and hints at the beginning of something new while ending something wonderful.And the plot, oh man. The pacing is just right, there are tense moments (also assisted by the amazing score by Yuki Hayashi) and next comes the release of that tension. The crests and falls are so well built-up, giving you just enough levity to breathe and think through the actions while leaving you wanting to know more. Any drama that happens in the show is planned for and well-executed and it shows in the payoff. Motivations of the characters are evidently carefully thought through and nothing is half-assed. As human beings, you'd find yourself empathising with all, if not most, of the characters' plights, having been there at some point. Each action and even each phrase said by the characters fit their personalities and represent who they are. We don't get abrupt actions that make no sense. Character development is truly logical and realistic, and growing with the characters feel like a reward of its own. Seeing them change through this common goal and ambition is something I can fully connect with, having been a part of an event like this myself. It is life-changing, it is painful, it is hopeful and it is always bittersweet.The realism of the show is one more thing to watch for. Having done some research on the event -- the Tokyo-Hakone Ekiden Race, it's safe to say the producers have also done their own in-depth research and stuck closely to real life and what can actually happen.Production of the show is swell. Unlike many many other animes that assume watchers cannot think for themselves, Kaze ga Tsuyoku leaves you to connect the dots, fit the pieces together and follow the story through. Ultimately, when they do reveal any conclusions, it feels good to have proof that your theories are right and see them come into fruition on screen. And the execution is illustrious. From subtle details such as the creaking sounds that signal the destruction of Haiji's knee to larger scaled panels that display Tokyo's beautiful landscape and all 10 characters gathered together, there is no wasted scene, no wasted moment. Some animes have filler episodes that leave a bad taste in my mouth, but this one doesn't. Truly, take note of each scene, the details will blow your mind.Finally, please don't look at it as just another sports anime that came out in recent years (and there has been quite a few). The life lessons that are embedded in this show far outweigh the short and sweet episodes that it brings. My only regret is that I want to see more of this universe, if ever possible. I'm not someone who usually writes reviews for shows or animes (this is my first actually). But I couldn't help wanting, needing, to express my feelings about this beautiful, emotional marvel of an anime that truly makes me question what it means to love, live and fight for something I believe in.

As a runner it felt so incredibly relatable despite some of the unrealistic aspects which imo are pretty easy to overlook since it is an anime. I loved getting to know each of the characters and they all have their own standout moment which really highlights the diversity of the characters. Additionally, I love seeing a complex relationship between guys and I felt like Kakeru and Haiji had that. As someone who had a similar bond with my running partner throughout school, I felt so connected and invested. The way that they illustrate the runner's high is also really amazing....Additionally, the way that some of the characters are drawn is quite entrancing. For example, Haiji's eyes really convey a range of emotions whereas Fujioka has a strong, but calm face that reflects his demeanor. Even if you aren't a runner, I think the story is still really compelling. Overall, it was completely enjoyable and I never felt like it slowed down or that I wanted to pause which I tend to feel for a lot of shows. The openings are all great and the tracks are uplifting at the right times. The ending is a little short/abrupt, but besides that I wholeheartedly recommend checking out this show.

The character development and their backstory are really good. I also enjoyed how well-drawn the scenery in the anime. The humor in this anime is light-hearted which I loved. Osts and soundtrack were also great. There were some scenes of the characters interacting which makes you want to ship them together. For example Haiji and Kakeru and Shindo and Musa. Some scenes made me tear up. The ending made me happy and sad. Well sad bc its the end! And happy bc the ending was very well done and you see the characters grown and yea! 10/10 ', '“Hey, do you like running?”What constitutes a masterpiece? What makes an anime worthwhile? You can have an amazing soundtrack and immaculate artwork but what’s the point of watching if there isn’t a compelling storyline? Run with the Wind surpassed all my expectations and had me completely enthralled until the very last frame. All I wanted was an anime about running. Nothing more nothing less. Since discovering sports anime, I wanted to watch one that depicted my favourite sport—track and field. What brought me here was a frivolous desire and infatuation with the work of Haikyuu, what kept me here was the incredibly relatable characters and...a story that truly moves you. Never in a million years did I expect to get emotionally invested. After all, it was a sports anime, right? It was just supposed to be something fun, something to spark my interest. Winners, losers, struggle, hard work, the end. However, what I take away from this anime is so much more than a memorable story. It’s the drive to make the impossible possible. It’s acknowledging your limits and shortcomings and deciding if when faced with a challenge you will face it head on or run away. It demonstrates the impact a single person can have. How one encounter—one person can change the entire way you perceive life.At first glance, one would think the members of the Kansei track and field team were chosen haphazardly. There were very evident differences in physique, interest, commitment, and motivation. The idea to run in the Hakone Ekiden competition is introduced so casually I immediately emulated the characters in thinking, this is a joke…right? When the idea is proposed, by none other than Haiji, that these housemates who came together by nothing more than chance would take on the daunting task of not only qualifying but competing in the Hakone Ekiden I was visibly shocked. I almost stopped watching because of how unbelievable it was but I am so thankful I didn’t.I can’t begin to conceptualize how to describe the characters. Safe for one exception, they are simply regular university students trying to navigate life, pursue their interests in their spare time, and overcome vices. Some vices certainly stand out more than others, but they’re so intelligently integrated into the storyline that you can’t help but watch in awe. Even a typical virtue such as perseverance is flipped on in its head when a character is determined to a fault.There’s nothing more heart wrenching than a lost dream and feeling powerless. What do you do when the feelings of regret, anxiety, and doubt become overwhelming? Do you pick up a pack of cigarettes? Do you quit without trying? Do you distance yourself from the situation altogether? What I found really powerful was that all the emotions I felt, the uncertainty, the skepticism, the elation—they were all portrayed in the characters’ reactions. The story keeps you guessing until the very end with unexpected twists, turns and setbacks. Not even the characters know what to expect, yet they decide to keep trudging forward.Run with the Wind is a testament to the audacity of dreams. Just because something feels out of your reach doesn’t mean you shouldn’t pursue it at all. It’s a reminder to find hope and joy even in a bad situation. Sometimes you have to push yourself past your breaking point to rediscover why you started in the first place.Run with the Wind is a story about second chances, what it means to dream, the power of friendship and the beauty of competition.

I highly, highly recommend.', 'Run with the Wind was such an inspiring anime. Thanks to it I started running and now my legs are doubled in size and i got 30kgs of muscles. I also gained a fondness for seeing college aged men in the shower but there is no gain without sacrifice.We start with our main protagonist running on the street when some weirdo on a bike stalks him and asks him if he loves to run. Now as someone who hates strangers this was a huge red flag. then when he brought him back to his college dorm, and gave him a place to stay along side...8 other guys and 1 old man, i started to grow even more sus. then they started showing me some of the the men naked in the shower. Now at this point my yaoi siren was blaring at full volume. however, i was assured by my friend who watched this with me that this was 100% not yaoi. And against all odds it turned out she was right. This is an inspiring show about the joy of endurance running. as someone who runs with the wind every single day, i could relate to so many events that happened in the show. The characters are all interesting and all come with their own realistic and interesting set of circumstances. watching them grow as a team and as people is the heart of the show. alll in all i think this anime is preeeetty gooood. 8 other guys and 1 old man, i started to grow even more sus. then they started showing me some of the the men naked in the shower.

Everytime you ask someone about their top 5 sports anime you usually get the same shows in different orders: Slam Dunk, Haikyuu, Hajime no Ippo, Kuroko no Basketball and Ping Pong the animation or something like Megalo Box or Yuri on ice. You never hear about KgTF and i still wonder why. Its really under the radar...and that really is a shame.STORY:In sports anime, you can usually only tell 2 stories: about a fallen prodigy getting to their peak or about how a team of newcomers takes everyone by storm and becomes one of the best. KgTF throws all this out the window and tries something different. A story about a group of people, who have either never ran track or did but were bad at it trying to get to one of the biggest races in japan(Kakeru is the exception). It is told beautifully and the characters are really well built, even if there are a lot of them and also i like how almost everyone acts like a real human being and actually have other worries in their life, more important than runninig. The bad parts are the sometimes unrealistic things happening and the absence of a true antagonist(more on this at characters).9/10ART:The art is amazing, beautiful, sometimes full of color, and sometimes shaded and almost depressing, it uses this perfectly to convey what the characters are feeling. Also the filming angles are really great and unique. All this and you might think the art is a 10. NO, not  at all because some dumb guy from Production I.G. decided it would be amazing and a good idea to make some of the characters in the running scenes( You know, the most important parts) S.G.I. It looks awful and it really draws your attention from what is happening. SGI crowds can suck my dick tbh. Atleast the intermissions are a 10/10 but its Production I.G.\'s so of course they are.7/10SOUND:The first OP is decent at best but the second one is really good, also the music is perfect for a running anime, and its also used perfectly when it should be used. The voice acting is good, nothing too special, maybe Toyonoga Toshiyuki deserves a shout since he played Haiji very well. Also i think every character was cast really well.8/10CHARACTER:This is the best part of KgTF, the characters. I dont know how they managed to make this many characters be original and funny, but also have another side to them that not a lot of people dont know, its amazing. Most of them are relatable, in the sense that at the start they really dont like the situation they are in, being practically forced to run. A lot of anime would have just said: ""Okay they have to run now, so they like running now.""  but this show doesn\'t do that, instead they show characters that really oppose the idea do  something about it (King and Yukihiko are good examples of this). My favorite character is Hirata. I feel like he is somehow way more different than the other guys and actually gave up a lot of things for running, and was one of the guys who actually tried their hardest. One of the worst parts about the characters is the missing of an antagonist( Fujioka is too nice to be one and the red haired guy just sucks at running) which really hurts it on the next category and also i think Kakeru doesn\'t really fit with everyone else, I would have rather have another guy who had a hidden talent foe running tbh.ENJOYMENT:This is something this anime lacks. The truth is, sadly, running is fucking boring. It just doesn\'t have the same amount of hype and crazy moments as any other sport. Yes, seeing Kakeru run with some really cool special effects is nice but it just doesn\'t cut it for me. Also the missing of an antagonist really hurts it, at one point i was asking myself, the question they were asking themselves. Just why are they running?7/10Ending statement:Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru is an anime that does something original and does it really well, i recommend you watch this but dont go into it expecting your run of the mill sports anime. Really underated series it deserves more attention.OVERALL: 8/10 and that really is a shame.STORY:In sports anime, you can usually only tell 2 stories: about a fallen prodigy getting to their peak or about how a team of newcomers takes everyone by storm and becomes one of the best.

No one recommended me this anime. I just was like hmm looks like a nice vibe so I’ll watch it. I am so happy for making that decision. The calming and feel good music, the realism, the character development, story, animation and colours, and the like are unmatched. Every episode left me with emotions and satisfaction.The characters are just amazing. Everyone of the 10 had amazing stories. I was able to connect with each one of...them. (Except joji and jota, they are sharing the same brain cell). When shindo ran the ekidan with a fever I was disappointed that I couldn’t see him run but I was able to see his titanium soul. Prince is my fav otaku Every character’s story is what we’re going as individuals in real life. I don’t think A anime will replace this one for a long time. This officially breaks my top 10 anime spot. I’m gonna miss these guys! Loved everyone.What did you all think of this? Also, who do you think Hana liked? Do you like running? Repeat after me.

Oh and this review won't contain much spoilers.I always thought this anime was a slowly paced  boring show. The characters didn't look compelling and it was about the least interesting sport for me, running. But I am glad I checked out this anime. Probably one of the most motivating anime for me. So let's talk about the actual show!Story: 9/10It's a sports anime so you won't get any great story but this...is probably the best one for me in the entire genre. The first 3 episodes are the best first episodes of any sports anime for me and you should definitely check them out and decide if you want to continue or not.Art style/Animation: 8/10I don't really care about animation much and this series doesn't depend upon it's animation for anything but it's good enough. That's all I will say as I don't care about animation but it can be really good to look at sometimes.Music: 10/10The music in this series is fantastic! And I also don't care much about music but if it even stands out to me in the show then it's automatically amazing.Characters: 9/10The characters are simply amazing. All characters are enjoyable and likable. They are probably the most important part of the show. Seeing all the 10 characters develop and face themselves through running is amazing. Running isn't particularly fun for 8 of the characters in the show. They were forced at first but just running with their friends made them realize something valuable in their life so they couldn't possibly give up on it even though it hurts to run. The only problem here is that the show is little short.Enjoyment: 9/10As I said, this anime is one of the most motivating anime out their. I hadn't enjoyed something as much as this one in months. So, if you like something like Haikyuu then this anime is definitely for you. Even if you don't care about sports you should check this anime out just for the splendid characters.Thanks for reading! is probably the best one for me in the entire genre.

Very worth watching.Planned to watch this bit by bit but couldn't help but watch episodes after episodes and ended up finishing it in 3 days. Production I.G. has been releasing some very high quality Shounen anime and this is one of them. The story was very eye-catching and captivating with the music fitting the scenes very well. There's no overly repeated scenes, which made the whole show very smooth and not boring for a single bit.As for the story, there was character development for every single character and there is a clear difference between all of them.

I cannot complaint about anything. This has to be the most ""PERRFECT"" anime I have watched till date. I have watched AOT, Death Note, Kimi No Nawa but none was as perfect as this one. Sounds were terrific and spot on. Characters were absolutely perfect. The art was beautiful. The story on which the anime was built was very simple and basic but it completely delivers the message that it wants to its viewers. The drive to never give up in life and continue working and working no matter how many times you fall, the importance of...friends in life, how as a team you can achieve victory were the important messages delivered. The anime in itself was also attractive because a normal person can easily relate with the problems that he/she faces when determined to achieve their goals. Though it is a simple slice of life, sports genre anime, everything the anime delivers is completely PERFECT. Some people might not appreciate the story but for me story was 90/100. If you are bored watching anime of common genres, this definitely is going to refresh you as it is realistic and a very simple anime. friends in life, how as a team you can achieve victory were the important messages delivered.

I can't find anything interesting about it at all. There are a lot of characters in the running team, but all of them are bland as far as I can see. The captain of the team is somehow funny and there are some good comedy scenes in there, the only reason I don't rate this show any lower. I dropped it after 6 episodes; I would have liked to complete it and see if it gets better later on, but I just can't, it just feels like a complete time waste.So yeah, that's...about it. Can't find anything praise worthy or anything to criticize, so I rate it a 5. Watch it only if you like slice of life kind of shows that have a relaxing atmosphere. about it.

We get an overall hilarious and emotional taste from this anime. The anime's outro song was the aspect that I found particularly appealing. It features two distinct outros: one from 1 to 11 and another from 12 to 23. The first one, which runs from 1 to 11, is the greatest; I listened to it through without pausing. That tune, which will remind me of this anime, is also something I added to Spotify. It's essentially a sports anime, comparable to Haikyuu and Blue Lock. I will recommend this anime.

Running is such a solitary sport but here it shows the importance of others in your life and not just on the track.The importance of the journey and not the destination.

Great animation and soundtrack, this is production IG at its good (IG is either 'great' or 'awful' with no in between. Rest assured this is them at their peak.)Interesting, flawed MC where its explored in full truly why he is doing this and how he feels about it, and having it be expertly woven into the story is quite impressive.Didnt realise how much...of a part of my life this had became until i ended it. of a part of my life this had became until i ended it."", 'Run With the Wind is an anime that takes a while to hit its stride, but once it does, it becomes an engaging show with a lovable cast of running boys. It is unique in many aspects, making it a breath of fresh air to the sports anime genre. Those looking for a strong, character driven show will enjoy this one.Let’s start with what I think immediately sets this apart from other sports anime - the setting. Most sports anime are set in high school, but this one is set in college. This allows for story avenues not possible in a typical shounen setting, such...as looking for a job or just trying to figure out what to do with your life in general. I do wish we saw more of the young adult life overall, since it’s something we don’t get to see in anime that much. Still, these college aged boys are going through things that are fresh to me in my mind, since I’ve only graduated college recently. Perhaps in that way I am biased, but to me it makes these characters more relatable, and it sets this anime apart from others in a very clear way.At first, the show starts off a bit slow. You don’t really get a good feeling for what the show is gonna be about until several episodes in. Those who waive off shows within the first three or four episodes might be missing out on something special. It doesn’t start getting good until we really get to know the cast.Which brings us to the team. 70% of this team have no experience with track and field at all. Most teams of sports anime have members that are at least somewhat experienced and have to deal with maybe one or two newbies at a time. It is through these characters that we learn about the intricacies of the sport. But since running is so straightforward, Run With the Wind takes advantage of this by comprising the team of mostly unathletic scrubs. This leads to a viewing experience where you get to see several people experiencing the sport from level 0 all the way to like level 5 or something. I was, however, skeptical of how the show was gonna be able to balance all of these characters and give them sufficient time to grow.When the cast is introduced, they each have a defining quirk - one guy is a lawyer, one guy is the smoker, you’ve got some twins over here, one is an otaku, etc. etc. I was worried that they would be forever associated with these stereotypical character traits, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the show is able to add layers to each and every single character. Each of them gets their time in the sun, and we learn about what they’re really like underneath these shallow introductions. By the end of the show, I was rooting for each and every one of them. It was like I knew them all personally, like I was on the team too. My highest compliment I can give is that I remembered all of the team members’ names, which is unusual for me.The one thing I think puts a stain on the entire show is how the team itself is formed. Let’s just say that pretty much nobody voluntarily joins the team at first. The team captain manipulates the others, practically forcing them to join. This small fact, to me, gives the entire show a bit of a shaky foundation. After all, how can I believe in a team that didn’t really want to do their sport in the first place? If it weren’t for the show’s other strengths, I think this show could have easily toppled under the weight of this flaw. It still bugs me, even after completing the show. I think this aspect could have been handled better.As far as the antagonists, there aren’t really any, which is fitting for this show. The show’s theme is all about answering the questions, “Why do you run? What does running mean for you?” It’s a very introspective show, and is less about super-hype sports moments and more about growing as a person. Thus, the lack of any hard hitting villains is appropriate. The self-reflective nature of the anime is another unique selling point.The animation and the soundtrack are also pleasant surprises to be had. The background art of this show is quite lovely, and the attention to detail to the characters as they run is respectable. Each person runs in a slightly different way than the other, adding another dimension to who they are as a person and as a runner. This show does have CG, but it is wise enough to use it with restraint. It is mostly limited to large group shots where there is a bunch of people running at the same time. Everything else is classically animated. The soundtrack fits the very thoughtful mood of the show. It has some pretty chill-sounding beats overall, but is still able to amp up the mood when it needs to.The last bit of praise I can give this show is a bit of a personal one but I think it’s worth mentioning. This show made me want to run again. And in fact, I did! I used to run a bit of track and field/cross country back in the day, and this anime reminded me of how simple, yet powerful, the act of running can be.Despite its slow start, Run With the Wind is a special anime. It is very good in pretty much all aspects, such as characters, animation, and story. I think those that like shows with big, lovable casts should check this one out, as well as those who are fans of sports anime in general.

Why? Because they get it.

However, each of these 10 runners has a unique story of their own, and not just something made up on the spot to fill the bulk of...a cast.

The story itself is nothing particularly special, but the cast of characters, each with their own stories of growth, is what really makes the show.To me, this wasn't a sports anime. It was an extremely well-done character study where we got to see Kakeru develop as a person and as a runner. The sport here was merely a vehicle for Kakeru's (and, to a certain extent, Haiji) growth. 23 episodes...might seem long for a show that is about one of the arguably least exciting sports to watch—which is exactly why it's not a sports anime, not in the same way other sports anime bigshots like Haikyuu!! or Hajime no Ippo are. The sport takes a backseat to the athlete, to the person.Character designs are lovely and aesthetically pleasing, and the music is absolutely outstanding. Yuki Hayashi never fails to disappoint, and I'm a particularly huge fan of his work on the Haikyuu!! OST. He does it again here. Each track perfectly fits the scene and lends a certain weight and gravitas to the show.One gripe I have is that, while the development of the side characters (i.e. not Haiji or Kakeru) feels satisfying, it is not satisfying enough. Fair, there are too many characters to give them the same amount of attention and care as the main two, and perhaps the source material did a better job of portraying their growth, but the 'arcs' for the rest of the cast seemed rather touch-and-go.But, in the end, this is a show about the character development of a boy who is struggling to figure out his role in life, and who happens to be a runner. As someone who was in cross country for a good chunk of my youth, this show reignited my love for running. It takes some level of crazy to get out there every day, sometimes twice a day, and beat your body to the ground. The hustle of training and the pain of a race are feelings that only runners understand—ask any runner, and they will tell you that running is a generous thing, one that gives more than it takes. You cannot take away the runner from the individual or vice versa.I'm giving this a 10, despite its shortcomings, and despite knowing it might not be to everyone's taste, because it achieves what it sets out to do, which is to show us how Kakeru grows as a runner and as a person. It isn't a traditional, adrenaline-pumping sports anime, and it doesn't try to be. Run with the Wind perfectly portrays the intensity and grit of long-distance running, all the while showing us how a young boy grows up. might seem long for a show that is about one of the arguably least exciting sports to watch—which is exactly why it's not a sports anime, not in the same way other sports anime bigshots like Haikyuu!! or Hajime no Ippo are.

I can\'t believe I watched this in like, probably half a day 😅 this is sooo good and it\'s really unique and realistic. It\'s not like other Shounen sports anime where the MCs are OP and like monsters. It shows us how we struggle to achieve our goals by trying again and again and doing our best in what we do. Haiji is too good with words, and probably has a bit of psychopathic tendencies but I like him the most.I must say that as a Deuteragonist, he gave more impact to the viewers...than the main MC. He has a story, he works hard, he waited for four years, and he\'s even enduring the pain just to answer his question. ""What is running all about?"" Well, atleast he\'s happy with whatever he\'s doing .I dunno, but he\'s the ultimate role model.I give this a 10/10 because this made my heart race.

To be honest this series hasn’t been as impacting (at least emotionally) as some of the other high-rated shows that I watched, but what it loses in the wow factor it makes up for with its consistent, and well articulated writing.Japanese literature, especially anime recently, have a tendency for bloated monologues that sound smart and mean nothing, and which you promptly forget about five seconds later. I won’t name any examples here, but I used to think I just wasn’t smart enough to “get” it, though I now realize that it’s just bad writing that detracts from...the flow of natural conversation. Of course, this show isn’t entirely faultless in this front, but where other japanese writers trip and fall in their faces, the scenes in this show keeps cruising through, at a pace that is both poignant and human.Where this show really shines is with its characters. With a cast of 10 main characters (or 9, because let’s be honest: the twins were pretty much the same for 90% of the episodes), I grew a bit worried that it would end up like the countless other anime across nearly every genre in which all of the character development are focused on the protagonist, and the side characters are left in the dust. Not so, not so. It wasn’t perfect, but it was the closest that fictional beings have seemed real people so far. I think the key here lies in character development and longevity, because it’s not the only show with a cast of unique characters. It’s easy to see how much the characters have changed when you compare the introduction in the first episode to each individual’s leg of the run in Hakone. This guy likes manga, this guy smokes, this guy is an African transfer student: it’s easy to label characters this way in order to differentiate between them, but that’s not what’s done here. For the length of time that it had and the amount of characters that it contained, this show did a relatively amazing job at exploring each of the characters in a genuine and believable way. Again, it’s not entirely perfect. Some of the characters, such as King and Shindo, I felt were a bit weaker than others. There’s also the fact that it’s highly unrealistic for a group of ten random college students to suddenly become so devoted to running. But hey, this is fiction, and sometimes being too realistic makes it boring.There’s also the fact that these people have relationships, however cheesy it may be, and not the artificial love triangles (quadrilaterals? Pentagons?) or shallow romance/best friend type stuff that plagues a lot of other anime. You can really see that these characters form relationships within the group based on their age and personality, just like in real life, whereas in most other stories everyone would only be friends with the main character and that’s the only thing that mattered.Then we get Kakeru, who has got to be the best male protagonist I’ve seen in years. In most anime you would see this cool guy that doesn’t stand out too much other than for having a harem of girls follow his cardboard cutout personality. But Kakeru is defined by himself, not what others think of him. He struggles to make friends, he is easily irritable, and he is rather arrogant. But that doesn’t mean he isn’t a good person. He just needed the right group of people, people who could understand him for what he is. His character growth was enormous, from a narrow-minded goal of speed and more speed, to realizing that running was about people, not numbers.That brings me to my final point. In reality, I think this show is not about running, even though it is a sports anime. What is remarkable about this show is that’s it about the people doing the running. However cliche it may be at times, it breathes new air into an industry which has become somewhat stale in recent years, focusing more on plot and excitement than characters you can relate to.The only, if minor, flaw I see with this show is that there’s always a good ending. Everyone reaches an official record, kansei just makes it to the qualifiers, they also just make the seeded spot, and kakeru beats the record by one second. It’s true that these characters persevere through adversity to reach that point, but it would be interesting to see how these characters react to working for their goal but falling short.All in all, this wasn’t the most memorable or emotional show that I’ve watched, but it’s certainly polished. You can tell that the source material came from an author who cared about writing a good story, and even. If it’s not all fireworks, at least it feels like running in the wind. the flow of natural conversation. Of course, this show isn’t entirely faultless in this front, but where other japanese writers trip and fall in their faces, the scenes in this show keeps cruising through, at a pace that is both poignant and human.Where this show really shines is with its characters. With a cast of 10 main characters (or 9, because let’s be honest: the twins were pretty much the same for 90% of the episodes), I grew a bit worried that it would end up like the countless other anime across nearly every genre in which all of the character development are focused on the protagonist, and the side characters are left in the dust. Not so, not so. It wasn’t perfect, but it was the closest that fictional beings have seemed real people so far. I think the key here lies in character development and longevity, because it’s not the only show with a cast of unique characters. It’s easy to see how much the characters have changed when you compare the introduction in the first episode to each individual’s leg of the run in Hakone. This guy likes manga, this guy smokes, this guy is an African transfer student: it’s easy to label characters this way in order to differentiate between them, but that’s not what’s done here. For the length of time that it had and the amount of characters that it contained, this show did a relatively amazing job at exploring each of the characters in a genuine and believable way. Again, it’s not entirely perfect. Some of the characters, such as King and Shindo, I felt were a bit weaker than others. There’s also the fact that it’s highly unrealistic for a group of ten random college students to suddenly become so devoted to running. But hey, this is fiction, and sometimes being too realistic makes it boring.There’s also the fact that these people have relationships, however cheesy it may be, and not the artificial love triangles (quadrilaterals? Pentagons?) or shallow romance/best friend type stuff that plagues a lot of other anime. You can really see that these characters form relationships within the group based on their age and personality, just like in real life, whereas in most other stories everyone would only be friends with the main character and that’s the only thing that mattered.Then we get Kakeru, who has got to be the best male protagonist I’ve seen in years.

Run with the wind (Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteru), with its amazing graphics, soul-stirring music, likeble cast of characters, will remain one of my favourite animes for a long time.Story: 8/10. Run with the wind is adapted from a novel by Shion Miura. The storyline is quite straightforward. But what impressed me was the dialogue and pacing of the show. Dialogue was meaningful and deeply thought out. The pacing of the show was very well done as there wasn\'t a single episode which felt dragged out or redundant. Every...scene contributed to either plot progression or characters development. Thank God there were no long lenghty discussions about game mechanics/sports terminologies or how a certain character\'s ""special technique"" works (ahem, Kuroko no Basuke, Prince of tennis).Art: 9/10. The art was very beautiful. I really like the clean, crisp art style alot. Using a bright color pallette really brought the scenes to life. I really like how beautiful the backgrounds looked (especially during the final Marathon), which made me wish I was there running with the characters. I also like how realistic the character designs were. The characters look like a group of students that you would find hanging out in your neighbourhood cafe or shopping mall. Only thing that disturbed me was Fujioka\'s cheekbones haha.Sound: 10/10. The music in this show was PHENOMENAL. All the background music were masterpieces of their own. There were so many instances where I was moved to tears due to the music accompanying the scene. (Eg. When King passes the baton(?) To kakeru on the final Marathon). I can play the OST songs of this anime on loop forever. Voice acting was done well and voice actors/actresses voices suited their characters well.Characters: 9/10. Each member of the race team were well-developed, and everyone had their motivations, fears, insecurities, backstories. No one felt like a one-dimensional cliche character that was there just to behave in a predictable manner. Furthermore, characters were written in such a way that they felt relatable, with real-world problems (eg. King worrying that taking part in the Marathon will distract him from finding a job, Yuki being unable to deal with his mother remarrying).Overall: 9/10. scene contributed to either plot progression or characters development.

If you like logic, you will hate this anime (even some magical power-up would be better because then there would be some explanation.)I like strategy so I was drawn in by the mystery of what sort of training/strategy/psychology would be applied (even if slightly fantastical) in order to have the main questions of the show answered.

There was one joke, in particular, that was really obnoxious, more towards the beginning.  That being said, I think a lot of people make excuses for it without addressing the main question: Is there really a need to bring up race like this if he doesn't really struggle or overcome many racial tensions in Japan?The issue in doing an anime about a team of people, especially in a series that only has 23 episodes to do it,...is that you have to flesh out every character.  Unfortunately, there just isn't enough given to Musa for them to justify having a black character.  Maybe one or two comments are thrown at him, and this pureness of his character handles the initial reaction, but he's already done running and quite honestly they didn't make any progressive comments on race in Japan at all.  That's not what this anime was about, and really it just feels slightly more offensive than it should.  Not that I was expecting a Japanese company about Japanese college students to really handle any racial tension with any sort of grace, I can't say that I will let this anime really pass on a great score.That being said, I think that overall they did try to make a good series and I have enjoyed watching it.  It gave me something to do, and I wasn't turned off from the first few episodes with a promise of something better.  And I won't lie, I did tear up at a few of the bigger moments towards the end.

Now i realize how wrong it was of me to think that way. I love how it's a realistic take on sports and the struggles of each member. ALSO COLLEGE STUDENTS NOT HIGH SCHOOL.It was so easy to relate to the characters as they near graduation and think of their future. As I've recently graduated as well.

The focus is on the characters and their individual answers to the central question: ""Why do (I/we/you) run?"" more so than the actual sport of running itself. The cast of characters we\'re introduced to are relatable and likable, because they could all so easily be us or someone we know. Their journeys both on and off the track are as inspiring as...they are incredibly ordinary.The natural weaving of subplots and subtle dropping of character hints follows a similar narrative structure to that of a novel, thanks to its source material being exactly that. Every character has their own personality and charm, but are never too gimmicky. Another refreshing point about the story is that it\'s about college students, not high schoolers. Our protagonist, Kurahara Kakeru, faces very real, college-student problems outside of running and we see him solve them in very real, college-student fashion: by mostly ignoring them.Production I.G.\'s animation really shines in this show. Famous for working on the iconic sports series ""Haikyuu!"" and ""Kuroko no Basuke"", the realistic motion in the characters\' muscles and hair as they run is breathtaking in ""Run with the Wind"". Even when the characters are still, their designs are brimming with life and energy. The vast differences in the characters\' looks/designs are also portrayed realistically and are, more or less, worked into their individual arcs.If you\'re looking for an action-packed, fast-paced series about track and field, this may not be the show for you.

Considering it was in the top 100, it HAD to have some sort of redeeming qualities, right?The first few episodes (especially the first episode) were super mediocre. Nothing special at all, and I was honestly considering not finishing the series if it were to to continue that way, in terms of quality. Characters were all introduced at once and there was no way to make any strong connections to the characters because of it.Luckily, after about 4 or 5 episodes, we finally got...to see some individualization in the characters. Despite Haiji's motives behind wanting everyone to run were not clear and hard to understand (because it was revealed more towards the end), the show grew on me and I started enjoying it more and more. Also, our other main character, Kakeru was SUPER bland and boring for the first half of the series. Of course, his back story was slowly being revealed and then completely shown towards the end, and his character development is clearly evident in the the show as well. But I think that if the audience could have had a better connection to our two main characters from the beginning, it would have made the first part of the series a lot more enjoyable. If you're able to stick through that blandness, it'll be worth the wait and development.There are quite some similarities to Haikyuu (also Production I.G.), but I would not say it's up to the same level of quality. Haikyuu is definitely superior in introducing characters, making the characters likable to the audience, and helping the viewer understand the technical side of the sport a lot more. But for what the show is, I think it does an excellent job nonetheless if you can accept a decently done job of these aspects.The show had a lot of its feel-good moments and I did end up learning the individual personalities of all the characters. Doing that with 10 characters is definitely a difficult task for a show, even with 23 episodes of run time. And to top it off, it had a complete ending. Very fulfilling and satisfying. Of course, there were many parts in the story that don't seem very believable, but I still felt extremely passionate for the show when they happened.Yes, this show is not one of my all time favorite shows, but for a sports anime, it is definitely up there as one of the best.

The show perfectly embodies the pain and discomfort of exerting yourself beyond your comfort zone as well as the primal joy it brings .OverallThis is an anime that went somewhat under the radar and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to watch a show with a charming cast."", ""First of all I am glad I got to experience such a wonderful masterpiece in my life. Just finished the last episode and I have no words, just bliss.Story: 9.5/10It is great no doubt.

The main characters are a roughly put together team of college students, many of which have never run in their life. They all have different personalities, different backstories which define them so clearly.  Prince, who I mentioned...earlier is one of my favourite characters among others, he is a character who is the most unfit and gets dragged in as the 10th man. Despite this, he runs for the team.This show is a masterpiece in every way and each episode being a golden nugget. The show does not have a romantic aspect, but that is what makes it special. It makes the bond between the characters running together extremely strong. From setting delicate undertones, it is clear that this story is written by a woman. Unlike other shounen shows, it touches deep feelings inside characters which cannot be seen. Beware, this show is an emotional rollercoaster, it is quite deep. I love this but others may not.I would definitely recommend everyone to watch this show, if you love shounen or not it is for everyone and is a story about perseverance and friendship. earlier is one of my favourite characters among others, he is a character who is the most unfit and gets dragged in as the 10th man.

I believe that this show is somewhat slept on within the sport anime genre, and anime as a whole. Taking such a boring concept such as running and creating something that can be enjoyed by anyone. Following well made characters through a journey common within the sports anime genre. Aside from great execution of the plot, with subtle humor lacked within show create a pleasant viewing experience. Despite the common tropes within this show, it doesn't really feel that similar to what others have done before. This feeling proven during the conclusion of the show.Characters are...well-done, with all of personality gelling together to create something you can get invested into. Sound wise, nothing amazing has been done but it's still great. After seeing all the sweat and tears that this team has gone through leaves you cheering for them, come the end of the show.

Maybe I\'m a little bit biased because I\'m currently a college student as well and this felt very close to home, they way they were living and the vibes and all that but this atmosphere that they\'re...able to achieve is something I\'ve never felt before, more of a feeling thing but I think it deserves a mention, the only anime I can think of that has gotten even somewhat close to getting to this level of immersion(speaking for me of course) was probably a silent voice but even then it wasn\'t close to this anime, which leads me nicely to my next point.The illustrations, art style and the animation. The art style isn\'t anything that stands out, its good, still images of the characters would just make you say ""huh good art style"" but my god did Production I.G. pulled out all the stops for this. They never seem to disappoint with any of the anime they are handed. Of course everyone is going to talk about how great the animation is but let\'s give a hand to the illustration artists, the illustrations in this anime were so damn good, there were times it seemed so realistic that my sister thought I was watching a real life movie when she walked in on a paused frame with just the landscape, and they did that consistently, every aspect of this anime just compliments another aspect of it so perfectly, I\'ve never seen such fluidly working anime, it just works, the art style compliments the animation, the illustration compliments the animation, the animation compliments the music, its unbelievable how they pulled this off, its like they were given movie budget, and truly, every episode felt like movie quality.Next, the animation, now I don\'t know that much about animation in its technicality that I can go and minutely breakdown so I\'m just going to say that it looked fluid. I hardly noticed ANY ""bad frames"" and it was just good to look at overall.Now let\'s talk about THE CHARACTERS, oh my god, the writer, the goddamn writer of this light novel is a genius, the details he spread out about every character were so subtle, but he kept adding on to it little by little giving every character so much depth and complexion that its amazing, I\'ve never seen such well done character writing before this anime(again, maybe biased because they are college students). She did this so well in fact that after about halfway the anime, every episode was making me tear up, and most of the times things weren\'t even really that ""sad""(on a surface level). I don\'t know what sort of trickery she did but goddamn, it felt like I was tearing up over nothing at times, but I knew the reason for my tears were the subtle increment in the depth of the characters that we knew, its just mind-blowing to me how someone can write characters that well. The character developments felt natural as well unlike a lot of other anime where its forced and honestly I could go on about every character and how they grew and why it makes sense but that would just make this review four times as long.Now we get to the best part, THE MUSIC, for me music is very important when it comes to be it anime, or movies or tv shows, good music can be a very important aspect in a show that can often get ignored, and it may come as a surprise but good music can be just as important in setting the tone as good animation. And my god did they pull through, the openings were good not spectacular but the endings were just incredible, it felt as if the composers watched the anime and really got a feel for the atmosphere and wrote their songs accordingly, the endings really add to the emotions of the episodes. Next let\'s talk about the OST, hands down the best OST I\'ve heard in an anime, every single track complimented what was going on in the story so well, this was like Hans Zimmer level of composition, the touch of beauty that is adds feels subtle but is very significant. On top of that, what\'s great is that if you read the titles of the tracks in the OST, it itself feels like a story, after completing the anime, I spent almost two hours just listening to the OST in its admiration and it felt amazing, the OST is just as beautiful as the animation and the illustrations, this aspect made the anime a hundred times better than it already was.All in all, I\'ve never watched any anime that felt this perfect in all its aspects, animation, art style, illustration, storytelling and music(keep in mind all of this is subjective and you may not like it as much as I did). I kind of want to stop watching anime now because of how good this one was, every once in a while you stumble onto an anime that\'s a 10 for you and its the best feeling ever and watching this anime definitely brought me a lot of joy. able to achieve is something I\'ve never felt before, more of a feeling thing but I think it deserves a mention, the only anime I can think of that has gotten even somewhat close to getting to this level of immersion(speaking for me of course) was probably a silent voice but even then it wasn\'t close to this anime, which leads me nicely to my next point.The illustrations, art style and the animation.

I know these aren't real people but it still inspires me to run myself. The story wasn't so much about pushing the limits or intense drama with other teams like most sports anime, which was refreshing because as someone who isn't a serious athlete but really enjoys sports, winning isn't everything. Feels...amazing to win and have something to work towards, but I believe enjoying the journey and actually having fun playing the game is so much more rewarding. It was about enjoying running and finding a reason for it. It was about friendship, health, teamwork, perserverance, passon, motivation, goals, self-discovery, and more.Ultimately, inspiring.

Let's talk, shall we?Sports anime often get this notion of being rather repetitive, same, and often completely boring if you've seen enough of them. This notion is not one I agree with nor one I particularly like as the focus of many of the better-end sports anime's I've watched are based solely around the characters rather than the actual sport. It's sort of a storytelling medium within a storytelling medium to tell a character's story through a sports anime.So, who are the characters in run with the wind?They're everything and more, from a nicotine addicted software engineer to a kid who...can't help but find himself running there's a wide cast and the one thing I just don't get when reading a lot of reviews are the people saying that all 10 members are the same.In what world? If you're looking at character design, I can see the argument for two pairs of people being the same, one of them being twins, and the other having clearly separable features each time they're both in frame.(Slight Spoilers for this section)We talking actual personality? Again, only two pairs I can really see fitting this argument, the twins yet again, and the same pair as before, Haiji and Kakeru. The twins grew up together, did everything together, and a main part of their general story arc is that they WERE the same, they had the same hobbies, and people couldn't distinguish them. I think this is blatantly apparent to anyone who actually watched the last couple episodes. With Kakeru and Haiji, it's meant to be like that, they start with a one-sided sort of hate and in the end scene reconcile to be the same in each other's views, they both see each other as the embodiment of running, also VERY apparent if you watch the last episode.(Spoilers Over)Now, let's talk about PLOT, there is something really special with how it presents the first couple episodes. Beyond the normal introducing the cast/hideout/guild they introduce the main character and Haiji in a way that pushes their relationship throughout the rest of the story.Then, it one by one introduces problems, misgivings, and more that each character may have with either running or themselves. It then does this multiple times for each and every character and may even re-visit characters every now and then. People like the MC are obviously given more and more scenes to show his problems but somehow he's not the one who I care the most about in this show. Sure, I find him to be a great main character but because of the plot I find Shindo's problems and general attitude 110% more entertaining, and that's my personal opinion. The same could go for anyone, they could resonate with the MC, or they could resonate with another character in the cast. This is mainly due to the great characters that are also only complimented by the plot.(Slight spoilers)Moving towards the end, there is a point where I feel the plot lacks a little bit. Directly after the qualifier, the twins ask if there is even a point and it's at this point that everyone in the cast seems to lose motivation, excluding few individuals. It makes even the viewer lose motivation and though that may seem to be a pro, it's a con in my eyes. I feel as since we're watching their story from mostly Kakeru's POV, that having lost motivation just makes me feel so damn disconnected and makes me question why is this show still going. It's only for a brief couple episodes as the format comes back and they rev out the final race showing each person's care for running and then showing them still having an end goal besides #1.(Spoilers Over)Beyond that, the ending feels nice, they give a short epilogue of sorts and yeah that's the end of the story. If it had 24 episodes to give a better epilogue and flesh out some moments during the final race I would've enjoyed that heavily but beggars can't be choosers.Run with the wind is great, you should watch it. can't help but find himself running there's a wide cast and the one thing I just don't get when reading a lot of reviews are the people saying that all 10 members are the same.In what world? If you're looking at character design, I can see the argument for two pairs of people being the same, one of them being twins, and the other having clearly separable features each time they're both in frame.(Slight Spoilers for this section)We talking actual personality? Again, only two pairs I can really see fitting this argument, the twins yet again, and the same pair as before, Haiji and Kakeru. The twins grew up together, did everything together, and a main part of their general story arc is that they WERE the same, they had the same hobbies, and people couldn't distinguish them. I think this is blatantly apparent to anyone who actually watched the last couple episodes. With Kakeru and Haiji, it's meant to be like that, they start with a one-sided sort of hate and in the end scene reconcile to be the same in each other's views, they both see each other as the embodiment of running, also VERY apparent if you watch the last episode.(Spoilers Over)Now, let's talk about PLOT, there is something really special with how it presents the first couple episodes. Beyond the normal introducing the cast/hideout/guild they introduce the main character and Haiji in a way that pushes their relationship throughout the rest of the story.Then, it one by one introduces problems, misgivings, and more that each character may have with either running or themselves. It then does this multiple times for each and every character and may even re-visit characters every now and then. People like the MC are obviously given more and more scenes to show his problems but somehow he's not the one who I care the most about in this show. Sure, I find him to be a great main character but because of the plot I find Shindo's problems and general attitude 110% more entertaining, and that's my personal opinion. The same could go for anyone, they could resonate with the MC, or they could resonate with another character in the cast. This is mainly due to the great characters that are also only complimented by the plot.(Slight spoilers)Moving towards the end, there is a point where I feel the plot lacks a little bit.

There is nothing special about the story, but it is exciting to watch.Art: 7The art is very minimal and basic, providing nothing special to the anime.

It does not subtract from the enjoyment of the anime, but it does not add anything either.Sound: 8The soundtracks are not...well-produced but do their job. I can loop the OST at the end, but other than that, there are no spectacular or memorable tracks in the anime.Character: 9I think the best part of the anime is the development of each character. Each character is dynamic in that it changes. A character is willing to give up smoking for running. Another character learns social skills and selflessness working in the team. Every character represents a type of person that has a purpose in their own way.Enjoyment: 10The story, art, sound, and character are all middle tier, but I definitely felt like it was more enjoyable than other anime that scores all 10 in the other categories.

There are points in the show that I truly applauded and cheered them on while slapping my desk telling them to keep going, sounds dumb right, but thats the power this show has.  There were points i cried with them, laughed with them and most importantly wanted to pet the dog with them. I admit the show has flaws which i\'ll explain in detail below. Also if you\'re a fan...of sports anime especially shows like haikyuu these two shows share the same studio and lets not lie to ourselves kageyama and kakeru are twins. Another important note is this show has AMAZING voice acting because everyone in this show truly sounds like they are in the middle of running and pushing themselves to the limit while giving the most inspiring inner monologue ever. It has relatable characters no matter what level of experience you have with running, theirs a character that you can relate to i bet. And most importantly the thing that sets this show apart from any other sports anime is it touches on very real problems in the world of sports and just in general. From racism, lack of support, as well as the struggles every college kids go through when facing their final year of college. Run with the wind is a unique story that inspired me and i bet anyone else who has watched it in some way and id recommend it to anyone who has an intrest in the synopsis. But at the same time if you are looking for a sports anime that has alot of yaoi vibes and making you wonder if they are all secretly gay or properly shows off an amateur track team try to reach their goals of running in a championship relay then this might not be for you lolDog 10000000/10Story 7/10Art 10/10Character 9/10Enjoyment 10/10Now for more detailed reviewing.

Are all the characters amazing and perfectly written loveable people? heck no theres characters i question why they are there or if they will ever have some development to make me like them and these characters can ruin scenes and moments. Do they properly show a realistic group of amateurs practice to increase their times? HECK NO.But does the show inspire you to also join in with all of them in their adventure to race in the Hakone Ekiden and show you the real struggles these college men go through in order to reach that and show the raw good and bad in their struggle to reach that goal?

I had a lot of time to ponder, and there was one question that was always at the forefront of my mind - What does it mean to run?One day I saw a platinum shining light that engulfed a slim figure. This figure’s arms were like outstretched wings, effortlessly gliding across the turbulent nature of the wind. This figure’s legs were uncapturable, they powerfully moved behind a blurred veil. This figure was a miracle. Hey, do you like...running? I asked.Running is lonely. It is for the strong, the committed, the powerful, the few who understand how it feels to be out alone ahead of the pack. I’ve always thought this way, running is for the few.I was once asked what it means to run. It’s strange, when I run my mind isn’t clouded, there are no thoughts that beg me for an answer, so why does this particular question now run alongside me on the track?I’m running the fastest I’ve ever ran and yet I don’t feel lonely. Why is that? This journey has changed me, I know that for sure, and yet as I stand at the finishing line, I still don’t have an answer to the multitude of questions running has brought me.Today, I see a golden shining light that engulfs a slim figure.

It doesn't offer anything new, the story is very linear as well. Despite this, I would say I enjoyed it.Story 7/10There's nothing majorly wrong with the story, I will admit that there are a few over-dramatised scenes but only a few. The reason I'm giving it a 7 is because it doesn't offer anything new. It has Haikyuu vibes, probably because it's by the same studio. The story is pretty linear, everything is for the training, there are no side arcs. The issue...with the sport chosen is that you can't do much with it, you're literally just running. You can't really add many interesting parts that other sports anime may offer, e.g. a hidden strategy.Art 10/10It's by the same studio as Haikyuu and the art is of the same quality... if not better. There is a small amount of CGI used but only for the background and you honestly can't blame them, it would be impossible to animate 20 runners all in one frame. The art style is similar to that of Haikyuu's too.Sound 8/10The music is done well and the background noise works very well to create an atmosphere around the characters. I've got experience in running and I can say that the atmosphere the anime gives is identical to reality.Character 8/10There is a bit of character development throughout the series. The characters don't seem one-dimensional, they all have things going on behind their character. The characters also feel real, something that is very important to me. The main character doesn't really seem like a main character though, we don't see many things from Kakeru's perspective. It focuses more on the overall story and all of the characters equally.Enjoyment 8/10I found that the episodes went by quite quickly, I would find myself binging without realising. It has decent comedy, mainly around the start.Overall 8/10Although the story didn't offer anything new, I still think the anime did well overall.

I've watched it 3 times now and every time it keeps my attention from start to finish without stopping. Each character has their own struggles that they have to overcome and they all have wonderful character development. They portray running really well as someone who ran cross country for a few years now. They show the struggles of not being motivated, and overcoming all the obstacles that a runner might face. I would recommend anyone this anime when they ask for recommendations, every...one I know who's watched it has really enjoyed it. one I know who's watched it has really enjoyed it."", ""Run with the Wind is almost a 10, but we can't grade in increments on MAL!- Story. On top of the straightforward sports goals, the character interactions are what drive the show and enable the plot to continue. The show smartly employs flashforwarding and flashbacks to maintain an air of mystery about the characters, so you don't truly know what's going to happen next. I was pleasantly surprised by something in Kakeru's backstory. Lastly, I liked the realism depicted with the sport and the internal struggles that come with it. No thigh muscles making cracking noises while bulging three times their size.- Characters. It...is hard for a show to pull off having ten main characters. Everyone experiences their own hangups and insecurities at different points in the show. Granted, not all of them get enough screen time and/or development as complex characters with their own motivations, talents, and stages in their life. My ranking of best character development to least are as follows:1. Kakeru, Prince, Haji, Shindo - they subvert the personality tropes expected of them.2. Hirata and King3. Musa and Yuki4. The twins - for me, they are the weakest characters with the dumbest arc and likely wouldn't have made a difference if they were removed. I could see someone identifying with them better than myself though.Characters in the 3rd and 4th tier come too late to truly have an impact in the flashback developments of the final episodes. I guess the studio did it because straight up running isn't necessarily the most entertaining thing to watch, and they needed to fill the runtime with something.- Art. Besides the solid lineart, I appreciate the rich color palette and great character designs. If you look closely, the characters look different without over-the-top deviation in art style. Besides hair, the characters have distinct fashion sense and facial structures/features.- Animation. This is the only section where I docked partial points. I noticed a creeping abuse of stills in the second half of the show, but I chalked it up to saving the budget for key competitions and moving the story along to the climactic competition. They made up for it in other ways. I appreciated the small details, such as their hair realistically sticking straight up after running sessions.- Music. The show's background music is excellent. The second Ending Theme is my favorite.- Sound design. I was holding my breath during the one minute clip that plays before the Opening Theme in episode one. That's how you know you're in for a treat. The show routinely pairs cinematic shots with sound design in order to achieve maximum impact, whether it's for emotive emphasis or comedic scene transition.- Writing. It's cool that the characters are older in college and at different stages in life, from carefree juniors to graduating seniors under pressure to find jobs after school. Too many sports animes are all about middle or high school kids who look and act ten years older than they should.What is wholly unique about the writing in this show is that it dedicates much of its time showing friends talking to each other about other friends -- you know, as real people do. Relationships are very important in this anime. The characters hang out in big groups, trios and duos; they get along, fight, and make up; they support each other. You get a sense of each character's dynamics with other characters. They give each other non-cringy life advice. Things that one character says to another is discussed or demonstrated later in the same episode, or several episodes over. This contributes to the organic nature of the cast coming together as teammates and friends when they were originally a ragtag group of strangers.It's worth mentioning that the show has a lot of well timed comedic moments that made me bark out a genuine laugh. Although the show does use stereotypical chibi edited scenes, they last briefly on screen.The final portion of the climactic competition had me on the edge of my seat with its constant sense of foreboding. There is a bit of ambiguous queer subtext, but I'm down with that. I actually thought it made the show more inclusive to viewers. Like whether you are gay or straight, the base feelings conveyed are the same. Your own views will further color your interpretation of what happened.- Emotional impact.

The story is fine and the characters are decent enough for a nice watch through.However if you are a runner, just ignore it all together. I know anime has the reputation of being not real, but I have seen some sports anime get really close to being accurate. Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru is not accurate to how runners train and how they start off. Right off the bat, Kakeru Kurahara talks about being...a slow runner.

Extremely disappointed. sports anime. Extremely disappointed.', 'Well, it\'s running. This show sure is about running.Track and field is a competitive sport featuring running races and courses. How does one make a show about running, of all things? Well, you have to start with having a good cast of characters. After all, the sport isn\'t exciting to watch. While you compete in track and field, the only strategy is to ""run to the goal"" in the shortest time possible. Well, Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru miserably fails at trying to create an engaging cast of characters.First off is the melodrama. It\'s cringe. You have 10 track and field players that seemingly get dragged...into the club against their will, and in a matter of a few days to a week, all ten just magically want to run. I get that in a story like this, it\'s pretty natural for certain characters to be easy to sway, but every single one of the characters are super easy to convince. A large majority of people just join the track and field club because ""I am moved by [this person\'s] feelings about running."" At this point, why have the characters be averse to joining the club in the first place? Is there any point? Each character is extremely generic, and they really do function as a hive mind rather than an individual. Some people first got convinced, and then that led to a chain effect where everyone wants to join, and the reasons are all similar and stupid. I\'ll specifically mention Musa, because while he isn\'t any different from the others, he\'s the only one that just doesn\'t make any sense at all. Wasn\'t his whole purpose for not joining because he need to work part time? Considering that Haiji shortly bans all part time jobs after everyone joins the club, how is Musa alright with this?You don\'t get to know any particular character very well and each character neatly fits into their generic mold. If you\'re going to have all of the characters easily be convinced, then don\'t do it at all. The show misses the point of the fact that the convincing part should give a character some personality and shed light onto their feelings into the matter.  The only exception to the generic and boring characters is Prince. He\'s funny, walks exagerated like a guy with a bone deformity, and yet also has a character depth as well. He shows his values and adheres to them as straight as an arrow despite being a scrawny guy that only reads manga. His white t-shirts with different phrases on them each time is also a change of pace.I\'ll also mention Kakeru and Haiji since those two characters have the most screen time. Kakeru is the MC, and the show is all about being coming of age and posing questions like: ""what does it mean to run?"" I hope you like hearing that a lot by the way. Running means ""the action or movement of a runner."" I kid, of course. It makes a lot of sense to have philosophical themes about running in a show all about mental progression and well, running, but it\'s shallow. Kakeru is an extremely unlikeable and gloomy MC, one where the author teases you about his ""mysterious past,"" because that\'s about all that he\'s got going for him. Sure, he experiences inner turmoil, and you\'re subject to a bit of that, but the cause is a bit ridiculous. The MC is still trapped in his own past I suppose, but the antogonistic character that comes and goads the MC is just so obviously fake. Sasaki Kousuke has an old history with Kakeru, but you don\'t actually get to know him. All you know his that he\'s mad at Kakeru for running better than him, and he\'s also mad at the other characters for being slower than him. Like haha, wow, Kakeru runs fast. He\'s so stupid!!! Lmaoo!! Prince runs so slowly, he might as well be in the jogging club!!! He\'s a two bit character with as much character depth as a demon king in an old RPG would, his only role being some generic evil villain that forces the main character to action. He\'s just there to serve as character progression and a symbol of the past of Kakeru.I wouldn\'t really care about Kakeru being edge boy, but Kousuke is just such a boring plot device that I cannot take the story seriously. The show just shoots itself by introducing random characters with the purpose of shoving the past of Kakeru down your throat. Then, Kakeru takes it really personally and gets trauma from it. That\'s just too hilarious.Haiji is what a normal MC in a type of show like this would have. Cheery, wounded but looking forward, encouraging others, kind, and wants to prop other people up with running. Do I need to say anything more? That\'s about it.Then comes the races. Oh god. There\'s a complete lack of good characters, and then you want me to suddenly cheer for them in a race where all I see are CGI models and crappy running? There\'s no monologue about exhaustion or the intensity of the run, and the soundtrack hits you with the most generic shitty and looping beat that I could come up in garageband in five minutes.What\'s the damn rush of getting all of the characters to join the track and field team? The premise of the show is that it\'s about character development and coming of age, yes? Yet, Haiji is all about running the Hakone Ekiden. That seems more like something out of a shounen. You need to pick one theme, and the show clearly favors the latter.

Why waterboarding is a thing when treadmills exist is a complete mystery to me. I guess even the KGB had its limit on how fucked up their torture methods were. Anyhoo, Kaze ga Tsuyoku Fuiteiru --  Run with the Wind -- is a story about people who are literally the epitome of masochism and, as weird as it may sound, actually enjoy running. I was expecting a psychological series going in depth with this pain = pleasure thing, but turns out our series relies on fujobaiting instead.It should be warned already on the title page...that every factor from story progression, seiyuu choices, male casting and slice of life-like approach yells out one thing loud and clear: homo undertones. While great many sports series have chosen this approach (Haikyuu, Kuroko, Wind Up, Free -- just to name a few), Kaze ga has very little charm outside its naked ecchi boys / manservice factors. Just to specify to what extent this exist and why it is a problem: there are 4 scenes of our young boys being naked already shown in the first episode before we even know their names. I don\'t mind male ecchi or bros bathing together washing each others dicks when it is manly and #no_homo, but when it becomes the first thing that stands out in a sports series that was told be filled with drama and comedy, and executed with cute boys who don\'t, in any way, act like genuine humans, we are off to a terrible start.The selling point of sports series tends to be their cast for their stories can never truly work if the person(s) going thru the story are not worth of being followed. Kaze ga\'s cast and approach I\'d like to describe with a short meme: y Tho? Our ""club"" of 10 boys are, outside few expectations, the exact same people. They have nearly invisible personalities, all they have are things that are common between all of them for there aren\'t such things that would separate them from each others -- outside their outlooks. And even this isn\'t entirely true since there are even twins among them. As a whole, the cast is fake and empty to a point that I wonder if this is what feminists see when watching CGDCT or ecchi anime. The cast doesn\'t have much appeal to me. I couldn\'t find any way to care about any of them. They have nothing that would make relate to them, they offer no entertaining personality traits, their behavior is dull and mainly reminds me of cardboard. None of them have any interesting past stories or current stories. None of them even says anything mildly interesting at any point during the run. The more they talked the more I came to go meh over them. How awfully boring must ones life be to hang out with any of them? A question I found myself asking several times.Outside episode 16, the sports side is an absolute joke. Even tho I don\'t like running myself, I have seen series that focus on running and track&field and which I have liked. Kaze ga\'s take on this torture method is exactly as dull as the sports itself. Nothing stands out, nothing feels meaningful, there aren\'t even any fitting/atmospheric or agro songs used that could make these scenes better. Instead, same few songs are repeated over and over and none of them is very fitting. So often, there plays some supposedly emotional song whilst our cast members run and sweat, followed, for example, by a scene where they get scolded for being too slow. What the series is trying to deliver here never reached my end. And typically, these running scenes are very short and made in the exact same manner, only thing that differs is the aftermath. Watching the execution here feels like repeatedly hitting ones head in the wall with a force so light that you barely even feel the effect, but still know it is happening. There are even sports series centering around baseball and fighting sports which field work (AKA running) is more noteworthy than anything Kaze ga achieved. The best characters here are these one-dimensional \'evil\' buttholes who just come around to mock our sports team for being a disgrace towards track\'n field. Why? Because their phrases are truthful remarks. Especially towards the end, the melodrama Kaze ga mixes together with sports is nothing less than a disgrace towards all athletes.In terms of actual story, one of the driving motions here are our boys interest to girls.. Literally ""lets run for the are girls.. on the other side of the road."" I am not sure who the writer is trying to fool with this since they only introduce one slightly relevant female cast member and she is more obviously filler than any other character. Also, she falls under the trope ""every food she prepares turns poison"" because apparently it is funny when women can\'t cook. She is totally adorable regardless. Yet it feels so unnecessary to insert such things here yet not deal with them accordingly. The outcome is just idiotic. The events itself are rather formulaic. Male x male interactions in fujobait manner, bathing together naked, and running. Some pseudo-psychological things going on since, apparently, running (for our mc) is the same as running away from problems, and the main dude seems to have some. Even so, there is no clear reason for the series to exist, story-wise. It\'s clear from early on that the mc\'s ""insecurities"" are just bullshit used as an excuse to work as some sort of ongoing cliffhanger to make people interested in what type of ""mysterious"" reasons he has for being such an angsty loner. Other sides of the ""drama"" are practically sitcom-tier since the cast acts like a bunch of drama queens instead of there being any ""real"" drama going on. Sometimes randomly asspulled and beyond fake event occurs, such as one character suddenly losing a consciousness at the end of an episode just to create a cliffhanger worth of 3 pennies. To talk more about these cliffhangers, they are used to some extent and every time they match the definition of ""horse shit"". False tension and not much more.The production, outside the incredibly bland character models (their bodies look like spaghetti and have even weirder necks than people in Ballroom e (not exaggerating -- same studio, also) -- and worth-of-nothing sports scenes, is one more thing that is not making this thing any better. The naked men bathing -scenes seem to be the ones that have gone thru the most planning. Comedy moments are over-simplified to a point that it looks just cheap and it is practically the exact same execution every single time. Dude\'s doing 2 frame shaking when being cornered. Otherwise the series screams it is made by Production I.G with their modern standards (which have been going down and down rather consistently for years if someone hasn\'t noticed). The pacing is simply too slow during any part that is not related to running and too fast with anything that is. Obviously, because they wanted to save money when animating running masses. CGI is being used during track events and it\'s like 3fps when out zoomed. Often, people who run look like they are floating over the track rather than touching the ground with their feet. Looks so incredibly lame. Not that it couldn\'t be forgiven if there were some actually good things going on. Pros that out weighted the cons. To me, even the smallest of problems stood out for I couldn\'t achieve any level of immersion with the series, rather saw it as nothing but a soulless product.All the criticism aside, I did quite enjoy moments around Akane ""Prince"" Kashiwazaki, who is the polar opposite of everyone else. Seems to hate running and is in really bad shape. His running form is so awkward and wrong that I managed to laugh at it few times, mainly reminding me of zombie movements from Resident Evil games. Even his posture while standing is advanced scoliosis, so I guess kudos for creating a dude like him. Other thing I have to drop here is the ending of episode 19 which was simply hilarious. If only there had been other good things I could praise than the rare few. that every factor from story progression, seiyuu choices, male casting and slice of life-like approach yells out one thing loud and clear: homo undertones.

197,"['Sangatsu no Lion\'s first five minutes contain a scene I might characterise as one of the best in animation. A boy listlessly wakens, drinking out of necessity, dressing out of obligation, and leaving his sterile apartment out of confusion, an existence so fragile it could perish with the wind. He doesn\'t say anything. He doesn\'t tell people about his problems. He just moves on with his life.At first I did not understand why this scene had such an impact on me. I thought it could have been the beautiful music, or perhaps the captivating artwork so characteristic of Shaft. That wasn\'t it. What overwhelmed...me was how illustrative it was of human life.People often describe their favourite pieces of fiction with vague terms such as ""brilliant"" or ""life-changing"". Sangatsu no Lion is not life-changing, least not in the sense of it developing for me a different personality, or in creating new passions. What it did, rather, is give me the tools to better understand myself and, more importantly, why I am here. And that is the greatest answer of all.To say that Sangatsu no Lion is powerful would be an understatement. There are numerous moments, much like the opening scene, that do much with little. Most things are left implicit and unsaid. A simple, everyday conversation between family, about what their plans could be for the next day, or a brief conversation about one\'s quiet hometown can contain more weight and characterisation than a series might in its entire duration. Sangatsu no Lion is as well masterfully-produced, a technical triumph, Shaft\'s greatest accomplishment.Sangatsu no Lion is at its surface an anime about shogi, but at its core a coming-of-age story of overcoming depression. Rei, the series\' protagonist, is a deeply and inherently flawed being. He is timid - incapable of speaking his mind or getting his feelings across - and unhappy with his role in life. Many characters do not understand why he is this way, and indeed, for someone so gifted at shogi-- enough as to turn it into a career from a young age-- and blessed by such having such a kind family care for him, it is easy to be envious and to question why someone in his position could ever feel unsatisfied. He is still in his teens, after all, so it could merely be an irrational fit of teenage angst. And so they think, and so they patronise him.There is more to Rei than the people around him give credit for. He never had a real family, nor even a youth, hence why he goes to school in an aimless search of one. He has nothing he can relate to but shogi. Even shogi brings him pain, as his thirst for victory ends only with him driving the loser to disappointment and despair. He needs to feed on other people\'s happiness to give meaning to his own existence, as without shogi, he will have nothing.This isn\'t meant to instil feelings of pity in the viewer. Rei\'s problems, while significant and real, aren\'t much different from what everyone else in his world is dealing with. His eventual mentor, Shimada, struggles with a fear of disappointing others and with a chronic sickness that disrupts his ability to play shogi. Even Hinata, the carefree, younger-sister figure to Rei is dealing with issues of love and an anxiety of growing up. Rei\'s journey is not just about recognising and facing his own problems, but also in understanding that pain is a normal part of life, and something that everyone deals with. All one can do is to take it with stride.Rei\'s eventual breakdown is one of the story\'s most notable moments. I have read complaints of the scene being too dramatic, or that it took too long for Rei to get there. I feel that was the point. Simply being told ""no, you are wrong"" does not do anything to help fix a person\'s issues. Rei has already been told his entire life that he is wrong. It is through being kicked down, made a fool of, and, yes, breaking down completely that humans are able to grow the most. We are resilient creatures, and respond to failure with success. Rei is not meant to be entirely likeable to the viewer. He\'s just a dude and he has his limits, much like anyone else. He is meant to be human rather than an embodiment of all things cool and attractive, and I suppose it is this distinction that is bothersome to certain viewers.The scene where Shimada chats with Rei about Yamagata, his hometown, represents a lot of what makes the anime so special. The conversation is only 90 seconds long, and yet it encapsulates Rei\'s growth as a person. It culminates in his one simple quip back to Shimada, that even something dull is still ""something"". Rei has by this point become capable of standing his ground and arguing back, and of framing the world more positively. It is easy to not notice these things because Rei\'s evolution is not sudden or obvious. That is precisely what makes it great, and is why it feels so real. It is only in the small details do we notice change.Many aspects of Shaft\'s production are experimental in nature, and that definitely shows through in this case. While some of their other works, such as the Monogatari series, got a bit too focused on style rather than content (to the extent of being pompous or even pretentious, I would argue), the direction and artwork of Sangatsu no Lion is artful and stylish while still managing to keep genuine. The tenth episode\'s shogi match is one of the more prominent examples of this, where a thunderous orchestral piece plays as the two furiously and silently challenge one another. It doesn\'t require dialogue, as the visual and audio cues do more than enough to demonstrate who is winning and losing, and how much stress they are undergoing. There is even a scene that more closely resembles theatre, with jazzy beats playing while Smith slowly (very, very slowly) eats breakfast. Some may feel this is unnecessary, but I am of the opinion that it provided a wealth of character to someone who we really had not seen or understood much of by that point in the story.It\'s a bit remarkable just how reminiscent the anime is of life in Tokyo. I feel that those who have never been here are missing quite a bit, as its depiction does well to make the world the characters live in feel real and relateable. It was actually a bit surreal in my case, as Rei goes to train stations, bridges and other areas that I have personally been to, and visits Sendagi at one point in the series: the quiet little neighbourhood in which I live. He even wears the exact same black coat that I bought at a local Uniqlo some months ago. So, understandably, I think, the anime has been a fairly personal experience for me. It\'s nothing short of stunning how much effort Shaft has put into making the setting feel like a real place where real people live. It is not a portrayal of Tokyo - it is Tokyo.The music in Sangatsu no Lion is without doubt some of the best that has been in anime. Most of the more heavy-hitting tracks are used sparingly, often only in one specific scene for a specific purpose, and accomplish said purpose with power and with triumph. In some scenes, such as the Yamagata talk, the first time ""Sayonara Bystander"" began playing, or the end of the twelfth episode when Rei promises to Momo to win, the music was effective enough to make my eyes water a bit. That isn\'t a reaction I normally have towards music.One could argue that there is a bit too much comedy in the anime. And, certainly, if you are looking only for serious storytelling from start to finish, you may end up feeling somewhat alienated by the end. I might have preferred a bit less comedy, too, as the light-hearted scenes, while enjoyable (especially with how adorable Hinata is), are not quite as exciting as all the other pieces. But I can still appreciate its existence, as it would be disingenuous to remove it altogether and to pretend as if there are no happy moments in the characters\' lives. Seeing Rei grow to accept the Kawamoto sisters is quite heartwarming, too. They care about him, even if he may not always care about himself, and by the end, they help him to find more meaning in life than shogi.It\'s true that Sangatsu no Lion does not have much conclusion. Most of the problems the characters are dealing with are still an ongoing struggle by the end, and Rei is far from becoming a master of shogi as most anime protagonists typically would. Part of this can be attributed to logistical issues, such as a limited production budget and the fact that the manga is still ongoing. I don\'t think this creates an inherent flaw with the anime, however, as Sangatsu no Lion isn\'t really in need of an ending. There\'s no plot with a specific starting point and ending point-- it is rather a moment in time, a piece of Rei\'s life and those of the people around him. His depression persists, and he remains an imperfect and flawed person, even if he now has friends and family by his side. He\'s still searching. He\'s still running. Perhaps that will change by the end of the second season or the manga. Maybe it won\'t. And that would be completely fine. I don\'t believe there is anyone, even on their deathbed, who has ever been complete as a person. We start imperfect, and we end imperfect, gradually, yet surely, evolving, unchanging.With most reviews, I feel compelled to discuss the anime in a mechanical way. ""The animation was nice"", ""the characters were developed well"", ""the plot was inconsistent"". It is because most anime feel crafted, like a specimen of sorts to be examined. How is this piece? How is that piece? Sangatsu no Lion never felt that way for me. It\'s bigger. It feels more real. And so I can\'t help but write something more personal, too.Is Sangatsu no Lion better than Honey & Clover? Maybe. Is it the best anime of the past decade? Perhaps. More than that? Could be. It is difficult right now to answer with complete certainty these questions I have been posing myself. Time is the best judgement, I feel. But I can say, without question or hesitation, that Sangatsu no Lion is the only anime since Touch that has had such a profound and visceral impact on me. And Touch was the best anime I had ever seen.Sangatsu no Lion is a statement that unhappiness is OK. Being depressed, unsatisfied or stressed does not make you weak - it makes you human. And so I find it appropriate to close with a quote from Hinata:""So what do you say at a time like this?""""You say to do your best."" me was how illustrative it was of human life.People often describe their favourite pieces of fiction with vague terms such as ""brilliant"" or ""life-changing"". Sangatsu no Lion is not life-changing, least not in the sense of it developing for me a different personality, or in creating new passions. What it did, rather, is give me the tools to better understand myself and, more importantly, why I am here. And that is the greatest answer of all.To say that Sangatsu no Lion is powerful would be an understatement. There are numerous moments, much like the opening scene, that do much with little. Most things are left implicit and unsaid. A simple, everyday conversation between family, about what their plans could be for the next day, or a brief conversation about one\'s quiet hometown can contain more weight and characterisation than a series might in its entire duration. Sangatsu no Lion is as well masterfully-produced, a technical triumph, Shaft\'s greatest accomplishment.Sangatsu no Lion is at its surface an anime about shogi, but at its core a coming-of-age story of overcoming depression. Rei, the series\' protagonist, is a deeply and inherently flawed being. He is timid - incapable of speaking his mind or getting his feelings across - and unhappy with his role in life. Many characters do not understand why he is this way, and indeed, for someone so gifted at shogi-- enough as to turn it into a career from a young age-- and blessed by such having such a kind family care for him, it is easy to be envious and to question why someone in his position could ever feel unsatisfied. He is still in his teens, after all, so it could merely be an irrational fit of teenage angst. And so they think, and so they patronise him.There is more to Rei than the people around him give credit for. He never had a real family, nor even a youth, hence why he goes to school in an aimless search of one. He has nothing he can relate to but shogi. Even shogi brings him pain, as his thirst for victory ends only with him driving the loser to disappointment and despair. He needs to feed on other people\'s happiness to give meaning to his own existence, as without shogi, he will have nothing.This isn\'t meant to instil feelings of pity in the viewer. Rei\'s problems, while significant and real, aren\'t much different from what everyone else in his world is dealing with. His eventual mentor, Shimada, struggles with a fear of disappointing others and with a chronic sickness that disrupts his ability to play shogi. Even Hinata, the carefree, younger-sister figure to Rei is dealing with issues of love and an anxiety of growing up. Rei\'s journey is not just about recognising and facing his own problems, but also in understanding that pain is a normal part of life, and something that everyone deals with. All one can do is to take it with stride.Rei\'s eventual breakdown is one of the story\'s most notable moments. I have read complaints of the scene being too dramatic, or that it took too long for Rei to get there. I feel that was the point. Simply being told ""no, you are wrong"" does not do anything to help fix a person\'s issues. Rei has already been told his entire life that he is wrong. It is through being kicked down, made a fool of, and, yes, breaking down completely that humans are able to grow the most. We are resilient creatures, and respond to failure with success. Rei is not meant to be entirely likeable to the viewer. He\'s just a dude and he has his limits, much like anyone else. He is meant to be human rather than an embodiment of all things cool and attractive, and I suppose it is this distinction that is bothersome to certain viewers.The scene where Shimada chats with Rei about Yamagata, his hometown, represents a lot of what makes the anime so special. The conversation is only 90 seconds long, and yet it encapsulates Rei\'s growth as a person. It culminates in his one simple quip back to Shimada, that even something dull is still ""something"". Rei has by this point become capable of standing his ground and arguing back, and of framing the world more positively. It is easy to not notice these things because Rei\'s evolution is not sudden or obvious. That is precisely what makes it great, and is why it feels so real. It is only in the small details do we notice change.Many aspects of Shaft\'s production are experimental in nature, and that definitely shows through in this case. While some of their other works, such as the Monogatari series, got a bit too focused on style rather than content (to the extent of being pompous or even pretentious, I would argue), the direction and artwork of Sangatsu no Lion is artful and stylish while still managing to keep genuine. The tenth episode\'s shogi match is one of the more prominent examples of this, where a thunderous orchestral piece plays as the two furiously and silently challenge one another. It doesn\'t require dialogue, as the visual and audio cues do more than enough to demonstrate who is winning and losing, and how much stress they are undergoing. There is even a scene that more closely resembles theatre, with jazzy beats playing while Smith slowly (very, very slowly) eats breakfast. Some may feel this is unnecessary, but I am of the opinion that it provided a wealth of character to someone who we really had not seen or understood much of by that point in the story.It\'s a bit remarkable just how reminiscent the anime is of life in Tokyo. I feel that those who have never been here are missing quite a bit, as its depiction does well to make the world the characters live in feel real and relateable. It was actually a bit surreal in my case, as Rei goes to train stations, bridges and other areas that I have personally been to, and visits Sendagi at one point in the series: the quiet little neighbourhood in which I live. He even wears the exact same black coat that I bought at a local Uniqlo some months ago. So, understandably, I think, the anime has been a fairly personal experience for me. It\'s nothing short of stunning how much effort Shaft has put into making the setting feel like a real place where real people live. It is not a portrayal of Tokyo - it is Tokyo.The music in Sangatsu no Lion is without doubt some of the best that has been in anime. Most of the more heavy-hitting tracks are used sparingly, often only in one specific scene for a specific purpose, and accomplish said purpose with power and with triumph. In some scenes, such as the Yamagata talk, the first time ""Sayonara Bystander"" began playing, or the end of the twelfth episode when Rei promises to Momo to win, the music was effective enough to make my eyes water a bit. That isn\'t a reaction I normally have towards music.One could argue that there is a bit too much comedy in the anime. And, certainly, if you are looking only for serious storytelling from start to finish, you may end up feeling somewhat alienated by the end. I might have preferred a bit less comedy, too, as the light-hearted scenes, while enjoyable (especially with how adorable Hinata is), are not quite as exciting as all the other pieces. But I can still appreciate its existence, as it would be disingenuous to remove it altogether and to pretend as if there are no happy moments in the characters\' lives. Seeing Rei grow to accept the Kawamoto sisters is quite heartwarming, too. They care about him, even if he may not always care about himself, and by the end, they help him to find more meaning in life than shogi.It\'s true that Sangatsu no Lion does not have much conclusion. Most of the problems the characters are dealing with are still an ongoing struggle by the end, and Rei is far from becoming a master of shogi as most anime protagonists typically would. Part of this can be attributed to logistical issues, such as a limited production budget and the fact that the manga is still ongoing. I don\'t think this creates an inherent flaw with the anime, however, as Sangatsu no Lion isn\'t really in need of an ending. There\'s no plot with a specific starting point and ending point-- it is rather a moment in time, a piece of Rei\'s life and those of the people around him.

It's like a combination of figuring out life in the present and how to deal with your past at the same time. The story is more than just about shogi, it's more about the player. How he decides what pieces to use, what pieces to move, and try and overcome his next opponent/obstacle. It also applies to his life. He has his new family which currently guards him and...his past (pieces he lost) which keep coming back to attack him.9/10 Art:This is pretty self explanatory.

Only thing is, the main protagonist is in his own story and we (the audience) gets to see what they experience. From that experience, the main protagonist Rei tackles through obstacles in his life, building relationships, and growing as a person. Adapted by the manga of the same name, this is a show that really takes slice of life to a unique perspective.The creator of the series is Chica Umino. Some people may recognize her work such as Honey and Clover. As such, character designs represented in this...show may feel familiar. However, 3-gatsu no Lion stands out on its own as we are introduced to Rei Kiriyama, a young man known for his professional shogi talent. Rei may seem like a successful person at first glance but deep down, he suffers from many personal issues. The show explores those issues in ways that really makes us curious not just about his life but how society, relationships, and a career can influence a person.From the first few episodes, it’s clear that Rei has talent when it comes to shogi. People even label him as a prodigy with a unique gift. Yet, Rei feels isolated in society as his real parents no longer exists in his world. However, fortune does smile on him as he meets Akari, Momo, and Hina, three sisters with gentle hearts that welcomes him as their own family. I have to admit, those very first few episodes gave me a realistic impression of Rei’s character. There are those in our world where a prodigy can feel so alone. The expectations from their peers, coaches, and fans really put them on the edge when they deal with competition against rivals. For Rei, it seems even worse because of his unsociable personality and the fact that he has a strained relationship with his adoptive parents. On a professional level, his career hasn’t really bloomed in his adolescence years. Sound something similar? Once in a while, I’m sure we’ve heard similar stories in the news before too. Viewers coming into this show should really expect to see why Rei feels the way he views society and how he adapts to make his life better for himself.There are a lot of memorable moments in this show but perhaps one of the most influential is how Rei develops relationship with the people he meets. He’s not an outgoing person and most of the time, he seems to keep to himself. This is evidenced by the cynical thoughts and narratives he voices in his head. Often times or not, Rei has trust issues towards others because of his past. The show cleverly does a good job at storytelling as we see glimpses of his past in multi-chapter arcs. Rei’s personality is strongly influenced by his past that carries into the present. Fortunately, not everything is gloom and doom because Akari, Momo, and Hina brightens up Rei’s life. They are like the light of his dark tunnel and we see how they are able to give him affection and treat him like a real family. Their influence in the show changes Rei as he realizes that he can trust certain people. Rei also becomes more aware of how being together with people is better than being alone. That’s really what makes the storytelling and character of this show intriguing. We see the mistakes that Rei makes and life lessons he learns from. Rei’s confidence grows and he begins to develop meaningful relationship with others.Besides the Kawamoto sisters, the show also offers a colorful cast of other characters. One of the most noticeable is Kyoko, the daughter of Rei’s shogi teacher. Throughout the show, we learn the negative influence she has on him. The way this show expresses human emotions is most evident when Kyoko and Rei are in the same segments. To name a few, we got jealousy, hate, pity, among others. The way Kyoko taunts Rei can also get uncomforting to watch with her snarky attitude. What’s important though is to understand her role in the show. It’s not to just to make viewers despise her but also how Rei’s negative side is often bought out in the worst way because of her influence.That being said, the series also has a colorful cast of characters on the professional shogi scene. Rei’s self-proclaimed rival Nikadou brings in many of the comical moments between them. Kai Shimada, a man in the late 30s, also has influence on Rei as he learns quite a bit from him throughout the show. Masamune Goto, a man that has a very complicated relationship with Rei’s father stands out as a seemingly main obstacle in Rei’s life. From this series, Rei experiences different feelings when it comes to facing off against his rivals. The in-depth narratives accompanied by the inner thoughts from his shogi matches gives us even a better insight of Rei on the competitive scene.Now, I am not an expert on shogi but it’s fair to say that 3-gatsu no Lion knows its content when it comes to game perspective. While the show heavily involves psychology in those shogi matches, there’s also strategy that is narrated and presented. Colorful imagery is also added to make the matches look larger than life. Even though the show can feel very melancholic, it still has many moments where it can draw an audience’s laughter. The shogi matches, character relationships, and even non-human characters such as Kawamoto’s cats are just a few examples. In fact, the show seems to not forget any character throughout its recourse. Unfortunately, this 2-cour adaptation is simply not enough to cover everything. The manga is still ongoing and as faithful as this is adaptation is, there’s still plenty that are left uncovered. Perhaps another season can explore more options but in a span of 22 episodes, that’s not really happening.Adapted by studio Shaft, it’s pretty recognizable that 3-gatsu no Lion has its style. While Shaft’s iconic head tilts aren’t the main factors when it comes to art direction, it’s still very Akiyuki Shinobish. Inspirations are drawn from the flashy segments, dialogue usage, and background imagery are just a few to name. It feels experimental at times while demonstrating a superior feel of realism. One thing I was really impressed by is how almost every camera shot focused on Rei reveals his feelings. Character designs are influential by the author’s works and very faithfully adapted from the manga. That being said, Shaft’s art style may not be for everyone but for 3-gatsu no Lion, it hits the nail in the coffin.3-gatsu no Lion may not be a show about music but even its soundtrack works effectively thanks to the talent of its production staff. The melancholic atmosphere is well choreographed with cleverly timed OST. The theme songs very well fits with the show’s themes. In particularl, Bump of Chicken’s OP song “Answer” really bought out the psychology of the show. However, I think the biggest praise should be given to Rei’s voice actor, Kengo Kawanishi. The way he voices Rei makes him feel very believable especially during powerful moments. Voicing a character like Rei honestly feels difficult but he pulls it off without trouble. Finally, the show’s narratives remains strong throughout the show. Rather than relying on a narrator, it doe the storytelling itself with its characters.Watching 3-gatsu no Lion feels very different compared to some of the other shows I’ve watched in relating to exploring the growth of a prodigy. It not only has heavy characterization but the psychology of the show gives a unique feeling of its storytelling. The relationship building and realism really gives slice of life more than just every day adventures. Because for circumstances, every day is a challenge for Rei as he takes on himself. Whether it’s in life or on the competitive shogi scene, we can see how Rei develops as a person. I can’t safely recommend this show to everyone however. It’s definitely a show that isn’t for anyone’s taste and for manga readers, you may feel slightly disappointed by what’s still left out in the dark. Yet in the end, 3-gatsu no Lion is able to breathe life with its powerful direction and a story of compelling melodrama. show may feel familiar.

Overall rating [9.3/10]Story [10/10] - This is not your typical anime with exposition, climax, and resolution. It's like you are reading a book. And in this case, a very good one. The experiences come fast and furious for the main character, but the center of his universe is definitely 'shogi'. Also, you don't have to be a shogi expert to watch this although it has a 'game' tag on it. You will love how the story goes from silent to being dramatic, and from that to being so comedic. One time you will be crying,...and then the next thing you know you've been laughing along with the character's dialogues.Art [10/10] - I've watched a fair amount of anime, and I speak for everyone when I say that this kind of art style is very unique. The way how every scenes were drawn into perfection, and how it can easily change your feelings toward the story make this anime one of a kind.Sound [10/10] - The opening and ending songs were performed by BUMP OF CHICKEN.

It's not that rare nowadays for most of them to have a very tragic backstory.Enjoyment [8/10]"", 'Sangatsu no Lion is a completely pointless series, revolving around a few more than flat characters.I\'ll try to be as spoiler free as possible while pointing out what I think worked and what not.Story: 3In a few words, the story in Sangatsu no Lion is ""playing shogi"". For as much as I would like to say that it talks about a kid growing, fighting his fears, learning how to relate to other people, eventually understanding how to live one\'s life, all of this is just barely touched, focusing more on ""what if I moved the pawn in A7 instead of B2?"". In 22 episodes, absolutely...nothing relevant happens. No epiphanies, no events, no change, or if something happens, it\'s brushed off in an incredibly simplistic way.We could think that since this is a Slice of Life, it reflects reality as it is, and oh, it does it perfectly. But please don\'t tell me that your usual, every day, routine lives are worth a series. Mine, is not.Art: 6For as much as I love shaft, the style here is pretty different from their usual. The colour palette, the watercolour-ish style, the animation itself were really pleasant to watch, as they give a warm vibe when it\'s needed, but doesn\'t work so well in the more ""cold"" scenes. Also, the classic shaft antics recur here as well, and maybe, they weren\'t so needed. What really bothers me here is the character design. From the beginning to the end of the series, the characters lose more and more punchiness and details, starting from a very specific character design (those mouths, really?) ending with a generic character from any other series of the last decade.Sound: 5Not much to say hereOTs and EDs are not so bad, but also not memorable. I finished the series half an hour ago and I already forgot what they sound like. Same goes for the background sounds and music. About the voices, the cast is galactic, it worked pretty well.Characters: 3Let\'s say you try to give an honest vote to your completely normal neighbour, or the guy that used to sit on the left corner in your classroom. That would be pretty hard, I imagine. The same goes here. The characters are completely normal people, but instead of having those many hues a normal person would have, they are just parodies of their ""IRL"" counterparts.The MC is the usual ""kind of problematic"" character. Introvert, social issues, no friends, focused only on shogi. You keep watching him doing nothing, saying a lot of ""I will whatever"", then going back doing nothing. Just stupidly thinking about shogi. So much to forget to drink for days! Can you imagine that?The female cast is the ""obliviously-incredibly-good-and-sweet-girl-that-oh-so-love-to-help-you-for-whatever-reason-and-obviously-loves-sweets"". As too often, the women in Sangatsu are put in the kitchen or related domestic areas, and those are the only moments in which you see them. Since it\'s a shogi anime, you could think there are also female shogi players, but no, the only one that you can see doesn\'t play anymore.Is the rest of the cast worth mentioning? the fat but passionate kiddo, the cold and invincible player, the mentor, the blonde with weird haircut guy?Enjoyment 3/ Overall 4I think I said everything I had to, with very bad grammar and vocabulary, though, but since this anime has been so hyped up, I could not keep it in.Sangatsu no Lion fails on every front. It fails in narrating a story, even a slice of life story, introducing elements that will be lost in the next scene, breaking tragedy or tension with out of place comedy, but still failing with both of them. It fails with its characters, with too good or too bad people that could exist in other genres, or using cliched characters that, as usual, follow the flow with no question asked. It also fails with the art, lowering the quality episode after episode.So, there are a lot of way better anime out there. Go see them. nothing relevant happens. No epiphanies, no events, no change, or if something happens, it\'s brushed off in an incredibly simplistic way.We could think that since this is a Slice of Life, it reflects reality as it is, and oh, it does it perfectly. But please don\'t tell me that your usual, every day, routine lives are worth a series. Mine, is not.Art: 6For as much as I love shaft, the style here is pretty different from their usual. The colour palette, the watercolour-ish style, the animation itself were really pleasant to watch, as they give a warm vibe when it\'s needed, but doesn\'t work so well in the more ""cold"" scenes. Also, the classic shaft antics recur here as well, and maybe, they weren\'t so needed. What really bothers me here is the character design. From the beginning to the end of the series, the characters lose more and more punchiness and details, starting from a very specific character design (those mouths, really?) ending with a generic character from any other series of the last decade.Sound: 5Not much to say hereOTs and EDs are not so bad, but also not memorable. I finished the series half an hour ago and I already forgot what they sound like. Same goes for the background sounds and music. About the voices, the cast is galactic, it worked pretty well.Characters: 3Let\'s say you try to give an honest vote to your completely normal neighbour, or the guy that used to sit on the left corner in your classroom.

It's animated by Shaft, who are known for extreme narrative and story abnormalities. Now that may sound bad, but the story so far has been directed beautifully. The way the story dives into the sadness of our MC's past really tugs on the heartstrings, but at the same time his current life is filled with happy moments that are heartwarming. The mix of drama and slice of life can get confusing or even annoying but I think that's just what makes this show really good.What is important to...note is that while having a main character such as Rei Kiriyama, a tragic backstory is nothing original. One might find that cliche or distasteful; however the mystery of his past as well as the growth of Rei as a person is what makes you feel the emotion the director is trying to impose.You don't have to like or know anything about shogi to enjoy this anime. And trust me, there is more to this show than just shogi. Rei's everyday life is incorporated with happy slice of life scenes featuring the Kawamoto sisters (Akari, Hinata, and Momo). They help Rei understand the beauty behind life, and not just the struggles of it. Besides the story, the art is outrageous and surreal, but not realistic. Don't let that throw you off, because it still captures the moments of emotion in detail. The OP and ED are sung by BUMP OF CHICKEN (who are a very good band), and both songs are aesthetically pleasing and catchy. The characters and atmosphere make this show enjoyable as well and make you feel a part of the story. The OST helps with this, as it's vivid and picturesque.Overall, give this anime a chance. You might find something you'll enjoy a lot.

And now that they\'ve made a name for themselves (and the fact that they\'re all out of source material on the monogatari series), they have started to calm down. Compared to last year\'s Owarimonogatari (and the subsequent Kizumonogatari movies this year), they have a Slice of Life entry this fall season by the name of San-gatsu no Lion (or March comes in like a Lion). Based on a well received ongoing manga, the story revolves around Kiriyama Rei, a...high schooler and a pro shogi player, living an independent life in a rather empty part of town. Having lived through a mountain of trouble as a child and not-so-good experiences at his foster family, the repressed emotions and lack of ""love"" (if you will) has made him depressed and lonely inside. The only thing he has left is his career as a shogi player, which, sadly, started with a lie. So, a life (and mental sanity maybe?) built on such a feeble foundation can only last so long. And so it all starts to crumble and he starts going into a downward spiral.But fear not, all is not lost yet. Enter the three Kawamoto sisters. Having gone through some rough times themselves, they had one another to lean on, and so they live their modest lives full of happiness and laughter with the occasional sad reminiscing. And thankfully, they drag our protagonist into it, and it acts as a sliver of hope in his life. His interactions with them and the subtle changes they cause in his personality seem to be the main focus of the show.Now, there are a few things to watch out for, if you\'re thinking of picking this up.Number one is the drama, the kind of drama where there are lots of tragic flashbacks and broken, damaged characters. If you find characters wallowing in depression appalling, this might not be your cup of tea. Though I would say that the creators have put a lot of effort in Rei\'s backstory as it feels ""legit"" and in-sync with his character.Second, is the game of Shogi. They say shogi is like chess, except that it\'s not (well it is, in essence, a strategy game). Compared to the 16 pieces per player in Chess, Shogi has 20 pieces; there is no queen, and two new pieces - silver general and gold general are in play. Even the board is different (its a 9x9 instead of an 8x8). Point is, if you don\'t know shogi, parts of the show involving it - like the surprised look on players when the opponent makes an interesting move (a shot of the board with all the pieces, a move, and cut to character\'s face), or analogies/metaphors relating to our main characters life, will probably make little to no sense (or won\'t have the desired effect).Number three is Shaft. Now, I already said that they\'re trying to calm down, and they are, I mean, 5 episodes without a head tilt (Shinbo must be screaming in frustration, good thing Kenjirou is in charge), but, it\'s still Shaft. And I\'ve seen some people complain about the artstyle. Thankfully, it all isn\'t as erratic as the monogatari series and I am fine with it. Heck I love how they keep the contrast when switching perspectives from the depressed MC to the cheerful sisters (love the color palette too, and the opening).Conclusion. I like where this is going. I like that the main character is ""damaged"" damaged and not just damaged for plot\'s sake, his backstory really gets me. And I am interested in how far down he is going to fall before he gets over his past or if the past is going to come back to haunt him, either way, he will face it and that\'s what I\'m looking forward to.

But if they do, I\'ll update this.', 'SHAFT previously installed a pretentious series that suffers from a massive diagnosis of what I like to call dialogue schizophrenia, making a guy with ahoge hair look cool while he continually sexually assaults lolis; it reined in unlimited amounts of money, yatta yatta (muting the preface point with that because this studio is the bane of my existence).Still riding on the Bakemonogatari cash cow, I\'m sure that they realized that adapting one of Chika Umeno\'s works (the mangka behind Honey & Clover), along with adding the overzealous, overly angular, dialogue heavy monologuing with a sexually ambiguous, teenage misfit boy that this would be a self-defining...hit among narcissistic, Tumblr normies. I\'m 100% sure that they weren\'t blind to their potential viewers.I mean, they surely didn\'t know that the internet would fill Reddit forums with social justice powered, too deep for you conversations and people would GIFing the overly artsy and talkative moments, right? Let me clarify this for those you who didn\'t know, just because something is pretentious and artsy DOES NOT mean that it has any substance! The package is often different than the content. Just imagine if A-1 had directed this instead of SHAFT.I thought it was high-budget trash, quite frankly. If you want to see tons of money put into in-your-face conveyances of depression while watching a rather privileged orphan whine to himself in exaggerated monologues while he’s allegorically drowning, than this is the series for you! This show is the primary example of what we you would call ""victim culture,"" which I absolutely hate about modern day society.I say privileged, because the unrealistic degree of how nice people are to him is uncanny. I understand people being nice to someone because their mother, father, and little sister died. And somehow, to make it more dramatic, they show Rei, the main character, looking at their corpses in the morgue? Who lets a child look at their family\'s bodies like that?But, back to my point about the weird way every single character bends over backwards to make Rei happy, no seriously. EVERY time Rei is depressed: his teacher, a family that takes him in like their own, and a rich kid that he beat in shogi either talk about how great he is, or give him back pats.I\'ve seen this before, I mean MC privilege is a dilemma prevalent in anime. It frustrated me, because it was like a self-insert fan-fiction or like Tommy Wiseau from The Room with side characters that I like to call “two-dimensional-encouragement-puppets.” But it frustrated me more, on top of everything, that main character still angsts dramatically with internal monologues. Many people on the interwebs even find this little shit ""relatable"" or ""likable"". One of his angsts were that his adoptive father loved him more than his two ACTUAL kids (***MC privilege***), so his step-sister was violent and made, what seems like consensual, sexual advances at him.I know that realistic teenagers like to wallow in their own sadness, and feel alone and alienated, but is this something that should praised? No. This is why teenagers are often made fun of. The main character is such a genius at shogi that it is stated in the show that he makes more than his HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER. What does he have to complain about?He has:•  A professional shogi career.• Unanimous accolades from everyone, except his bipolar step-sister.• A family who unconditionally loves him and takes care of him, even though he\'s not related to them by blood.•  Friends and a school teacher that go out of their way to cheer him up.As someone who was adopted, I would have killed to have my life laid out so cleanly in front of me. Where are these all of these allusions to suicide and self-hate even coming from? People complained about the melodrama in Your Lie in April, but at least there was a character that was dying from a disease, that, you know, had a reason to angst or freak out.The banality of this series is astounding, Rei loses a shogi match and doesn\'t eat for days and more allegorical drowning. I get that he\'s a child genius, bordering on Asperger\'s, perhaps? Who knows? The series doesn\'t really clarify what the hell is wrong with him. It got better toward the end of the series, because it focuses on other characters like Kai Shimada (he has Kaiki Deishuu\'s voice actor) that made it bearable.This anime could be categorized along with the Monogatari with how absurd it is. I mean, there\'s angst, then talking cats, depression metaphor then cute girls making food and talking about cute stuff. SHAFT treats you like you\'re some kind of intellectual when they go into the 3deep5me fucking dialogues ー that the main character has with himself. He\'s like one of those goths that writes poetry by candlelight.Overall, the visuals are pretty and music can be enjoyable at times, except when they insert precocious French music in episodes for no real reason. This series is what it would look like if a hack art student had gallons of money to dump into a project like SHAFT, who not-so-secretly embodies the spirit of an avant-garde student that lives in Calabasas, CA.I give it a 2/10, though barely that. I nearly dropped this garbage because of how silly and immature it was. I felt like putting my head into a cheese grinder after every episode.

I personally wouldn't made it so far without your helpful and constructive feedback that you have given me over the years.Naturally I decided to do something special to make this occasion and So I decided up a anime that I truly loved and that anime in question is 3 Gatsu no Lion or March Comes in like a Lion in English. First aired in 2016 the series...has gained a strong following over the years for it's strong characterisation, masterfully handling of serious topics and fantastic art-style.I previously watched the series when it was airing and I loved it. When Aniplex announced and released the English dub for season 2 I decided to re-watch the series in it's dubbed form and I love it even more to a point where I ultimately decided to write a review for both seasons. It was that amazing. More about the Aniplex's Dub later but first let's talk about the plot and characters and why I adored it so much.The story follows a shogi prodigy named Rei who lives by himself. Despite living along Rei is far from a stable individual as suffering from numerous issues such as social anxiety, depression and loneliness that prevents him from connect to anyone due to his tragic past.He soon the Kawamoto family a trio of sisters and their grandfather who run a traditional Japanese pastry shop. They too have dealt with pain and loss. Now Rei must learn to socialise with other people and understate his triumphs and failures as human being in order to defeat his social anxiety and depression.Saying that the story of March comes in like a lion is outstanding wouldn't give this series any justice. This is easily the best put together anime I've ever seen from this decade.Where do I honestly begin maybe with the first episode. This is easily the best first episode I've ever seen in anime because not only it does an outstanding job at establishing Rei as a character by diving in social anxiety mindset. The first episode also does a fantastic job at establishing it's own tone to the viewers. The first 10 minutes of episode 1 has a melancholic feels that showcases the darker side of the series while the most of the second half of the series shows the more lighter side of the series where everything is all happy and bubbly. Normally this tonal combination would totally back fire but it didn't because March Comes in like a Lion understands tonal shifts.Out of the anime I've seen March Comes in like a Lion is one of few series that is able to hand it's tonal shifts.The biggest problem I had with Your Lie in April outside of the hamfisted executed themes and monologues was the tonal shifts that series had the worst tonal shifts I've seen in my life because not that series were executed incredibly poorly as it pop out of nowhere (mostly thanks to Tsubaki) but it actually did more harm to an already problematic series. Episode 1 of that series was prime example of that issue.March Comes in like a Lion doesn't do any of that. It know's how it's dark and light tone well and it's know how to switch between theses two without feeling awkward or out of place. The tonal balance of March Comes in like a lion helps the comedy and drama flow better and speaking of drama let's talk about it.March Comes in Like a Lion is heart a drama. From the first minute of episode 1 season 1 to the last minute of episode 22 of season 2 we see the well crafted drama play out as it greatly affects every single character in the show.The drama also allows us to dive into the characters motivations and ideals for various characters and shows for a tremendous job of it. This is main reason why March Comes in Like a Lion is not a shogi sports anime. Sure the series has a lot shogi matches to a point where they were frequent tournaments that are filled with competitors who want to win however the show completely destroys the generic I want to be the shogi player like no one ever was as the show does a brilliant job at exploring the competitors true motivations of winning.Rei is a competitive shogi player that has to win various tournaments if want to support himself in life. He's not doing it for recognition, he's not doing it to be the best shogi player in the world he's doing it as a career to support himself, or he will be homeless.That not all March Comes in like a lion has to offer. The series is also a beautiful coming of age tale. In season 1 we see Rei as a depressed anti-social individual who is trying to live his life as a professional shogi player. However, thanks to Akari and the Kawamoto he starts to open up to people more to a point where he starts to help people with their problems in season 2 which I will talk about in a bit.When the show is not being a heavy character drama show becomes an engaging and grounded that is filled with fascinating character chemistry and interactions that only strengths the already strong characterisation of the series.Season one of March Comes in like a Lion is a masterpiece on its own right that can win various anime awards inducing anime of the year. Season two on the other hand takes the already masterful season 1 and takes it to another level. The majority of Season two is focused on the topic of bullying and how bullying can affect others.Needless to say, this topic was masterfully executed thanks to not only having some of the best writing to ever exist in this medium but it's also the subject with respect and care. Watching this bullying arc is like watching an actual human being getting bulled in front of your eyes. It was portrayed beautifully thanks to the brilliant direction and writing.Season 2 of March Comes in like a Lion is without the best anime squeal I have seen from this medium as it took everything that was brilliant in season one and expended to new heights. My praise of season two doesn't end there. The rest of the arcs in season two were also fantastic.They may not be as emotional compared to the bully arc but they are still strong arcs in the own rights. My favourite arc of season 2 not counting the bully arc is the Old Gen vs New Gen Shogi championship arc aka Sakutarou vs Shimada.Despite being the only arc of the series that focusing primarily on it's supporting characters which was a nice change of pace for the series it is a very a fantastic written arc that communicate the theme and topics of sacrifice, retirement, generation, and passing to torch.The visual imagery also enhances the mood and atmosphere of the match as this is not just an another typical championship shogi match. It is a match that would change two individuals as people especially on Sakutarou's end who despite surviving as a shogi kishou all those years had to see his peers die over the years just to get to that spot that he's currently at.March Comes in like a lion is not a just story it is a tale of ambition, passion, love and emotion that highlights the best and worst aspects of life in a more grounded way and for that reason alone as many others things I said before March Comes in like a lion is one of the best stories I've ever encountered in any medium.The characters in March Comes Like a Lion can be best described as real human beings.At first glance Rei may appear to be another typical self insert tragic character that you have seen before however the series immediately throws that exception out the window. From Rei's emotional out bursts, unpredictable thinking to trying his very best to improve his social life towards others Rei is the embodiment of a flawed who's trying to improve his life before the world crashed down on him.His character development over the course of the series is historically amazing as he goes from an anti-social lone wolf who just wanted to play shogi just, so he can live to a more social and friendly person. Sure he still plays shogi just so he can live but thanks to character development we Rei go out of his way to help people in need. The best example of this is with the bully arc in season 2. Rei could have easily ignored Hinata's bullying issues by just ignoring them and continue playing he's shogi matches just, so he can live. Rei fortunately not only helps Hinata with her bullying problems he a sacrifice a decent amount of shogi time he's only source of income.Yes, it does hurt having a reduced income just to help a friend but Hinata and her family helped him defeat the darkness of depression in season 1 and that was a good trade off.This is my favourite aspect of March Comes in Like a Lion.Character development that is left intact across seasons.I have seen many anime from this decade where character development were not left intact across seasons/ story arcs. Certain shows will either repeat character arcs due the authors using a wonderful plot device that is called amnesia or even worst characters contradicting their development after they were developed in previous seasons/story arcs.March Comes in like a Lion doesn't do any of that. It perfectly develops its characters and that development stay intact across seasons allowing for more character development in future arcs.A perfect example of intact character development is shown with the second protagonist of the series Hinata.Hinata is the second of the three sister's of the Kawamoto family.In season 1 she's assisted Akari overcome Rei's depression and social anxiety in season 1. She becomes the primary protagonist in season 2 with the Bully and graduation middle school arcs and man she was a beautifully written character. The way she developed over the course of the bully arc was not only splendid site on to see visual storytelling perspective but it so relatable to the eye.Despite being the victim of bullying she never gave her strong will to the bullies as she is reminded determined to shut down the bullies even it may hurt her mentally in the process.Add up her bubbly and determined and you got yourself a wonderfully crafted character that highlights the best and worst of life from a child's perspective.Finally we have the final main character of the series Akari.Akari is a fantastic character if I ever saw one. Akari is the guardian angel for because it wasn't for her then Rei still be on path of darkness and social anxiety. She was the only one that fully broke Rei dark shell. Yes Hinata and Momo assisted Akari into breaking Rei dark shell but Akari not only drag Rei out of he's dark shell into the light but she also only character that understood him of what he was coming from.Just like a person taking a orphan homeless kid into they home who has been mentally and physically damaged from they former orphanage. That's not all to Akari as character. In season 2 bully Arc we the viewer start to see signs of Akari being a broken individual.Despite being the mother substitute for Hinata and Momo she has faces has own struggles that affaced her as a person. In episode 5 Someji made a strong statement of Hinata's bullying situation which he said ''There is nothing wrong of helping a friend in need''. That statement affected her as mother figure because compare to him she doesn't have the strong will to deal with theses things due to pressure.As the arc progressed Akira starts trying to be a strong mother figure who doesn't let pressure talk over her mentally.Her character development in the bully arc is showcased at the climax of the bully arc with Taiga's mum. The way she conflict to her showcases how much she has grown as a person On top of her incredible character development across the season's she's a very nice and caring person who tries her hardest to people in need hand that's the reason why she's my second favourite character in the series.The supporting characters are just as great and complex as the main characters. They all that have they quirks and personal struggles that plays off with the show core themes. Some personal favourite characters include Shimada, Harunobu, Touji and Takashi.Overall the characters in March Comes in like a Lion are just as fantastic as the plot.Studio Shaft is known to have fantastic production values that add more detail and flare in they and March Comes in Like a Lion is no different. The artistic direction and the use of sharp/soft colour palette really brought the world of March Comes in Like a Lion to life.This is only enhanced with the gorgeous animation that is filled with emotion and atmosphere. Naturally this is a shaft production so you can expect their signature pops of colour and head tilts. It may be random but unlike all other shows from Studio Shaft they don't abuse it all that much. Add this up the show's fantastic visuals storytelling that only strengths the show core themes of depression, emotion, bullying and sacrifice and you got yourself a beautiful series that is style and substance. Great job Shaft.March Comes in Like A Lion visual presentation is only made better by the wonderfully composed soundtrack done by the very talented Yukari Hashimoto.Melancholic and soft tracks perfectly set the mood and tone of the series. The emotional tracks that played in the series only strengthen the narrative and presentations as when there is an emotional moment the tracks rises up just to amply the emotional moments in the series.This is thanks to the March Comes in Like Lion fantastic sound direction. It knows when to play various tracks at the right moments and it knows how to fade in and fade out the tracks at any given time.All the opening and ending themes were incredible as not only the songs are great it has a lot of symbolism that accurately captures the show's themes.When I heard, that Aniplex Of America was going to dub both seasons of March Comes in Like A Lion I was very excited how the show was going to fare in it's a dub. Needless to say, the dub of March Comes in Like a Lion didn't disappoint me one as this is one the best dub I heard for Aniplex it also, in my opinion, surpasses the already amazing original Japanese audio.Despite many of the English Actors not having previous roles, they managed to bring out A game as every single dub actor did a tremendous job with the roles that they were given. The best performances in the dub were the rising stars Kayli Mills as Hinata and Khoi Dao as Rei. Overall if you are looking for a great dub that is on par with the original Japanese audio I strongly recommended the dub.March Comes in Like a Lion is a series that impacted me of not only how I view anime as a medium but it also impacted me as a human being. It is a series that soul-crushing broke my heart but the same rebuild it with it's wonderful characters that represent the highs and lows of humanity and life. The beautifully crafted story arcs that have a purpose, masterfully written characters that were well written, the fantastic production values that was only made better with the beautiful melancholic soundtrack.March Comes in Like a Lion is not just an anime it's a masterfully created human and thematic study that would make any cry and because of these reasons March Comes in Like a Lion is not only the best anime I have seen from this decade but it's also one of the favourite things ever.Yes, there were others anime from this decade that I called masterpieces in the past however they all palls in comparison to the beautiful piece that is March Comes in Like Lion which is a true masterpiece of an anime that changed my life forever.Thank you Studio Shaft for making this masterpiece a reality. has gained a strong following over the years for it's strong characterisation, masterfully handling of serious topics and fantastic art-style.I previously watched the series when it was airing and I loved it. When Aniplex announced and released the English dub for season 2 I decided to re-watch the series in it's dubbed form and I love it even more to a point where I ultimately decided to write a review for both seasons. It was that amazing. More about the Aniplex's Dub later but first let's talk about the plot and characters and why I adored it so much.The story follows a shogi prodigy named Rei who lives by himself. Despite living along Rei is far from a stable individual as suffering from numerous issues such as social anxiety, depression and loneliness that prevents him from connect to anyone due to his tragic past.He soon the Kawamoto family a trio of sisters and their grandfather who run a traditional Japanese pastry shop. They too have dealt with pain and loss. Now Rei must learn to socialise with other people and understate his triumphs and failures as human being in order to defeat his social anxiety and depression.Saying that the story of March comes in like a lion is outstanding wouldn't give this series any justice. This is easily the best put together anime I've ever seen from this decade.Where do I honestly begin maybe with the first episode. This is easily the best first episode I've ever seen in anime because not only it does an outstanding job at establishing Rei as a character by diving in social anxiety mindset. The first episode also does a fantastic job at establishing it's own tone to the viewers. The first 10 minutes of episode 1 has a melancholic feels that showcases the darker side of the series while the most of the second half of the series shows the more lighter side of the series where everything is all happy and bubbly. Normally this tonal combination would totally back fire but it didn't because March Comes in like a Lion understands tonal shifts.Out of the anime I've seen March Comes in like a Lion is one of few series that is able to hand it's tonal shifts.The biggest problem I had with Your Lie in April outside of the hamfisted executed themes and monologues was the tonal shifts that series had the worst tonal shifts I've seen in my life because not that series were executed incredibly poorly as it pop out of nowhere (mostly thanks to Tsubaki) but it actually did more harm to an already problematic series. Episode 1 of that series was prime example of that issue.March Comes in like a Lion doesn't do any of that. It know's how it's dark and light tone well and it's know how to switch between theses two without feeling awkward or out of place. The tonal balance of March Comes in like a lion helps the comedy and drama flow better and speaking of drama let's talk about it.March Comes in Like a Lion is heart a drama. From the first minute of episode 1 season 1 to the last minute of episode 22 of season 2 we see the well crafted drama play out as it greatly affects every single character in the show.The drama also allows us to dive into the characters motivations and ideals for various characters and shows for a tremendous job of it. This is main reason why March Comes in Like a Lion is not a shogi sports anime. Sure the series has a lot shogi matches to a point where they were frequent tournaments that are filled with competitors who want to win however the show completely destroys the generic I want to be the shogi player like no one ever was as the show does a brilliant job at exploring the competitors true motivations of winning.Rei is a competitive shogi player that has to win various tournaments if want to support himself in life. He's not doing it for recognition, he's not doing it to be the best shogi player in the world he's doing it as a career to support himself, or he will be homeless.That not all March Comes in like a lion has to offer. The series is also a beautiful coming of age tale. In season 1 we see Rei as a depressed anti-social individual who is trying to live his life as a professional shogi player. However, thanks to Akari and the Kawamoto he starts to open up to people more to a point where he starts to help people with their problems in season 2 which I will talk about in a bit.When the show is not being a heavy character drama show becomes an engaging and grounded that is filled with fascinating character chemistry and interactions that only strengths the already strong characterisation of the series.Season one of March Comes in like a Lion is a masterpiece on its own right that can win various anime awards inducing anime of the year. Season two on the other hand takes the already masterful season 1 and takes it to another level. The majority of Season two is focused on the topic of bullying and how bullying can affect others.Needless to say, this topic was masterfully executed thanks to not only having some of the best writing to ever exist in this medium but it's also the subject with respect and care. Watching this bullying arc is like watching an actual human being getting bulled in front of your eyes. It was portrayed beautifully thanks to the brilliant direction and writing.Season 2 of March Comes in like a Lion is without the best anime squeal I have seen from this medium as it took everything that was brilliant in season one and expended to new heights. My praise of season two doesn't end there. The rest of the arcs in season two were also fantastic.They may not be as emotional compared to the bully arc but they are still strong arcs in the own rights. My favourite arc of season 2 not counting the bully arc is the Old Gen vs New Gen Shogi championship arc aka Sakutarou vs Shimada.Despite being the only arc of the series that focusing primarily on it's supporting characters which was a nice change of pace for the series it is a very a fantastic written arc that communicate the theme and topics of sacrifice, retirement, generation, and passing to torch.The visual imagery also enhances the mood and atmosphere of the match as this is not just an another typical championship shogi match. It is a match that would change two individuals as people especially on Sakutarou's end who despite surviving as a shogi kishou all those years had to see his peers die over the years just to get to that spot that he's currently at.March Comes in like a lion is not a just story it is a tale of ambition, passion, love and emotion that highlights the best and worst aspects of life in a more grounded way and for that reason alone as many others things I said before March Comes in like a lion is one of the best stories I've ever encountered in any medium.The characters in March Comes Like a Lion can be best described as real human beings.At first glance Rei may appear to be another typical self insert tragic character that you have seen before however the series immediately throws that exception out the window. From Rei's emotional out bursts, unpredictable thinking to trying his very best to improve his social life towards others Rei is the embodiment of a flawed who's trying to improve his life before the world crashed down on him.His character development over the course of the series is historically amazing as he goes from an anti-social lone wolf who just wanted to play shogi just, so he can live to a more social and friendly person. Sure he still plays shogi just so he can live but thanks to character development we Rei go out of his way to help people in need. The best example of this is with the bully arc in season 2. Rei could have easily ignored Hinata's bullying issues by just ignoring them and continue playing he's shogi matches just, so he can live. Rei fortunately not only helps Hinata with her bullying problems he a sacrifice a decent amount of shogi time he's only source of income.Yes, it does hurt having a reduced income just to help a friend but Hinata and her family helped him defeat the darkness of depression in season 1 and that was a good trade off.This is my favourite aspect of March Comes in Like a Lion.Character development that is left intact across seasons.I have seen many anime from this decade where character development were not left intact across seasons/ story arcs. Certain shows will either repeat character arcs due the authors using a wonderful plot device that is called amnesia or even worst characters contradicting their development after they were developed in previous seasons/story arcs.March Comes in like a Lion doesn't do any of that. It perfectly develops its characters and that development stay intact across seasons allowing for more character development in future arcs.A perfect example of intact character development is shown with the second protagonist of the series Hinata.Hinata is the second of the three sister's of the Kawamoto family.In season 1 she's assisted Akari overcome Rei's depression and social anxiety in season 1. She becomes the primary protagonist in season 2 with the Bully and graduation middle school arcs and man she was a beautifully written character.

Yes Hinata and Momo assisted Akari into breaking Rei dark shell but Akari not only drag Rei out of he's dark shell into the light but she also only character that understood him of what he was coming from.Just like a person taking a orphan homeless kid into they home who has been mentally and physically damaged from they former orphanage. That's not all to Akari as character. In season 2 bully Arc we the viewer start to see signs of Akari being a broken individual.Despite being the mother substitute for Hinata and Momo she has faces has own struggles that affaced her as a person.

The idea of shogi and the struggles you could face mentally was a new concept to me. However, as the show continued, it became quite boring and repetitive, and that very quickly. Dialogues between the characters were becoming bland and it seemed like the creators focused on the gameplay dialogues ""move pawn to etc."", rather than the dialogues in crucial moments....I feel like the lack of enthusiasm shown really made the show seem repetitive. A lot more could have been done with 22 episodes. It had such a good start but it didn\'t reach my expectations.Art: 7 (Good)At first glance, I was not a fan. But as I continued watching, I started really liking it. The animation is really beautiful and unique. Kudos to the animators!Sound: 6 (Fair)Background music could have been better.Characters: 2 (Dreadful)This is my biggest issue. Characters. I\'ll just say that there was no character development from any character. Rei Kiriyama might have had some, but it\'s not significant. And he\'s the main character. The show introduced bland, boring characters who were not likeable at all. I also felt like there were a lot of \'filler\' characters, as in characters that were introduced for the sake of having more characters. Why introduce them when they won\'t be interesting or get any development? Especially the main character and the three sisters. More could have been done with these characters.Enjoyment: 3Throughout the whole show, no episode or part seemed engaging or \'ooh, I think I should concentrate on this part\'. I took my time with this series.Overall: 3This anime was so disappointing. It had the potential to be a masterpiece but the pace and lack of development stopped it from being so. The flimsy plot and poor set of characters brought this show to a lower level. This is why I can\'t rate \'3-gatsu no Lion\' more than a 3/10.

Hence I was excited to watch this series. However after finishing all 22 episodes, I was left disappointed and wondered what did this anime have that deserved the high scores it obtained?Unlike run with the wind, whereby they made running interesting, this anime made shogi look difficult and boring to someone who does not know about the game. The rules and how the...game is played is never really explained other than a brief introductory in the form of using cats to make it look cute. The creators of the anime seems to be talking down to the audience as they literally have to portray the rules of shogi being explained to kids.I felt that they could have spent more time in explaining the rules and gameplaymore in detail like having a new Shogi member whom just join the association being shown the ropes, instead of that few minutes of explaining to the two kid sisters on how pieces move. The reason is because we are being informed a lot of time throughout the anime, of technical jargons such as 7c rook which without knowledge of the game or proper introduction, the viewers like myself are left wondering what they all meanShogi aside, I also do not understand a few things about the anime. Why is there a need for the mc to attend school? It is shown a lot of times that he would rather be somewhere else like attending a Shogi tournament than be in class. Is it to show his human side like him wanting to have a normal teenager life? If that is the reason, it seems counterproductive as it shows him having disdain towards his fellow students. Instead of reaching out to them, he eats by himself during lunch. They did show him attempting to reach out to his classmates but in the end he falls short of actually making contact with them but shows what he perceives as will happen in his mind and decides not to approach them instead.If this is how the mc is going to behave, why bother showing us his pass childhood as what is happening now is the same as when he was young. Is it to make the viewers empathise with him? After all this is the lifestyle he choose and he seems to be happy with it so why does the viewers need to relate with him?Back to my question of why the need to show the mc attending school. It is definitely not about him passing his exams to obtain his certificate for his future career because we have been told he already chose to be a professional Shogi player whom apparently earns more than his teacher. Is it to make friends in his life? If that is the case than why didn’t he actually bother to attempt to make friends? All we are told, the answer to him attending school is to experience high school life like this is some sort of plot amour so that this anime could incorporate high school for the sake of it.Speaking of making friends, there is this three sisters and the other Shogi player Nikaidou that he did make friends with. Why the need to go to school to make more friends when he already have those which he could strengthen the bounds with. The school part could have just been cut out of the anime as it serve no purpose other than to show that the mc values Shogi above all else including a normal teenager life. I feel that the time the mc is shown as attending school should have been given to those four as it make more sense in character building.If the anime wants to include drama besides Shogi, I felt that there should be more development among the mc and his foster family instead of the story of the other Shogi player Kai.Overall if you like me who still do not know what is 5d pawn, 7c rook or 2f knight, after watching this anime, I would advice to skip this anime.

This anime is neither good in explaining the game Shogi nor portraying a good drama.', ""It's difficult to review slice-of-life shows through a critical lens. It's the one genre that is seemingly immune to poor reviews, simply because as long as the show is comforting, then it'll get a good score. I particularly like it when slice-of-life intersects with progress. Last year's Comic Girls did that, as well as Barakamon a few years back.One of my first favorites when I became an anime junkie was Hikaru no Go, which also centered around a competitive board game. With 75 eps and a controversial ending, it has largely faded from memory today. But it was enjoyable, and Hikaru had significant growth throughout...its run.March Comes in Like a Lion explores much of Rei's past. But I felt empty when the show didn't use this past to really affect the person he is now. And at the end, I felt the same way he did. Nothing much got accomplished during S1, and I didn't feel Rei had grown as a person. Instead, he was still wallowing in self-pity. Without significant progress, S1 felt like a disappointment.It didn't help that the humor in the episodes felt completely forced, as the artstyle turns into chibi silliness. This is supposed to relieve the view from the seriousness of Rei's depression, but I felt it was out of place and more annoying than how it was used in Your Lie in April.Hikaru no Go inspired a generation to learn Go, including more than a handful of western fans at anime conventions. I don't think March Comes in Like a Lion will do the same with Shogi. I hope S2 impresses, I really do. But S1 was a slog to get through with its strange chibi takes and generally inconsequential cast. its run.March Comes in Like a Lion explores much of Rei's past.

The progression of the story was slow alot of characters r presented but they didnt do much or play a real role for the show and aswell their developpement was poorly made (like misumi, takahashi, tsujii, hanaoka...) Animals speech are pretty not necessary since they speak for nothing... Mostly jokes r really really bad i never laughed after watching those 22 epsiodes but i guess comedy isnt the aim of...the show. However the story about a young adolescent who has lost their parent in a accident but thanks to shogi and his relatives managed to find a reason to live and to change his life is decent.Art 3/10I hate the art and the way they draw characters expression when it came to joking... So childish and annoying.Music 3/10Musics r bad they arent made to be listening many times. I put 3 for the first op of the show.Character 5/10I dislike so much Nikaidou omggg and all of this over reaction he got. Didnt like Hayashida aswell i find thay he lack of charisma for a teacher, his reaction is so chiddish sometime. And Misumi and his cat (what does the cat do in the show ? Nothing ! Exactly just like Misumi him self ;) ) However i still put 5 for Shimada who inspired me alot for his motivation and his determination for shogi.Enjoyment 3/10 and Overall 4/10Didnt enjoy the show because above :D. I found the rythm was very slow bc of those characters that doesnt have a real impact in the story. the show.

So childish and annoying.Music 3/10Musics r bad they arent made to be listening many times. I put 3 for the first op of the show.Character 5/10I dislike so much Nikaidou omggg and all of this over reaction he got. Didnt like Hayashida aswell i find thay he lack of charisma for a teacher, his reaction is so chiddish sometime. And Misumi and his cat (what does the cat do in the show ? Nothing ! Exactly just like Misumi him self ;) ) However i still put 5 for Shimada who inspired me alot for his motivation and his determination for shogi.Enjoyment 3/10 and Overall 4/10Didnt enjoy the show because above :D. I found the rythm was very slow bc of those characters that doesnt have a real impact in the story.', 'Hate slow-paced anime? Then this isn’t for you. Hate generic sub-characters? Then this isn’t for you. Hate heavy narration? Then this isn\'t for you. Hate when an anime spends a good portion of its time depicting a board game that you don’t understand? Then this isn’t for you. Have a short attention span and don’t like slow-paced series? Then this anime is definitely not for you!Nonetheless, I genuinely LOVE March Comes in Like a Lion!! So what about this series makes me love it despite rating it a 7 and being Debby Downer? Easy: the main character, the art, and the heavy narration.Characters: Rei is...probably one of my favorite character that has come into fictional existence over the past few years. He is different from all the melancholic male characters out there. Yes, he does mope around and feels sorry for himself, but he doesn’t whine nor does he have an undesirable urge to play victim and guilt trip all those that are around him. He is this unique quality character that is not found in stories that often. His growth does not happen immediately. It’s a very slow process. It’s the people around him, the small mundane things, and the ruminating thoughts he has that allows him to grow. His ability to come to terms with his circumstance and his attempt to widen his perspective is a breath of fresh air for me. He really embodies an insecure 17 year old who is trying to become an adult. Observing Rei grow makes this whole series worth watching. He is a wonderful example of creating a slice-of-life/coming of age character. Furthermore, as a viewer who overanalyzes everything and is stuck in my own thoughts while living a monotonous life, Rei’s (and his “mentors”) numerous insightful quotes are always worth reflecting upon.So what about the other characters? First and foremost, most of the characters are mainly there to highlight the story of Rei. So the fact that Rei’s development is incredibly slow means that other character growth are undeniably slow. It’s so slow that unfortunately they are only seen as the typical stock characters. I’m only going to discuss the three sisters (Akari, Hinata and Momo), and Rei’s actual “sister” (Kyouko) to make my point, but the other side characters have similar problems.Like Rei, Rei’s ""sister” is also the melancholic type. However, the difference between these siblings are noticeable. She is the “woe unto me” type with a Kurt Cobain flare (more like the obnoxious Sasuke Uchiha from  Naruto). The femme fatale, the woman who comes to ignite the flame to the series. Anytime she brings herself into Rei’s life, drama is inevitable. To add the chaotic-ness of her personality, there also seems to be some uncomfortable (“sexual”) tension amongst Rei and her; this point could hopefully be proven void later on, but as a viewer it does create a natural curiosity to keep wanting to know what had happened to both of them prior to Rei’s current living situation.As for the three sisters, they are the exact opposite of Rei and Kyouko. They are introduced at the very beginning of the series, and they are there to radiate love and happiness to Rei’s black and white existence.  Together, the sisters represent the warmth and compassion that a family unit could be filled with. However, the main concern I have with these ladies is that even though March Comes in Like a Lion is half way done, they are not even slightly fleshed out. Momo, the youngest sister, is basically there to be cute. Nothing else. Just to be cute. Akari is the typical sweet female character. She is considered to be beautiful, gentle, mild-tempered, and extremely maternal: the epithet of “perfection”. Hinata is probably the sister that stands out the most which is quite the irony, because in reality she is so normal that she wouldn’t stand out at all. She’s not too cute. She’s not too perfect. She is just an average girl. The problem I have with these 3 sister is not that they are stock characters, but they have so much to offer and it is not being showcased. There are subtle hints and moments that makes it obvious that their life is not as simplistic as it appears. They have a gloomy history and they have struggled a lot. It is unfortunate that this is a slow-paced anime because their potential as characters is obvious. Although there is no doubt in my mind that this series will do these sisters justice and gradually mold and shape them, I find it a little sad that many viewers will only see them as just shallow/uncreative archetypes.Art: The art is possibly my favorite part of March Comes in Like a Lion (Studio Shaft is remarkable). It honestly feels like I am watching a book because this series manages to wonderfully combine heavy narration (which I usually tend to dislike) with divine imagery.  As I mentioned a thousand times already, this is a very slow- paced anime. However, even when nothing is happening the art is able to speak volumes.I am an impatient human being and I lose interest easily. So when the show focuses on a shogi match (which I have difficulty fathoming), the one thing that keeps my attention asides the dialogue is the art. For instance, while the characters are playing shogi, they are consistently drinking liquid. Water and liquid is something that is always brought up in the art throughout each episode, and this does not surprise me. Water is able to give life and hydrate the body, but at the same time it is able to drown and suffocate a person’s soul. The artistic style can be observed and reflected on for days if one wanted to understand the atmosphere and tone of the story.Rei and the art are probably the key reasons one should watch this series. Although this anime does feel boring, that does not mean it is awful. The story is executed in such a way that character development and growth feels realistic. Again, this is not a series for people who need to be stimulated with action/philosophical scenes every few minutes. Nonetheless, the writing and concept of March Come in Like a Lion is so well thought-out that I actually would recommend people to watch this series even if they may drop it after a few episodes in. The only suggestion I can give a person who is interested in wanting to view a slow-paced series but is unable to focus, is to watch it with another person so the uneventful section of the show can feel somewhat less intolerable.(On another completely irrelevant note: the creators of this series really love cats; there are so many annoying cats in this show) probably one of my favorite character that has come into fictional existence over the past few years.

The way she describes mental illness, anxiety and youth problems is something absolutely touching and sometimes agonizing because, at least for me, is really relatable. Honey & Clover is my all time favorite manga, but this time, 3-gatsu animation is somehow a different kind of Chika's work. Relief happens less often and the excruciating feeling of drowning in negative feelings is more constant. Episode six was hard to watch non-stop. Maybe because now it's a story mainly about sadness, loneliness and depression. And that is actually something...impressive. Even though I don't really understand nor think about Shogi as an interesting sport/game.Art (10/10) is my favorite part, just like in H&C. Her style is so cute <3 I love the details of the eyes, the cute animals, and now, the TALKING animals! Oh gosh, so much cuteness for my heart to handle.Sound (8/10) is simple, yet quite pretty. I barely noticed the background soundtrack - and I always do it strictly! Guess the story steals all the atenttion from it. Also, the dubbing is awesome! The voices of the characters fit perfectly, especially the female voices - that are also very cute.3-gatsu is about Rei's pain, most of the time, and this end up building our point of view about the rest of the story and the other characters (9/10) in a very strict way - probably because all the narration of the history until now was made by the protagonist only. But all of the characters are unique in their own way and full of characteristics that hold our affection with the passage of time. And these characteristics are so real that it's hard not to feel close to them somehow.Story (10/10) is amazing and yet kinda hard to go along with. The pace is purposely slow - and that makes it sometimes really deep and tense. Still, that is a perfect way to demonstrate how depression works, it's a perfect way to show to the viewers how hard is to feel anguished like that, how difficult it is to have a mind so full of thoughts and fears like this. I was positively surprised by this story that deals so well on the subject of psychological illnesses in a such intense and emotional way. After being so disappointed with various Japanese anime/manga that treat mental illnesses as banal or irrelevant things, watching 3-gatsu was somehow inspiring. I saw myself in various problems that Rei had, I could feel in my skin how scary some moments he spent were. And a show that creates empathy towards this issue is fantastic and without a doubt deserves all the credits.Probably not everyone will like or even truly understand it, but I think it was worth the time for all those who have been teenagers without friends at school, and didn't know how to express their feelings or had family problems/losses.3-gatsu is a story about trusting others, discovering your own strength and weaknesses, about letting it go and moving on.I'm very glad I'm having the chance to follow this series and I can bet some will like it as much as I do. And I really hoping for an emotional and very happy ending full of tears, just like Chika did in Honey & Clover. impressive.

And I really hoping for an emotional and very happy ending full of tears, just like Chika did in Honey & Clover."", ""Once upon a time, I fell in love with a show named Honey and Clover. Because of that love, I decided to check out other works by the author behind it (Umino Chica). This led me to discover 3gatsu no Lion. A story about shogi didn’t seem really appealing, but I dove right into it nevertheless. Then bam, the feels train struck again and I loved it. I said to myself “I wonder if this will get an anime adaptation just like the author’s previous work.” I waited patiently for a long time with the hope of the manga being turned into an animated masterpiece....And it did happen, I felt really happy about it. However, the adaptation managed to surprise me in so many ways despite having an initial idea what to expect from it, especially since Shaft was going to be the studio to adapt it. It was not the animated masterpiece I expected it to be, but still one of the best shows to have come out in recent memory.3gatsu no Lion offers a unique approach when it comes to blending elements from both slice-of-life and sports. First of all, shogi is presented as a professional thing. Most stories that revolve around sports are usually in school setting where they compete with other schools. In the world of 3gatsu, overhyped high school boys are replaced with composed adults. Arenas and courts packed with people are replaced with tatami rooms with only the limited presence of observers. There are actual stakes involved, since defeat can mean a threat to their career, their source of income. Simply attempting to be successful in shogi because you have the passion is not enough. The story makes that known as there are no plot devices or any other bullshit that can turn the tide during the match. A self-proclaimed shogi genius because he beats every person in his town can be just another hopeless brat when thrown into a pit of professionals. There are no shortcuts, convenience is subjective. Each move made on the shogi board is carefully planned and calculated like their life depends on it. A feeling of heaviness in every touch of a shogi piece, like a sense of burden channeled through every part of the player’s body. Enduring and outsmarting the enemy is the key, as a single match can consume up an entire day.Even though the sense of competition prevails throughout the show, it is not always associated with intensity. The narrative is easy-going and introspective. The consistent monologues often remind me of Honey and Clover, very reflective and poignant. It conveys well what goes inside a character’s mind: doubts, anxieties, hope, resolve, basically almost the entire spectrum of human emotions. The atmosphere emulated by the show can go from heartwarming funny moments amplified by Shaft’s eccentric execution to serious dread especially during official matches. Outside shogi matches, the story focuses on the daily lives of the shogi players. We get a glimpse of their situation and then come to understand how and why they ended up choosing shogi as a profession. Take shogi away and everything will change.And now we get to the main character, Kiriyama Rei. He is seen as the next big storm in the world of shogi as past trends report that every professional who debut in middle-school always become the next master. In reality, he struggles like your average shogi player. His name is well-known, but he still has a long way to go by climbing up the ranks. What makes him interesting as a character is because of his troubled past that always try to come back at him when he tries to move forward. Even though he doesn’t want to gain sympathy from others, his frail persona always gets him unexpected help. He acts timid and indecisive at times but can also act the opposite when push comes to shove. His character development is subtle throughout the story, further reinforced with his reflective internal monologues.  Sure, other shows have main characters like Rei but what they usually miss is having a well-grounded character background that makes us understand why that character acts that way. By that, I don’t mean having a tragic past and then go on a full pity show on others when you feel being cornered and act unreasonable. Rei is quite different, he can act like your typical teenager that is undergoing an angst phase but he tries to be mature which is the result of him always being surrounded by adults. Even though he miserably fails at some occasions, it is the story’s attempt to show that he is still a kid and can act naïve. He has limited interaction to kids his age because he immerses himself with shogi, thus always being seen as a weirdo. There is always an underlying explanation to aspects of his character. Its fine saying you don’t like him for who he is but at least you have to recognize that the show perfectly justifies it. It could be borderline victimization but there is an attempt to break out the victim role.The presence of the Kawamoto household is possibly the best representation of the show’s slice-of-life element. I feel like if they are omitted from the story, it wouldn’t be the same. Sure, sometimes they get too much screen time which mostly consists of them drooling over sweets but I see it as like an ice-breaker from the overwhelming seriousness of the show most of the time. They also serve as a bridge for Rei to act just like an ordinary human once in a while. He can get hungry just like any other person. He can also display concern and worry over trivial things. He can feel like being part of a family, in which he copes up with his feelings about his experience with his foster family. There are also other people who help with respect to Rei's development as a character like his teacher Hayashida who assists him in his life as a student, despite having the option not to go to school and focus only in shogi. Even fellow shogi players like Nikaidou is relevant to his development as the sense of rivalry makes him evaluate his self-worth. This part of the show is just in equal footing with shogi in terms of relevance to the development of the story and its characters.For my final thoughts on this show adaptation-wise, I think Shaft did a great job with it. Like I said in my introduction, it wasn’t the animated masterpiece I expected it to be. It took a while for me to really vibe with what Shaft is trying to do with it, but it really manages to capture the essence of the show. I always envisioned the 3gatsu adaptation as really bleak, with hints of heartwarming moments, but Shaft managed to adapt it into something colorful and artistic. How it executes various scenes that incorporate symbolism with Rei’s almost lifeless narration is beautiful. I can’t forget in the first episode in which Rei did a shogi match with his foster father. The brilliance of how Rei’s past is flashed every time a shogi piece moves was so emotional for me. If there is one major criticism I have with the show though, it would be how it transitions serious scenes with downright slapstick chibi comedy. It’s kind of off-putting at times, but it’s not bothersome enough to ruin the show.Overall, even without my slight bias for it as a fan of the manga, it is still a show worth checking out especially if you love slice-of-life. I could’ve given it a higher score, but it’s not yet there in terms of development. I’m glad this is going to get another season and hope more people discover this gem I’ve cherished for a long time. And it did happen, I felt really happy about it. However, the adaptation managed to surprise me in so many ways despite having an initial idea what to expect from it, especially since Shaft was going to be the studio to adapt it.

Some people tend to be worried when they hear that studio Shaft is going to be adapting anything, but Shaft perfectly adapted the already great manga of 3-gatsu no Lion in a very creative way, as they usually do.3-gatsu no Lion tells a story about a boy that tries to find a place where he belongs and is accepted, a story that consists of many different parts, each of which can stir up many different kinds of emotions, and when all of them...come together, they make this amazing series.The story that 3-gatsu no Lion tells is that of Rei Kiriyama, a 17-year-old boy who has faced many troubles and sadness despite his young age. His losing his family when he was still a child and even facing problems while living with his adoptive family, have caused him many traumas and insecurities and made his personality reclusive. While trying to find a way to escape from that pressure, he decides to live alone, in Tokyo, but how is he going to make it on his own? The only thing that Rei is talented at and can depend on is shogi, since he is one of the few people who became professional players while in middle school. But even like that, Rei sometimes faces pressure from the shogi community, he can’t take proper care of himself and doesn’t have any friends.That’s when he meets the Kawamoto sisters, who are determined to take care of Rei and make him feel less lonely with their hospitality.As he struggles to maintain himself physically and mentally, he slowly meets and interacts with more people, from the shogi community, school or his family, and gets to understand his own complex emotions.3-gatsu no Lion is more of a slice of life/drama series with some comedy, but there is focus on shogi, too, which also helps the story progress and the characters develop. Although shogi is one of the basic elements of the anime, it’s really not necessary to know anything about it and understand exactly how they are playing in order to know what’s going on and enjoy the matches. Everything you need to know is told by the characters, through the great description of their feelings and thoughts during the matches.The narration is simply amazing, the more you watch and listen to the characters talking, the more you are getting drawn in this wonderful story. The way the characters describe how they feel, the troubles they are facing, the dialogues and interactions between them, all seem extremely realistic and even relatable, you can understand exactly what they are going through just by hearing them talking. And as they are thinking through the monologues and they interact with each other, their feelings gradually change, which offers great development to the story and the characters.It certainly looks like a simple and slow paced story but it can be serious and dramatic, but also very heartwarming and with more lighthearted moments, each of these parts is perfectly handled.As for the adaptation, studio Shaft did a remarkable job and remained completely faithful to the source material, following the chapters and the dialogues exactly as they should.The best and main part of 3-gatsu no Lion and what makes it as great as it is, is definitely the characters and their development.The main character of this story may be Rei, but all of the characters receive the necessary amount of focus. They are all amazingly fleshed out, deep, they feel realistic and have unique and interesting personalities. Even the ones that you would consider characters with a mean personality, are enjoyable to watch, you can sympathize with them and they have a reason behind their actions.All of them get gradually developed and more of their backstory, personality, thoughts and feelings are continuously revealed.The character with the greatest and most obvious growth is, of course, Rei, who keeps changing throughout the whole series, but the other character\'s growth is also impressive.The relationships between the characters also feel very human and watching their interactions is always enjoyable.Moving on to the art and animation, it’s obvious that Shaft did an astonishing job. They used the unique art style of Umino Chica without changing anything and added their own special, creative touches as they usually do. The result was aesthetically beautiful, with nice and unique character designs, detailed backgrounds and great cinematography.The expressions of the characters are great and perfectly used in both the serious and the funny scenes.There are also many metaphorical scenes with great symbolism, that depict the characters\' thoughts and emotions in a very creative way.The color palette is also very nice and the colors are used correctly according to what each scene wants to show. They can go from really dark colors that show up when the characters are anxious, tense or depressed, to brighter and cuter ones for the more lighthearted scenes. The shift of the colors really adds to the whole experience and makes us understand better how the characters feel at that moment, especially when it comes to the serious and dramatic scenes.The music used in 3-gatsu no Lion is great, it always fits the scenes perfectly and helps them convey their overall feeling better.The first OP and ED, “Answer” and “Fighter” by BUMP OF CHICKEN, are truly beautiful. It’s nice how they used “Fighter” as the ED song, since it was the song used for the first collaboration between the band and the author, a short music video of 3-gatsu no Lion.The second OP, ""Sayonara Bystander” by YUKI, and ED, ""orion"" by Kenshi Yonezu, are also pretty nice and fit the anime.Even the shogi song, ""Nyaa Shougi Ondo” by the sisters’ VAs (Kana Hanazawa, Ai Kayano and Misaki Kuno), was pretty cute and offered some information about shogi.Another nice detail is the cute sound effects and the animals’ little dialogues, which are pretty funny.The voice actors did a great job and managed to convey the characters’ feelings perfectly.3-gatsu no Lion may look like a very simple story, with no really extraordinary elements. But the way it manages to handle and describe all the complex, but human feelings and thoughts of the characters so naturally and perfectly, is what makes 3-gatsu no Lion a masterpiece. The many different situations that the anime depicts, the dramatic ones or the heartwarming ones will definitely stir up your emotions and tug at your heartstrings.It may not be an anime that pleases everyone’s tastes, but it is definitely unique, realistic, refreshing and worth dedicating some of your time to watch it. come together, they make this amazing series.The story that 3-gatsu no Lion tells is that of Rei Kiriyama, a 17-year-old boy who has faced many troubles and sadness despite his young age. His losing his family when he was still a child and even facing problems while living with his adoptive family, have caused him many traumas and insecurities and made his personality reclusive. While trying to find a way to escape from that pressure, he decides to live alone, in Tokyo, but how is he going to make it on his own? The only thing that Rei is talented at and can depend on is shogi, since he is one of the few people who became professional players while in middle school. But even like that, Rei sometimes faces pressure from the shogi community, he can’t take proper care of himself and doesn’t have any friends.That’s when he meets the Kawamoto sisters, who are determined to take care of Rei and make him feel less lonely with their hospitality.As he struggles to maintain himself physically and mentally, he slowly meets and interacts with more people, from the shogi community, school or his family, and gets to understand his own complex emotions.3-gatsu no Lion is more of a slice of life/drama series with some comedy, but there is focus on shogi, too, which also helps the story progress and the characters develop. Although shogi is one of the basic elements of the anime, it’s really not necessary to know anything about it and understand exactly how they are playing in order to know what’s going on and enjoy the matches.

It looks like it is going to go nowhere and the description saying that this show is about shogi doesn\'t help it one bit. But then comes the actual story which is great. It blends the shogi with the drama in a way that doesn\'t seem forced and fits into the story. It honestly made me think about the characters as persons but we will get to that later.Art and Animation [8.8]The art of the source material got adapted great into animation. It leads into an almost perfect mix if not being for some hiccups in...the quality in some later episodes. The art is great but the problem is that still shots get used too often. Don´t get me wrong still shots can greatly improve some scenes but it just gets used too much to the point that at later episodes it gets you out of the experience.Sound [8.5]Both of the openings are incredible. BUMP CHICKEN and YUKI did a great job with their respective songs ""Answer"" and ""Sayonara Bystander."" Personally, I prefer ""Sayonara Bystander"" as a song but the animation doesn´t mix properly. ""Answer"" while not having the same emotional impact as ""Sayonara Bystander"" it is still a great freaking song that gets you hyped and the animation fully supports it.Character [9.7]These are some of the greatest supporting characters of the last year. The sisters are incredible by making the story much easier to handle while not falling into a forgettable category. My favorite character goes to the middle sister Hinata since I actually see her as a fully developed character with motivations and dreams. The best part about the sisters is that their lives do not revolve around the main character which is a problem most animes suffer from. The problem with the cast is the main character and his family. They never seemed like actual people and especially the sister seemed too cruel and psychotic to be taken seriously. I honestly cannot see myself encountering any of these people anywhere in the world and that is the part that doesn\'t sell me completely.Enjoyment [9.0]This is a great series that hooked me up from start to finish the problem is some of the passing. The beginning was a bit slow and some of the later halves of the show took away some of the enjoyment since they took me out of the experience. Aside from that, I think that the series was a great adaptation of the source material having read it myself.ConclusionI would recommend this series to anyone that is ready to experience something more than your usual circle of things you want to watch. This is a perfect passageway to people who want to expand their horizons and see the beauty in life. This is why my overall rating is a 9.2.Hope you found this review usefulThis is my first review so I would appreciate if you could gic¡ve me any feedback regarding my writing style and things that I could improve on. the quality in some later episodes.

It's pretty darn good visuals, and its detailed, giving the main character, Rei, a generally grim face most the time, most befitting his character.Transitions from scenes are good, and I'm finding myself like the art style more and more each episode. Also the OP is pretty good and the EDSound: Well, the sound is pretty good. The OP is good, and the ED is good....The music hasn't really stuck out to me much. The sound effects are pretty good. Overall their good.Characters: Well, each character is done extremely well, yes even the grandpa and Momo (especially momo) Regardless they are all very well done. Each has their own uniqueness to them, making me crave even more next week.Story: It's brilliant! Each character deals with their trials differently, and it is very entertaining to see how they deal with it. Furthermore it is extremely interesting to see Rei become closer to the three sisters as the story progresses! The story is equally balanced among all the characters, with of course Rei being the main.Enjoyment: I'm enjoying each episode each week. I genuinely am hoping for specific things to happen, and it is fun to see it all play out!I hope you try March Comes In Like A Lion out for yourself, and form your own opinion.

The story is gripping because of the gravity and emotions of the thoughts and feelings behind it, while also coupled with unexpected hilarious scenes that lighten it up enough to not feel overbearing.You should not expect something action filled or a driving narrative from this anime, because that is not what it's trying to be. Instead, it focusses on the inner thought processes of various characters, though mostly Rei. It's very slow paced and can seem depressing at times, but luckily, just at the moments when things seem to get...too heavy, there will be a funny moment to relieve the viewer of the tension.It is definitely worth watching. too heavy, there will be a funny moment to relieve the viewer of the tension.It is definitely worth watching."", 'It has romance or not?Some will ask this question before risking to see this anime and my answer is probably not, since if there is almost imperceptible but this did not guide you in the wrong way since if there are a couple of relationships with prospect, but dont expect a lot of them, it contains deep themes that can be appreciated in many ways depending on each one, every relationship that connects with the MC (main character) has its complex history and that puts you fuller in her, the characters You love them or hate them, even comes to play with your emotions,...this is undoubtedly one of the best anime that i has seen, said this I beg you to give it a chance since you will not regret it and for those who are looking for romance, I am the same To you and the fact that there is no strong romance you love this anime. this is undoubtedly one of the best anime that i has seen, said this I beg you to give it a chance since you will not regret it and for those who are looking for romance, I am the same To you and the fact that there is no strong romance you love this anime.', ""“The further you go, the steeper it becomes, and there won’t be anyone around you.” – Rei KiriyamaI feel I lack the vocabulary and eloquence to adequately express how special Sangatsu no Lion truly is, but i'll attempt to do my best nonetheless.Depression is a silent battle. Constantly waging war against yourself. What happiness you can grasp is constantly sinking into an ocean of nothingness. You are nothing, you have nothing.Sangatsu no Lion does not shy away from showing it's viewers the reality of the soul crushing torment that depression is. The protagonist of the story isn't a faultless man embarking on...the hero's journey, he's apprehensive, unsure of himself and engulfed in loneliness. Although this may be the case, Rei is a hero. A champion for the broken, a beacon in the night. He is you and I.Rei's battle with depression is captivating to say the least. Losing his family and being adopted into another, he uses shogi to appeal to his foster father and gain his approval. Through his immense talent and hard work he becomes a professional in the shogi world, but as a side effect he alienates his adoptive father's biological children. He then decides to live alone and chase after shogi, isolating himself. It's at this point that the story begins.The vicious cycle of win or become nothing becomes Rei's life. He isn't satisfied with how things have turned out but he continues to press forward because that's what is expected of him. His life has essentially become a vice as he suffers quietly in solitude.The show is by definition a sports anime and doesn't shy away from that fact. Even if you were to peel away the dramatic story elements, the direction in the each shogi match is stellar. Every move is tense and efficient, as the players place their shogi pieces down with a satisfying clack, demanding the other player acknowledge their move. It's all extremely atmospheric, and you feel as if you were sitting right next to the board. Chika Umino has a deep understanding and respect for shogi and it definitely shines through.Now, to pivot back to story elements.The world of professionals is cutthroat and Rei soon comes to realise that the only way for him to remain one is to douse the hopes and dreams of each opponent he defeats. But why should he? Why should he be the one to attain victory? Why him?Through all the uncertainty, self-doubt, self-loathing and pain, a figure appears and lends a hand to Rei as if to pull him from the depths of his mind to start anew. Akari, Hinata and Momo Kawamoto are thrust upon him.Like Rei, the Kawamoto's have also experienced loss, the tragic death of their mother has left them incomplete. Broken but united, the Kawamoto family embraces Rei as one of their own. Through all of the pain, Rei begins to learn of the struggle of others. The Kawamoto sisters are as human as he is, they also all share the pain of losing a loved one and this commonality bonds them to each other. Scenes of Rei surrounded by the girls and simply having a conversation were enough to bring me to tears. The only way I think I could describe Rei's relatonship with the Kawamoto household in words would be 'sweetness'. It's this same sweetness that Rei must separate himself from as he feels he isn't deserving of it.Depression is an irrational beast by nature and overcoming it is a arduous process. Through all the success he's achieved and friends he's made, he still feels lonely. This is the painful truth of mental illness. However, Rei decides to leap forward into the abyss and towards finding his own undeniable happiness. To say Rei's journey is inspiring would be an understatement. As someone who has battled with chronic depression for a majority of their life, Sangatsu no Lion portrays how isolating and painful it can be perfectly.I've seen Sangatsu no Lion criticised for it's slow pacing while I on the contrary believe the slow, methodical building to be a necessity. Each character has a role, every dialogue exchange and scene has a purpose, to have such a unique and dynamic cast of characters would be impossible if it weren't for that fact that they all have backstories and lives that are completely fleshed out and interesting. You can't rush greatness.As this is an adaptation, an animation studio must adapt it. Shaft's unorthodox approach to storytelling has often been hit or miss with me, ventures like the Monogatari Series often take a wildly esoteric approach to storytelling. The director of said series, Akiyuki Shibou, steers the ship that is Sangatsu no Lion. At a first glance I was definitely worried that he would employ the same over the top, no holds barred direction style that he's come to be known for but to my surprise he shows a more restrained, thoughtful direction style. Characters in close-up slowly turning to one another, quick cuts of a noisy shogi player fidgeting, it all lent itself to the atmosphere quite well, suffice to say I was surprised, even beyond that I was thoroughly and consistently blown away by his direction. Paired with Chika Umino's visionary level of storytelling, Sangatsu no Lion became a living, breathing creation. The art and music perfectly compliment each other as you feel chills run down your spine in tense scenes and your heart filled to the brim in the Kawamoto house. It's all masterful.Through all of the suffering and anguish, the clouds will eventually part and you'll be exactly where you need to be, this is the powerful sentiment the show carries. Misery is combatable, you just need to be brave enough to face it. There is beauty in life, you just need to be able to see it.Sangatsu no Lion might be the most powerful piece of media I've encountered to this date and for that i'm eternally grateful.Please watch this show. the hero's journey, he's apprehensive, unsure of himself and engulfed in loneliness.

But the story, for me,  was too dull. I mean its slice...of life and i did not have any high expections to start with but the plot here was all dull. It fails to grab the watchers attention in my case,Kiriyama who is an expert shogi player has the attitude of someone who has just given up on life,he is just so dull ,so unenergetic that he makes you feel the same way too when you watch. Kiriyama's tragic life story begins later on but by this time I was so uninterested to even care but for the most part,the plot is kiriyama going to his shogi matches,kiriyama going to school, kiriyama going to akari's place and helping them with whatever problem they have. But seriously this Anorexic kid's pitifull state of mind was the most off putting thingArt/SoundThe art is good for the most part,I really like and appriciate the small things such as momo's design suiting her personalitiy,and the cats etc but there are certain things i don't like ...such as the fact that i HATE the way kiriyama's mouth is shaped .....sometimes especially when he is annoyed its really bad. The voice Acting was Superb! Couldn't have asked for better.... all the voice actors were so in tune with their characters and it was just a perfect fit espcially momo ,the cats and KoudaIn the end I'd like to state again that i wrote this review for a very niche group of people but you are free to take from it what you will.thanks for taking the time to read this of life and i did not have any high expections to start with but the plot here was all dull.

It's incredibly frustrating when the protag is constantly being pushed around by other unlikeable characters, and submitting to their abuse and nonsense. There was ONE redeeming quality of the story which involves a family who displayed a great deal of support for the protag and showed a great example of how friends should have your back with no expectation of anything in return. I WILL be continuing onto the next season, in hopes that it'll get better, but this one was pretty dreadful. "", '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)The pawns were my friends, the knights my family, and the queen my lover. For I was king.When it came to chess, I was the best. In my corner of the world, anyway. I lived the sport as much as I could. Winning school tournaments, going to summer camps to learn new skills. Squaring off against multiple opponents simultaneously. Practicing with a plastic travel set and a versus timer and a book on named openings. For a while, chess was my calling. A passion that neither bishop nor rook could squander.Today, that’s no longer the...case. Writing, programming, and other -ing’s have replaced what was once my kingly domain. But, even today, having not played chess for years, I know that I could go back to that board. See the same familiar pieces. And they would invite me back with open arms (if they had arms, anyway).Because, just as 3-gatsu no Lion would claim, what we experience never really leaves us – and that there’s always someone waiting to lend a loving hand.STORY3-gatsu centers on a young man named Rei Kiriyama. As only the fifth shogi player to become a professional while still in middle school, the prodigy engages in hard-fought battles in this sport of the mind. However, his most daunting battlefield occurs off the board. In a place simply called “life.” But thanks to Akari, Hinata, and Momo, three kindhearted sisters in his neighborhood who have taken him under their wings, Rei survives onward, fending off “attacks” all around him.According to outside sources and information about the series in its current state, this season of 3-gatsu is merely the first of many. In what is meant to be a very long, very articulate journey (should the original author, SHAFT, and the anime gods will it). Thus, these introductory twenty-two episodes have the honor of setting up its story for the audience. What it entails, where it plans to go, and why any of it matters at all.And like a shogi board primed for an upcoming match, 3-gatsu sets up said story with expert ease.It doesn’t take too long to understand that shogi in and of itself makes for an important plot element for this anime. This sport forms the crux of many of the events and becomes the driving force behind Rei’s actions. It’s essentially Japanese chess except it includes a few extra pieces (the lance, the golden general, etc.).While nothing extensive, 3-gatsu teaches the audience about these different pieces and the overall structure, letting the audience have a better grasp of this plot element on a technical level. And it does what it can to vary up the depicted matches. Quietness, sweltering heat, hyper-focus. While the board and the pieces never change, each match has a certain air about it that keeps them from falling prey to stagnation.Admittedly, shogi is not the most thrilling of sports to watch. There’s no “action” besides the players picking up and placing their pieces. Moves often require many, many minutes of thinking. The environment calls for very little fanfare.However, like most sports anime (and, indeed, most sports stories), shogi isn’t necessarily all about the spectacle. Rather, it’s a catalyst, a vehicle that allows 3-gatsu to carry its grander, more thoughtful ideas forward.It starts by viewing shogi in a thematic sense. Yes, it’s just a bunch of wood carvings with Japanese words etched into them. But, in the larger context of the story, it means so much more.Shogi is a singular sport; the player can only rely on himself or herself. In a way, it’s rather lonely, almost isolated. Yet it’s also a dual (and duel) sport. Someone else takes the other side of the board, forcing two minds, two ideals, and two people to clash. In a broader sense, shogi requires a winner and a loser (which is almost always the case based on the rules). Each player can only control his or her own pieces, meaning they themselves command their fate. And the game’s rooted tradition and strict etiquette mask the tumultuous feelings harbored within.As described, and considering the context of 3-gatsu, shogi is a metaphor for life itself. Individuals act on their own and interact with others, controlling what they themselves say and do. They “win” and they “lose” all the time. They don’t always reveal how they feel, for emotions aren’t the simplest to explain.The parallels here are important because, outside of shogi, where 3-gatsu truly matters, life and what it encompasses takes precedence on a thematic and narrative level.For instance, one of the anime’s most pronounced characteristics is its tonal range. The story will often swing back and forth between extremely heartwarming and utterly crestfallen, raising and lowering the audience’s emotions without remorse. It can be slightly jarring at times, but this dichotomy speaks to life’s own emotional rollercoaster. How happiness and sadness are closer than one may believe.Furthermore, both sides of the spectrum elevate 3-gatsu’s plot points and explore its vital themes. On the happy end, Akari, Hinata, and Momo’s nostalgic, loving home is Rei’s “kotatsu.” They implore the importance of togetherness. That a belly full of food, a few good laughs, and a company of loved ones is all it takes to warm the soul. On the sad end, Rei’s barren apartment with an equally lonely lifestyle stresses reality’s gloomier corner. While tough to stomach, depression is a formidable foe that cannot always be cured with a touching smile (let alone a silver general).To reach these ends and continue its exploration on life, the show fills its space with even more thematic exploration. It focuses on family – Akari and the girls, Rei’s deceased family, his foster family – to highlight how such close bonds both heal and harm. It emphasizes certain mindsets like having no regrets and refusing to lose. It talks about self-worth and the challenges people face in their own lives.Yet the most intriguing thematic element (besides shogi) is its most prevalent feature: water. For Rei, water symbolizes so many of his darker thoughts: suffocation, obstruction, restriction. But it also symbolizes what could possibly be: refreshing, buoyant, sustainable.In one scene, a thunderous storm hearkens harsh ocean waves that drown his mind. Then, in another scene, he’ll take a swig from his plastic bottle at home to quench his thirst. Indeed, water is a constant in Rei’s life. A duality that, once again, plays to the anime’s strengths through its thematic connections to life and its clear, precise presence.All this thematic discussion hasn’t even elaborated on 3-gatsu’s main plot points and story beats.Part of what grounds the show’s story is how much Rei loses. Despite his prodigy status, his losses up the realism of his current situation while readying him for his eventual climb later. They also put into perspective where he is at in his life and the strength of his numerous opponents.It also has its memorable scenes. More specifically, Rei’s breakdown in episode ten explodes out the emotions he has been keeping trapped inside himself. He basically yells at the world for making him think everything is always his fault, and that giving up or giving in is not an option for him or anyone. As Nikaidou would put it, Rei “doesn’t want to lose” – in every sense of the phrase.And extra narrative facets keep the story progressing. Foreshadowing with the top shogi player as the beast to beat. A subplot involving Kyouko’s jerkwad “boyfriend.” Rei’s decision to stay away from Akari, Hinata, and Momo’s home for much of the second half of the season is not only seen but felt. The creation of the shogi club at Rei’s school makes for an optimistic finale moving forward.Even after all this analyzing, 3-gatsu presents even more to its audience. Effective comedy. Interesting dialogue. Purposeful chapter structure. Simply put, as the introductory portion to this story, the anime roars like a ferocious lion preparing for what will unfold.ART & ANIMATIONWhen watching 3-gatsu, its actual animation soars during scenes where it overexaggerates the Kawamoto sisters’ actions or forms a fantastical aside. (Shogi remains quite the stationary sport.) But it’s the impressive artistry and the technical finesse that allow this show to reach ever higher heights.Above anything else, the anime loves its visual metaphors. From a pair of balloons floating upwards through the sky to gallons of water submerging Rei as he sits on the steps leading to the school rooftop, 3-gatsu constantly creates thoughtful, engaging scenes. They not only bolster the ideas of the show but also provide the audience with yet another thematic layer to think about.The show has tons of flair, too. A first-person perspective obfuscated by strands of hair. Shifts in camera angles, like a top-down view of Akari as her cats whirl around her. Multiple styles shifted between seamlessly: rough, quirky, sharp, involved. The sheer amount of techniques employed, the obvious attention to cinematography, and the risks taken with its vast variance turn this slice-of-life drama into both an outstandingly diverse and an artistically worthwhile endeavor.To go even further, 3-gatsu also focuses intently on the overall look and feel of the visuals themselves. Color choices reach across the rainbow, sparking lots of contrast between its melancholic mood (blues, greys, blacks) and its sweet serenity (oranges, yellows, pinks). A noticeably soft approach ushers in a calm setting while still carrying its weighty, solemn baggage. And its backgrounds – from inside the sisters’ home to the imaginative moments – persist as a constant example of the anime’s artistic integrity.And one cannot ignore the designs of the characters, for they evoke the same sense of wonder that the rest of the visuals deliver. Generally, they’re rather unique in their facial details: lines fill out their eyes, their mouths are slightly thicker than normal, their gazes often exude a gentle aura.Individually, Akari’s ponytail draped over her shoulder, her purple-colored eyes, small hairpin, cardigan sweaters, usual apron, and ample assets paint her as the womanly goddess she is. Hinata’s long twin-tailed hair, her smaller physique, girly outfits, and sincere smile captures her energy and kindness. Momo’s short, light-orange hair and wide eyes highlight her cute and childish status that much more.There’s also Rei with his frazzled black hair, green eyes, glasses, white buttoned-up shirt, and jeans that give him a nerdy, quiet look that fits his character all too well. The girls’ grandpa’s squareness. Smith’s tall, Western vibe. Kyouko’s brown overcoat and devilish beauty. Nikaidou’s rotund shape and Shimada’s lanky frame. The characters’ designs are interesting and attractive and different.Exactly like the rest of 3-gatsu’s artistry.CHARACTERSIn 3-gatsu, the characters exemplify their respective roles: the main protagonist, the supporting cast, and so on. But they represent much more than just what a literary definition could ascribe. In fact, they continue the exploration of the anime’s themes through thoughtful ideas and progression of their own.As the star of this tale, Rei Kiriyama doesn’t lead the most eventful of lives. He wakes up each day without anybody around. He puts on his clothes and munches on some convenience-store food before making the long walk and the sad train ride to his local shogi hall. He plays a couple of games in relative silence. Then he goes back home. To a desolate, no-drapes apartment where he practices the sport by himself – which is arguably one of the loneliest activities imaginable – in the middle of his wide-open room. Only to fall asleep, wake up, and go through the whole process ad infinitum.Loneliness characterizes Rei to a depressing degree. From him eating his cold lunch by himself to sitting outside on the cold concrete as the wind howls about him, Rei is often alone. Sometimes of his own choosing, sometimes because it can’t be helped. But this void follows him nonetheless.And it always has. The true beginning of Rei’s loneliness starts with the tragic death of his parents and his little sister in a freak car accident. Having lost those held most dear to him, he doesn’t know what to do. So, he latches onto shogi – to keep his thoughts focused and to numb the pain in his heart.Rei describes his relationship with “the god of shogi” as an “ugly lie.” That he only agreed to like the sport so he could survive. Indeed, in lying, Rei’s father’s friend Kouda takes Rei in as a foster child.Unfortunately for the young boy, loneliness just won’t let go. Rei’s presence in his foster family tears them apart. As Kouda favors the prodigy player, his other kids suffer. His son Ayumu regresses into seclusion, and Kyouko succumbs to rebellion and seethes with rage. Rage that she takes out on Rei through physical abuse.This form of abuse is new to Rei, but abuse in general is not. For, as a school student, he has often been ignored or neglected by others, enduring mental abuse without really knowing it. Their bullying stops Rei from reaching out to anyone except for the ants on the ground. Even more loneliness for the lonely protagonist.Rei, realizing what he (inadvertently) does to his new family, separates himself from them, choosing the path of a professional shogi player to keep his unluckiness from spreading. Sadly, despite his quick rise in the shogi world, Rei hits a block of sorts. With expectations of his future set high, and people (outwardly or not) questioning his abilities, loneliness further tightens around him.Up to now, Rei is a “liar.” A “home-wrecker.” A “loser.” His situation is practically unfair and wholly unbearable. However, a wholesome, miraculous light in his life keeps him going: the Kawamoto sisters.Across a couple of bridges and down a few roads, Akari, Hinata, and Momo accept Rei as one of their own. They brighten the atmosphere with delicious food, energetic actions, and cuteness galore. Through their personalities, nostalgia permeates the air. Warmth radiates outward. Kindness envelops everything.Rei may not word it exactly this way, but, for him, their home is heaven on Earth. It’s one of the only places where he can truly feel at ease. Where his loneliness must wait at the door and his happiness grows to levels he never thought possible.It’s all thanks to the girls themselves. Beginning with Akari, she dotes on Rei as much as she can. She saves him from his “friends” and their “drinking game.” She leads the charge in curing his cold. She speaks earnestly with him about matters. She directly invites him over or slyly involves him in other ways to get him active.Akari’s thoughtfulness cannot be understated. She looks after her two little sisters by herself. She works at her grandpa’s shop and her aunt’s lounge. She remains emotionally strong despite the pain they have experienced in their own lives. And that’s not even the half of it. Akari is not only the best supporting character in 3-gatsu but also one of the best in all of anime.Hinata doesn’t earn the same accolades, but that certainly doesn’t mean she isn’t without her own incredibly supportive nature. She is genuinely glad to see more sides of Rei’s personality. She thinks about how he’s doing when he’s not around. She overcomes “boundaries” like giving him food in front of and inquiring about Kyouko. Hinata’s heartwarming relationship with Rei proves that she cares deeply about him – more so than he may realize.And Momo supports in her own way, too. She’s a toddler, so she understandably can’t do much. But, as she views Rei as her older brother and dances excitedly whenever he arrives, she subconsciously gives him a sense of responsibility and self-esteem that nobody can replicate.Akari, Hinata, and Momo are amazing supporters. So much so, in fact, that they even know when not to support. While the second half of the season contains less of these three than one would prefer, them giving Rei space argues for the fact that, sometimes, it’s best to let a person focus on what he or she needs to so that they, too, can help themselves.That’s not easy to do, though. Despite the girls caring for him, and despite his determination, Rei still struggles. He experiences agony. Arrogance. Anger. Just as the people in his life influence him, he affects himself through the actions and thoughts he takes. That is, loneliness cannot always be blamed on everyone else. It’s also up to that person to do something about it.So, Rei does just that. He divulges his feelings to Yuusuke about going back to school and not wanting to run away. He reaffirms why he played shogi in the first place when he remembers the games that had his father really thinking hard. He agrees to forming the joint shogi-science club at his school to earn him a new set of friends.Just as things start to look a bit brighter, Kyouko injects herself into Rei’s life. Now an adult, Kyouko preys on Rei. She isn’t laughably maniacal or in possession of some mega power. Instead, she simply uses her words. To spite, to hurt, and to poison her foster brother.Kyouko’s manipulation, her uncomfortably forward physicality makes their relationship an abusive yet striking one. She loves him to death and despises his guts. She hates her father, she fell for a man one too many years her senior, and she is beyond selfish. As Momo would put it, she’s a “witch” – but also somebody in desperate need of support. Altogether, her complicated thoughts and her complex feelings turn her into one of the best “villains” to grace the medium in a long while.As for Rei, despite her abuse and their unique relationship, he wants to help his foster sister. And it’s this reversal of roles, where he can be there for someone who is lonely, that ultimately gets at 3-gatsu’s most important theme.To reiterate, Akari, Hinata, and Momo support Rei however they can. But they aren’t the only ones who do so. Nikaidou is Rei’s rival, motivator, and friend. Takashi may not always have tact, but he sincerely guides Rei as both a teacher and as an adult. His foster father calls him on his cell phone multiple times when he isn’t responding. Shimada mentors Rei in the art of shogi, shows him what it means to persevere, teaches him what matters most when all is said and done, and gives him the chance to finally be relied on.In other words, there is always someone nearby who cares. Rei has lost. He has been bullied. He has been hurt. But he has never truly been alone. For, all around him, from the Kawamoto sisters to the man who “cracked open his skull,” people in Rei’s life love him in one way or another.This sentiment applies to the audience, making it the biggest takeaway from this first season. Life can be cruel, mean, and unfair. Yet, despite the problems people face and the seemingly insurmountable terrors they confront, there’s always someone nearby who cares.Sure, it may not be people as perfect as Akari, Hinata, and Momo. But maybe it’s a close parent or a significant other or a friend that hasn’t been spoken to in years. No matter the case, someone is out there. Right now. Ready and willing to replace that loneliness with support of their own.MUSIC & SOUNDJust as 3-gatsu’s story, art, and characters demonstrate their power, the music and the sound that surrounds the entire experience does the same.Its opening tracks, “Answer” and “Sayonara Bystander,” fill the air with optimistic tones, rhyming lyricism, strong vocal work, catchy instrumentation, and various emotions. They create a set of powerful songs which capture the anime’s drive to tell a tale that’s both thoughtful and real. Their ability to not only kick off each episode with the right mood in mind but also invoke a sense of longing in the audience stands as a testament to their overwhelming strength.Its ending tracks have a similar level of strength but go down different routes. The first ED, “Fighter,” embodies its title with a determined beat, sincere singing, and an empowering background choir. In comparison, the second ED, “orion,” incorporates hip-hop, distinct snapping, and smooth harmonizing to uplift the audience with grounded delivery. Together, they represent the show’s grander sense of hope and perseverance against the odds and the adversity that life so regularly throws into the mix.Continuing with the spirit of the show, 3-gatsu’s original soundtrack implements music that strikes at the heart of its own ideals. In one track, crystal rings loudly to chill the air and to hallow out the atmosphere. In another track, zippy xylophone playing and a pronounced tuba reflect the infectious happiness of the Kawamoto sisters. In other tracks, piano moves effortlessly from soft and melancholic to fun and free as the mood shifts accordingly. Combined with acoustic guitars, marching drums, grating sounds, and a whole host of other instrumental work, the OST dares anyone to denounce its craftsmanship.The voice-acting performances likewise stand tall. Ai Kayano as Akari uses a mature and loving voice that brings calm and comfort in droves. Kana Hanazawa as Hinata ups the silliness levels with her boisterous tone. Misaki Kuno’s cheerful way of speaking directly equates to the toddler’s cute behavior. Kengo Kawanishi as Rei narrates his loneliness well while also ranging in his emotions throughout the season. And Nobuhiko Okamoto as Nikaidou yells and motivates with care and without end.Two special side-shout-outs go to Ms. Kayano, Ms. Hanazawa, and Ms. Kuno. First for voicing the cats. 3-gatsuverbalizing the cats’ inner thoughts was unexpected and hilarious, the three leading women making it so. Second, and speaking of cats, the anime’s special ending track “Nyaa Shougi Ondo” also deserves props. It was cool to see the creators go out of their way to (some extent) teach the sport of shogi to the audience. Even more impressive was making it into a song, using a cat motif, and having the women once again contribute with singing of their own (and few “nyaa” lyrics).None of these musical pieces and performances mention the show’s attention to other sound-effects. The clack of a placed shogi piece. A growing-ever-louder grandfather clock. The plunging of water. The anime goes everywhere with its metaphors, comedy, and emotions, and the included sound-effects always keep up, rounding out this aural experience in fantastic fashion.ENJOYMENTIn my introduction, I wrote about my chess-dweeb era. It’s something that I will cherish forever. Practicing with my dad on the couch while we watched television together. Defeating my fifth-grade teacher for the first time. Laughing with my friends about the dumb moves we made. I rarely, if ever, pick up a pawn nowadays, but chess will always be a part of me no matter what.Chess and shogi aren’t technically the same, but the show got me thinking about these precious memories of mine. Yet my connection to this anime goes deeper.I haven’t lost my family. I’ve never been abused or bullied either. Meaning, I cannot claim that my situation in life has been anything like Rei’s. But I can empathize with his emotions – because I’ve been there. I know what it feels like to be put on a pedestal only to let everyone down. To succumb to loneliness. To not seek guidance out of misplaced fear and shame when those around me clearly want to help.I’m saving the details of my own life-altering story for a more momentous moment. Suffice it to say, though, I connect with this show beyond just the sport it depicts. And it makes me so gosh darn happy to see how, wrapped around my personal connection to this tale, the anime does almost everything right that it possibly could.The comedy makes me laugh a ton. Akari tapping her hands on the table back at Hinata. Hinata magically and hurriedly floating through the air and out the door. Momo asking Rei if he’s her older brother or not. If it isn’t already apparent, I adore the Kawamoto sisters.The drama sucks me in. Kyouko’s manipulation. Takashi’s wise words. Rei’s troubled life. I became so interested in what was going on that I took half a day off from work just so that I could finish the remainder of the season because I couldn’t put it down.The content itself means a lot to me. Purposeful themes treated with respect. All the creativity behind its visual direction. The strong writing throughout. Altogether, it’s an anime that appeals to my critiquing mind.And, while I’ve already slightly talked about her already, let it be known: I have the biggest crush on Akari. Beautiful. Motherly. Kind. Thoughtful. Sincere. Attractive. Mature. Strong. She’s nothing short of angelic, and she has become one of my favorite characters of all-time without any shred of doubt.In fact, this crush extends to the entire project here, for I love this anime. It’s the kind of show that only comes around once in a while. An anime that represents what this medium is and demonstrates what it can do. And I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to watch it.At this point, there’s not much else I can write down. Which means there’s really only one thing left: give it the highest honors possible.3-gatsu no Lion proves its outstanding worth in this medium through extreme execution. A thematically heavy story. Wonderful artistry. A host of awesome characters. Superb sound choices. A wealth of entertaining moments. Like any king, it has everything and then some.And it’s only the opening.SUMMARYStory: Great, as a thematically rich start to this journey, the tale explores life’s duality of happiness and sadness through shogi, nuanced narrative elements, and purposeful plot points while delivering a meaningful and expressive slice-of-life dramaArt & Animation: Great, visual metaphors, impressive variance in artistry, and lovely character designs both engage the audience and bolster the themes thereinCharacters: Great, Rei’s unfortunate abuse and struggles expound on the concept of loneliness, the Kawamoto sisters define supporting characters, smart writing crafts Kyouko into a stellar “antagonist,” and a heartfelt theme on there always being someone nearby who cares solidifies the cast’s incredible strengthMusic & Sound: Great, a set of powerful OPs and EDs, an emotional OST, strong VA performances, and extra additions elevate the experience even furtherEnjoyment: Great, personally relatable, downright entertaining, and Akari is beyond angelicFinal Score: 10/10 case. Writing, programming, and other -ing’s have replaced what was once my kingly domain. But, even today, having not played chess for years, I know that I could go back to that board. See the same familiar pieces. And they would invite me back with open arms (if they had arms, anyway).Because, just as 3-gatsu no Lion would claim, what we experience never really leaves us – and that there’s always someone waiting to lend a loving hand.STORY3-gatsu centers on a young man named Rei Kiriyama. As only the fifth shogi player to become a professional while still in middle school, the prodigy engages in hard-fought battles in this sport of the mind. However, his most daunting battlefield occurs off the board. In a place simply called “life.” But thanks to Akari, Hinata, and Momo, three kindhearted sisters in his neighborhood who have taken him under their wings, Rei survives onward, fending off “attacks” all around him.According to outside sources and information about the series in its current state, this season of 3-gatsu is merely the first of many. In what is meant to be a very long, very articulate journey (should the original author, SHAFT, and the anime gods will it).

He wakes up each day without anybody around. He puts on his clothes and munches on some convenience-store food before making the long walk and the sad train ride to his local shogi hall. He plays a couple of games in relative silence. Then he goes back home. To a desolate, no-drapes apartment where he practices the sport by himself – which is arguably one of the loneliest activities imaginable – in the middle of his wide-open room. Only to fall asleep, wake up, and go through the whole process ad infinitum.Loneliness characterizes Rei to a depressing degree. From him eating his cold lunch by himself to sitting outside on the cold concrete as the wind howls about him, Rei is often alone. Sometimes of his own choosing, sometimes because it can’t be helped. But this void follows him nonetheless.And it always has. The true beginning of Rei’s loneliness starts with the tragic death of his parents and his little sister in a freak car accident. Having lost those held most dear to him, he doesn’t know what to do. So, he latches onto shogi – to keep his thoughts focused and to numb the pain in his heart.Rei describes his relationship with “the god of shogi” as an “ugly lie.” That he only agreed to like the sport so he could survive. Indeed, in lying, Rei’s father’s friend Kouda takes Rei in as a foster child.Unfortunately for the young boy, loneliness just won’t let go. Rei’s presence in his foster family tears them apart. As Kouda favors the prodigy player, his other kids suffer. His son Ayumu regresses into seclusion, and Kyouko succumbs to rebellion and seethes with rage. Rage that she takes out on Rei through physical abuse.This form of abuse is new to Rei, but abuse in general is not. For, as a school student, he has often been ignored or neglected by others, enduring mental abuse without really knowing it. Their bullying stops Rei from reaching out to anyone except for the ants on the ground. Even more loneliness for the lonely protagonist.Rei, realizing what he (inadvertently) does to his new family, separates himself from them, choosing the path of a professional shogi player to keep his unluckiness from spreading. Sadly, despite his quick rise in the shogi world, Rei hits a block of sorts. With expectations of his future set high, and people (outwardly or not) questioning his abilities, loneliness further tightens around him.Up to now, Rei is a “liar.” A “home-wrecker.” A “loser.” His situation is practically unfair and wholly unbearable. However, a wholesome, miraculous light in his life keeps him going: the Kawamoto sisters.Across a couple of bridges and down a few roads, Akari, Hinata, and Momo accept Rei as one of their own. They brighten the atmosphere with delicious food, energetic actions, and cuteness galore. Through their personalities, nostalgia permeates the air. Warmth radiates outward. Kindness envelops everything.Rei may not word it exactly this way, but, for him, their home is heaven on Earth. It’s one of the only places where he can truly feel at ease. Where his loneliness must wait at the door and his happiness grows to levels he never thought possible.It’s all thanks to the girls themselves. Beginning with Akari, she dotes on Rei as much as she can. She saves him from his “friends” and their “drinking game.” She leads the charge in curing his cold. She speaks earnestly with him about matters. She directly invites him over or slyly involves him in other ways to get him active.Akari’s thoughtfulness cannot be understated. She looks after her two little sisters by herself. She works at her grandpa’s shop and her aunt’s lounge. She remains emotionally strong despite the pain they have experienced in their own lives. And that’s not even the half of it. Akari is not only the best supporting character in 3-gatsu but also one of the best in all of anime.Hinata doesn’t earn the same accolades, but that certainly doesn’t mean she isn’t without her own incredibly supportive nature. She is genuinely glad to see more sides of Rei’s personality. She thinks about how he’s doing when he’s not around. She overcomes “boundaries” like giving him food in front of and inquiring about Kyouko. Hinata’s heartwarming relationship with Rei proves that she cares deeply about him – more so than he may realize.And Momo supports in her own way, too. She’s a toddler, so she understandably can’t do much. But, as she views Rei as her older brother and dances excitedly whenever he arrives, she subconsciously gives him a sense of responsibility and self-esteem that nobody can replicate.Akari, Hinata, and Momo are amazing supporters. So much so, in fact, that they even know when not to support. While the second half of the season contains less of these three than one would prefer, them giving Rei space argues for the fact that, sometimes, it’s best to let a person focus on what he or she needs to so that they, too, can help themselves.That’s not easy to do, though. Despite the girls caring for him, and despite his determination, Rei still struggles. He experiences agony. Arrogance. Anger. Just as the people in his life influence him, he affects himself through the actions and thoughts he takes. That is, loneliness cannot always be blamed on everyone else. It’s also up to that person to do something about it.So, Rei does just that. He divulges his feelings to Yuusuke about going back to school and not wanting to run away. He reaffirms why he played shogi in the first place when he remembers the games that had his father really thinking hard. He agrees to forming the joint shogi-science club at his school to earn him a new set of friends.Just as things start to look a bit brighter, Kyouko injects herself into Rei’s life. Now an adult, Kyouko preys on Rei. She isn’t laughably maniacal or in possession of some mega power. Instead, she simply uses her words. To spite, to hurt, and to poison her foster brother.Kyouko’s manipulation, her uncomfortably forward physicality makes their relationship an abusive yet striking one. She loves him to death and despises his guts. She hates her father, she fell for a man one too many years her senior, and she is beyond selfish. As Momo would put it, she’s a “witch” – but also somebody in desperate need of support. Altogether, her complicated thoughts and her complex feelings turn her into one of the best “villains” to grace the medium in a long while.As for Rei, despite her abuse and their unique relationship, he wants to help his foster sister. And it’s this reversal of roles, where he can be there for someone who is lonely, that ultimately gets at 3-gatsu’s most important theme.To reiterate, Akari, Hinata, and Momo support Rei however they can. But they aren’t the only ones who do so. Nikaidou is Rei’s rival, motivator, and friend. Takashi may not always have tact, but he sincerely guides Rei as both a teacher and as an adult. His foster father calls him on his cell phone multiple times when he isn’t responding. Shimada mentors Rei in the art of shogi, shows him what it means to persevere, teaches him what matters most when all is said and done, and gives him the chance to finally be relied on.In other words, there is always someone nearby who cares. Rei has lost. He has been bullied. He has been hurt. But he has never truly been alone. For, all around him, from the Kawamoto sisters to the man who “cracked open his skull,” people in Rei’s life love him in one way or another.This sentiment applies to the audience, making it the biggest takeaway from this first season. Life can be cruel, mean, and unfair. Yet, despite the problems people face and the seemingly insurmountable terrors they confront, there’s always someone nearby who cares.Sure, it may not be people as perfect as Akari, Hinata, and Momo. But maybe it’s a close parent or a significant other or a friend that hasn’t been spoken to in years. No matter the case, someone is out there. Right now. Ready and willing to replace that loneliness with support of their own.MUSIC & SOUNDJust as 3-gatsu’s story, art, and characters demonstrate their power, the music and the sound that surrounds the entire experience does the same.Its opening tracks, “Answer” and “Sayonara Bystander,” fill the air with optimistic tones, rhyming lyricism, strong vocal work, catchy instrumentation, and various emotions. They create a set of powerful songs which capture the anime’s drive to tell a tale that’s both thoughtful and real. Their ability to not only kick off each episode with the right mood in mind but also invoke a sense of longing in the audience stands as a testament to their overwhelming strength.Its ending tracks have a similar level of strength but go down different routes. The first ED, “Fighter,” embodies its title with a determined beat, sincere singing, and an empowering background choir. In comparison, the second ED, “orion,” incorporates hip-hop, distinct snapping, and smooth harmonizing to uplift the audience with grounded delivery. Together, they represent the show’s grander sense of hope and perseverance against the odds and the adversity that life so regularly throws into the mix.Continuing with the spirit of the show, 3-gatsu’s original soundtrack implements music that strikes at the heart of its own ideals. In one track, crystal rings loudly to chill the air and to hallow out the atmosphere. In another track, zippy xylophone playing and a pronounced tuba reflect the infectious happiness of the Kawamoto sisters. In other tracks, piano moves effortlessly from soft and melancholic to fun and free as the mood shifts accordingly. Combined with acoustic guitars, marching drums, grating sounds, and a whole host of other instrumental work, the OST dares anyone to denounce its craftsmanship.The voice-acting performances likewise stand tall. Ai Kayano as Akari uses a mature and loving voice that brings calm and comfort in droves. Kana Hanazawa as Hinata ups the silliness levels with her boisterous tone. Misaki Kuno’s cheerful way of speaking directly equates to the toddler’s cute behavior. Kengo Kawanishi as Rei narrates his loneliness well while also ranging in his emotions throughout the season. And Nobuhiko Okamoto as Nikaidou yells and motivates with care and without end.Two special side-shout-outs go to Ms. Kayano, Ms. Hanazawa, and Ms. Kuno. First for voicing the cats. 3-gatsuverbalizing the cats’ inner thoughts was unexpected and hilarious, the three leading women making it so. Second, and speaking of cats, the anime’s special ending track “Nyaa Shougi Ondo” also deserves props. It was cool to see the creators go out of their way to (some extent) teach the sport of shogi to the audience. Even more impressive was making it into a song, using a cat motif, and having the women once again contribute with singing of their own (and few “nyaa” lyrics).None of these musical pieces and performances mention the show’s attention to other sound-effects. The clack of a placed shogi piece. A growing-ever-louder grandfather clock. The plunging of water. The anime goes everywhere with its metaphors, comedy, and emotions, and the included sound-effects always keep up, rounding out this aural experience in fantastic fashion.ENJOYMENTIn my introduction, I wrote about my chess-dweeb era. It’s something that I will cherish forever. Practicing with my dad on the couch while we watched television together. Defeating my fifth-grade teacher for the first time. Laughing with my friends about the dumb moves we made. I rarely, if ever, pick up a pawn nowadays, but chess will always be a part of me no matter what.Chess and shogi aren’t technically the same, but the show got me thinking about these precious memories of mine. Yet my connection to this anime goes deeper.I haven’t lost my family. I’ve never been abused or bullied either. Meaning, I cannot claim that my situation in life has been anything like Rei’s. But I can empathize with his emotions – because I’ve been there. I know what it feels like to be put on a pedestal only to let everyone down. To succumb to loneliness. To not seek guidance out of misplaced fear and shame when those around me clearly want to help.I’m saving the details of my own life-altering story for a more momentous moment. Suffice it to say, though, I connect with this show beyond just the sport it depicts. And it makes me so gosh darn happy to see how, wrapped around my personal connection to this tale, the anime does almost everything right that it possibly could.The comedy makes me laugh a ton. Akari tapping her hands on the table back at Hinata. Hinata magically and hurriedly floating through the air and out the door. Momo asking Rei if he’s her older brother or not. If it isn’t already apparent, I adore the Kawamoto sisters.The drama sucks me in. Kyouko’s manipulation. Takashi’s wise words. Rei’s troubled life. I became so interested in what was going on that I took half a day off from work just so that I could finish the remainder of the season because I couldn’t put it down.The content itself means a lot to me. Purposeful themes treated with respect. All the creativity behind its visual direction. The strong writing throughout. Altogether, it’s an anime that appeals to my critiquing mind.And, while I’ve already slightly talked about her already, let it be known: I have the biggest crush on Akari. Beautiful. Motherly. Kind. Thoughtful. Sincere. Attractive. Mature. Strong. She’s nothing short of angelic, and she has become one of my favorite characters of all-time without any shred of doubt.In fact, this crush extends to the entire project here, for I love this anime. It’s the kind of show that only comes around once in a while. An anime that represents what this medium is and demonstrates what it can do. And I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to watch it.At this point, there’s not much else I can write down. Which means there’s really only one thing left: give it the highest honors possible.3-gatsu no Lion proves its outstanding worth in this medium through extreme execution. A thematically heavy story. Wonderful artistry. A host of awesome characters. Superb sound choices. A wealth of entertaining moments. Like any king, it has everything and then some.And it’s only the opening.SUMMARYStory: Great, as a thematically rich start to this journey, the tale explores life’s duality of happiness and sadness through shogi, nuanced narrative elements, and purposeful plot points while delivering a meaningful and expressive slice-of-life dramaArt & Animation: Great, visual metaphors, impressive variance in artistry, and lovely character designs both engage the audience and bolster the themes thereinCharacters: Great, Rei’s unfortunate abuse and struggles expound on the concept of loneliness, the Kawamoto sisters define supporting characters, smart writing crafts Kyouko into a stellar “antagonist,” and a heartfelt theme on there always being someone nearby who cares solidifies the cast’s incredible strengthMusic & Sound: Great, a set of powerful OPs and EDs, an emotional OST, strong VA performances, and extra additions elevate the experience even furtherEnjoyment: Great, personally relatable, downright entertaining, and Akari is beyond angelicFinal Score: 10/10', 'Sangatsu no Lion is filled with important life lessons that is taught to us in style. It has great music, quality animation and a fantastic art style. All of this added with the writing makes for an experience to say the least.  I want to also mention that the first episode of this show made my heart ache pretty hard and it didn’t take long to understand why.  I felt like I understood Rei’s character quickly because I was Rei at one point. I did everything not because I enjoyed it but because it was necessary, I was unsure of what I really...wanted to do and how I wanted to live. I felt like I could disappear at any moment and no one would notice. Communicating with others was a chore and all I could really do is sit there and stare blankly at the person I was supposed to be communicating to. Looking back, it honestly felt awful.Story/Characters/Writing (9/10):The story of Sangatsu no Lion can be simplified to it being a story about life, but it is much more intricate than that. Like shogi there are many different pieces involved each with different roles to play. The author used shogi as a tool to give the viewer more insight on the characters and on life, this is done very well. Rei is the character who rightfully gets most of the character development. Other characters like the Kawamoto family is also focused on but nowhere near as much. I was completely fine with this as I was much more interested in Rei than others. The side characters are well used to further develop Rei’s character while they themselves get developed little amounts at a time.  My biggest problem with this show was its comedy. Although it may not be tagged as a comedy, there was still a considerable amount of comedy in it, and it was very hit or miss. Sometimes it got a chuckle out of me, other times it just felt forced.Art/Animation (9.5/10):Each episode is presented to us with unique visuals that reflects what is being said perfectly, this all thanks to studio Shaft’s creative way of adapting works. Each time they switch styles it doesn’t throw me out of the experience, in fact it makes me feel more involved with the characters. They somehow made each style perfectly embody what the characters were trying to convey.  Although I’m usually not into the more bright, bubbly type of art akin to shoujo works, I felt this was done extremely well.Sound (8.5/10):The voice actors did a wonderful job portraying their individual characters. Almost all lines I felt were delivered very well and held the emotion they were supposed to. The soundtrack was also very good. It was done by Yukari Hashimoto the same composer as Penguindrum, once again she delivers a wonderful soundtrack. I feel this one was even better though because of what Sangatsu no Lion is. I especially love the delicate piano pieces.Overall (9.1/10):This is very good, more than that even. I think this first season of Sangatsu no Lion was a considerable amount better than the second season. I could relate to it much more than the second season making it much more emotional than the second season. It has fantastic writing, its art and animation is too good, the voice cast is great, and the soundtrack is also very great.

The only thing that held this show back from getting a higher score was its comedy.', 'We\'ve all felt a bit lonely at some point in our lives. Yet, when we\'re asked to describe loneliness, it becomes somewhat difficult to express it. We take for granted the comfort of others, the warmth of a hug, and even just the presence of someone who recognizes that you exist. We feel as though there\'s no point to life if there\'s nobody to experience it with. After all, we\'re only human.I think that 3-gatsu no Lion perfectly captures this type of feeling. It\'s one of the few shows that tells an honest story that is made only by someone who had also experienced such...emotions. The show\'s use of imagery to captivate the audience, the story that is borderline tear jerking, and the music to embrace the atmosphere of the situations presented truly made this anime one of the few stories that drove me to awe every single episode.As someone who experienced loneliness and depression before, I feel as if 3-gatsu no Lion is directly speaking to me. Though the shogi in this show is an important part of the story, I\'ve never felt overwhelmed by all the terminology that the characters use. It is safe to say that you don\'t need to know a lot about shogi to appreciate the story. The story is about Rei Kiriyama and his relationship with others as he traverses through the trials of life. At the beginning of 3-gatsu no lion, we\'re introduced with a beautiful French song that coincides with a sweeping view of Rei simply getting ready and walking from his apartment to his next shogi game. In the background we see Rei\'s apartment, ragged and without furniture, the cup ramen on the floor, and a beautiful landscape of the area around him. We also see his clothes and how he conducts himself every morning as he prepares for the day. While he\'s walking to the shogi hall, we see him enshrouded in a crowd of people, as if he were simply a background character, emphasizing his loneliness in this sea of people living their day-to-day lives. By the end of this segment, we already know what Rei is like, and the entire scene is almost entirely without dialogue. Such masterful storytelling is very rare in anime nowadays. Whereas other anime tell their stories entirely through exposition and boring conversations, 3-gatsu no Lion tells it entirely through its animation and music to effective results. The beautiful French music mixed with ordinary scenes that many could relate to in this first episode is the epitome of this. It is moments like this that make me go, ""This is why I watch anime.""The story doesn\'t just show Rei as a depressing character. It also shows how he tries to overcome his situation, by persevering through his sad emotions, and by strengthening his resolve and give meaning to his career in shogi. Throughout the course of the show, his past constantly comes back to haunt him, yet we see him trying his best to overcome it. Rei changes from someone who lives only for the sake of living, to someone who enjoys spending time with his newfound companions. And the change is almost unnoticeable until you take a step back and look at his character. It is thanks to the show\'s wonderful pacing that neither feels rushed nor too slow that helps you know Rei more on a personal level.The side characters are also wonderful to watch, especially the moments with the three sisters -- Akari, Hinata, and of course Momo. The moments with those three just bring so much life to the show that I just wish that they had more screen time in the second half of the show. I want to know more about them and go more in-depth to their family situation and problems. And this problem extends to some of the other characters as well, as some just completely disappear. It\'s really a shame that they didn\'t get as much development as Rei did over the course of the story, but luckily there\'s a second season for that (hype!). Another more prominent supporting character worth mentioning is Shimada. At first, he seemed like a character who wasn\'t as important when he was first introduced, but I was surprised at how much depth and focus he was given in the latter half of the story. His dedication and reason for playing shogi is one of the most relatable and emotional story arcs I have ever seen, and it just goes to show the ability of the writer to make amazingly lovable characters. It just irks me that some characters didn\'t seem to get as much love.The art and animation is simply stunning. Shaft really outdid themselves this time. Instead of raising the number of head tilts and the surreal, mind numbing imagery seen in their previous works, Shaft manages to strike a perfect balance between realism and dreamlike symbolism. The art style evokes a sense of comfort in the mundane, awe in the inspiring scenes, and even beauty in the depressing scenes. I often find myself just sitting in my seat appreciating the level of detail in the scenery of the background and the images that Rei conjures up in his internal monologues, never feeling overwhelmed or taken out of the story by the animation. The show is simply a master of blending art and animation with storytelling, which is what all anime should strive to do.Of course, the music is also an important component to the memorable scenes. Where in most anime the music is there for the sake of being there, in 3-gatsu no Lion the quieter tunes add on to the scenes and build emotional resonance. For example, in a conversation when Rei is having a conversation someone who deeply admires him and asks Rei why he went back to high school, the piano in the background starts off quiet and harmonized in the background. But once the conversation became more intimate and Rei connected with this person, the piano gradually grew louder and created a sea of emotions, making this scene one of the most amazing scenes I\'ve ever seen in anime. I was almost left in tears once that scene was over. The soundtrack is so beautiful that it is a sin not to appreciate it.3-gatsu no Lion is such an enjoyable watch that I\'m baffled that many haven\'t watched this amazing show yet. Not many anime could match this sort of quality, and it\'s a shame that shows like this get buried underneath all the mediocrity that comes out every year. If you\'re like me and crave for a more emotional story of striving for success and happiness in life, then this is a show for you. emotions.

Despite being a Shaft show and having garnered relatively high praise for having an amazing opening episode that paved the way the story would play out, it didn\'t seem like anyone was really watching the show while everyone turned their heads towards different things.  It really was a shame that this show never got the attention that it deserved, because it truly is an amazing watch.Story: We start with Kiriyama Rei, a professional shogi player who barely attends high school, make his way to the shogi hall to play his routine matches.  Quietly,...he sits as he plays a game until his opponent admits defeat and leaves without saying a word.  He makes his way to the three sisters that live in a house on the other side of the river and utters the first of his lines in the series.A dense, twenty-two episode journey, 3-gatsu\'s story is wrapped around Rei and his journey to break out of the shell that he has spent around eleven years in and open himself to the world around him. Utilizing Shaft\'s (or particularly Shinbou\'s) style of visual storytelling, each episode is filled to the brim with each of our characters\' stories and gives us insight to the personal struggles they live with, or the trials that they\'ve overcome through the use of visual metaphors and internal narrative in order to convey the feelings and emotions that are pasted on-screen.  While I personally don\'t find the style of Akiyuki Shinbou to fit a lot of things, 3-gatsu is one of those exceptions where I find his style to work VERY well and would work pretty poorly without it.At its core, 3-gatsu is a character-based show that spends the lion\'s share of its runtime with character development and interaction.  It has this slow but consistent build-up from the start of episode one to the last episode that builds up how its characters change over time, culminating into a something that can only be described as beautiful.  But every rose has its thorns.The show is very dense with content and really wants to give us the story of everyone they introduce, but given the time constraints and just how dense the story feels, many if not all of the stories feel incomplete.  Not only that, but the story feels like its running off of the tracks in the latter half of the series by shifting to a completely new character and having Rei take a backseat in the background.  While the quality of the series during this period was still consistent, I couldn\'t help but feel a little cheated due to the fact that the series at this time wasn\'t about Rei, and I feel like this period of time created a gap between his story and the audience that almost makes him feel less important despite being the main character.Not only that, but the show has comedic moments that hurt the series sometimes.  While the comedy that the show exhibits does coincide with the situation that they\'re placed in, a lot of it clashes with the seriousness of the situation before it, thus creating this VERY jarring shift in tone that I personally wasn\'t a big fan of seeing.  It kind of erased the seriousness of the situation and I wished they could\'ve handled it better so that every profound statement that Rei was saying wasn\'t followed up by some crazy shenanigan from the crazy cast of characters that were following behind him.Despite that, the show managed to pull off a fitting ending to the series that backtracks and shows the emotional journey that the audience went on while seeing Rei grow out of his shell and ride into the light away from the darkness that he secluded himself in.  The ending provides a look into the fruits of his labor and is honestly one of the most satisfying endings I\'ve seen in a while.Overview:+ Great pacing with a dense, investable story+ Lots and lots of character development+ Satisfying, cumulative ending-  Comedic timing hurt more than help-  Second half makes the show fall off a bitCharacters:  Characters act as the most important aspect of a slice of life drama, as without them, the story has no way to push itself forward, and if done poorly, will give the audience no reason to bother rooting for the characters since they\'ll have no attachment to them.First and foremost, Kiriyama Rei, our main protagonist.  A professional shogi player in high school with a relatively high ranking, Rei first comes off as an introverted recluse who doesn\'t seem to want to associate with anyone.  As the series unfolds, the story behind those glasses comes forth and we get to see more of what lies beyond that unhappy and silent exterior.  A good portion of the series is split between Rei\'s development in the present time as he becomes accustomed to the people that have forced themselves into his life and backstory where we learn more about how the young man known as Kiriyama Rei came into being.  Both aspects help make Rei\'s story feel real and impactful and turn him into a character that feels very much like a real person.  While we do see a lot of the former, the latter leaves a lot to be desired.  I feel like the backstory of Rei in certain aspects could\'ve been handled better.  The story on how he met the three sisters didn\'t feel like it had that much detail, and his relationship with someone who beat him up in the past feels like it could\'ve used some attention.  I feel like these are both story aspects that could\'ve been looked upon, but weren\'t used simply because they ran out of time, which is a real shame.Then we have the three sisters of Akari, Hinata, and Momo.  The three sisters had a lot of potential at the start of the series as they helped crack Rei\'s shell at the beginning of the series, and seemed to have their own story to tell as a sort of sub-journey that we could go on.  But sadly, this never came to fruition.  As the series goes on, the three sisters are used less and less, and by the time the second half shows up, they\'re barely in the series anymore and replaced with other characters.  I say this because the series synopsis heavily advertises the three sisters, yet they don\'t feel as important as they\'re let on to be.  Which again, is a real shame because they seemed like they had the potential to give us an interesting story to watch.I also want to bring attention to Shimada Kai, the character who I would argue is the protagonist of the series in the second half of the series.  Kai takes the spotlight due to the shift in story arc that the series has in the second half, thus bringing his own story and struggles into the grand scheme of things.  His development plays a lot like Rei\'s, where we\'re given the struggles he has both in the present day and when he was younger through backstory in internal narrative.  His story is a lot shorter than Rei\'s, but feels a lot more complete.  My only complaint with Kai is the fact that to accommodate his story, Rei had to be shelved off to the side that I occasionally forgot at times that this show was supposed to be about Rei because of how hard and drastic of a shift it was.Beyond them, the cast is filled with varying characters with varying degrees of importance.  A few have their own stories to tell, with some feeling more complete like Nikaidou\'s, while others feel lacking and I really feel like could use more detail like Kyouko and Gotou\'s.  Mostly I complain about these holes in their story because I feel like the time constraint with such a dense story forced the cutting of some of its parts, making it feel incomplete.Overview:+ Rei\'s development+ General character development for the majority of the cast-  Backstories felt incomplete-  The three sisters feel very underwhelming/underusedArt:  Produced by Shaft, 3-gatsu comes out of the gate with a handdrawn artstyle with rough linework and muted colors similar to that of another show the company has made, Madoka Magica.  As such, the show\'s art lends itself to be a flexible style that lets it effortlessly flow into serious scenes or comedic scenes without any sort of shift in its art.As mentioned before, the visual storytelling that 3-gatsu showcases creates stunningly animated metaphors that, alongside the easy flexibility that the art has, adds to the visual experience that 3-gatsu executes.  And since this is a Shinbou show, yes, there are headtilts, yes there are closeups, and yes there are the general shinbouisms that persist throughout the series.  (Wouldn\'t be a Shaft show otherwise)  Despite that fact, they don\'t actually use them that much throughout the series, so if you\'re not a fan of them like me, then goo news, there\'s not much of that to see.Overview:+ Unique, flexible artsyle+ Stunning visual metaphors+ Not too many shinbouisms  (And yes, I consider this a good thing)Sound:  The show has two OP and ED tracks as per usual for a show spanning 2 cours.  The first half has the tracks ""Answer"" and ""Fighter"", both by Bump of Chicken, while the second half has ""Sayonara Bystander"" by Yuki and ""Orion"" by Kenshi Yonezu where the tracks by Bump of Chicken and Yuki are done in emotional rock while the last ed is done in emotional piano with some synthesization.All four of these tracks reflect Rei\'s struggle with clawing his way forward out of the hole he put himself in, and with the visuals that they\'re complimented with, that metaphor becomes all the more clear.  That being said, I find the tracks by Bump of Chicken to be the most memorable if not the only tracks worth remembering.  I say that mostly because the tracks in the second half don\'t stick out to me all that much, and the style of music that Bump of Chicken just fits the series so well that the two feel intertwined and inseparable.Overview:+ Good tracks-  Only about half of them are memorablePersonal Enjoyment:  3-gatsu was a series that I was determined to watch when I first read about it.  Despite my rather unfavorable history with Shaft and how much I dislike Shinbou\'s style of storytelling, I was determined to watch it no matter how many shinbouisms were thrown at me because I truly believed it was gonna be something special even when I found out that not that many people really watched.  And honestly, while it may not rank high score-wise, this is a series that speaks to me personally, and I\'m really glad that I decided to watch it.What did I like about this series?I\'ve already praised how much I like Bump of Chicken\'s work on the series\'s tracks and how well the character development was weaved into the series despite its flaws, so I want to get into specifics here.  I think hands down my favorite moment of 3-gatsu was the ending scene of episode 10.  The amount of raw emotion and power behind that scene in that point of the series was a huge catalyst for how everything else played out after that and it was honestly bone-chilling hearing those words, sticking out as one of my favorite scenes of anime to date.What didn\'t I like about this series?If I may be honest...I don\'t like Nikaidou.  Obvious characters you\'re supposed to not feel sorry for aside, NIkaidou is that one character I found to be kinda irritating despite how big of a role he played in the series.  There\'s something about that cheerful arrogance that irritated me and I wanted to poke him with a needle so he\'d deflate like a balloon.Would I recommend this series?Yes.  If you haven\'t watched this series, I would highly recommend putting this on the watchlist because this is one of the better series of the 2016 year.  It saddens me that this show wasn\'t on a majority of people\'s radars, and as someone who saw through the whole thing and shares his opinion with of many of those who watched the series, 3-gatsu is a powerful, emotional journey that should be experienced, especially if you suffer from depression.  Trust me, as someone who\'s suffered the same shit, this was a very positive and heartwarming experience to have. he sits as he plays a game until his opponent admits defeat and leaves without saying a word.  He makes his way to the three sisters that live in a house on the other side of the river and utters the first of his lines in the series.A dense, twenty-two episode journey, 3-gatsu\'s story is wrapped around Rei and his journey to break out of the shell that he has spent around eleven years in and open himself to the world around him. Utilizing Shaft\'s (or particularly Shinbou\'s) style of visual storytelling, each episode is filled to the brim with each of our characters\' stories and gives us insight to the personal struggles they live with, or the trials that they\'ve overcome through the use of visual metaphors and internal narrative in order to convey the feelings and emotions that are pasted on-screen.  While I personally don\'t find the style of Akiyuki Shinbou to fit a lot of things, 3-gatsu is one of those exceptions where I find his style to work VERY well and would work pretty poorly without it.At its core, 3-gatsu is a character-based show that spends the lion\'s share of its runtime with character development and interaction.  It has this slow but consistent build-up from the start of episode one to the last episode that builds up how its characters change over time, culminating into a something that can only be described as beautiful.  But every rose has its thorns.The show is very dense with content and really wants to give us the story of everyone they introduce, but given the time constraints and just how dense the story feels, many if not all of the stories feel incomplete.  Not only that, but the story feels like its running off of the tracks in the latter half of the series by shifting to a completely new character and having Rei take a backseat in the background.

Please excuse me if I make a mistake or you don\'t understand a part, as English is not my first language. Thank you.Sangatsu no Lion, a jewel that did not make much noiseWith the pace of current anime production it is impossible to see all the series. For that reason, some series only have a modest success, while others take all the fame. It is the case of Sangatsu no Lion, a jewel that went a little unnoticed.I must confess that when it premiered, I saw the first episodes and then I left...it there, parked. It was released in the fall of 2016 with Yuri !!! on Ice, Drifters, the third season of Haikyuu !!, Keijo !!!!, Bungou Stray Dogs season two, Occultic, Nine, Ajin 2nd season, Hibike! Euphonium season two, Shuumatsu no Izetta and Trickster, among others.However, of that group, Sangatsu no Lion is the least obvious at first sight. It was one of two series produced by Shaft that season, best known for Monogatari Series, Madoka and Nisekoi, so I already had the credentials to take a look.In addition, the manga of Umino Chika had been awarded with the Cultural Prize Osamu Tezuka in 2014, a more than respectable endorsement. But what attraction can a melancholic anime have on a boy who plays Shogi?What is Sangatsu no Lion?It is the story of Rei Kirishima, a professional shogi player - Japanese chess - who is only 17 years old. Orphan from very small, after the death in an accident of his parents and younger sister, ended up under the care of the best friend and rival in the shogi of his father. But although his new adoptive father treated him with affection and respect, he could not help but feel the loneliness after losing his family. Especially when in his new home he lived with the two biological children of the house, who resented him for receiving the attention of his father, being a talented player.Without a real family, or friends, his attitude towards life is negative and frankly depressing. So much so that he is unable to see that in fact if he has friends, even if they are few. This begins to change when he meets the sisters Kawamoto, Akari, Hinata and Momo, who give some family warmth to their cold existence. In the course of the 22 episodes we meet her adoptive sister, the troubled Kyouko Koda. The girl serves as the ""villain"" of the story, but despite that has a link with Rei, although it is a very twisted.They also introduce us to their rival / best friend, Harunobu Nikaidō, a young chubby and precarious health that, unlike our protagonist, has a passionate and positive attitude. The other great support of Kirishima is his teacher Takashi Hayashida, the only one in his school who knows that he is a professional shogi player. In addition, as the series progresses, Kai Shimada is introduced, a talented player who has not been able to reach the top due to the existence of Touji Souya. This one seems a reflection of Kirishima, but not much is known about him yet. Except that it generates admiration in Rei and that he is a genius of shogi.An anime of contrastsSangatsu no Lion is definitely an anime series full of contrasts, between light and dark, with Rei Kiriyama in the middle, trying to get his place in life. The shogi is his lifeline and he clings to it with force, but that makes him lose his perspective. His way of seeing the same game that has guaranteed his survival in more than one way, isolates the world. But that is something that only happens in his mind, that is blinded and does not realize that he is not alone, neither in the Shogi nor in life.The story is told slowly, almost parsimoniously. When Rei is alone, the feeling of isolation and loneliness is palpable. It is clear that depression overwhelms him. But the Kawamoto sisters are his oasis, they are, as he very well puts it later in history, his kotatsu. When Akari, Hinata and Momo are on screen, everything is energy, color, happiness. Life is vibrant, sweet and warm.Even art mutates to fit the light and shadows in Rei\'s life. The music, full of beautiful notes, evokes nostalgia. If any weakness has this series, is that its pace is not suitable for everyone. It is not the kind of anime that we see to entertain us, it is one of those that make us reflect, look inside. Depression is a problem and this story of daily life has nothing new to say about it. Its purpose is another, it is to show us the joy of living even in the midst of a seemingly miserable life. It is to show us the evolution of a character that is maturing both in the Shogi and in life.Sometimes the rhythm is slow and the tortuous exposition of Rei\'s life becomes too reiterative, which is a bit less.Another conflictive issue is how the series concludes. His final is open, just at the beginning of a new semester at Rei High School and a new season of Shogi. In the middle we are presented with a flashback of Rei\'s childhood, which serves to contrast between the child he was and the man in which he begins to develop. It lets us see that the Shogi already knows not the ticket to save his life, but to live it. As a conclusion it is perhaps unsatisfactory, but fortunately it already has a new season airing until this day of January, 2018. So we can continue to see how the story unfolds.In any case, the end of Sangatsu no Lion subtracts one more point from this anime. However, I can not stop recommending it, because it is a jewel. And I look forward to write about the continuation.SUMMARYSangatsu no Lion presents the evils of depression and isolation in a way full of art. An art that mutates in light when its protagonist feels closely the love of three orphan sisters, like him. Its excessively contemplative rhythm and its open ending detract from this excellent anime.Personal rating8.5/10 it there, parked.

That´s not the only point that bothers me. The design is kinda careless, but that´s just the typical SHAFT thing you have to deal with. Maybe you like blurred background and faceless side characters, maybe you like...to know what´s happening next because you see that leant back SHAFT head, maybe 3-gatsu no Lion is exactly what you call perfect. I would not, I hoped for more.But let´s talk about the characters and the story, since it´s the most important thing for me. Here we come to the points that I really like. There´s nothing new about an introverted main character that goes through a really hard time in his life, but Rei is kinda surprising you. He is the stereotype that you already know and still he makes decissions that don´t fit in his role. It´s like seeing a child grow and develop new characteristics. As you start the first episode, you are dead even with Rei because he doesn´t know much more about his surroundings.The thing that keeps you watching this anime is the question about his past. A lot of things happend, really sad things, really disturbing things and you sit there watching it and waiting for an explanation.Since I mentioned his really sad past, I have to comment that I´m still waiting for 3-gatsu no Lion to make me cry. It has so much potential to be a tear-jerker, but it´s just not happning. Every time you think that it will crash your feelings, SHAFT decides to get off the track. Shame on you. But thanks for explaining Shogi for dummies! xDI just watched episode 11.5, so maybe it´s going to get better but if you´re just as disapointed as I am, you just have to concentrate on Momo and the cats. Those are some hilarious side characters. to know what´s happening next because you see that leant back SHAFT head, maybe 3-gatsu no Lion is exactly what you call perfect.

A lot of things happend, really sad things, really disturbing things and you sit there watching it and waiting for an explanation.Since I mentioned his really sad past, I have to comment that I´m still waiting for 3-gatsu no Lion to make me cry. It has so much potential to be a tear-jerker, but it´s just not happning. Every time you think that it will crash your feelings, SHAFT decides to get off the track. Shame on you. But thanks for explaining Shogi for dummies! xDI just watched episode 11.5, so maybe it´s going to get better but if you´re just as disapointed as I am, you just have to concentrate on Momo and the cats. Those are some hilarious side characters.', ""this is a review of 3-gatsu no lion upto episode 15,it will be updated after i finish the show if my thoughts change.Story : 10/10,The show's story is very unique,That is judging by most titles that are coming out now,it's about a 17 year old highschooler and a professional Shogi player named Kiriyama Rei,The show may be misunderstood as a game-centered show,but it's far from that,Shogi in this anime is not that huge of an aspect,so even if zero knowledge of Shogi,i enjoyed this show.the story centers on our Main character's life,interactions,friendships,relationships and past,the show is completely away from anything supernatural,it's pure slice-of-life but keep...in mind this IS a seinen anime,thus if you're a fan of action or Very happy,non-complex anime,then don't give this a try,as it's rather complex.Characters : 8/10,the series is still airing and i saw upto episode 15out of 22.and so far i can say that characters are this show's strongest point excluding it's story.The characters are a small cast,yet they're very unique and feel Very..Genuine.we have our main character,kiriyama rei,a professional shogi player that is also a high schooler,we have his foster family That play a huge part in his life,we also have the 3 kawamoto sisters,consisting of the Mature and caring older sister,the childish yet Slightly mature middle sister,and the Moe-blob youngest sister that serves really well into the story despite her not being very complex,we also have Side characters like the shogi players who appear for around an episode ( sometimes more ) and Kiriyama rei's best friend,who serves as emotional support to our Main character,and of course the teacher who serves for comedic purposes and to lighten the mood up.Art : 10/10,I mean there's nothing to complain about here,this is SHAFT.although 5 episodes passed with no head tilts,the others had enough head tilts To make me happy.everything is colorful and very genuine looking,although the eyes and lips are strange at first,you get used to it and start loving it later on.Sound : 9/10,So far the soundtracks were beyond amazing,it was for the first time that i heard a French song in an anime which was very interesting and unique.the other soundtracks fit the scenes they were in perfectly,the first ed and op Done by Bump of Chicken were also quite amazing,and the second opening done by Yui,the second ed done by Kenshi yunezo were also As great,if not better than the first twoOverall rating : 10/10,This show is a masterpiece,and the title is well deserved.Do i recommend this?

This is one of the great spiritual laws of life."" - Shoghi EffendiHis name is ""Shoghi"", how could I not quote him here?March Comes in like a Lion, or Sangatsu no Lion in Japanese, is the newest work produced by studio Shaft, previously known for shows such as Madoka Magica and the Monogatari series. While those are the only shows I watched...from them, at least at the time of writing this review, I was always intrigued to see what could they do if they adapted something with a realistic setting, without any supernatural elements that they could use to express their very specific, highly unusual style. I got an answer with this show, starting Fall 2016 I was once again introduced to all the things I grew to respect about both the directing and the writing talent working for that studio. How well did the transition from fantasy to realism work for me personally? Well, I\'m here to share my thoughts on exactly that, so if you are interested to see it, even though you already saw the score I gave it and probably think I\'m just an another fanboy, then I encourage you to keep reading.*Slight spoilers for 3-Gatsu no Lion included*Story: 9,5Welcome to a world where a game of shogi means more than you could ever imagine, but at the same time it means less than you would ever anticipate. That\'s the world that the main protagonist - Rei Kiriyama - lives in on a daily basis. As one of the few players to enter professional shogi while also being a middle school student he decided to live on his own, making a living off of doing just that. However, Rei doesn\'t love shogi. It\'s not something he\'s ever passionate about, every match feels like a job to him, he only strives to be better because he needs to eat and pay rent. Shogi is the only thing he\'s really good at, taught by his now deceased father and other people, he has grown to be a recognizable face amongst the players and enthusiasts of the game. Even that doesn\'t bring him joy, as his dark past is always in the back of his mind, not letting him fully enjoy what life has in store for him. However, one day he begins to develop bonds with people. Throughout the show he meets both the ones interested in shogi and the ones that never played it, and through those encounters something starts to resonate within him. He starts discovering himself, his reason to push on, his motivations and goals and most importantly, why does it hurt so much when he loses at something he doesn\'t feel passionate about.Just from the premise alone, the anime seems very complicated for anyone that isn\'t from Japan. Shogi isn\'t a game that\'s popular overseas to put it lightly. If you\'re afraid that it isn\'t suitable for you because of that fact alone, let me dispel those doubts. This is not a show that focuses heavily on the shogi board, but everything that happens around it, closer or further away. From the daily practice at home to the big tournament live streamed on national TV, we actually see very little of the games, not even once do we see one in its entirety, without any interruption. No, this isn\'t a show that focuses heavily on strategies to defeat the opponents or major conflicts being decided by a mere game. This is actually a drama, intertwined with several slice of life elements. Yes, shogi is in the middle of it all, but the show does a good enough job not to make it complicated for any newcomers, at one point even explaining the rules through special songs with cute cats as endings of some episodes, though I\'m certain that anyone who has experience with the game will also find something to his liking, because even if the strategies and games aren\'t touched upon for too long, they\'re still there.The story progresses quite fast, which is surprising considering how slow the dialogues are and how much time the show spends on some scenes. It\'s narrative feels sluggish, but it\'s somehow constantly pushing forward, with each encounter or event providing some sort of insight, some sort of a push towards the next episode.Just like in real life though, this story goes through phases and constant development. It follows the current state of the main character, sees him clinging to new hopes and people without him even realizing it most of the time. Everything starts with the kindness he received from the Kawamoto family. The oldest sister - Akari - brought him in when she saw him on the streets and the rest of the people living in her house slowly started warming up to him. Rei, who never encountered such kindness, can\'t even begin to comprehend how he got into that situation. He can\'t understand where all the warmth and happiness he found came from. Nonetheless, this first push into being a part of society definitely helped him grow, he decides to go back to school and after many other events, he can finally decide on something in his life That\'s when the show starts changing, it pushes back the happy sisters and all the slice of life elements into the background and pulls shogi into the foreground. Personally, I was very satisfied with this change. It helped the show feel fresh and showed that it\'s able to leave its comfort zone to provide a different take on the progression of the plot and its themes. While for some this decision backfired heavily, for me it was the dream scenario, because this was the part where the fantastic script and directing could shine in the usual Shaft style, not saying that it didn\'t do so before, it just wasn\'t as prevailing.As for the ending, even a 2 cour anime can\'t cover the entirety of the ongoing manga, but thankfully at the end of the final episode that the second season is coming in Fall, so there\'s no need to worry about an unfinished product. It\'s not like it left anything completely unconcluded, it\'s just that it needs more time to fully bring the story to an end.From that point on it really started reaching for stars, for the place at the anime pantheon where the biggest analysts could  forever argue about its themes and their messages to the characters and the viewer. A show that, amongst other things, already was a great commentary about the difficulties of being a pro at a young age, an issue that is becoming more relevant than ever before, starts to add the issues of people who were pros long before Rei\'s career started. This were supposed to be the key moments that would decide on this show\'s greatness. Did it truly reach that? For me yes, it did. It handled it very maturely, without rushing into conclusions and delivering the closure at a very good pace, it let everything build up to the point where I was excited for every new story that it wanted to show me, surprised by both the writing quality and the procurement by the studio. It kept on overtaking itself, at no point could I feel any signs of regression in its quality. Instead, the constant growth left me astonished. Even when the show went the more predictable direction, it always threw in a little twist so the viewer won\'t feel like he got scammed out of something. It truly was one of the most humane stories that I experienced.Going back a bit, I want to touch upon the slice of life elements, as they truly split the community, at least during the time it aired. Besides the ones that didn\'t care or enjoyed everything all the same, we had the side that hated the heavy shogi parts and enjoyed the easiness and warmth of the scenes with the sisters, but on the other one there were people who preferred strong and thoughtful narrative without the cute moments that they considered worse. I am the one that didn\'t think it mattered. The outstanding work of directing both and mixing them in so they could become the perfect reverses of each other in my opinion brought out the best from both of them. While there were longer periods where one received more screen time than the other, they were easily swapped by different things. The happy feelings didn\'t came out only from the sisters, neither did the drama come out only from the shogi games. Different characters underwent multiple events that showed different sides and approached the same inner problems and conflicts Rei faced through their mindsets. This is another thing that 3-gatsu really excelled at.Never before have I found myself seeing as many details as I did with this series. That\'s not to say they\'re not subtle, far from it actually, and I don\'t think it\'s just because I felt like I could relate to the story. Actually, the subtlety here is used more often than straightforwardness. That\'s why I, as the viewer, found more than I usually would. It operated its atmosphere really well and knows what it goes for. I can understand why some would say that slice of life-like moments ruin that, but I think the show really needs them. Just as any other show with this amount of pressure put on the viewer, it tries to take his mind off of it so he can smile but also think about everything that happened up to that point. You may use it as a breather at the very least. I\'m just a moefag, I enjoy simple things in anime, especially when they\'re done as well as they were done here.All in all, the story is deep, and it only goes further down the rabbit hole with each episode. Never stops trying to go above and beyond what it set for itself at the beginning. Always moving, but never stopping being alluring, charming, interesting and surprising until the very end.Characters: 10Everything will once again boil down to how you see certain genres. 3-Gatsu took a risk mixing the simple, moe cuteness and heavy, symbolic way of storytelling. I\'m certain that it knew that people who don\'t enjoy one or the other could feel alienated when it took the main stage as I mentioned before, but I\'m sure that if that\'s the case, then people could find something to enjoy in the characters. From the first episode it struck me as a series where everyone from the cast will have some problems they\'ll have to deal with, whether they will take the main stage or not was left as a mystery. What\'s surprising though is how many character profiles it managed to present. Each one has enough of a time spot to provide a valuable view on one of the story elements. For example, we get to see all types of shogi players, each at a different part in their private life, their professional career and with a different meaning they find in playing it. All of this affects Kiriyama\'s decisions and his way of life. It\'s not something that\'s brushed off, all characters are introduced at the correct times, so they could destroy Rei\'s view of the future, bringing either light or darkness into it.I\'ll delve deeper into his character. As an orphan who moved into a house full of people with dream of shogi greatness he had to work hard for the status he got at the point where we meet him. He was adopted to a family where shogi skills were the most precious ones. His potential unfortunately started to bring sadness rather than happiness. People started seeing him as a shogi machine, rather than a kid. Because he was an adopted child, the arguments arose and after some time he decided to move out and live off of his earnings as a pro, which leads us to the beginning of the series. As a lost youngster, not understanding what he wants in life, never even trying to find it he mindlessly continues to pursue shogi and lives a monotonous life, but when he meets the Kawamoto family he starts seeing that it doesn\'t have to be like this.The family consists of three sisters and their grandfather. Their mother and grandmother passed away. The oldest sister - Akari - works at a bar. One day she found Rei on the streets and took him home. There he also met the middle sister Hinata, who is a very passionate and reckless klutz, and the youngest Momo, who is the cutest little thing in existence. Their grandfather works at a sweets shop. They\'re not the most wealthy family, but they get through somehow. Any time that we get to see them together they provide a lot of lovely, happy feelings, but that doesn\'t mean they never undergo difficulties. Despite all that, they take Rei into their family as if he was their own kin, take care of him and invite him to dinners. They\'re very altruistic and as I mentioned before, they also had to go through the premature death of their family. But that\'s where the similarities end, because the Kawamoto family are the exact opposite of Rei. They\'re happy, hardworking, passionate and expressive. They think about their future, but try to not to keep their head in the clouds to maintain the household. This sudden meeting of two worlds really exemplifies what the show can do best.Later we meet Rei\'s rival and friend Nikaidou, who despite his chubby appearance and loud, sometimes obnoxious way of being can provide thought provoking ideas and be friendly towards newly met people. His mentor - Kai Shimada - is, once again, mostly the opposite of him. He is skinny, lets thing get to his head, but he is also a much better shogi player that can blow someone\'s mind with his style of play. There\'s also Rei\'s teacher who tries to push him into doing what he really wants to do, even neglect his studies if necessary.All the characters, including the ones I didn\'t mention, help Rei slowly understand something that he couldn\'t even begin trying to comprehend before. They show him their own worlds and as he begins to find his long lost strive for a better life their interactions end up being the pushes he needed to escape the enclosed dark place he found himself in. It\'s really hard for me to remember such a well balanced cast, with just the right amount of time provided so they won\'t feel dull or forced down the viewers throat, but 3-Gatsu achieves it and in a style that doesn\'t leave any other element pushed to the sidelines. The writing doesn\'t lose its goal for a second as it drives every character into a point where I could be satisfied with the time I spent with the, but with a room to grow and expand if needed.Just as a quick note though, this show relies heavily on long monologues to develop its characters. I know that it\'s a problem to many, but unlike some other shows, this one also visualizes all the thoughts to make it more interesting. Still, if you don\'t feel like that\'s your thing or you simply don\'t feel like watching a show like this, you should be informed about it beforehand.Art and Animation: 9When it comes to anime directing I can\'t think of a more distinct style than the one of the person who single handedly made Shaft into what it is today - Akiyuki Shinbou. After watching one of his works, going into the next one the first thing you\'ll say is: ""Oh, this is a Shaft anime"". It\'s no different here. Sudden, sharp camera work, fast yet clear scene transitions, constant changes in the color pallet, a lot of close ups and the usage of colors and backgrounds as a way of showcasing emotions. It\'s all here. What I always wanted to see however is how he would continue his pursuit of imagery in a show without supernatural elements. The answer was easy enough, he simply visualized all the emotions, stuff that was going on inside the head of a character. Everything seems to have a consistent meaning, water is a symbol of being flooded by something a character can\'t fight with, foggy backgrounds mean that a character is deep in thought etc. so, directing wise, really damn good once again. Shaft really does deliver on this aspect, unless of course you don\'t enjoy this style of directing. If something I felt the severe lack of neck tilts. EVERYTHING NEEDS MORE NECK TILTS.The art style is pretty, and there are definitely things that stand out, like the wide panoramic shots of the town during day and night or the cute, comedic chibi-like moments, but the character designs leave a little bit to be desired. A lot of the faces look similar, they\'re hard to read unless someone\'s making a very clear facial expression and their closed mouths are barely noticeable during most scenes. The characters themselves look good, distinctive and unique for the most part, theres one pair that I sometimes mixed up, but besides that I could always say who\'s who. The thick outlines definitely helped with that, those were the strongest point about the character designs.The animation is really beautiful. Unless it\'s necessary to the feeling of the scene or it\'s simply a close up, character rarely stay in one place. Often there\'s something going on in the background, like the cats in the Kawamoto house, another pair playing their own games or a simple sparkle or a special effect. There are a couple of weird graphical choices, but they\'re more often then not fully aware choices to make something seem more comedic and cartoony.By the way, the openings are directed even better than the rest of the series. Could talk for hours about their meaning, but time is precious and there\'s anime that\'s waiting for me as you read this, so I\'ll keep it short. First opening shows Rei falling into the water not being able to escape his memories, while the ending shows him getting out and meeting his past self, as he manages to get past his trauma. The second opening is a reminder of the road Rei had to go through and the future that lies ahead of him, while the second ED shows him once again falling down, but this time he has something that he can happily look forward and look up to and manages to continue on, even if he undergoes minor regression and faces many obstacles, especially mental ones.Sound: 9I\'m not the one to judge music properly, but I do feel like the soundtrack screwed around with a lot of ideas and lacked consistency, even in the first episode one insert song was in French and after that we didn\'t get to hear any more and at times I didn\'t feel like the switches between the happy and sad music were done properly. The soundtrack on its own is gorgeous, really pleasant and ambient, it follows the themes of the show, complements the scenes themselves very well, often gets louder and more intense during important moments which is always nice, uses a lot of instruments and when it needs to, the show can get quiet to provide a nice breather for the viewer so he can think about what happened up to that point or what\'s about to go down. Lots of positives overall.The voice acting here is great. A lot of the times, just when I started to think that the tone of someone\'s voice is about to get repetitive they either switch it, stop talking or the music changed to keep it fresh. We get to hear the voices of popular seiyuu such as Kana Hanazawa, who once again voices a cute girl, Nobuhiko Okamoto, who once again voices a very impulsive character, Miki Shinichiro, who once again voices a stoic character, alongside many others such as Marina Inoue, Takahiro Sakurai, Ai Kayano and others.  A fresh seiyuu that voiced Rei also do a good job, he can put on a good, emotional performance, talk in a steady, melancholic tone, act surprised and provide a lot of other expressions. At times I even felt like the characters were created for the voice actors and not the other way around.The OP\'s and ED\'s, besides the great directing, sound great and really fit the rest of the soundtrack both with the lyrics and the music itself.Toshiki Kameyama isn\'t one of the most memorable sound directors, his more notable work are probably Kokoro Connect, original Escaflowne, Nisekoi and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, but he really did hit it out of the park this time. He really does fit the realistic Shaft style. Great work.Enjoyment: 10Beyond the slower start, this series really provided me with one of the most unique and special experiences to date. The subtlety in every scene and the care put into all the details, while a bit slow paced, definitely made the series into something that I always wanted to see. It really felt like I went through the story alongside Rei, not only as a passive observer, but as someone who attached himself to his ideals and waited to see more of it each time an episode ended. Not often was a series that doesn\'t actually build up huge amounts of tension, or at least not up to a specific point, left me so empty upon finishing it. I\'m sure it won\'t be a feeling I\'ll forget any time soon.As I\'m writing this I feel completely entranced by what I got out of it, debating over meanings of certain situations and looking back at my life realizing how many similar decisions I had to make, while quite a few series were able to do this, March comes in like a lion was able to do it week after week, episode after episode, key moment after key moment. That\'s why this show is truly one of my favorites, an unforgettable piece of art that I\'ll gladly revisit once I cool off. The second season has already been announced, so my rewatch will have to wait a bit. Not that I\'m complaining of course.Overall: 10I was a fan of other Shaft works before I started 3-gatsu, but this cemented it\'s place as one of my favorite studios. Their works are always consistent and bring something special to the genre they tackle. While everyone gushes over how Trigger saves anime, I\'m just here watching how Shaft tries its hardest to make it into a place where masterpieces can be born. The amount of talent in the staff that gathered to create this one show, that I could have never expected to turn out as well as it did, put out something that I think current dramas should look up to in almost every element. Not everything works at all times, but when it all clicks, then it\'s worth every minute of the time I spent with it. I\'m seriously glad I started watching anime when I did, because seeing something like this being put out into the world is a magnificent feeling. I\'m certain that when someone in a couple of years finds this little gem amongst thousands of new anime, he\'ll be able to enjoy it just as much as I enjoyed it when it aired. It\'s that universal and timeless.Am I overstating it all?Probably, but those are my honest feelings and they\'re as pure and heartwarming as happiness on Momo\'s face when she sees Rei coming her way, Hinata\'s passion in life or Akari\'s concern for other human beings.Now, excuse me while I go and weep about all those little moments that I just remembered.As always, this is purely my opinion and I highly recommend you to develop your own. from them, at least at the time of writing this review, I was always intrigued to see what could they do if they adapted something with a realistic setting, without any supernatural elements that they could use to express their very specific, highly unusual style. I got an answer with this show, starting Fall 2016 I was once again introduced to all the things I grew to respect about both the directing and the writing talent working for that studio.

While there were longer periods where one received more screen time than the other, they were easily swapped by different things. The happy feelings didn\'t came out only from the sisters, neither did the drama come out only from the shogi games. Different characters underwent multiple events that showed different sides and approached the same inner problems and conflicts Rei faced through their mindsets. This is another thing that 3-gatsu really excelled at.Never before have I found myself seeing as many details as I did with this series. That\'s not to say they\'re not subtle, far from it actually, and I don\'t think it\'s just because I felt like I could relate to the story. Actually, the subtlety here is used more often than straightforwardness. That\'s why I, as the viewer, found more than I usually would. It operated its atmosphere really well and knows what it goes for. I can understand why some would say that slice of life-like moments ruin that, but I think the show really needs them. Just as any other show with this amount of pressure put on the viewer, it tries to take his mind off of it so he can smile but also think about everything that happened up to that point. You may use it as a breather at the very least. I\'m just a moefag, I enjoy simple things in anime, especially when they\'re done as well as they were done here.All in all, the story is deep, and it only goes further down the rabbit hole with each episode. Never stops trying to go above and beyond what it set for itself at the beginning. Always moving, but never stopping being alluring, charming, interesting and surprising until the very end.Characters: 10Everything will once again boil down to how you see certain genres. 3-Gatsu took a risk mixing the simple, moe cuteness and heavy, symbolic way of storytelling. I\'m certain that it knew that people who don\'t enjoy one or the other could feel alienated when it took the main stage as I mentioned before, but I\'m sure that if that\'s the case, then people could find something to enjoy in the characters. From the first episode it struck me as a series where everyone from the cast will have some problems they\'ll have to deal with, whether they will take the main stage or not was left as a mystery. What\'s surprising though is how many character profiles it managed to present. Each one has enough of a time spot to provide a valuable view on one of the story elements. For example, we get to see all types of shogi players, each at a different part in their private life, their professional career and with a different meaning they find in playing it. All of this affects Kiriyama\'s decisions and his way of life. It\'s not something that\'s brushed off, all characters are introduced at the correct times, so they could destroy Rei\'s view of the future, bringing either light or darkness into it.I\'ll delve deeper into his character. As an orphan who moved into a house full of people with dream of shogi greatness he had to work hard for the status he got at the point where we meet him. He was adopted to a family where shogi skills were the most precious ones. His potential unfortunately started to bring sadness rather than happiness. People started seeing him as a shogi machine, rather than a kid. Because he was an adopted child, the arguments arose and after some time he decided to move out and live off of his earnings as a pro, which leads us to the beginning of the series. As a lost youngster, not understanding what he wants in life, never even trying to find it he mindlessly continues to pursue shogi and lives a monotonous life, but when he meets the Kawamoto family he starts seeing that it doesn\'t have to be like this.The family consists of three sisters and their grandfather. Their mother and grandmother passed away. The oldest sister - Akari - works at a bar. One day she found Rei on the streets and took him home. There he also met the middle sister Hinata, who is a very passionate and reckless klutz, and the youngest Momo, who is the cutest little thing in existence. Their grandfather works at a sweets shop. They\'re not the most wealthy family, but they get through somehow. Any time that we get to see them together they provide a lot of lovely, happy feelings, but that doesn\'t mean they never undergo difficulties. Despite all that, they take Rei into their family as if he was their own kin, take care of him and invite him to dinners. They\'re very altruistic and as I mentioned before, they also had to go through the premature death of their family. But that\'s where the similarities end, because the Kawamoto family are the exact opposite of Rei. They\'re happy, hardworking, passionate and expressive. They think about their future, but try to not to keep their head in the clouds to maintain the household. This sudden meeting of two worlds really exemplifies what the show can do best.Later we meet Rei\'s rival and friend Nikaidou, who despite his chubby appearance and loud, sometimes obnoxious way of being can provide thought provoking ideas and be friendly towards newly met people. His mentor - Kai Shimada - is, once again, mostly the opposite of him. He is skinny, lets thing get to his head, but he is also a much better shogi player that can blow someone\'s mind with his style of play. There\'s also Rei\'s teacher who tries to push him into doing what he really wants to do, even neglect his studies if necessary.All the characters, including the ones I didn\'t mention, help Rei slowly understand something that he couldn\'t even begin trying to comprehend before. They show him their own worlds and as he begins to find his long lost strive for a better life their interactions end up being the pushes he needed to escape the enclosed dark place he found himself in. It\'s really hard for me to remember such a well balanced cast, with just the right amount of time provided so they won\'t feel dull or forced down the viewers throat, but 3-Gatsu achieves it and in a style that doesn\'t leave any other element pushed to the sidelines. The writing doesn\'t lose its goal for a second as it drives every character into a point where I could be satisfied with the time I spent with the, but with a room to grow and expand if needed.Just as a quick note though, this show relies heavily on long monologues to develop its characters. I know that it\'s a problem to many, but unlike some other shows, this one also visualizes all the thoughts to make it more interesting. Still, if you don\'t feel like that\'s your thing or you simply don\'t feel like watching a show like this, you should be informed about it beforehand.Art and Animation: 9When it comes to anime directing I can\'t think of a more distinct style than the one of the person who single handedly made Shaft into what it is today - Akiyuki Shinbou. After watching one of his works, going into the next one the first thing you\'ll say is: ""Oh, this is a Shaft anime"". It\'s no different here. Sudden, sharp camera work, fast yet clear scene transitions, constant changes in the color pallet, a lot of close ups and the usage of colors and backgrounds as a way of showcasing emotions. It\'s all here. What I always wanted to see however is how he would continue his pursuit of imagery in a show without supernatural elements. The answer was easy enough, he simply visualized all the emotions, stuff that was going on inside the head of a character. Everything seems to have a consistent meaning, water is a symbol of being flooded by something a character can\'t fight with, foggy backgrounds mean that a character is deep in thought etc. so, directing wise, really damn good once again. Shaft really does deliver on this aspect, unless of course you don\'t enjoy this style of directing. If something I felt the severe lack of neck tilts. EVERYTHING NEEDS MORE NECK TILTS.The art style is pretty, and there are definitely things that stand out, like the wide panoramic shots of the town during day and night or the cute, comedic chibi-like moments, but the character designs leave a little bit to be desired. A lot of the faces look similar, they\'re hard to read unless someone\'s making a very clear facial expression and their closed mouths are barely noticeable during most scenes. The characters themselves look good, distinctive and unique for the most part, theres one pair that I sometimes mixed up, but besides that I could always say who\'s who. The thick outlines definitely helped with that, those were the strongest point about the character designs.The animation is really beautiful. Unless it\'s necessary to the feeling of the scene or it\'s simply a close up, character rarely stay in one place. Often there\'s something going on in the background, like the cats in the Kawamoto house, another pair playing their own games or a simple sparkle or a special effect. There are a couple of weird graphical choices, but they\'re more often then not fully aware choices to make something seem more comedic and cartoony.By the way, the openings are directed even better than the rest of the series. Could talk for hours about their meaning, but time is precious and there\'s anime that\'s waiting for me as you read this, so I\'ll keep it short. First opening shows Rei falling into the water not being able to escape his memories, while the ending shows him getting out and meeting his past self, as he manages to get past his trauma. The second opening is a reminder of the road Rei had to go through and the future that lies ahead of him, while the second ED shows him once again falling down, but this time he has something that he can happily look forward and look up to and manages to continue on, even if he undergoes minor regression and faces many obstacles, especially mental ones.Sound: 9I\'m not the one to judge music properly, but I do feel like the soundtrack screwed around with a lot of ideas and lacked consistency, even in the first episode one insert song was in French and after that we didn\'t get to hear any more and at times I didn\'t feel like the switches between the happy and sad music were done properly. The soundtrack on its own is gorgeous, really pleasant and ambient, it follows the themes of the show, complements the scenes themselves very well, often gets louder and more intense during important moments which is always nice, uses a lot of instruments and when it needs to, the show can get quiet to provide a nice breather for the viewer so he can think about what happened up to that point or what\'s about to go down. Lots of positives overall.The voice acting here is great. A lot of the times, just when I started to think that the tone of someone\'s voice is about to get repetitive they either switch it, stop talking or the music changed to keep it fresh. We get to hear the voices of popular seiyuu such as Kana Hanazawa, who once again voices a cute girl, Nobuhiko Okamoto, who once again voices a very impulsive character, Miki Shinichiro, who once again voices a stoic character, alongside many others such as Marina Inoue, Takahiro Sakurai, Ai Kayano and others.  A fresh seiyuu that voiced Rei also do a good job, he can put on a good, emotional performance, talk in a steady, melancholic tone, act surprised and provide a lot of other expressions. At times I even felt like the characters were created for the voice actors and not the other way around.The OP\'s and ED\'s, besides the great directing, sound great and really fit the rest of the soundtrack both with the lyrics and the music itself.Toshiki Kameyama isn\'t one of the most memorable sound directors, his more notable work are probably Kokoro Connect, original Escaflowne, Nisekoi and Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, but he really did hit it out of the park this time. He really does fit the realistic Shaft style. Great work.Enjoyment: 10Beyond the slower start, this series really provided me with one of the most unique and special experiences to date. The subtlety in every scene and the care put into all the details, while a bit slow paced, definitely made the series into something that I always wanted to see. It really felt like I went through the story alongside Rei, not only as a passive observer, but as someone who attached himself to his ideals and waited to see more of it each time an episode ended. Not often was a series that doesn\'t actually build up huge amounts of tension, or at least not up to a specific point, left me so empty upon finishing it. I\'m sure it won\'t be a feeling I\'ll forget any time soon.As I\'m writing this I feel completely entranced by what I got out of it, debating over meanings of certain situations and looking back at my life realizing how many similar decisions I had to make, while quite a few series were able to do this, March comes in like a lion was able to do it week after week, episode after episode, key moment after key moment. That\'s why this show is truly one of my favorites, an unforgettable piece of art that I\'ll gladly revisit once I cool off. The second season has already been announced, so my rewatch will have to wait a bit. Not that I\'m complaining of course.Overall: 10I was a fan of other Shaft works before I started 3-gatsu, but this cemented it\'s place as one of my favorite studios. Their works are always consistent and bring something special to the genre they tackle. While everyone gushes over how Trigger saves anime, I\'m just here watching how Shaft tries its hardest to make it into a place where masterpieces can be born. The amount of talent in the staff that gathered to create this one show, that I could have never expected to turn out as well as it did, put out something that I think current dramas should look up to in almost every element. Not everything works at all times, but when it all clicks, then it\'s worth every minute of the time I spent with it. I\'m seriously glad I started watching anime when I did, because seeing something like this being put out into the world is a magnificent feeling. I\'m certain that when someone in a couple of years finds this little gem amongst thousands of new anime, he\'ll be able to enjoy it just as much as I enjoyed it when it aired. It\'s that universal and timeless.Am I overstating it all?Probably, but those are my honest feelings and they\'re as pure and heartwarming as happiness on Momo\'s face when she sees Rei coming her way, Hinata\'s passion in life or Akari\'s concern for other human beings.Now, excuse me while I go and weep about all those little moments that I just remembered.As always, this is purely my opinion and I highly recommend you to develop your own.', ""Rating a series or movie where I feel a strong connection to the lead character is unusually difficult. Depending on how that character is represented, those feelings can skew far in either direction. And yes, Rei Kiriyama is rather similar to me in a number of ways, mainly in his personality. I've never played shogi and I'm only passable at chess, but the kind of social isolation and hunger for inclusion that he feels is something I very strongly associate with, as they characterized a number of my formative years. So, while I am tempted to just make this a review of his character, I'll...try to keep this broader before getting back to the characters, saving him for last.This largely focuses on Rei's experiences, specifically those with his high school, the young Kawamoto family raised by their elder sister, his own apartment and prior home life, and, of course, the more dynamic world of shogi. While not all of these are fleshed out (the school feels mostly empty despite a handful of important characters, and his prior home life is largely focused on his experiences there), the characters they include really make these locations work, particularly the Kawamoto home which is nothing but character. The shogi experience is rather unique for a series like this. I'm unused to a series that focuses on a single sport spending so little time exploring the specifics of that sport. It largely skims over it, with a couple of notable exceptions. That unfortunately makes it difficult to connect with the activity itself and to feel the hype of its bigger moments.That being said, this series is a character study first and foremost, and it most definitely excels. The entire Kawamoto family is always a pleasure to have on screen and one of the more important influences in Rei's life. While it doesn't quite have the heart of Lilo and Nani Pelekai, this kind of family always stands out to me for the love and infighting in equal measure.I don't think I could consider any of those three individually - they come as a matched set. Kai Shimada ends up being the kind of mentor character that I can appreciate for how flawed he is. Clearly exceptional at shogi and driven by the people he surrounded himself with as a child, he's the kind of person who serves more as an example of that drive rather than a teacher, though he is both. Harunobu Nikaidou is also a pleasure to watch, serving mainly as both a foil and a booster for Rei. The most interesting character is Kyouko Kouda, Rei's adoptive sister who has long been eclipsed by him in the world of shogi and is desperately trying to find her place in a world that she feels rejected from. I couldn't shake the impression that she looked like she was drowning and the only life preserver she could find was Rei, the person who she sees as having thrown her into the deep end himself. She treats him terribly, but there's more to her than just a ball of resentment.There are many other characters introduced, but with a couple of surprising exceptions among Rei's opponents, none of them get this kind of attention. I'd love to know more about Rei's adoptive father and brother, about his actual parents and sister, and most importantly, the black box that is Touji Souya. Maybe that's being saved for S2, but these are some pretty big blanks to fill in.As for Rei himself, he's a complex web of emotions. An introvert who nonetheless craves connection, the most fascinating thing about him is his relation to shogi. He's very good at it, but he never developed a connection to it beyond one of necessity, or so he thinks. Many of the bonds he makes and sustains in the show are through shogi, and while it takes him a while to admit it, he wants to prove himself. He's desperate to do more than survive in this world, which means excelling at shogi, graduating high school, and finding connection and support. He's still finding his direction, but now he's more deliberate.Overall, I think this is a great season of anime. It shows how capable this show is at building out characters in beautiful fashion, and while it probably focuses a little too much on a subset of them, season 2 will probably do a lot to expand on that. I wish the series would do more to invest me in shogi, as it feels like it could theoretically be replaced with a different game and be a similarly affecting anime, but it's the kind of show that reminds me strongly of Run With the Wind for how well it invests me in its characters' journeys, and ends up getting the same score from me. try to keep this broader before getting back to the characters, saving him for last.This largely focuses on Rei's experiences, specifically those with his high school, the young Kawamoto family raised by their elder sister, his own apartment and prior home life, and, of course, the more dynamic world of shogi.

I forgot what exactly I was doing back then that made me add this show to my watchlist but I don\'t regret doing that. In fact I was glad to have discovered this series. As I read its synopsis, I noticed that this series was focused around a game, and that game is Shogi. Shogi is commonly known outside of Japan as ""The Japanese Chess"" and I am no stranger to that term because I already saw this game being played in other anime series although I did...not bother to learn the rules on how to play it. Luckily, this series did not need prior knowledge of the game to understand the story.So what does the story have in for us? Well, let\'s check my first opinions as I started rolling the first episode.So, the first episode starts off with the opening. Quite a tradition to older series of anime but good thing there were no spoilers, it just leaves you kind of confused but it is nice. I remember anime series by their iconic openings and the more marvelous an opening is, the better I remember the scenes of the series. But let\'s not focus on that.The first episode already gives off a lot of melodramatic feel and it hints that the show is somewhat heavy on the mood. There\'s plenty to think about when you start watching. As you progress more and more, the story highlights that this is all about the internal struggles of the main character. Well, I shouldn\'t any more than that since spoilers are something I would never bequeath upon thy audience.The art, well... It is something truly unique. I have some words to say about this element of the show. I cannot really fathom this art style because it feels as if it was based heavily from the manga\'s art style and it feels that they gave incredible animation to each page of a volume. Well I cannot really describe it properly but to be honest, I haven\'t really gotten used to the art yet. It does not particularly bother me, but I just can\'t seem to notice it everytime a character does an action. The transition for each chapter is  so well done and it does not kill the mood.The sound is something top-notch. The BGMs and soundstracks fit so very well and the staff found great music producers for this show. Everything fit so well with the mood and even the sound effects are excellent as well.There will always be characters that you will hate but I do not particularly have any of them in this series. Well, maybe not yet. However, I found that the characters lacked a bit of development and detail during their screen times.As I previously said, this show is not light on the mood but it is not particularly that heavy as well. But as the struggles went by, the anime also alleviates the pain by itself amidst the struggleswhich is a great feature for a show that has drama. This anime is truly something that prioritizes the mood because you can feel it wrap around your heart. You can feel both pain and joy when the mood calls for it. It\'s like having a spoon of ice cream after drinking a hot cup of coffee. Another element of the story that I noticed is that it frequently displays the deafening silence in the environment. Silence is something considered as peaceful but it also can be a main factor among the chaos. Although the show was not all that bad, I can\'t help but think that it felt kind of empty with no direction.Well this first season was alright, but I\'m looking forward to seeing the next one.""Happiness is something you can find wherever you are.""- ep. 21 not bother to learn the rules on how to play it.

It is that simple and yet not simple at all. I start the show and the beautiful french song wins me over. When I finished 3 episodes I saw all the potential for this to eventually become one of my favourites. Although the route the show took was not what I was expecting, I am glad the feelings I was expecting were met.For starters, the show deals with our protagonist Rei and his journey to find the happiness he has been looking for. Like everybody who has been...through their teens, Rei asks himself a lot of questions we all can relate to. It\'s not something that no one has thought of before but what it does is help you go through all those years you probably spent thinking about the things our protagonist thinks about. It\'s a journey where you can reinvent yourself. You can identify and understand people who are going through similar phases and be more pleasant to them at the same time. The show is easy to understand and yet the best parts of the show are pretty subtle. You are a human, you\'ve been through things, you have felt things and you have to ask yourself the questions. The more human you are the better you can appreciate this show. After reading this much, the show probably seems like an edgy show about teen problems with sad and gloomy atmosphere all the time. In fact, it is pretty different. Although the things brought up in 3 gatsu no lion is pretty deep at times but it never tries to sell it too much to the audience. It tries to keep the atmosphere as easy and every day like as possible, just what you would expect from a slice of life. It can be an everyday smile and spread smile show one moment and then manages to cover it with beautiful relatable sadness the very next. It makes sure not to overdo the depressing themes and tries some very not funny comedy. The purpose of the comedy never seems to be about making people laugh. Rather it\'s about making them feel warmer and more vulnerable to digest the more serious concepts.The show focuses on shogi and people who build their life around shogi. But no one has to understand Shogi to truly appreciate the show. Rather its the story of people choosing a not so lovely life, the struggles they face because of it and their reasoning to continue. The answers to the questions are pretty simple and it is presented that way but they still manage to hit hard because of the sheer presence of realistic natural emotions that can easily win people over. The pacing is slow because of those things of course. But that shouldn\'t affect people because the show never really loses the magic it attracts its audience with. The show is better of being slow because that is what allows it to excel as well as it does.The artwork is fantastic. The use of environmental description and portraying them beautifully adds a lot to the strategy of making things warm to the viewer. It adds to character development through the imagination of the characters.Not only does the artwork look good but with great animation, it also serves a strong purpose to why it is what it is. It just feels very real. It is a very special show.The sound in 3 gatsu no lion is also wonderfully done. Good storytelling through opening and ending, meaningful lyrics and nice songs as well. The soundtrack is mostly chill as if there\'s a touch of sadness and recovery to it, like the nature of the show itself. No matter how many emotions the show portrays it rarely goes out of its soothing way of music. No matter what the problem is it\'s natural. People go through them. Hence they can feel better with a few drops of tears. The music portrays everything as soothing and calm. Time for a mandatory Steven Wilson quote-""Those are the things that make me want to express or exercise something through my songwriting.""There\'s a lot of beauty to be found in sadness and melancholia.""One of the things that you find time and time again - not just with music, but with literature - is that things that appear to be quite depressing on the surface can ironically be very uplifting and touching to other people.""When you hear something that really reminds you that you\'re not alone in feeling sad, depressed, melancholic, angry - I think that can actually be a very cathartic experience.The soundtrack works in a similar fashion for 3 gatsu no lion.Now I talk about my favourite aspect of this show of course. The characters! The characters in 3 gatsu no lion have a lot of development in a short period of time. Rei Kiriyama is a pretty successful yet unhappy teen. He doesn\'t enjoy shogi but still plays on because it is the only thing that gives meaning to his life. His sense of survival is the thing that keeps him ticking. He isn\'t proud of his reasons and wants to find more to himself. The show\'s best parts are about Rei\'s inner conflict and self-discovery. The 3 kawamoto sisters are people that can make Rei feel different. Their purpose in the show is strong. They are pretty detailed characters who are supposed to contribute to building a warm environment for the entire show. They have their own emotions and they easily feel sympathy and care for other people.2 other characters I would like to talk about is Rei\'s adoptive father and his adoptive sister. Rei\'s adoptive father is the kind of person who would give more importance to his passion of shogi than to his own children. That would result in a messed up psychology for Rei\'s adoptive sister Kyoko who is another important character in the series. Her presence creates doubt and problems for Rei which plays a vital role in his developmentRei\'s relationship with his homeroom teacher is one of the highlights of the show and certainly one of my favourite things. Basically, some of Rei\'s traits is also some of our most pathetic sides that we often can\'t let go. His conversations with his teacher address those and is a life lesson for the audience in general. One other character of importance shows up as Rei\'s mentor later in the series. His development is also something to admire and reminds us just why we love this series in case we ever forget in the middle of all those attempted comedy that we might not appreciate all the time.How much did I enjoy the show? It is not something people would watch for entertainment.The journey itself is rather the draw here.It is not a show where you leave easter eggs to have the people talk about and discover vague meanings and how technically superior it is to other works.It\'s better than that. It\'s just very relatable, has a strong purpose and feels very warm and soothing.Conclusion: Of course season one leaves things to be desired but that is why we got a season 2. Hopefully, season 2 will be just as good if not better. I hope they don\'t go downwards from here. As for season 1 as a stand-alone, well I am very happy no doubt. Would recommend everybody to watch it the right way for sure. through their teens, Rei asks himself a lot of questions we all can relate to.

Unlike many of today’s shows, it eschews fast-paced, action heavy plot in favour of using its characters and their interactions with each other as vehicles to explore themes common to us all. Its reflective tone, stunning visuals, and emotionally-charged music also help set this show apart.StoryIf you’re looking for a no-holds-barred, adrenaline-charged thrill-ride, 3-gatsu no Lion is not the show for you. Few significant events occurred within the show’s 22 episode runtime. This did mean that it dragged from time to time and I was never on the edge of my seat desperate to see what would happen...next, particularly as I have no real interest in shogi. However, 3-gatsu no Lion persistently ambled along at a relaxed, steady pace, its focus love and its various expressions, including sharing with each other, be that a hobby/interest, a meal, or a special occasion, and the loneliness that we all feel from time to time as human beings. Whilst these two subjects may seem dichotomous, 3-gatsu no Lion, in a contemplative, thoughtful way, wove them together, reminding us that intense loneliness can be remedied through seeking solace in the people around us. At times it can be nice to watch a more contemplative show such as this. Life can often be draining, with its many pressures and demands. Shows such as this can, therefore, act as a soothing balm to a weary soul, encouraging us to unwind and immerse ourselves in its soft, gentle world.Characters3-gatsu no Lion is more character than story-driven. Its characters develop more in their interactions with each other than in response to their circumstances. To me, that is 3-gatsu no Lion’s greatest strength.  It was less about shogi and more about Rei’s poisonous relationship with his adoptive sister, Nikaidou’s one-sided rivalry with Rei (which was often played for comedic effect), Shimada’s sense of obligation towards the people of his hometown, which was both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness, and the Kawamoto sisters’ intense love for each other, which overflowed into love for the lost. And whilst many of these characters’ issues were not resolved, I didn’t feel like that was a problem. I’ve always appreciated the realism of Umino’s works. Sometimes it isn’t possible to wave a magic wand and fix all of your problems, sometimes you will wrestle with an issue for what feels like a lifetime. But, as 3-gatsu no Lion hints, as long as you have the support of the people you love, you can continue to fight without giving up.Art/musicI absolutely adored 3-gatsu no Lion’s art. Umino’s art and character designs are among my favourite of all manga-artists and have transferred well into the medium of anime. The use of soft, pastel colours, beautiful scenery (that often reminded me of Van Gogh’s The Starry Night), and delicate pen/brush strokes, alongside the show’s contemplative, relaxed pace, combined to give the show a real dream-like feel. And whilst its background music wasn’t especially memorable, the opening and ending tracks were also beautiful and emotionally-charged.Overall enjoymentWhilst 3-gatsu no Lion’s meandering pace made me feel restless at times, I found the show to be extremely enjoyable overall. It proved that, with a strong enough cast of characters, a show doesn’t need to be full of action to hold your interest. If your cast are interesting and likeable enough, you’ll care about even the most minor details of their lives and the smallest of trials they undergo. And the cast of 3-gatsu no Lion did just that. They had me watching and waiting to see if they could overcome the difficulties that they faced right until the show’s conclusion. next, particularly as I have no real interest in shogi.

It\'s a surprise for me because i was expecting a depressing drama like Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso, turn out complete opposite of that. What spectacullar about this anime is the character. Rei, the series\' protagonist, resonate with me very close, it feel so real to me what & how he feel.Altough Rei have very different story & living place than me, still i can relate so much with him. For example many characters do not understand...how can he sad, and indeed, for someone so gifted enough as to turn it into a career from a young age how is someone like that be unhappy with what he do?. I think that\'s what people around me think too, but also for myself, ""I should be happy for what i do, why i\'m not?"" that word keep coming to my mind over and over. Then, how Rei keep moving with his life silently and leaving his problems unresolved, this feel so much realistic. Most people have many problem, but mostly rather than solving like much fictional story that just focus on single problem, we usualy leave it there, there is so much more to do & think than just that. I think that one of Sangatsu no Lion message is that okay to have a unressolved problem, it\'s normal, just keep moving foward.People could argue that there is a bit too much comedy in this show. And, certainly, if you are looking only for serious storytelling from start to finish, you may end up feeling somewhat alienated by the end. But this is what real life does, you can cry then five minutes later laugh. Our feeling is not one dimensional. when we depressed because something, we still can be happy because something else, while depressed feeling still there. Our emotion is stacked, not cancel each other. This mean when someone is happy, not mean he is not depressed. And when someone is depressed, not mean he is not happy.The show is not about resloving problem, but about to accept it is part of normal life, and how to overcome it. Also I find more about happiness in this show than any other show. But certainly this show not for everyone, without you resonate with the character i think it will be bit hard to appreciate this show.Many reviews, usualy discuss the anime in a technical way. ""The animation is excellent"", ""the characters well developed"", ""the story is weak"". But Sangatsu no Lion can\'t reviewed that way for me. It feels more real. And so I write something more personal. how can he sad, and indeed, for someone so gifted enough as to turn it into a career from a young age how is someone like that be unhappy with what he do?.

I'd never even heard of it before this anime, yet I still managed to enjoy this so much. So, if you're using shogi as a reason to avoid watching this—stop it.The anime, although it about shogi, does not entirely focus on the game. Throughout the episodes, it gives us enough information in a easy-to-understand-and-process way, so that even total babies to shogi (ahem, me) understand enough of what's going on. It doesn't overload this...information, though, giving the perfect amount, and using the game to present to us a drama anime that works through some of my favourite themes, such as success/failure.The story as a whole is written very well. It doesn't focus on a subject too big that the writers end up having to rush just to get it done, and instead it leaves just the right amount of room to take its time in exploring the characters and their lives, and is thus successful in creating an effective ambiance/feeling around the story and drawing us in. I am a sucker for seamless stories, ones that are able to naturally incorporate various things throughout episodes and then ties them all together for a nice finale, and this anime does just that.Additionally, if you appreciate devices such as symbolism, you'll be in for a treat. The animation in this story is already super appealing, but the way this anime uses symbolism made me really giddy. It tells a story not only through events but through its animation, which was really wonderful.Finally, I'm a huge fan of the main character's interior monologue. It kind of reminds me of The Catcher in the Rye, if you've read it.Overall, definitely give this anime a chance. I can't imagine anyone disliking it (unless, perhaps, you are of a younger age—personally, when I was 10-13 I was more interested in action-packed things—in which case this may not be for you). information, though, giving the perfect amount, and using the game to present to us a drama anime that works through some of my favourite themes, such as success/failure.The story as a whole is written very well.

It works best when it\'s either especially dramatic, or focusing on the warm, but somewhat melancholic relationship between the sisters and Rei. The (to me) most intresting aspect was Reis incredibly negative relationship with his ""sport"", something you rarely see, and defenetly not that well done. That being said, the show kind of fell apart it\'s second half. I think...up to the introduction of his Mentor everything still had enaugh focus, but afterwards, the story shifted it\'s focus way more to Reis school life, which had been mostly glossed over before, and basicly wraps that up in a happy ending in like 4 episodes. The conflict between him, his sister and his dad is dangling in the wind, the 3 sisters never talk to him about it (on screen).... The whole last episode shows reis relationship with shogi in only a positive light, as if it only brought him good things. There wasn\'t enough time spent on his changing  emotions towards it.Art (9)Pretty good, only the toddler looked a bit...wierd... at times. Some of the positive imagery alsso looked too goofy/childich at times, and didn\'t mesh well with the darker images of the show.Sound (6)Can\'t really judge the soundtrack, seemed mediocer. The voice actors on the other hand...most of them were consistently okay, though often overeager. Even in happy moments, more toned down acting would have helped the atmosphere a lot. Rei\'S voice actor sounds really great when he\'s contemplating or talking while holding back or calm, but way to old whenever he has to be loud or energetic. A younger voice would have propably been more convincing.Enjoyment (6)Since i like to suffer, i enjoyed most of it quite a lot! Especially the 3 sisiters and rei\'s interactions were great, and the dramatic stuff. But the aprupt and unfitting end, that didn\'t ty up most of the storys, as well as the implied incest love story /thing/ made me enjoy it a lot less then i should have. It defenetly had more potential, wich only serves to make me angry.OverallStill propably the best anime of that season. If you like characterdriven, moody slice of live Dramas, you should have a good time - or at least something pretty to look at up to the introduction of his Mentor everything still had enaugh focus, but afterwards, the story shifted it\'s focus way more to Reis school life, which had been mostly glossed over before, and basicly wraps that up in a happy ending in like 4 episodes. The conflict between him, his sister and his dad is dangling in the wind, the 3 sisters never talk to him about it (on screen).... The whole last episode shows reis relationship with shogi in only a positive light, as if it only brought him good things. There wasn\'t enough time spent on his changing  emotions towards it.Art (9)Pretty good, only the toddler looked a bit...wierd... at times. Some of the positive imagery alsso looked too goofy/childich at times, and didn\'t mesh well with the darker images of the show.Sound (6)Can\'t really judge the soundtrack, seemed mediocer. The voice actors on the other hand...most of them were consistently okay, though often overeager. Even in happy moments, more toned down acting would have helped the atmosphere a lot. Rei\'S voice actor sounds really great when he\'s contemplating or talking while holding back or calm, but way to old whenever he has to be loud or energetic. A younger voice would have propably been more convincing.Enjoyment (6)Since i like to suffer, i enjoyed most of it quite a lot! Especially the 3 sisiters and rei\'s interactions were great, and the dramatic stuff. But the aprupt and unfitting end, that didn\'t ty up most of the storys, as well as the implied incest love story /thing/ made me enjoy it a lot less then i should have.

I have never seen a show (or really any media) with a cast of such unfolding, believable, multi-dimensional, human characters.3-Gatsu no Lion centers itself on a high-school Shogi player who suffers from overwhelming depression, and lives in relative isolation.  The depression is visualized in absolutely beautiful ways through the animation, the metaphors and the protagonists inner monologue.  And ultimately you find yourself rooting for a...character who fails to see his value and assumes he is burdening all of those around him, while also seeing the outside perspective of how he is touching and shaping the lives of those around him and bettering the world, even though he cannot recognize it.  In spite of the inherently dark themes in the show, it always remains believable and never feels contrived or melodramatic.  And somehow, the show threads the needle and feels really uplifting instead of depressing.And while I think that the story of the protagonist earns this series a 10/10 rating by itself, I find myself getting blown away by how the show handles the side characters.  Every character in this world is incredibly human, and has their own motivations and struggles.  This show constantly subverts expectations by making you root for characters that lesser shows would have left as cliched antagonists or undeveloped background characters.  But 3-Gatsu no Lion lets these 'background characters' step into the foreground, sometimes even drifting away from following the protagonist for a while.  The reality is, the show introduces characters for you to hate, and then you wind up understanding them and sympathizing with them.  Or it sets up characters for you to overlook and then pulls the rug out from under you when you realize that they are just as complex people as the main character and have their own equal struggles.The power of the show is that it is one of the few shows where the main character isn't the center of the universe, but is struggling inside a living breathing world.  And in most shows, the main character is 'special'.  In 3-Gatsu no Lion, he is definitely special, but so is everyone.  This is a show that is filled with characters that all could have been the main character, and that is an impressive feat.  And it also makes the main character's struggles more real and meaningful.I may be biased in that 3-Gatsu no Lion perfectly fits within my stylistic preference for shows (along with shows like Oregairu and Natsume Yuujincho).  But 3-Gatsu no Lion is the most 'human' show I've ever seen, and I think is a must-watch for anyone who likes Slice-of-Life shows, or emotional/uplifting shows.

This is especially so for me, since  I am not the type of person who really enjoys slice of life / coming of age very well, so seeing one executed well is a good treat.Also I think it can be said that a lot of the story is based on the character development of our main character. And while the MC does indeed get a lot of screen time and development, it seems that the story does a pretty sloppy, or has a pretty shallow representation of the ""depression"" our MC is going through. It...starts off pretty well represented, but I think it gets undermined most of the time of the story for the rest of the story.I\'d say this is my biggest criticism of the story. The MC has so many crutches to get rid of his depression, like for example, the fact that everyone around him basically wants him to get better, just pretty damn unrealistic. The fact that people naturally surround him. Also, for a guy who wants to make friends, he is pretty damn cold to Nikaido, so that just doesn\'t make sense. Plus, my second is the whole dramatization. His parents died. He\'s emotionally scarred and alone. He also separates an entire family by himself. We g o t    i t. This plot seems more like a drama than anything.I also understand. It\'s an anime/manga, perhaps it doesn\'t need to be so realistic, right? Well, the story is grounded on slice of life, so I would disagree. It should be believable. I mean, I think NHK does a better job of offering a narrative on depression of some sort, even though it\'s comedic. It\'s a little nonsensical and the author gets it, there are always bizarre scenarios, while this show seems to want to be more realistic, so it should also offer a more realistic narrative too.Still pretty good though, just some things that could have been improved. I appreciate an anime about shogi, since I myself am a westerner, I\'ve never played shogi, obviously I played chess instead. Knowing talented chess players, not one myself, I at least understand what the people in 3 Gatsu lion and the parallels between Chess and shogi, so it was pretty informative. starts off pretty well represented, but I think it gets undermined most of the time of the story for the rest of the story.I\'d say this is my biggest criticism of the story.

It's vivid art style perfectly suits the show with it's heavy use of simile and metaphor for intense feelings and emotions. The show falls short for me, however, with what I think is it's more secondary theme: competitive spirit, and often just makes me wish the show would return to the aspects...I love.When I say the show is a Slife of Life Drama I mean that the narrative structure is that of a Slife of Life show with no one clear narrative outside of following the lives of the characters but with elements of drama in some tough struggles the characters encounter or have encountered. And even as I say that, it isn't just drama elements throughout the show either. In fact, the show offers a counter to it's drama elements in the form of the Kawamoto sisters and their day-to-day interactions. I absolutely love it. Not only does the show give you a good drama ... but also a heartwarming release from it. Sorry to be cliche about it, but it's the complete package lol.The main character, Kiriyama Rei, is a bit of a cliche (non-social, tragic backstory with family), but I do think this show pulls it off. I could be a bit biased; I'm sure a specific demographic I most certainly fall into is the one this character is meant to pull in, but it succeeded. The support he receives from all the other characters makes me envious of him but also extremely happy for him. I also love his strained relationship with his foster family, particularly his sister Kyouko. They cannot stand being near each other, yet somehow they still seem to care for each other and preserve the relationship. Kyouko can't help but rely on and find comfort in spending time with Rei despite her very clear animosity toward him. Perhaps it is only because she doesn't have anyone else to confide in, but she still needs that comfort. On the other hand, Rei was bullied quite frequently by Kyouko as a child and dislikes her nature of sewing internal conflict, yet he still stands up to men far older and stronger than him for her sake. I kinda wish I could have seen more from Kyouko to be honest, but I still love most of what I got from the other characters that got focus.Where the show doesn't work as well for me is when it goes in-depth with shogi unfortunately. Sometimes it does quite well, other times the show is too heavily reliant on symbolism to try and make you understand what's happening in the game and what the players are feeling. I don't really find symbolism effective if I can't tell how the symbolism applies to what it is symbolizing. I have a good idea of how the game works, but there's just too much to take in on the board for me to understand what is happening at a glance. Part of me feels like the writer could just be b.s.ing the shogi out of convenience for the narrative and covering it up with the symbolism, but I can't really tell. The show does use symbolism well in many other places though for sure, and the visual representations of that symbolism is a wonder to look at; it just really feels like overkill sometimes in the shogi matches.But the art style though, I really love it. It perfectly captures the mood on screen no matter what it is. If it's dark and depressing there might be some thick and rough black shading; if it's cheerful there will likely be lots of clear bright colors; and if it's a moment of heartfelt the sunlight will just blast into the pane. I think the way the lines in the character eyes are drawn in are even altered in specific ways to match their feelings (I didn't go back to confirm though, please forgive). And the slow changes in character expressions ... it just really makes you appreciate the art form.And the show is so heartfelt. It actually had me crying on multiple occasions. The way the characters feel in every scene is so well conveyed that I couldn't help but cry from all the changing and mixing emotions, especially from Rei. If what you want most in a show are heartfelt stories of character growth then I couldn't really think of a better show for you than this one. Back to why I think the cliche in Rei's character works, it's because the low starting point makes his growth that much more gratifying to see.Please watch this show. Maybe some parts of it will be a bit overplayed for you as it was for me, but you shouldn't mind it compared to what the show does extraordinarily well: it's character writing.

It's a show I would rewatch over and over again.Strange how the main character, Kiriyama Rei, is in high school, but my expectation of a gloomy high schooler was turned down. The story intertwines high school and adult life in a very subtle and clever way. I couldn't help but be fond of each characters' stories, not one character is boring out there. Plus, shogi is an interesting strategy sport, as I also play xiangqi (Chinese chess), it definitely excites me.Constantly, the need to change and people's expectations of us...push us ahead, but every once in a while, there's something that keeps coming back and knocking you down. At times, you struggle with yourself, trying to get up. That kind of feeling is frustrating. I felt that in the show.At the end of the day, we all get to pick every piece of us, and put them back together, go out there, give it another try.Sangatsu no Lion gave me the courage. It changed my life in the most beautiful and significant way. push us ahead, but every once in a while, there's something that keeps coming back and knocking you down.

It changed my life in the most beautiful and significant way."", '(This review covers both seasons)March comes in like a lion is a niche show. It is not a show I would recommend to the average anime watcher because of the nature of the show. Slice-of-life shows like this one tend to be slow and uneventful with no real plot. This kind of genre does not appeal to most people and I recognize that fact yet I believe this show is one of the best of its kind (at least from what I\'ve watched so far).THINGS THIS SHOW DOES WELL/I LIKE:CharactersI think this show does a great job of introducing realistic and relatable characters that do...not rely on cliche anime tropes that we see all too often. The writers humanize the ""villains"" in the story, introducing the ambiguous aspect of human nature that Kiriyama observes. I can appreciate the fact that even minor characters get their stories shared and they\'re not just Kiriyama\'s opponents but people with hopes, dreams, and goals. Furthermore, I love it when a show relies on character-based comedy to introduce some light-hearted moments in an otherwise dense show. The majority of the characters are likable and make the show a very entertaining watch. The three sisters add a very wholesome element to the show and Kiriyama has become one of my favorite characters because of his immense growth throughout the show and his relatability.AnimationThis show has one of the most unique animation styles I have seen. It\'s not exactly a crisp animation style if that makes sense. To me, it\'s more of an artistic animation style. The show also has no qualms with switching the style every now and again to set the tone or emphasize an emotion or a metaphor. I think that is one of the reasons why this show is so special and why some moments hit so hard. Sometimes, it almost has a cinematic feel which I really like. The animation also does a very good job of portraying emotions. Kiriyama\'s mouth alone portrays so many of his thoughts and emotions which I think is really good. The eyes provide a similar effect as well and look very unique.SoundtrackAlthough the OST is good yet unnoticeable in a lot of the minor scenes, it creates a very impactful effect in the major scenes of the anime.MetaphorsThe metaphors in this show are very appropriate and thoughtful. They\'re not cheesy or over-the-top like some other shows and they complement the characters and/or scenes very nicely.THINGS THIS SHOW DOES NOT DO WELL/I DON\'T LIKE:PacingThis show has a pacing issue, especially during the early shogi matches in season 1. Despite the fact that I like watching slice-of-life and slow writing does not really discourage me from watching a particular show, I found some of the scenes hard to watch because of how slow they were. Although I do recognize that some of the scenes are slow for a purpose whether it is for elaborating on a metaphor or verbalizing a character\'s thoughts, if the pacing was altered, I would find the show a bit easier to watch.Unfinished Plot Points/CharactersThis show has many characters and plot points that are not completed (however, this would all be solved with a season 3). Akari, for example, is grossly underutilized in my opinion. Although Hina does a very good job in both seasons, I feel that she takes the spotlight and Akari is glossed over a majority of the time with the exception of a few scenes. Characters like Gotou and Kyoko are completely neglected in the second season which is unfortunate because I feel they still had some room for development and involvement in the story. Shimada’s story ends in defeat with no hope of redemption. He\'s represented in the story as the embodiment of hard work but doesn\'t get a title or any recognition to show for it. Kiriyama doesn\'t get a title and is left as a player with a lot of room for growth. He also never plays Nikaidou which was an event that I thought would happen.CONCLUSIONI would probably rate the entire show an 8.5/10 with season 1 being rated a little lower than season 2. Although it was slow at times, it was a show I thoroughly enjoyed nonetheless and I watched it twice all the way through.

A great show.', ""Visually and emotionally engrossing but intellectually misplaced, this show struggles most at maintaining a focal core to its story, undermining its originally interesting characters. This nebulous nature is demonstrable most by disregarding the emotional struggles of the protagonist. The advancement of story plot by becoming a sports-esque shonen midway through the show abandoned our initial premise of a numbed and enervated youth, struggling with self-discovery and plagued by a fear of straying from routinely methodical thinking. The transition in show style itself is not necessarily at fault, rather that the execution lended itself poorly to the furtherment of the characters. This striking offence widens even...greater when the show eventually doesn't even follow the main protagonist, who becomes relegated to a support character with no influence over the story whatsoever. After this, the rest of the watching experience becomes waiting for the show to run out of episodes and come to a close.Art is above average. Sound is above average.

After this event, Rei becomes self-reliant and chooses a solitary lifestyle, but he is later adopted by a family with whom he spends several years of his life. Masachika is the head of the family and a friend of Rei\'s father; he became interested in the boy when he noticed Rei\'s talent for shogi and soon became his mentor. As a...player himself, Masachika is very demanding of his children, Kyouko and Ayumu, regarding shogi; he naturally expects his children to follow this path and become great professional players. Although both of them are good and work hard, Rei ends up naturally standing out, proving to be a true shogi genius. These circumstances become a source of discord and rivalry, and for this reason, Rei feels guilty about being integrated into another family and decides to live alone.The Kawamoto Sisters in Relation to Kiriyama:Finally, as a completely closed-off boy not belonging to any social circle, he finds refuge in a humble family composed of three sisters—Akari, Hinata, and Momo Kawamoto—and their grandfather, who opened their arms to understand and accept him as a family member. Rei\'s entry into this new family environment was the turning point in his life, aiming at both individual and collective growth, allowing him to feel loved once again. Above all, the care this new family had for Rei awakened in him the feeling of love and the real meaning of family that he so desperately needed. Their living environment is cozy, humorous, and above all, happy. You can feel this ""warmth"" of good feelings overflowing through the screen, as through Rei\'s sad eyes, we gradually realize that such things can exist. Thus, Kiriyama begins to form bonds with them, even without realizing it at first, because despite the contrast between two worlds, both sides have gone through numerous traumas, and thus empathy between the parties began to flourish.The Importance of Secondary Characters:In this work, secondary characters are prominently featured, and some of them have their own arcs, exploring their lives, personal dramas, and, in the case of players, how shogi is involved in all of this, whether as an escape valve or as a lifeline. Thus, throughout the narrative, each of the numerous characters ends up impacting Kiriyama (whether directly or indirectly) regarding his perception of the world and life. Gradually, his protective shell begins to crack, creating small cracks where light begins to enter—visually demonstrated by the anime. Throughout the two seasons of Sangatsu no Lion, this becomes increasingly noticeable, culminating in a mixture of shared experiences, where all encounters and people have their due importance.Kiriyama as a Character and How His Feelings Are Portrayed in the Anime:Initially, Kiriyama is depicted as solitary and depressed, with shogi as the sole focus of his existence. Thus, he spends every spare minute of his day studying, practicing, and participating in tournaments, to the point of neglecting even personal care, such as eating and drinking water, because when Kiriyama is immersed in shogi, he diverts his attention and pours all his feelings into it. Therefore, being an introspective character allows for a more intimate and personal narrative about Kiriyama; initially, we do not see the character being eloquent or anything of the sort, but his thoughts and feelings continue nonetheless. Despite appearing calm and serene on the outside, internally Kiriyama battles fiercely against his own fears, anxiety, loneliness, and depression, even though he is aware of it all, he knows he is in the midst of this turbulent sea but still drowning and unable to hold on to anything. It\'s just inevitable.Visuals and Soundtrack:When such thoughts reach him, the anime treats him with stunning and experimental visuals, constructed in a way to make everything beautiful, where the technical aspect fits perfectly with the plot\'s proposal. The chosen colors are very well utilized and contribute significantly to conveying the sensations of the scenes and their metaphors, where Kiriyama submerges himself in water and drowns, demonstrating how complicated his feelings and thoughts are. The soundtrack manages to accompany the feelings conveyed by the anime well. It follows every mood swing, embraces sad moments, and explodes with moments of comic relief and celebration. The animation is consistent and common to works of the genre, without major differences, because the work is very emotive, close-ups on the characters\' faces or plans in which actions are executed in silence are common, highlighting the events and conveying a sense of tension to the viewer.Viewer Immersion:The work manages to address various themes inherent to human nature in a sensitive and close manner, whether delicate or not. It is possible to feel the characters\' frustration, despair, and euphoria up close. We vibrate with their small victories and cry with their failures; it\'s as if we ourselves were feeling those emotions, the sensations of abandonment, of not fitting in among others, of striving to be strong for someone. All the feelings represented in this work are common to any person, so it is easy for the viewer to feel connected to the characters because they are as human in their feelings and sufferings as we are. The part about shogi is a show in itself, what at first seems boring and uninteresting becomes fun, as the work itself assumes that ""shogi is boring"" and decides, at a certain point, to teach children (and the viewer) how to play shogi. In a fun and relaxed way, it tries to better explain how the shogi board works, something the viewer wants to know, since the protagonist lives for this game.""Sincerity"":Furthermore, the anime emphasizes the importance of sharing problems, even the most trivial ones, and makes us aware that there will always be people around us willing to help us. Sangatsu no Lion is a work where there is no fear of talking about feelings, regardless of age, gender, or situation. The characters laugh and cry wholeheartedly. Every falling tear, every hearty laugh, and every desperate scream are so sincere that they become visceral. The best word to define this work is sincerity; the way it explores the importance of human relationships, the connections between us, and how they can save us from our deepest pits of loneliness—just as it did with Kiriyama.-----------------------------------------------------------------------Review do porquê esse é o meu anime favorito (Versão em Português):Introdução da História.A princípio, acompanhamos a vida de Rei Kiriyama, jovem que acumula diversas tragédias no seu passado, como a morte dos seus pais e da sua irmã mais nova em um acidente. Após esse acontecimento, Rei passa a ser dependente de si mesmo e optar por um estilo de vida solitário, porém, futuramente ele é adotado por uma família, com quem passou a viver por vários anos da sua vida. Masachika é o chefe da família e amigo do pai de Rei, ele interessou-se pelo garoto quando percebeu que ele possuía talento para o shogi e logo passou a ser seu professor. Por ser um jogador, Masachika é muito exigente com os seus filhos, Kyouko e Ayumu, no que concerne o shogi, ele espera naturalmente que os seus filhos sigam esse caminho e se tornem grandes jogadores profissionais. Apesar de os dois serem bons e se esforçarem, Rei acaba por se destacar naturalmente, apresentando-se como um verdadeiro gênio do shogi. Essas circunstâncias tornam-se um fator de discórdia e rivalidade, e por esse motivo Rei se sente culpado de estar infiltrado em outra família e então decide então morar sozinho.Irmãs Kawamoto em relação ao Kiriyama.Por fim, sendo um garoto totalmente fechado e não pertencente a nenhuma bolha social, ele encontrou refúgio em uma família humilde composta por três irmãs — Akari, Hinata e Momo Kawamoto — e o seu avô, que abriram os braços para compreendê-lo e aceitá-lo como membro da família. A entrada de Rei neste novo ambiente familiar foi o estopim para a guinada em sua vida, visando tanto o individual como o coletivo e, assim, ele pôde, mais uma vez, sentir-se amado. Sobretudo, o cuidado que essa nova família tinha com Rei, despertou nele a sensação do amor e do real significado de família, que ele tanto precisava. O ambiente de convívio deles é aconchegante, engraçado e principalmente feliz. É possível sentir esse “calor” de bons sentimentos transbordando pela tela, pois pelos olhos tristes de Rei, vamos percebendo que essas coisas podem existir. Assim, Kiriyama passa a criar laços com elas mesmo sem perceber no início, pois apesar do contraste entre dois mundos, ambos os lados passaram por inúmeros traumas, e assim a empatia entre as partes começou a florescer.A importância dos personagens secundários.Nessa obra, os personagens secundários têm bastante destaque, e alguns deles têm os seus arcos próprios, que exploram a sua vida, os seus dramas pessoais e, no caso dos jogadores, a forma como o shogi se envolve com tudo isso, seja como válvula de escape ou como uma bóia salva-vidas. Sendo assim, ao decorrer da narrativa cada um dos inúmeros personagens acaba por impactar Kiriyama (seja de forma direta ou indireta) sobre a sua percepção de mundo e vida. Aos poucos, a sua casca de proteção vai se rompendo e criando pequenas frestas, onde a luz começa a entrar — o anime faz questão de demonstrar isso visualmente. Ao longo das duas temporadas de Sangatsu no Lion isso se torna cada vez mais perceptível, onde no final o resultado é um mesclado de troca de experiências, onde todos os encontros e pessoas tem a sua devida importância.Kiriyama como personagem e como seus sentimentos são retratados no anime.A princípio Kiriyama se apresentava com solitário e depressivo, tendo o shogi como foco único da sua existência. Passando assim, cada minuto livre do seu dia estudando, praticando e participando de torneios, a ponto de relegar até mesmo cuidados pessoais, como comer e beber água, pois nos momentos em que o Kiriyama estava imerso no shogi, ele desviava a sua atenção e colocava todos os seus sentimentos. Sendo assim, por ser um personagem introspectivo, isso possibilita uma narrativa mais intimista e pessoal acerca de Kiriyama, ou seja, principalmente no início, não veremos o personagem sendo eloquente e nada do tipo, porém os seus pensamentos e sentimentos não param. Apesar de ser aparentemente calma e sereno por fora, internamente Kiriyama travava lutas ferrenhas contra os seus próprios medos, ansiedade, solidão e depressão, mesmo tendo a consciência de tudo isso, ele sabe que está no meio desse mar turbulento, mas ainda assim está se afogando e não consegue se agarrar a nada. É apenas inevitável.Visual e Trilha sonora.Nos momentos em que esse tipo de pensamento chega até ele, o anime literalmente o trata com um visual arrebatador e experimental, construído de uma forma a tornar tudo muito belo, onde a parte técnica se adequa perfeitamente à proposta da trama. As cores escolhidas são muito bem utilizadas e contribuem bastante para transmissão das sensações das cenas e as suas metáforas, onde o Kiriyama se submerge em água e se afoga, demonstrando o quão complicado são seus sentimentos e pensamentos. A trilha sonora consegue acompanhar bem os sentimentos passados pelo anime. Segue cada subida e descida de humor, abraça os momentos tristes e explode com os momentos de alívio cômico e celebração. A animação é consistente e comum às obras do gênero, sem grandes diferenciais, pois pelo fato da obra ser muito emotiva, são comuns closes no rosto dos personagens ou os planos nos quais ações são executadas em silêncio, dando destaque para os acontecimentos e transmitindo o sentimento de tensão ao espectador.Imersão do espectador.A obra consegue abordar diversos temas inerentes à natureza humana de forma sensível e próxima, sejam eles delicados ou não. É possível sentir de perto a frustração dos personagens, o desespero, a euforia. Vibramos com as suas pequenas vitórias e choramos com as suas falhas; é como se fôssemos nós mesmos a sentir aquelas emoções, as sensações de abandono, de não se encaixar entre os demais, de se esforçar para ser forte por alguém. Todos os sentimentos representados nesta obra são comuns a qualquer pessoa, por isso é fácil para o espectador sentir-se conectado aos personagens, pois eles são tão humanos, nos seus sentimentos e sofrimentos, quanto nós. A parte de shogi é um show à parte, o que a primeiro momento aparenta ser chato e desinteressante se torna divertido, já que a própria obra parte do pressuposto de que “shogi é chato” e decide, em um certo momento, ensinar às crianças (e ao espectador) como jogar shogi. De forma divertida e descontraída, ele tenta situar melhor o funcionamento do tabuleiro de shogi, algo que o espectador vai querendo saber, já que o protagonista vive em função desse jogo.“Sinceridade”.Ademais, o anime faz questão de enfatizar a importância de dividir os problemas, mesmo aqueles mais banais, além de nos conscientizar de que sempre existirão pessoas ao nosso redor dispostas a nos auxiliar. Sangatsu no Lion é uma obra onde não há medo de falar sobre sentimentos, independentemente da idade, do sexo ou da situação. Os personagens riem e choram com vontade. Cada lágrima em queda livre, cada riso escancarado e cada grito desesperado chegam a ser viscerais de tão sinceros. A melhor palavra para definir essa obra é sinceridade; a forma como ela explora a importância das relações humanas, das conexões entre nós e como elas podem nos salvar dos nossos mais profundos poços de solidão — assim como foi com Kiriyama. player himself, Masachika is very demanding of his children, Kyouko and Ayumu, regarding shogi; he naturally expects his children to follow this path and become great professional players. Although both of them are good and work hard, Rei ends up naturally standing out, proving to be a true shogi genius. These circumstances become a source of discord and rivalry, and for this reason, Rei feels guilty about being integrated into another family and decides to live alone.The Kawamoto Sisters in Relation to Kiriyama:Finally, as a completely closed-off boy not belonging to any social circle, he finds refuge in a humble family composed of three sisters—Akari, Hinata, and Momo Kawamoto—and their grandfather, who opened their arms to understand and accept him as a family member.

No other anime demonstrates such a profound sense of empathy for others. It seamlessly makes you feel every emotion there is, without resorting to unrealistic melodrama. Every character is immensely complex and rich with nuance and emotion. The art and sound design is consistently beautiful with a unique sense of style and direction that only a Shaft show can provide. The more time you spend with it, the more you understand just how truly special of an anime it is.The show's pace may not be for everyone, but if you're willing to sit back and let it wash over...you, you're in for a one-of-a-kind experience. you, you're in for a one-of-a-kind experience."", 'I don\'t know where to start...This anime is absolutely amazing, I must say after the first few episodes, I was completely hooked and was unable to stop watching the show. And while I did find a few moments which I would say were a bit ""boring"", for the most part the anime did its best to keep all my attention focused specifically on it.Now, to start off, I will straight up say that you should only watch this anime if you are okay with exploring in depth themes, emotions and more adult-like content. Without delving too much into this, the anime talks a lot about...depression, the effects of depression, and how it can completely crush an individual. As such, I highly recommend avoiding this anime if you are uncomfortable with these themes.On the other hand, if you are capable of understanding and handling these themes, then I fully recommend it, as this anime not only handles it well, but rather handles it excellently. Furthermore, many of the shortcoming you might find in this season, will be fixed in the 2nd season (Which is a masterpiece on my opinion.)Below I will delve into the main categories of this show;Story 10/10:As mentioned above, the story of March Comes in like a lion revolves around depression, and how it affects the main character, as well as him slowly getting through it, in this regard the story is absolutely amazing, it treats depression as a serious issue, and unlike other anime I have seen, there are a lot of moments when it feels like the issue is barely being resolved, giving this a very mature and realistic progression throughout the show.Art 9/10:While unlike season 2, the art style doesn\'t have any very memorable highly-detailed scenes, there is a very good combination and transitions of pure darkness when needed, to beautiful imagery and light in order to show happiness and tranquility, in that regard, while the art style might not be detailed, the great use of lighting and environment have definitely been great.Sound 8/10:There are a good number of good OSTs in the show, but nothing really memorable apart from two of them.Character 9/10:The characters are pretty well detailed, each have their own problems and they are well written to be integrated inside the story. And yes, characters become even better in the 2nd season.Enjoyment 7/10:I overall enjoyed watching this anime, and I would gladly re-watch it if I will ever have enough time for it. The only reason why I am not rating this higher is because of a few scenes, which genuinely made me feel bored.Overall 9/10:I highly recommend this. depression, the effects of depression, and how it can completely crush an individual.

It\'s usually most of the time a ""hit or miss"" situation. Since it\'s a genre that is one of the hardest to flesh out and give the viewers or readers alike, something they would find worthwhile. In many cases, things like character progression are uncommon and hard to fit in. I don\'t know how to explain it well, but more or less, it\'s hard to create a story that elevates the slice of life elements in a good and enjoyable way. However, there are few shows...out there who can accomplish this and so much more. Sangatsu no Lion is such a phenomenon, and it does it incredibly well and thorough. This anime takes the slice of life elements and digs deep into the emotional aspect to really give us a feeling of what those characters are feeling. The thing is, it\'s not just related to the main character. More or less anyone, even a side figure you would find forgettable in the long run, gets that time in the spotlight. Not to mention, the author - Umino Chika, alongside the incredible - Shaft studio, does a tremendous job of adapting this story on the big screen. It\'s one of the few I would consider having a perfect adaptation. I have not read the manga myself yet, but from what others are telling me. I am confident in saying so.StoryFirst off, Sangatsu no Lion is a heavily character-driven story, there is, in other words, no set goal. Although, once you start moving places, you will see arcs with their own specific objective. That said, Sangatsu no Lion won\'t give the answer straight to you. One has to look at the whole picture and piece together what it\'s telling you. At least, at some points. Shogi is a crucial component and tool in Sangatsu no Lion. It\'s used in the most unexpected ways. There are times when we get to learn the rules of shogi through some cute stories of cats. But at the end of the day, I wouldn\'t be worried too much if you can\'t understand all those sharp and seriously in-depth games. As long as you acknowledge that it tells a story through shogi, you will be fine. Much of the psychological elements, to behavior, actions, mannerism, and all that good stuff is clearly conveyed through the games of shogi. That\'s one of the reasons which make Sangatsu no Lion stand out from other anime. It does it delicately and is not afraid to play the long game. But at the end of it all. The pay-off more than enough makes up for it, if anything. Oh, not only that. The sounds of shogi pieces smacking on the board are oddly satisfying. I can\'t be the only one that thought that, right?On top of that, Rei\'s inner monologuing adds even more flavor to an already fantastic anime adaptation. Above all that, Sangatsu no lion uses a good deal of metaphors through visual and psychological. In an incredibly fascinating, captivating way. In other words, it\'s also a highly complex anime and certainly not for everyone but more on that later. Among others, it does a great job of depicting life realistically. The good it carries, the bad, and how this affects anyone in either a terrible depressive. Or a more positive and happy way. In which case, it shows us how loneliness affects our ways of thinking and how it can be dangerous to not surround yourself with warmth if possible. Moreover, it shows the process of opening up to others in great detail, like many other aspects. It\'s not as easy as it sounds, a human being can be quite stubborn and shy even. It goes through all of that in extensive detail. Expect it to be quite comprehensive and delve deep, so, at the end of the road, you will understand the character far better than you would think at first.  I said it before, and I will repeat it once more. Sangatsu no Lion is not afraid to bring up any side character and totally take them apart. So you can fully understand their reasoning and philosophy for life among so much else you have to watch to believe.It\'s true that Sangatsu no Lion tells a depressive and dark story, but there is some comedy to be had. In fact, it balances out that aspect so exceptionally well that it never ceases to astound me when the mood changes at the drop of a hat. Sangatsu no Lion will not only give you a highly impacting character-driven story. But the wholesome moments which will heal you when you are down in the dumps are here too. It\'s so cute and fluffy, all at once, that it will definitely ease the pain from the more darker parts of the story. I mean, if it was hopeless and gloomy all at times, it might have ended up as a double-edged sword. So this is a nice touch that gives your mind a break from the dark for a moment. When we do take a break, you can also expect to see some food-related themes and in a general sense. My recommendation is to always have something to eat with you. Or you will, for a fact, regret it when you see some amazingly tasty-looking anime food on your screen.Oh, let me add this one too, but I won\'t delve too deep into this topic for obvious reasons. Sangatsu no Lion does have a slow romance that, in fact, builds up over time as our character progress. Just don\'t watch it for that reason since you would come out disappointed if you are a hardcore romance fan, I imagine. It\'s not the main topic. This anime is trying to mess around with. That said, it gradually and tastefully builds up in the background, and it\'s so damn cute not gonna lie. I also want to point out that Sangatsu no Lion has one of my top favorite arcs in anime and manga as a whole. Only a few come close if you ask me. So studio shaft did a fantastic job of adapting this one arc, especially. Everything to the direction and execution harmonized with each other perfectly and hit all the right notes. It\'s a common theme delved into anime or manga, but only some manage to a great job of executing it. Sangatsu no Lion is one of those very few that actually went the extra mile and blew this one out of the park.Now the first season tells a great story by itself. Still, the second season is in a completely different league altogether. But one thing is sure if it was not for the first season is a significant success hitting all the right notes in the right place. The second season would no doubt be near as emotionally impacting. Expect to cry, expect to laugh, and expect to notice many emotions you didn\'t think you already had. Sangatsu no Lion is one of a kind in that way. You will definitely not regret watching this classic if you are looking for an incredibly intricate character-driven story with shogi elements and a dash of tasteful romance.SoundWhen it comes to the instruments, effects, any kind of sound at all in Sangatsu, no Lion is impactful and feels real. Studio Shaft nails every little detail, regardless of what type of mood we are in at the moment. It definitely complements nicely with the art-style to boot, which is another highly positive component. More on that soon. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and hits right on the dot with different vibes. You will be surprised at how one tune will make you all happy-go-lucky inside, but the next might gives you immense goosebumps and hit hard where it hurts the most. On top of that, every opening song relies on symbolism, and the songs by itself are top-notch. My favorite is the first opening song by Bump of Chicken and OMG! I love the meaning of those lyrics. It\'s so vast and meaningful to Rei as a character. I also love the first and second ending song. One by the same artist and the other by Kenshi Yonezu. Both are wonderful, and I love it way too much. Let\'s not forget about the first season-opening two, which is also just great. Not my cup of tea in terms of the song, but it\'s just as important and impacting as the rest of the opening and endings.ArtThe art tells its own story, and that\'s not empty words mind you. Since studio Shaft does an absolutely phenomenal job of conveying all kinds of emotions, feelings, regret, sorrow, and even sadness through that simple but extremely expressive art-style. On top of that, the coloring is spot-on. If it\'s dark, the art gets darkened and a more greyish tone but still being very colorful. For comedy, it feels fluffy, shiny, and happy, and so forth.  It never ceases to astound me since the art-style color palette always hits on the mark when it comes to our character\'s mood. This is Shaft we are talking about, and it should be as expected. But this is no easy thing to make a reality, so you have to give some insane credits for accomplishing this. Not to mention keeping it the norm as it gets even more intricate and intense as you move on to the second season. Let\'s also not forget to appreciate the highly detailed background. They are so damn beautiful, and more or less, each frame is worthy of becoming a wallpaper. Its amazing Shaft has been able to accomplish something like this and kept it going strong. I can\'t even imagine if the next seasons come around. It will surely be on another level once again.CharactersAs previously stated, characters play a considerable role in Sangatsu no Lion. Let\'s talk about our main - Rei Kiriyama for a moment. I don\'t know how to put it without falling into spoilers territory. However, his progress from the first season to the second season is stunningly executed. It was realistic in terms of how long it took for him to change and accept reality and embrace it tightly. At first, Rei comes off as a negative and depressive guy who just doesn\'t seem to have any purpose in life. He seems to be at the end of the road and could break at any point now. You can\'t really blame him either when you learn his side of the story, and all hell he had to go through. Everyone is in for a surprise when they find out how he is still somewhat going and not completely given up at life. Regardless, what I am trying to get across here is that Rei is an entirely different person from his first season counterpart. Without a shadow of out, one of the best-written characters and the development is tastefully and very satisfying executed step by step. I am focusing more on Rei as to no spoil some other major characters. Don\'t let that make you assume they don\'t get the spotlight, though. Since as I have made it abundantly clear by now, they do and then some.The NegativeSuffice to say Sangatsu no Lion is not for everyone. The pacing is very slow, but it gives room for additional brilliant and emotionally profound and thorough character development. That one arc, especially, just blew me away, and I was an utter mess through it. Though, that\'s only the beginning. During one of the shogi matches. I was conflicted with myself in whom I should root for. Both characters had their own noble reasons for fighting. However, fleshing them out through emotionally packing backstory and shogi put me in a tight spot. Who did I fancy more? Who did I want to win? All kinds of similar thoughts were swirling inside my head. And I was at war with myself more times than I could possibly count. Sangatsu no Lion made me feel all sorts of emotions I thought I didn\'t have to put it plain and simple.But sadly, not without faults. If I had to point out some ""issues,"" It would have to be the inconsistency in pacing like you skipped an episode. This was not common, but when it happened, it was definitely a bothersome sensation. Sometimes it also felt like character bonds were established way too quickly with the supporting cast and not giving it enough room to develop first. On top of that, Sangatsu no Lion has en huge cast, and I wished many more got explored and revived attention. Regardless of all the mentioned problems, do take it with a large grain of salt. While I did want somethings were handled even more delicately. At the end of the day, I have much more praise than things to pick on with Sangatsu no Lion. Undoubtedly, I had an absolute blast watching it, and without a shadow of a doubt. It\'s now one of my all-time favorite anime and one of the best out there to boot, no question asked. Not to mention, it\'s not like this is not something a sequel or reading ahead in the manga can fix, so it\'s really not that much a problem if you look it at that way.ConclusionI highly encourage and recommend Sangatsu no Lion with all my heart to everyone who wants to experience life and even characters depicted realistically in anime. And so much more, you can\'t even begin to imagine. It\'s one of a kind and an absolute must-watch absolutely. Definitely, one of the few I would say you should watch at some point in your life. Sadly, it\'s clearly not for everyone since it handles some rather dense and complex topics. It all comes down to if you are interested in that kind of intensity. That said, do not be afraid to give it a shot, and you might find yourself pleasantly surprised. It\'s a unique slice of life and not the usual kind executed with a lot of love and care. Every frame had a lot of love care put into it. Studio Shaft embedded it all in warm light and made it feel so alive and colorful. You can tell this is a director and production team that actually cares about the viewers. Sangatsu no Lion is undoubtedly a classic and one of the best anime I have watched in recent years. out there who can accomplish this and so much more. Sangatsu no Lion is such a phenomenon, and it does it incredibly well and thorough. This anime takes the slice of life elements and digs deep into the emotional aspect to really give us a feeling of what those characters are feeling. The thing is, it\'s not just related to the main character. More or less anyone, even a side figure you would find forgettable in the long run, gets that time in the spotlight. Not to mention, the author - Umino Chika, alongside the incredible - Shaft studio, does a tremendous job of adapting this story on the big screen. It\'s one of the few I would consider having a perfect adaptation. I have not read the manga myself yet, but from what others are telling me. I am confident in saying so.StoryFirst off, Sangatsu no Lion is a heavily character-driven story, there is, in other words, no set goal. Although, once you start moving places, you will see arcs with their own specific objective. That said, Sangatsu no Lion won\'t give the answer straight to you. One has to look at the whole picture and piece together what it\'s telling you. At least, at some points. Shogi is a crucial component and tool in Sangatsu no Lion. It\'s used in the most unexpected ways. There are times when we get to learn the rules of shogi through some cute stories of cats. But at the end of the day, I wouldn\'t be worried too much if you can\'t understand all those sharp and seriously in-depth games. As long as you acknowledge that it tells a story through shogi, you will be fine. Much of the psychological elements, to behavior, actions, mannerism, and all that good stuff is clearly conveyed through the games of shogi. That\'s one of the reasons which make Sangatsu no Lion stand out from other anime. It does it delicately and is not afraid to play the long game. But at the end of it all. The pay-off more than enough makes up for it, if anything. Oh, not only that. The sounds of shogi pieces smacking on the board are oddly satisfying. I can\'t be the only one that thought that, right?On top of that, Rei\'s inner monologuing adds even more flavor to an already fantastic anime adaptation. Above all that, Sangatsu no lion uses a good deal of metaphors through visual and psychological. In an incredibly fascinating, captivating way. In other words, it\'s also a highly complex anime and certainly not for everyone but more on that later. Among others, it does a great job of depicting life realistically. The good it carries, the bad, and how this affects anyone in either a terrible depressive. Or a more positive and happy way. In which case, it shows us how loneliness affects our ways of thinking and how it can be dangerous to not surround yourself with warmth if possible. Moreover, it shows the process of opening up to others in great detail, like many other aspects. It\'s not as easy as it sounds, a human being can be quite stubborn and shy even. It goes through all of that in extensive detail. Expect it to be quite comprehensive and delve deep, so, at the end of the road, you will understand the character far better than you would think at first.  I said it before, and I will repeat it once more. Sangatsu no Lion is not afraid to bring up any side character and totally take them apart. So you can fully understand their reasoning and philosophy for life among so much else you have to watch to believe.It\'s true that Sangatsu no Lion tells a depressive and dark story, but there is some comedy to be had. In fact, it balances out that aspect so exceptionally well that it never ceases to astound me when the mood changes at the drop of a hat. Sangatsu no Lion will not only give you a highly impacting character-driven story. But the wholesome moments which will heal you when you are down in the dumps are here too. It\'s so cute and fluffy, all at once, that it will definitely ease the pain from the more darker parts of the story. I mean, if it was hopeless and gloomy all at times, it might have ended up as a double-edged sword. So this is a nice touch that gives your mind a break from the dark for a moment. When we do take a break, you can also expect to see some food-related themes and in a general sense. My recommendation is to always have something to eat with you. Or you will, for a fact, regret it when you see some amazingly tasty-looking anime food on your screen.Oh, let me add this one too, but I won\'t delve too deep into this topic for obvious reasons.

Sangatsu no Lion is undoubtedly a classic and one of the best anime I have watched in recent years.', 'The experience of being an anime fan has changed quite significantly since I was a wee lad. Now that the industry is at a point where U.S fans can view everything legally as it airs simultaneously in Japan, has crafted a need for fans to always be watching the currently airing shows. Which can get tiring because about 9/10 shows are either bad or shows that will be forgotten the moment the last episode ends.Sangatsu No Lion is a beacon of light; not necessarily because it is the most breathtaking viewing experience, but more so because of a very specific set of reasons. There are...two brands of sports anime, the melodramatic type(i.e. Touch/Cross Game) and the monster-of-the-week type(i.e. Hikaru No Go). Sangatsu no Lion fills an interesting niche insofar as it merges the two together in a seamless manner. I have a conjecture that this is due to the strength of the directing. Sangatsu no Lion has a ton of great visual imagery. There are no bland shots, there continues to be interesting animated sequences that are very necessary to break up the monotony of two people playing Shogi.Sangatsu No Lion\'s biggest selling point is that it does not do anything egregiously bad. There is nothing that will compel you to drop this series and as a result of this, all of the strengths flourish and there only remains a reason for the viewer to return. Which was a necessary component to add to a show of this nature, due to the fact that there is not much demanding your constant attention. You can put this show on in the background as you do work, glance up every few minutes and still not have missed much exposition or interesting progression.In a way, this series is the very definition of a sum-of-its parts. There are some anime where you know very clearly what are the strongest and weakest aspects. The MC is boring, but at times he can be a very compelling and interesting protagonist. The love interest is a little over the top, but she does add an interesting dynamic to the protagonist that would not otherwise be there. In terms of flaws, this show is a mixed bag, there are bad elements but they are clearly all there for the sake of creating some interesting character interactions.If you have ever struggled with feelings of isolation or depression. Look no further, watch this right now! Sangatsu No Lion gets it. The MC is for all intents purposes depressed and is struggling with some self-hate issues. Issues that get in his way of connecting with others and trusting other people. Having a character with trust issues does not automatically make this show ""deep"" or ""thoughtful"" but the way it juxtaposes that with the people in his life who genuinely care about him is done to a masterful degree of success.Overall, this show was good. I wish I could rate it higher, but it just stumbles over its own two feet because the show does not have a strong sense of urgency jumping from one plot point to the next. This is not a thriller, and if you are coming to this for that type of entertainment, look elsewhere. The joy of watching this comes down to the details and minutiae of this characters life.P.S: It would help in your enjoyment if you have some background with Chess or Shogi so you can understand some of the strategical concepts that are thrown around semi-frequently. two brands of sports anime, the melodramatic type(i.e. Touch/Cross Game) and the monster-of-the-week type(i.e. Hikaru No Go).

I may have already given up in four attempts, when trying to write a coherent review for this. The pressure that comes, with the knowledge of knowing, that what you are writing is not making justice, to the amazing quality the series has in your mind. Coming along with the even worst feeling, the guilty which comes with the though of your flawed attempt turning people off people from the work itself. But as kiryiama, that is quoted here said, I also do not want memories of running...away even from this responsibility. So let’s go to my review of 3-gatsu no lion.So I will start with a rather divisive aspect of this show, the sudden swifts between comedy and drama.  Many consider those jarring, I really like this contrast though, our protagonist is trapped in his own negative and tortured vision of reality, his own problems mostly being created by his own mentality, which in turn only makes then even worst. Making for endless internal monologues about the cruelty of reality, reviving saddest memories possibly in a melancholic tone. But outside of that mentality, there is this world of fun whacky characters, that really look and care about him, their amusing interactions showing him other side this world, being sometimes a relieve and sometimes a burden for his lonely self. Besides what also makes it work, is how the show no matter what emotion it is trying to convey, it goes all out with it, it sincerely wants to make you feel the sadness, the melancholic and the joy, all those uneven emotions that make life worth it, at the same time.  And believe it, I say that as someone that is not that big of a fan of the comedic scenes, those usually were funny and adorable, but not the appeal of the show.You know discussing the plot in this one is kind of hard. In terms of continuous progressing events there is little of them in this show. What we have here is a completely personal approach to storytelling, this is rei’s journey through and through out (with one noticeable exception), the series goes to great lengths to show exactly that. The person he is, the values he believes, what experiences made him that way, how the interactions with several different characters influenced and still influence him.  The depth of emotions and moments that made his entire life is displayed perfectly. It could be argued this type of storytelling comes to the expense of other characters, since most of the other ones are not as interesting, and that happens in this show, but it is not as prevalent of a problem here, a lot of the characters are still pretty good and unique on their own, and a lot is made to show or imply they all have their own life’s and issues going on, which in turn, makes them way more than devices to move the plot. Also as a side point please people, stop saying this series is about shogi. Sure the game is used as device to showcase some of the character issues, like Kiryama low self-esteem and guilty, for example with the suffer he had when he crushed another character goals, and it has this theme and ambition, and working hard to achieve your goals, not unlike many sports series. But those as the sport itself are never the main focus, the focus is always on the characters their interactions and drama. Hell you really do not need to understand how is shogi is played to watch this, and if you are really infatuated with it, they explain the rules to youThe lack of plot progression, also ties to another recurrent complaint, hailed against the show, the character development, and the changes in the characters are too slow or nonexistent. The former is simply not true at all, the last episode serving to show how rei’s view of other changed, just compare how much outspoken he is in disagreements in the end of the series, and how the found things he really cares about. The former is mostly true, but that actually is one of the series strengths. Depression is a cycle of highs and lows, there are no easy answers to solve it, every self-betterment, being a struggle for the person. There is no character development for him that comes only with internal motivation, Rei may try to believe he is all right now, that he found motivation and is finally going to move on. And then something happens, he loses the only match he really wanted to win, Kyouko (best girl) comes back to visit him, then he is back at the gutter, feeling even worst this time. Its usage of character regression, is a powerful, but impressive criticism, of a shallow and simple view of the solving of this kind of issue. There are also no answers other characters may give him, Shimada altruism, is at first presented as a solution to rei self-centeredness, that is only a deception though. Later we found out why through several episodes, a negative side of said altruism, the pressure of the responsibility that comes with what he tries to achieve, becoming an obsession that deteriorates his health, and gets in the way of his ability of playing shogi. A truly endless need to rush out things, meaning to him an own personal hell.There is one thing I will concede is really missing in 3-gatsu, it has no central theme tying the whole thing together. Saying a 3-gatsu no lion has no themes or messages, it wants to explore is laughable at best, from family, and how that defines the individual, guilty, knowing how the forgive and accept yourself, the effects of traumatic events, learning to let go of your past, the precedence of human interactions, ambition, the pressure of competition. But I cannot say it all ties back to a central theme. Sure I can easily track guilty as the most prominent one, Rei just blame himself, for everything around him, from the ruining of the relations of his foster family, to the lie that decided what his life was going to be, to the fact he constantly win at shogi a sport he has no idea what it means to him, or if he really cares about it, getting in the way of the inspirations of those that really care about it. He has no means of dealing with that overblown sense of guilty, so he constantly tortures himself in his mind about it, his depression and lack of self-esteem mostly steaming from that.  But no lots of thing like do not have much to do with guilty. In my mind that comes of more like a missed opportunity to have a thematic cohesive work.You know the kiriyama quote at the begging of the review is only there for one reason, when rei said that, it become engraved in my mind as the moment I realized this show was going to become one of my favorites. Mind you, not only because I find that particularly sentiment relatable, being someone that was constantly bombarded with the question, why did I continued going to university, I barely took anything out it, sleeping in every class and not talking with anyone at school. But I still kept going to that place, and I could not explain even for myself very well why. And that moment explained what I was feeling way better than I ever could, of course I would never skip classes, how could I justify to myself, the fact I was running away, from the school life I so dearly desired. This show has dozens of this moments that helped to reflect and understand myself better. It gave me the tools I needed to have a better reading and understanding of my reality and is in a lot of ways the catalyst, for the improvement of my situation. And I can never be grateful enough to this show for that, or recommend the show enough for that matter. away even from this responsibility. So let’s go to my review of 3-gatsu no lion.So I will start with a rather divisive aspect of this show, the sudden swifts between comedy and drama.

And believe it, I say that as someone that is not that big of a fan of the comedic scenes, those usually were funny and adorable, but not the appeal of the show.You know discussing the plot in this one is kind of hard. In terms of continuous progressing events there is little of them in this show. What we have here is a completely personal approach to storytelling, this is rei’s journey through and through out (with one noticeable exception), the series goes to great lengths to show exactly that. The person he is, the values he believes, what experiences made him that way, how the interactions with several different characters influenced and still influence him.  The depth of emotions and moments that made his entire life is displayed perfectly. It could be argued this type of storytelling comes to the expense of other characters, since most of the other ones are not as interesting, and that happens in this show, but it is not as prevalent of a problem here, a lot of the characters are still pretty good and unique on their own, and a lot is made to show or imply they all have their own life’s and issues going on, which in turn, makes them way more than devices to move the plot. Also as a side point please people, stop saying this series is about shogi. Sure the game is used as device to showcase some of the character issues, like Kiryama low self-esteem and guilty, for example with the suffer he had when he crushed another character goals, and it has this theme and ambition, and working hard to achieve your goals, not unlike many sports series. But those as the sport itself are never the main focus, the focus is always on the characters their interactions and drama. Hell you really do not need to understand how is shogi is played to watch this, and if you are really infatuated with it, they explain the rules to youThe lack of plot progression, also ties to another recurrent complaint, hailed against the show, the character development, and the changes in the characters are too slow or nonexistent. The former is simply not true at all, the last episode serving to show how rei’s view of other changed, just compare how much outspoken he is in disagreements in the end of the series, and how the found things he really cares about. The former is mostly true, but that actually is one of the series strengths. Depression is a cycle of highs and lows, there are no easy answers to solve it, every self-betterment, being a struggle for the person. There is no character development for him that comes only with internal motivation, Rei may try to believe he is all right now, that he found motivation and is finally going to move on. And then something happens, he loses the only match he really wanted to win, Kyouko (best girl) comes back to visit him, then he is back at the gutter, feeling even worst this time. Its usage of character regression, is a powerful, but impressive criticism, of a shallow and simple view of the solving of this kind of issue. There are also no answers other characters may give him, Shimada altruism, is at first presented as a solution to rei self-centeredness, that is only a deception though. Later we found out why through several episodes, a negative side of said altruism, the pressure of the responsibility that comes with what he tries to achieve, becoming an obsession that deteriorates his health, and gets in the way of his ability of playing shogi. A truly endless need to rush out things, meaning to him an own personal hell.There is one thing I will concede is really missing in 3-gatsu, it has no central theme tying the whole thing together. Saying a 3-gatsu no lion has no themes or messages, it wants to explore is laughable at best, from family, and how that defines the individual, guilty, knowing how the forgive and accept yourself, the effects of traumatic events, learning to let go of your past, the precedence of human interactions, ambition, the pressure of competition. But I cannot say it all ties back to a central theme. Sure I can easily track guilty as the most prominent one, Rei just blame himself, for everything around him, from the ruining of the relations of his foster family, to the lie that decided what his life was going to be, to the fact he constantly win at shogi a sport he has no idea what it means to him, or if he really cares about it, getting in the way of the inspirations of those that really care about it. He has no means of dealing with that overblown sense of guilty, so he constantly tortures himself in his mind about it, his depression and lack of self-esteem mostly steaming from that.  But no lots of thing like do not have much to do with guilty. In my mind that comes of more like a missed opportunity to have a thematic cohesive work.You know the kiriyama quote at the begging of the review is only there for one reason, when rei said that, it become engraved in my mind as the moment I realized this show was going to become one of my favorites. Mind you, not only because I find that particularly sentiment relatable, being someone that was constantly bombarded with the question, why did I continued going to university, I barely took anything out it, sleeping in every class and not talking with anyone at school. But I still kept going to that place, and I could not explain even for myself very well why. And that moment explained what I was feeling way better than I ever could, of course I would never skip classes, how could I justify to myself, the fact I was running away, from the school life I so dearly desired. This show has dozens of this moments that helped to reflect and understand myself better. It gave me the tools I needed to have a better reading and understanding of my reality and is in a lot of ways the catalyst, for the improvement of my situation. And I can never be grateful enough to this show for that, or recommend the show enough for that matter.', 'About this series: 3-Gatsu No Lion is a series of depicting various forms of art. It starts off with a seventeen-year old’s pilgrimage. His mission was to aim for the best. Soon, we realize that this isn’t a pilgrimage but a train filled with people that connect to each other with shogi. Shogi is a form of communication between two individuals. What makes this series special is that it isn’t only competitive but also heartwarming and filled with messages throughout our real life. We also get to witness that professional shogi players sacrifice their position in life and devote themselves to shogi. In this series,...the main character faces him, society, and others to cross the border of solitude.Story: The story progresses in a steady pace that equally matches with the message carried along with it. It would be best to describe the story as similar as the first opening theme song because the main character keeps on sinking and being dragged by the ocean until someone pulls him from being drowned eternally. The ocean pulling him to the abyss can be symbolized as the shackles of disapproval, insecurity, and expectation. The person that pulls him from drowning can also be symbolized as the bonds and trust made with others.  Each chapter seemed to fit along perfectly each other as similar as filling a puzzle; drama to set up an atmosphere, competitive shogi battles that keeps us on the edge of our seats, and the tiny bits of connection to the audiences made by emphasizing with the main character’s experience. Although the series felt like it was cut short during the lion tournament arc, it overall went on a smooth and perfect pace.Art: The art style is similar to Your Lie In April but with less colors and more shading.  I find it unique and suitable to portray dark yet soothing themes. The dim imagery is perfectly synchronized with the self-conflicting emotions and thoughts that characters go through.Sound: The soundtracks in the anime produce the general mood of the situation. The soundtracks aren’t loud or constant; they change accordingly, similarly as water. The soundtracks are mostly piano composed. Aside from the ost/soundtracks, the opening and ending theme songs are beautifully composed.Characters: Rei is a sensitive and anxious seventeen-year old boy that attempts to overcome his weaknesses. The people he meets and deals with have a large impact in his life. I believe that Rei is an ideal main character in this story because characters with flaws have great potential to grow. He may seem timid and nervous but he carefully observes his surroundings and is analytical at times. Other shogi players struggle and dedicate most of their effort in Shogi similarly to Rei’s dedication to Shogi. As mentioned previously, the characters are all aboard in the same train to the same destination.However, the character development isn’t very obvious yet it is efficient to some extent. I believe it needs to improve in this field. Nevertheless, every character in the anime was equally significant to the story because they all support the important message throughout each chapter.Enjoyment: Exploring the field of competitive shogi left me in excitement for the next episode.Overall:(Pros) - Steady pace-\tMany messages throughout the series-\tUnique art style-\tVariety of Soundtracks(Cons) - Was cut short during the lion tournament-  Vague character development the main character faces him, society, and others to cross the border of solitude.Story: The story progresses in a steady pace that equally matches with the message carried along with it.

This is the message that 3 gatsu no lion convey to us through that simple and yet interesting shogi match.', 'Intro3 gatsu no lion whose full name is March comes in like a lion is a slice of life and sports anime that is based off the manga of the same name. 3 gatsu no lion is the shortened term that I use to refer to both the anime and the source material. I haven’t read the source material yet however after watching the anime I may actually look into it.Story and setting3 gatsu no lion is a sports and slice of life anime that focuses on both the professional career of the main character Rei and his personal life which is...also affected by his career. The story largely takes place in Tokyo although Rei does travel to other parts of the country in some episodes to either take part in competitions and witness others playing.The anime showcases the life of Rei Kiriyama a 17-year-old who is socially awkward but considered to be a powerful shogi player having started out when he was in middle school and becoming a pro while there as well. His achievements plus the fact that he started Pro while only just in middle school has made him somewhat famous. While also looking at the professional career of Rei in Shogi the story also looks at the isolation that Rei surrounds himself with which is a result of his shogi skills clashing with his family. The story alternates between looking at Rei’s career and his interactions with several support characters and the struggles of other Shogi players and their background stories.Shogi itself is relatively interesting sport and was an interesting theme to use for the anime. Shogi while like conventional western chess is infinitely more complex with each piece having far more ways to use than what is seen in western chess. The strategies that were observed from the anime looked pretty complex made even more so by the fast-paced matches that were shown in the anime. All in all, Shogi is a sport and game that is rarely seen in the west so it was an interesting topic to see for this anime.CharactersReiRei Kiriyama voiced by veteran voice actor Kengo Kawanishi of Mobile suit gundam iron blooded orphans and Naruto shippuden fame is one of the main characters of the series. A 17-year-old teenager and a professional shogi player that went pro when he was still in middle school Rei is a relatively quiet person with his personality being best described as shy, quiet and focused. Because of a tragic accident that took his family away from him Rei was adopted into what can be a traditional shogi family. It is here that Rei was introduced to Shogi by his adopted father. Unfortunately, Rei’s skill with Shogi had the opposite effect in that it caused Rei and his family several problems that eventually resulted in Rei leaving home to be independent. Rei’s wrestle with this fact is one of the many struggles that he faces in the anime. Apart from Shogi Rei actually has very few other interests and indeed it can be said that Shogi is everything to Rei as it gave him not just a sport to take part in but also a purpose and a path in life that eventually led Rei to pursue a career in Shogi. In a way Shogi gave Rei a clear purpose in life something that he did not have before. Because of his quiet nature, Rei can be socially awkward around people and as such his closest friends are for the most part the fellow shogi players that he meets as he goes through his career. However, the exception to this rule is the Kawamoto sisters that helps take care off and support Rei after they encountered him.One of the central themes of the anime apart from showing Rei’s growth as a shogi player and his career in that is Rei opening his rather closed personality to others and him learning to rely on others rather than try to do everything by himself. Throughout the series there are a number of characters that try to get Rei to do this with the best ones being the Kawamoto family of sisters. The interactions between Rei and the Kawamoto sisters especially Akari and Hinata was especially cute and it was nice to see Rei slowly open to them. All in all I felt that Rei as a character was well designed and that his voice actor Kengo Kawanishi did a pretty good job portraying him.AkariAkari voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Tales of Zestiria the x and Anohana fame and one of my favourite seiyuu’s is one of the main characters of the show. A resident of the same town that Rei lives in Akari is also Rei’s neighbor in that she and her family only live across the river from Rei’s apartment complex. A kind hearted, understanding and considerate young woman Akari can be considered the very image of a young mother if one did not know that Akari’s family actually consists of three sisters. Due to the early death of her mother Akari was forced from an early age to take care of her sisters and also manage the household as the eldest daughter. As a result, Akari’s life is generally focused around helping to support her family. However, this doesn’t mean that Akari does not have the opportunity to work as she also helps her grandfather in running a traditional Japanese sweet shop and at the same time also work as a hostess in her aunt’s bar. Ironically it is her latter job that allowed her to encounter Rei when she took him in after finding him sick after a night out with friends. To Akari Rei is very much like a lost lamb that needs to be taken off and as a result Akari likes to take care of Rei and get him involved with their affairs. Apart from being kind and caring Akari is also very perceptive in that she can easily see the pain that Rei hides behind his easy going and nervous attitude when he is with them. Rather than trying to pry out the reason Akari instead tries to let things slide and patiently wait for Rei to reveal this when he is ready to do so.The interactions between Akari and Rei tend to be quite heart-warming in that Akari can confide in Rei the worries and issues that she has with regards to her family with Rei who is someone that she trusts. Similarly, this relationship is also mirrored in Rei who also tries to open up to Akari when he is feeling down. The relationship between Rei and Akari can be quite funny as Akari can act somewhat like a mother type character as she cares about the well-being of Rei with the best example in the series when she and her sisters kidnapped Rei to take him to a hospital after suspecting that he was ill. When Akari is with her sisters a great deal of hilarity can occur due to the fact that all three like sweet things like snacks but have to balance their desire for them with the family budget. Although the relationship between Akari and Rei doesn’t progress past that of good friends and Neighbors I think that it is entirely possible for them to be paired as a couple seeing that their age difference isn’t that large plus Rei is one person that Akari has a lot of trust in and cares a great deal in. All in all I think Ai Kayano did a pretty good job portraying the character of Akari.HinataHinata voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of Psycho pass and Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei fame and my second favourite seiyuu is the second of the three Kawamoto sisters within Akari’s household. A middle school student Hinata is a positive, upbeat and cheerful person that always tries to cheer Rei up when he feels sad. One notable trait of Hina is that she is a heavy sleeper that at the same time always manages to wake up at the last minute and yet still make it to school on time. Although she isn’t as good as a cook as Akari is Hina’s bento’s still look to be pretty tasty. Like Akari Hina also likes to take care of Rei and as the series progresses it becomes apparent that Hina has developed feelings for Rei as she gets flustered quite often when he’s around and also the actions that she took when she saw Rei and Kyouko. Though the anime only hints at this possibility I think it will be a good thing as depending on which year Hina is in for middle school the age difference between them is not that great. When Rei is not with them for some reason it’s funny seeing Hina worry about him and at the same time consider the various punishments for him when he doesn’t come. Like Akari Hina can also be quite understanding of Rei but at the same time Hina also tries to involve him in her affairs which is always funny to see.  Within the anime there are quite a few episodes that focus on Hina as a character with the most notable one being the arc that focuses on her crush in school. I quite liked this arc as it showed not just how frantic Hina can get and at the same time how creative she can get with her bento’s as well. All in all, Hinata was a well-designed character and I felt that Kana Hanazawa did a pretty good job portraying her. Her relationship with Rei was also cute.MomoMomo voiced by veteran seiyuu Misaki Kuno of Log Horizon and Myriad Colors Phantom World fame is the third sister of the Kawamoto sisters within Akari’s household. A preschool student Momo can be described as pure, innocent and cute but she does have a selfish and stubborn streak at times which can be quite comical when it appears. Momo for the most part is limited in the interactions that she can be part off due to the fact that she is still a preschool student. For the most part Momo serves as the comic relief for the show defusing otherwise tense situations with her presence. Like Akari and Hinata Momo also likes Rei and sees him akin to a family member and someone that she can trust.KyoukoKyouko voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Marina Inoue of Attack on Titan and Log Horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series. Kyouko is the adapted sister of Rei’s adopted family and has a rather interesting relationship with Rei. Older than Rei by four years which would make her 21 years old Kyouko is beautiful but hot headed and has a mean streak about her that makes it hard for people to know her. Her personality can be described as manipulative, willful and independent. Kyouko is a stubborn person at times and can also be annoying and disrespectful to others while also being independent. In a way, her personality was shaped by her father and his desire to have his family focus their careers on Shogi. However, Kyouko’s does change at times especially when she is around Rei that she has a grudge on. Though she bears obvious dislike for Rei she can still act innocent around him though this usually happens when she wants him to take care of her. In a way Kyouko has a rather negative influence on Rei’s life and career in that she often induces doubts and worry in Rei before crucial events like shogi matches. However, Kyouko isn’t really a true villain in that she doesn’t bear hatred towards Rei in a literal sense rather she seems to enjoy hindering him for her amusement. All in all Kyouko was a rather complex character and a well-designed one and I felt that her seiyuu Marina Inoue did a great job portraying her.NikaidoNikaido whose full name is Harunobu Nikaido is voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto of Alderamin of the sky and Owari no seraph fame. A important support character within the show Nikaido can be considered to be Rei’s first and best friend though only Nikaido sees this as the truth. Rei and Nikaido met when they were little through the player of Shogi and because of being beaten by Rei repeatedly has declared himself to be Rei’s lifelong rival. Like Rei Nikaido is a professional shogi player though not as skilled as Rei is. Despite seeing Rei as a rival Nikaido also sees Rei as a friend as well and as they both understand shogi on a more intimate level than most people do he can easily see when Rei is in turmoil during a match. Nikaido does try to cheer up Rei at times when he’s down and there is one instance in the anime when Nikaido forgets his role as a commentator and tries to get Rei to understand where he went wrong. Aside from his interactions with Rei as part of Shogi Nikaido also gets the chance to interact with the Kawamoto family where he teaches them the basics of Shogi with the help of a very well designed and animated picture book that shows the pieces as cats. I felt that Nikaido was a pretty good character as apart from motivating Rei as his rival he also supports him as a friend. Nikaido’s background isn’t as well explored as other characters but it’s obvious that he comes from a reasonably rich family as he has a driver and a butler following him. Nikaido’s struggle with his health and his desire to do well in Shogi I felt was well done however. In the end, I felt that Harunobu Nikaido did a great job portraying Nikaido.Hayashida SenseiHayashida sensei voiced by veteran voice actor Takahiro Sakurai of Naruto and Anohana fame is one of the support characters of the show. A teacher that teaches at the high school that Rei attends Hayashida is the only person that knows that Rei has a professional shogi career outside of the school and thus the reason why he is absent from school for the majority of the school year. As a fellow player of Shogi Hayashida understands the life choices that Rei goes through in balancing shogi with is school life. As a result, Hayashida tries his best to stop Rei from being dropped out of school by showing him the work that he must do to catch up his school year. Apart from his school life Hayashida also cares about the well-being of Rei having seen that his quiet attitude isn’t going to win him any friends in school. Though his attempts at doing so usually fail. However, while certainly not within his assigned duties it was nice to see Hayashida do so much to help Rei get a decent chance of passing his school year and in the end I felt that he was a pretty good teacher who cared about every one of his students. I felt that Takahiro Sakurai did a great job portraying Hayashida SenseiArts and animationThe art style I felt was reasonably done and I felt that the character designs for each of the characters was well thought out and designed. The color that was used in the anime was also a pretty good choice. The animation that was used for the anime I felt was also well done and looked natural and smooth. For the shogi matches the clear and crisp animation greatly helped in allowing the viewing of each of the individual pieces and the moves that were being made.MusicThe music for the series I felt was pretty good with the second opening theme and the second ending theme being my favourite. The scene music I felt was also well done.Voice actingIn terms of voice acting that I place an emphasis on I felt that Akari and Hinata’s seiyuu’s Ai Kayano and Kana Hanazawa respectively did a excellent job portraying their respective characters. Rei’s voice actor Kengo Kawanishi I felt also did a great job. Additionally, the character of Kyouko who I felt was a rather complex character was played excellently by Marina Inoue.Overall conclusionAt its heart 3 gatsu no lion is a slice of life anime that’s combined with a sports anime thus giving a story that not just shows the growth of the main character Rei as a human being but also his growth as a professional shogi player. The combination of genre means that it also combines and features several different themes into the anime. These include the growth of the character as a human being, the human emotion that’s balanced with the intrigues and challenges that are a result of the sport that’s being portrayed with this being Shogi in this case. This balance of themes I felt was interesting as it allowed us the viewers to see not just Rei’s journey as he grows not just in his career as a pro shogi player but also as a human being and in doing so break out of the shell that he had built to protect himself with.The subject matter of Shogi I felt was also good as this subject is something that is not very well known outside of Japan compared to the likes of international chess. The strategies that were shown in the anime were also well explained and animated which was good to see as Shogi can be hard to understand at times. In no small part, due to the picture book that Nikaido bought each of the pieces that are used in Shogi were explained pretty well and in great depth.In the end, I quite enjoyed 3 Gatsu no lion and Shogi was certainly an interesting subject matter to feature. Seeing Rei’s growth over the series and seeing him forge friendships and be more open to others was also nice to see. also affected by his career. The story largely takes place in Tokyo although Rei does travel to other parts of the country in some episodes to either take part in competitions and witness others playing.The anime showcases the life of Rei Kiriyama a 17-year-old who is socially awkward but considered to be a powerful shogi player having started out when he was in middle school and becoming a pro while there as well. His achievements plus the fact that he started Pro while only just in middle school has made him somewhat famous. While also looking at the professional career of Rei in Shogi the story also looks at the isolation that Rei surrounds himself with which is a result of his shogi skills clashing with his family. The story alternates between looking at Rei’s career and his interactions with several support characters and the struggles of other Shogi players and their background stories.Shogi itself is relatively interesting sport and was an interesting theme to use for the anime. Shogi while like conventional western chess is infinitely more complex with each piece having far more ways to use than what is seen in western chess. The strategies that were observed from the anime looked pretty complex made even more so by the fast-paced matches that were shown in the anime. All in all, Shogi is a sport and game that is rarely seen in the west so it was an interesting topic to see for this anime.CharactersReiRei Kiriyama voiced by veteran voice actor Kengo Kawanishi of Mobile suit gundam iron blooded orphans and Naruto shippuden fame is one of the main characters of the series. A 17-year-old teenager and a professional shogi player that went pro when he was still in middle school Rei is a relatively quiet person with his personality being best described as shy, quiet and focused. Because of a tragic accident that took his family away from him Rei was adopted into what can be a traditional shogi family. It is here that Rei was introduced to Shogi by his adopted father. Unfortunately, Rei’s skill with Shogi had the opposite effect in that it caused Rei and his family several problems that eventually resulted in Rei leaving home to be independent. Rei’s wrestle with this fact is one of the many struggles that he faces in the anime. Apart from Shogi Rei actually has very few other interests and indeed it can be said that Shogi is everything to Rei as it gave him not just a sport to take part in but also a purpose and a path in life that eventually led Rei to pursue a career in Shogi. In a way Shogi gave Rei a clear purpose in life something that he did not have before. Because of his quiet nature, Rei can be socially awkward around people and as such his closest friends are for the most part the fellow shogi players that he meets as he goes through his career. However, the exception to this rule is the Kawamoto sisters that helps take care off and support Rei after they encountered him.One of the central themes of the anime apart from showing Rei’s growth as a shogi player and his career in that is Rei opening his rather closed personality to others and him learning to rely on others rather than try to do everything by himself. Throughout the series there are a number of characters that try to get Rei to do this with the best ones being the Kawamoto family of sisters. The interactions between Rei and the Kawamoto sisters especially Akari and Hinata was especially cute and it was nice to see Rei slowly open to them. All in all I felt that Rei as a character was well designed and that his voice actor Kengo Kawanishi did a pretty good job portraying him.AkariAkari voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Tales of Zestiria the x and Anohana fame and one of my favourite seiyuu’s is one of the main characters of the show. A resident of the same town that Rei lives in Akari is also Rei’s neighbor in that she and her family only live across the river from Rei’s apartment complex. A kind hearted, understanding and considerate young woman Akari can be considered the very image of a young mother if one did not know that Akari’s family actually consists of three sisters. Due to the early death of her mother Akari was forced from an early age to take care of her sisters and also manage the household as the eldest daughter. As a result, Akari’s life is generally focused around helping to support her family. However, this doesn’t mean that Akari does not have the opportunity to work as she also helps her grandfather in running a traditional Japanese sweet shop and at the same time also work as a hostess in her aunt’s bar. Ironically it is her latter job that allowed her to encounter Rei when she took him in after finding him sick after a night out with friends. To Akari Rei is very much like a lost lamb that needs to be taken off and as a result Akari likes to take care of Rei and get him involved with their affairs. Apart from being kind and caring Akari is also very perceptive in that she can easily see the pain that Rei hides behind his easy going and nervous attitude when he is with them. Rather than trying to pry out the reason Akari instead tries to let things slide and patiently wait for Rei to reveal this when he is ready to do so.The interactions between Akari and Rei tend to be quite heart-warming in that Akari can confide in Rei the worries and issues that she has with regards to her family with Rei who is someone that she trusts. Similarly, this relationship is also mirrored in Rei who also tries to open up to Akari when he is feeling down. The relationship between Rei and Akari can be quite funny as Akari can act somewhat like a mother type character as she cares about the well-being of Rei with the best example in the series when she and her sisters kidnapped Rei to take him to a hospital after suspecting that he was ill. When Akari is with her sisters a great deal of hilarity can occur due to the fact that all three like sweet things like snacks but have to balance their desire for them with the family budget. Although the relationship between Akari and Rei doesn’t progress past that of good friends and Neighbors I think that it is entirely possible for them to be paired as a couple seeing that their age difference isn’t that large plus Rei is one person that Akari has a lot of trust in and cares a great deal in. All in all I think Ai Kayano did a pretty good job portraying the character of Akari.HinataHinata voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of Psycho pass and Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei fame and my second favourite seiyuu is the second of the three Kawamoto sisters within Akari’s household. A middle school student Hinata is a positive, upbeat and cheerful person that always tries to cheer Rei up when he feels sad. One notable trait of Hina is that she is a heavy sleeper that at the same time always manages to wake up at the last minute and yet still make it to school on time. Although she isn’t as good as a cook as Akari is Hina’s bento’s still look to be pretty tasty. Like Akari Hina also likes to take care of Rei and as the series progresses it becomes apparent that Hina has developed feelings for Rei as she gets flustered quite often when he’s around and also the actions that she took when she saw Rei and Kyouko. Though the anime only hints at this possibility I think it will be a good thing as depending on which year Hina is in for middle school the age difference between them is not that great. When Rei is not with them for some reason it’s funny seeing Hina worry about him and at the same time consider the various punishments for him when he doesn’t come. Like Akari Hina can also be quite understanding of Rei but at the same time Hina also tries to involve him in her affairs which is always funny to see.  Within the anime there are quite a few episodes that focus on Hina as a character with the most notable one being the arc that focuses on her crush in school. I quite liked this arc as it showed not just how frantic Hina can get and at the same time how creative she can get with her bento’s as well. All in all, Hinata was a well-designed character and I felt that Kana Hanazawa did a pretty good job portraying her. Her relationship with Rei was also cute.MomoMomo voiced by veteran seiyuu Misaki Kuno of Log Horizon and Myriad Colors Phantom World fame is the third sister of the Kawamoto sisters within Akari’s household. A preschool student Momo can be described as pure, innocent and cute but she does have a selfish and stubborn streak at times which can be quite comical when it appears. Momo for the most part is limited in the interactions that she can be part off due to the fact that she is still a preschool student. For the most part Momo serves as the comic relief for the show defusing otherwise tense situations with her presence. Like Akari and Hinata Momo also likes Rei and sees him akin to a family member and someone that she can trust.KyoukoKyouko voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Marina Inoue of Attack on Titan and Log Horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series. Kyouko is the adapted sister of Rei’s adopted family and has a rather interesting relationship with Rei. Older than Rei by four years which would make her 21 years old Kyouko is beautiful but hot headed and has a mean streak about her that makes it hard for people to know her. Her personality can be described as manipulative, willful and independent. Kyouko is a stubborn person at times and can also be annoying and disrespectful to others while also being independent. In a way, her personality was shaped by her father and his desire to have his family focus their careers on Shogi. However, Kyouko’s does change at times especially when she is around Rei that she has a grudge on. Though she bears obvious dislike for Rei she can still act innocent around him though this usually happens when she wants him to take care of her. In a way Kyouko has a rather negative influence on Rei’s life and career in that she often induces doubts and worry in Rei before crucial events like shogi matches. However, Kyouko isn’t really a true villain in that she doesn’t bear hatred towards Rei in a literal sense rather she seems to enjoy hindering him for her amusement. All in all Kyouko was a rather complex character and a well-designed one and I felt that her seiyuu Marina Inoue did a great job portraying her.NikaidoNikaido whose full name is Harunobu Nikaido is voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto of Alderamin of the sky and Owari no seraph fame. A important support character within the show Nikaido can be considered to be Rei’s first and best friend though only Nikaido sees this as the truth. Rei and Nikaido met when they were little through the player of Shogi and because of being beaten by Rei repeatedly has declared himself to be Rei’s lifelong rival. Like Rei Nikaido is a professional shogi player though not as skilled as Rei is. Despite seeing Rei as a rival Nikaido also sees Rei as a friend as well and as they both understand shogi on a more intimate level than most people do he can easily see when Rei is in turmoil during a match. Nikaido does try to cheer up Rei at times when he’s down and there is one instance in the anime when Nikaido forgets his role as a commentator and tries to get Rei to understand where he went wrong. Aside from his interactions with Rei as part of Shogi Nikaido also gets the chance to interact with the Kawamoto family where he teaches them the basics of Shogi with the help of a very well designed and animated picture book that shows the pieces as cats. I felt that Nikaido was a pretty good character as apart from motivating Rei as his rival he also supports him as a friend. Nikaido’s background isn’t as well explored as other characters but it’s obvious that he comes from a reasonably rich family as he has a driver and a butler following him. Nikaido’s struggle with his health and his desire to do well in Shogi I felt was well done however. In the end, I felt that Harunobu Nikaido did a great job portraying Nikaido.Hayashida SenseiHayashida sensei voiced by veteran voice actor Takahiro Sakurai of Naruto and Anohana fame is one of the support characters of the show. A teacher that teaches at the high school that Rei attends Hayashida is the only person that knows that Rei has a professional shogi career outside of the school and thus the reason why he is absent from school for the majority of the school year. As a fellow player of Shogi Hayashida understands the life choices that Rei goes through in balancing shogi with is school life. As a result, Hayashida tries his best to stop Rei from being dropped out of school by showing him the work that he must do to catch up his school year. Apart from his school life Hayashida also cares about the well-being of Rei having seen that his quiet attitude isn’t going to win him any friends in school.

Prepare yourselves, for this is going to get deep.3gatsu covers something that not many anime have done; life. Plain and simple, without over exaggerating somebody's pain or having angst upon angst, without trying to force you into liking any one specific character.I still remember the opening episode. It was dark, and morbid, and it felt heavy and gloomy and dreary. And then, suddenly, Momo appeared, followed by the other sisters, and their squishy cats and the gentle happiness that always surrounds them and light entered my soul.And THAT is exactly what is so darn beautiful about...3-gatsu, as well as the way Shaft has interpreted it; you feel gloomy when they want you to feel gloomy and happy when they want you to feel happy.And the reason I'm pointing this out is because usually, in anime, they try too hard to get you to feel something, and it backfires entirely. Many a time have I watched something that was clearly meant to be touching but I just felt myself clamming up and cringing. In other words, controlling the emotions of the watcher in the palm of the creator's hands is an incredibly rare power very few anime possess.That being said, with that opening episode, Shaft has indeed hypnotized us, but they don't abuse it. It is, as I said, about life, and hence, very often, there are long stretches of nothing, of boredom (not because the show is boring, but because you feel the emptiness that the characters feel), loneliness, and that only makes those little energetic moments all the more powerful.Story: 8One could basically classify 3-gatsu as a slice-of-life. And it is that, in essence. So originality of story isn't really up for discussion here. And yet it's so much more. I found the story to be so simple, so basic, and yet the way they portrayed it, it felt like everyday was a struggle, everything had importance, nothing happened without a reason. And somehow, it made me...treasure this reality so much more. Things that seem so utterly insignificant to others; when you're trying your best but no one else sees it... understanding that it matters to YOU. In essence that's what this is about, and by gosh that is beautiful.So I suppose, rather than the story, the story TELLING is beautiful.Characters: 10You blink and every character is a stereotype, then you blink again and suddenly, every character is raw and complicated and real. You're so swept away in the moments, that when hundreds of them pass and you look back, you'll see just how much everything has developed, that everything was leaving a mark. And that's how it is in life, and why reality is always so much more complicated than in anime; because things are always and forever developing, even without us noticing. Only months later do we see any actual results.3-gatsu doesn't just develop our lead shortcake, Rei Kiriyama, but everyone. And this happens through the eyes of Rei, and what makes that so powerful is that it develops the side characters WHILE developing Rei simultaneously.Now that, is something special.Art: 9When I heard Shaft was producing, I immediately told myself I'd never watch it. With their flashy colors and textures and random striking of poses, I thought I'd never be able to take anything the characters said seriously. And with a story by Chika Umino, characters are everything.But then I watched the opening song, strangely enough, and their directing of it was so unique, exactly what I'd thought the story to be like. And then I watched it, dreading the worst, but it was nothing short of beautiful. Staying loyal to the manga's original artwork while throwing in dashes of their own style, Shaft managed to put their directing to use, and what resulted was a story that flowed and involved and hooked the audience with a style that can still only belong to Shaft.Shaft, well done for reading the atmosphere and calming down on the head tilts. Standing O.Sound: 9Full justice was done here. Openings, endings, the OST in general; Everything fit to enhance the effect of the main goal - making the characters shine.Overall:The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was not because I didn't tear up (this is usually my prerequisite for a show. If it made me cry, with no other obvious faults, I give it a 10), because feels this show does not lack. Rather it was because indeed, sometimes, it got too gloomy and scenes would drag out; an issue I'm sure is not present in the manga.And this is also why 3-gatsu probably won't be watched by the masses; it IS gloomy. It IS drawn out, and perhaps melodramatic at times. And I'd have to agree with you - or at least, the me at episode 7-ish would.See, I entered the show, and I only thought 'wow, okay, dark, dark, gloomy, gloomy'; and yet I continued to watch. I don't know what it was - maybe it was Momo, with her teeny dress and leggings; maybe it was those annoying cats; maybe it was the fantastic opening theme (which I never skipped), maybe it was the way Rei tried so hard all the time, with a subliminal kindness no one could see and yet nothing worked...Whatever it was, I was well into the show before I realized - hang on.This is.... really quite beautiful. 3-gatsu, as well as the way Shaft has interpreted it; you feel gloomy when they want you to feel gloomy and happy when they want you to feel happy.And the reason I'm pointing this out is because usually, in anime, they try too hard to get you to feel something, and it backfires entirely.

Openings, endings, the OST in general; Everything fit to enhance the effect of the main goal - making the characters shine.Overall:The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was not because I didn't tear up (this is usually my prerequisite for a show. If it made me cry, with no other obvious faults, I give it a 10), because feels this show does not lack. Rather it was because indeed, sometimes, it got too gloomy and scenes would drag out; an issue I'm sure is not present in the manga.And this is also why 3-gatsu probably won't be watched by the masses; it IS gloomy. It IS drawn out, and perhaps melodramatic at times. And I'd have to agree with you - or at least, the me at episode 7-ish would.See, I entered the show, and I only thought 'wow, okay, dark, dark, gloomy, gloomy'; and yet I continued to watch. I don't know what it was - maybe it was Momo, with her teeny dress and leggings; maybe it was those annoying cats; maybe it was the fantastic opening theme (which I never skipped), maybe it was the way Rei tried so hard all the time, with a subliminal kindness no one could see and yet nothing worked...Whatever it was, I was well into the show before I realized - hang on.This is.... really quite beautiful."", ""3 gatsu no lion is a anime that speaks deeply with me. It's a emotionally heavy anime, and talks a lot about various aspects of life, and, because of that, i couldn't help but to see myself in the place of Kiriyama Rei certain times, and seeing he grow as a person and face his problems with help of others was wonderful. There's a lot to take from this anime, and it's a wonderful piece that manages to be emotional and fun, with great carachters all arround, each one with his own backstory and motivation.Story: 8/10The story has a simple premise, but the way it...is introduced to the viewer is what make it so interesting. Thru the anime, you see how the facts have an affect in Rei's life, leaving him in a hole that seems hopeless. Not only that, but you see how different characters interpret the changes that Rei made in their lives, for better or worse, leaving a history that feels heavy, emotional and very real.In the end, it's clear how much Rei grew, and how much he has to grew, he learns how to deal with some things, and, with help of his new friends, he learns to be a better person overall. (And i don't even know how to play shogi)Art: 9/10Shaft is a great studio with great animes, and this one is another one of those. The art and animation is what you expect from Shaft, it's not as radical as Monogatari, for example, but still very unique and clever used.Sound: 8/10There's not much to talk about it, it's nice, the wind sound in some parts is cool, the original dub of the characters are great, there are times when Rei's voice is penetrating, like he's talking directly to you. I loved Momo's and Kawamoto's dub.Character: 10/10I can't remember the last time i saw something like that, every character in this anime is deep, with a great story that tells you how he got where he's now and why he fights to be even better. The characters are more than just generic flat characters, every thing they do and reflect they past and beliefs. Even the characters i hated in the beggining begin to grow into me, to the point that i couldn't decide who was right, or if even there's something as right or wrong. The anime is not afraid of descontruct every character, with vulnerable and serious moments. And, of course, Kiriyama Rei is phenomenal unlucky guy, and i can't stop myself from feeling excited for what the future reserves for him.Enjoyment: 9/10As a said before, the anime speaks deeply with some of my past experiencies, and, because of that, it feels extremely real sometimes, it talks about serious stuff and it has always a great lesson to be learned from it, i think it's one of those that should be watched by everyone at least once, just to see what they can take out of it.Overall: 9/10Great anime, with phenomenal characters that feels overall as a project passion from everyone envolved. cool. is introduced to the viewer is what make it so interesting.

It\'s also about how it is delivered.When I first saw the studio name ""Shaft"" next to ""slice of life"" anime, I was pretty doubtful; Shaft\'s directing choices are often multi-angled, with various high contrast shots and rapid scene transitions which makes it optimum for mystery and psychological genre. But apparently their approach also fits the ""slice of life"" genre.3-Gatsu no Lion is a masterpiece in directing; the sound and the shot choices act perfect to deliver the desolation Kiriyama faces as he lives an isolated life, questioning his way of life. This is how to direct an anime.Story:...7/10Who knew that such a board game can create new insights about life? March Comes in Like a Lion just touches you with just the sense of realism - something that I rarely get in this medium. I feel like that I am in Kiriyama\'s shoes as I am watching this. And Kiriyama\'s spiritual growth is perfectly natural and, well the story just seems in touch.But then why am I giving this a relatively low score?Mostly due to pacing. Quite a lot feels unresolved after watching the first season (I haven\'t watch 2nd season so far and I plan to). And Kiriyama\'s development feels pretty slow. I just felt like that if this entire story was told in 15 episodes rather than 22, it would have resolved this issue. Well, I guess reading the manga might solve the problem for me her.Art: 9/10Solid work from Shaft. Seems like they preserved the original artist\'s art style too.Sound: 10/10I don\'t think I can immediately find an anime that does better in this field except Bakemonogatari (also by SHAFT). Great openings and endings, and all insert songs and sound effects are placed perfectly.Characters: 8/10All just feel REAL. I can relate to them. And they have scars like regular human beings.I am giving an 8 for now because it doesn\'t feel like that the characters haven\'t been fully explored yet.Enjoyment: 7/10The story does start to feel little repetitive after a certain point; there are just to many shogi matches to count. I just didn\'t feel like that the first season ended in the right part.And most importantly, I am just not a big fan of slow paced anime.Overall: 8/10A masterpiece in directing choices. But slow pacing could have been improved. It kinda felt a little repetitive near the end. Nice slow paced story for slice-of-life fans. I think I need to get to 2nd season before being fully able to rate this anime.TL DR; Realistic anime with great directing choices.

I couldn't stop watching it. With art that captured emotions so remarkably I couldn't get enough of it. I think that just for an anime about a game the matches were more spectacular and fascinating than in most shounen anime. Lead of the series Kiryiama Rei is not only appealing with his personality but also with his character development throughout the series. I recommend it to people who like darker and more psychological kind of anime. But it isn't just dark all the time. With some of its lighter moments it brings a nice contrast that's...intriguing to watch. So fellow anime watchers just watch it =) intriguing to watch. So fellow anime watchers just watch it =)"", 'March comes in like a lion... Oh where do I start? This is one of my all time favorites!Before I get started though, I will mention that I have not yet read the manga so this review is strictly on my reaction to the anime.The story revolves around a teenage professional shogi player named Rei. You quickly find out that he is an orphan who is now living alone while still trying to attend high school and continue on his career path as a professional player.Now this is considered a sports anime but don\'t worry if you\'re not familiar with shogi. The shogi episodes go...by at a good pace and are done in such a way that you actually become engrossed and not bored by the game play.The main plot of the story is about Rei and his relationships with others in the form of flashbacks and present day. He\'s had a rough life, the past 10 years after losing his parents and sister he was brought up by another family but was always felt alone. His ""adoptive"" father and sister have big roles to play in his emptiness.But thankfully there is a light in the darkness or several lights for Rei. He doesn\'t spend a lot of time at school but when he does he is usually in the company of one of the most caring teachers ever! He also has a safe haven to retreat to found in the Kawamoto home. Three sisters Akari, Hina and Momo have welcomed Rei into their home and their hearts in the most heartwarming way I have ever seen.The scenes when Rei is with the girls are my favorites. there is so much warmth and love there. The girls also have known tragedy, They live with their grandfather. Their grandmother died and so has their mother, quite recently from what Rei can tell. The wounds are too fresh for the girls to talk about what happened to their mother and they never mention what happened to their father who is absent and never brought up.I\'d like to mention the art and sound quickly. The art style is absolutely gorgeous! The background music is soothing and fits in perfect. The two OP and two ED are fantastic! Everything blends together so nicely.I found out today that there will be a season two and I am so happy I can\'t contain myself! I can\'t say enough good things about this anime. by at a good pace and are done in such a way that you actually become engrossed and not bored by the game play.The main plot of the story is about Rei and his relationships with others in the form of flashbacks and present day.

But I’ve seen too much good in this world to write it off. I’ve seen too much of humanity’s capacity for kindness and justice to give up on us ever getting better. Just look at the state of the world now: after hundreds of years of systemic oppression and racism, people from countless different countries have come together in support of reforming the broken...systems that leave too many black men dead at the hands of powerful white cops. Minneapolis, the city where George Floyd lived and died, even managed to outright defund their police department. Change is hard and progress harder, but we have the power to make it happen. We have the power to shift the world in a better direction, in the face of all its evil, and write a better future than the present we currently have. I believe in humanity’s capacity for love. I believe in out capacity to weather even the worst storms. Love in the face of hatred is a difficult, sometimes almost impossible endeavor, but it is worth fighting for every single time. Anything less is a betrayal of all that we’re capable of achieving.I have always valued anime for its sincere belief in that same truth. But I don’t think I’ve yet seen a show that so perfectly captures the idea of radical empathy as Sangatsu no Lion.(And yes, I am absolutely stealing the phrase ""radical empathy"" from the Pedantic Romantic. What can I say, it just fits too perfectly.)Above all else, Sangatsu is a story about faith in people. It’s a story about a kid crushed by depression, wandering his way through a melancholy life, but finding the courage to keep trying every single day. Rei Kiriyama, age 17, professional shogi player, lost his family in a tragic accident when he was a kid, and in the years since then he\'s grown into a shy, repressed young man, crippled by doubt and mental illness, holding onto shogi as the one lifeline keeping him stable in an otherwise perilous existence, even as it\'s also a cage keeping him from finding his own happiness. But Sangatsu isn\'t really about shogi, and you don\'t need to know a single thing about how the game\'s played to appreciate it (the show will teach you all the stuff that matters, so don\'t worry). In fact, Sangatsu isn\'t so much about one thing as it\'s about, well, everything. It\'s about the entirely of Rei\'s life, his past and present traumas, his struggles, his triumphs, the people he meets and the people he lives behind. And it\'s about all those people as well, from the family of three sisters who become something like Rei\'s surrogate family to the many opponents Rei faces from across the shogi board. It\'s less a plot than a woven tapestry, depicting an entire community of lovable, well-realized characters, the ways their lives intersect, the ways they build each other up, the ways they give each other comfort in their darkest moments. And it\'s about how Rei grows in that space, slowly learning to process his trauma and value his own life.To say the show doesn\'t have much of a plot might seem like an insult. But what Sangatsu lacks in tightly scripted story progression, it more than makes up for in sheer, raw emotion. Rei is an unflinchingly human protagonist the likes of which we so rarely get, a raw nerve of feeling so crippled by past trauma it can be almost impossible to watch. The show pulls no punches in depicting the deepest recesses of his darkness, the suffocating pressure that builds on him until he breaks, the voices in his head that tell him he doesn’t deserve to be happy. It’s devastating and intimate and painful in a million ways big and small, and the fog of his despair grows so thick at times you feel like you could choke on it. But just as Sangatsu forces you to suffer with Rei at his worst moments, it allows you to cheer with him at his best. It lets you bask in the joy of the people who care about him, the overwhelming catharsis of finding places he can belong, the countless tiny connections that refuse to let him be swept up and blown away by his inner storm. It has the courage not to shy away from the ugliness of the world, but it has greater courage still not to shy away from its beauty either. And its capacity for kindness is so awe-inspiring, so heart-stopping, that it’s enough to drive you to tears through sheer positivity alone. I cannot recall the last show I watched that was this agonizingly hopeful, this capable of reaching into the deepest pits of your soul and making you so utterly surrender to your capacity to feel.And with the strength of that disarming radiance, Sangatsu no Lion embarks upon one of the most breathtaking, majestic, unbearably honest tales about the power of ordinary life I’ve ever seen. It weaves so many threads together, juggling so many characters with so many complicated, messy connections, and it makes them all soar. It’s a gut-wrenching intimate drama that slowly expands outward to a gripping ensemble piece, full of countless incredible characters who could all be the protagonist of their own story. It’s a pulse-pounding sports drama that takes a brutal examination of the perils of tying your life’s purpose to achievements you may not earn, how the things that keep us grounded can also trap us in place. It’s a gorgeous slice-of-life comedy, with some of the most consistently gut-busting cackles and most cheek-stinging smiles any anime’s wrung out of me. It’s a heartbreaking analysis of toxic and codependent mindsets that tears your psyche apart with its unyielding depictions of self-loathing and misery. It’s an explosion of sheer joy in its brightest moments and a primal scream of sheer agony in its darkest. And it’s all brought to life by an absolutely staggering production by studio Shaft, weaponizing their abstract expressionism more intimately and more breathtakingly than ever before. The way it layers symbolism and visual metaphor, the way the editing breathes with the chaos of the characters’ minds, the way it makes the real world feel so raw, not to mention the top-tier work from every single voice actor involved… it is UNSPEAKABLY beautiful. It effortlessly sucks you into the story’s unflinching honestly, forcing you to confront the extreme, devastating, overwhelming, rapturous emotions as if they were your own.The end result of all this talent and effort is nothing short of magical. Few anime have been able to touch my soul this deeply. Few anime have been so capable of tearing my defenses down and leaving me a quivering wreck of emotions. Few anime have so thoroughly stunned me, amazed me, bowled me over, left me this tender and vulnerable and joyous. I love every single thing about this show, and that’s not always something I can say about even some of my favorite anime of all time. Sure, maybe the opening few episodes could’ve been a little more structured, maybe the plot’s overall aimlessness could’ve been improved, maybe there were certain characters I enjoyed seeing on screen more than others. But there’s not a single moment in this show I didn’t at least like. There’s not a single story beat in this show that didn’t work for me. There’s not a single character in this show who I don’t appreciate seeing on screen, and the vast majority of them I outright adore. No other show I\'ve seen was flawless enough that I could say with a straight face there was nothing I’d rather go without. And the absolute best of these building blocks- Rei’s first climactic outburst, Mr. Hayashida’s guidance, Rei and Kyouko’s fascinatingly fucked relationship, literally everything about Hina- are among the most compelling, resonant, rewarding ideas anime’s ever given me.Sangatsu no Lion gives me hope. It gives me hope for my capacity to overcome my own demons and forge a meaningful life. It gives me hope for humanity’s capacity to shake off our worst mistakes and let kindness triumph over fear. And it gives me hope in anime’s capacity to still give me the kind of experience no other medium is capable up, even coming up on three years watching it. It’s a restorative aria that hits you in the deepest parts of your soul, breaking all your rawest nerves apart and sewing them back together more lovingly than ever before. It is the soul of radical empathy itself surging across the screen like the waves of a tumultuous ocean. It’s devastating, uplifting, gut-wrenching, spiritually cleansing, and utterly, unflinchingly beautiful. And somehow, the second season is so much better it almost feels like an insult. Don\'t let this show pass you by: it\'s truly something to behold. systems that leave too many black men dead at the hands of powerful white cops.

Don\'t let this show pass you by: it\'s truly something to behold.', '!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!Sangatsu no Lion revolves around Rei Kiriyama, a frail boy that has to deal with a terrible loss. To distract himself from his emotions he turns to Shogi - a japanese board game similar to chess. His unhealthy obsession with the game is only fueled by the bad parenting of his new \'shogi father\'. Rei\'s new siblings naturally grow to hate Rei instead of their father for stealing his attention. Rei also starts to blame himself for breaking the family apart so he wants to leave the house asap. Soon he becomes a pro and can afford to live by himself, he...is \'happy\' that he left the house without doing more damage.And to Rei, that is the finish line. He can now somewhat take care of himself, he has a place to live. He just goes to the shogi hall once in a while, and he doesn\'t even need to get better at it. He just needs to stay at his current level... nothing needs to change, life is okay. That\'s where we meet Rei, a depressed boy who thinks he is okay in his solitary aquarium. In the following episodes, through his eyes, we get to see how he evolves through his interactions with people and shogi. I know nothing about shogi but I found the premise fascinating and the story did not disappoint.As the contrast between the life with his friends and his solitary life became more and more apparent, sometimes Rei was depressed, other times he was crying from happiness. The audience is intentionally put painfully close to Rei, listening to every thought that goes through his mind in slow pacing. The plotline was interesting and realistic. Whether the scene was dramatic or humorous, whether Rei won a game or lost, the show always handled it brilliantly. It was an amazing experience to be able to watch things both from an omniscient view and from Rei\'s perspective.In terms of the other characters, The Kawamoto sisters show Rei how dark and lonely his side of the bridge is and how there are other ways you can cope with loss. Nikaidou urges him to take better care of himself and his shogi, to not be content where he is. Takashi sensei reminds him he\'s still just a kid but also that he is amazing for his age, that he should have self-confidence. Every character has a meaningful place in Rei\'s life, and impressively none of them is just a ""development tool"" for him.Despite seemingly revolving around Rei, the show is realistic and deep with its side characters as well. Akari doesn\'t just take Rei in because he\'s ""stray"", she geniunely cares and it isn\'t a one-way street. Rei is a big help to their family.. or rather he is family. Nikaidou is not your typical one-dimensional shounen rival, he has his own reasons for pursuing Rei. Even Takashi has plenty moments where it\'s apparent his life doesn\'t revolve around his favorite student. Same goes for every single character in the show, everyone has their own lives to worry about. Thanks to the masterful narrative, everyone feels so real and important and well developed.But what really elevates the series to a work of art is its amazing use of visuals and sound. The artstyle is gorgeous and unique. The show makes great use of symbolism without going overboard and becoming too abstract. Visually, this is easily the most impressive anime I\'ve seen so far. Not because the landscape or animation is as pretty as in Made in Abyss or Shingeki no Kyojin, but because it handles tonal shifts and abstraction extremely well and has a unique approach to facial expressions. The soundtrack also does a great job accompanying the switches in atmosphere and is filled with beautiful bittersweet piano tracks.In terms of negatives, I had no idea what Shogi is so it was hard to appreciate the matches. They were still dramatic and insightful but I\'m sure I\'d enjoy it a lot more if I actually knew what was going on. It wasn\'t much of a problem at first but Shogi became more prevalent towards the later episodes so it was a bit of a turn-off. Nikaidou\'s cute introduction obviously wasn\'t enough to understand pro matches. Secondly, as cute and lovely the Kawamoto family is, the humour in their household was sometimes cheesy and repetitive. The over the top humour amplified the disparity between Rei\'s melancholy and happiness but didn\'t feel real at times.Overall Sangatsu no Lion is an amazing show and highly recommended for anyone who wants to witness ""art"" in anime. is \'happy\' that he left the house without doing more damage.And to Rei, that is the finish line. He can now somewhat take care of himself, he has a place to live. He just goes to the shogi hall once in a while, and he doesn\'t even need to get better at it. He just needs to stay at his current level... nothing needs to change, life is okay. That\'s where we meet Rei, a depressed boy who thinks he is okay in his solitary aquarium. In the following episodes, through his eyes, we get to see how he evolves through his interactions with people and shogi. I know nothing about shogi but I found the premise fascinating and the story did not disappoint.As the contrast between the life with his friends and his solitary life became more and more apparent, sometimes Rei was depressed, other times he was crying from happiness. The audience is intentionally put painfully close to Rei, listening to every thought that goes through his mind in slow pacing. The plotline was interesting and realistic. Whether the scene was dramatic or humorous, whether Rei won a game or lost, the show always handled it brilliantly.

How should I begin... First of all I have to prevent that I will do my review in french. Your eyes may burn with my english, so... Let's just start !3-gatsu no lion est honnêtement pour moi un bijou, un chef d'oeuvre et bien entendu c'est un avis subjectif. Je veux juste que les gens comprennent à quel point cet anime vaut la peine d'être regardé et apprécié à sa juste valeur.L'histoire 10/10: On suit l'aventure de Kiriyama Rei, le personnage principale âgé de 17 ans et professionnel de Shogi. Pour ma part j'avais déjà entendu parlé du shogi (Akashi Seijuuro ou...encore Shikamaru Nara xD), mais sans jamais approfondir la chose et grâce à cette histoire j'ai pu découvrir ce monde qui est plus complexe qu'il ne paraît. Ça nous montre qu'on a pas forcément besoin d'action pour aimer une histoire et pour l'apprécie. Ça vous fera tout aussi planer et sentir d'émotions si vous y mettez du votre.L'art 10/10: Wow, wow, WOOOOOOOW !!! Plus j'avançais, plus je prenais des claques et plus j'avais des frissons rien qu'avec le graphisme. Comment vous dire que les dessins sont magnifique, l'animation tellement bien calculée et réfléchie ! Ce n'est absolument pas un graphisme comme les autres. Les émotions sont super bien retranscris dans les mouvement, à tel point que tu ressens ce que les personnages ressentent. Ils jouent avec les angles, les couleurs, les formes pour faire ressentir quelque chose, pour dire quelque chose et ça franchement, je trouve ça magnifique. C'est vraiment de l'art pour moi, pas de simples dessins.Le son 10/10: Encore ici, je n'est rien à dire si ce n'est que les génériques et ost sont magnifique. Dans certains animes les musiques sont la pour nous faire ressentir de l'amusement, de l'intensité, mais là ce n'est que pure émotion. Je peux même dire que l'art et le son sont très similaire dans ce qu'ils veulent faire passer. Dans l'opening 1 et 2, j'ai complètement voyagé, mais pas ailleurs, voyagé dans les émotions. Je parle toujours et encore d'émotion, mais je pense que c'est le but de cet anime. En écoutant l'ending 2 je plane complètement et c'est ce que j'aime ! Et une chose vraiment positif par rapport aux ost, c'est qu'on a eut droit à un en français ! J'étais choquée ! C'est toujours du japonais (normal) et de l'anglais, mais le français état une très bonne surprise !Les personnages 10/10: Déjà le personnage principale... Il me touche énormément. Je dirai qu'on peut le catégoriser dans les personnages assez pathétique (je parle du vrai sens de pathétique, ce n'est pas péjoratif), tellement sa vie est misérable, et dont on pourrait se lasser parce qu'il n'avance pas et ne fait que se plaindre. Mais absolument pas !  Il est émouvant et nous fait nous questionner sur certains aspects de la vie et de l'être humain. Comme tout les autres personnages d'ailleurs. Qu'ils soient fous, joyeux, tristes, intimidants ou autres, ils nous apprennent tous quelque chose d'important selon leurs vécus, et ça c'est une très belle chose. Vous ne pouvez que vous attachez à eux, avec leurs qualités et défauts.L'amusement 10/10: Le 3 premiers épisodes sont assez lents (ce n'a absolument pas été un problème pour moi, parce que je savais que ça annonçait quelque chose de super) mais il ne faut pas abandonner et lui donner ça chance. Ils sont assez mystérieux aussi, on ne comprend pas forcément le problème de l'histoire, mais plus on avance et plus on reste scotchés ! Je ne vois pas les minutes défiler, et je n'exagère rien du tout ! Rien qu'avec le récit du narrateur je suis à fond, alors quand le rythme est un peu plus rapide je suis aux anges *.* Ça me fait vraiment réfléchir sur l'humain et me fait comprendre certaines choses.Le tout 10/10: Comme vous pouvez le voir, j'ai mis 10 partout et je ne pense rien exagérer. J'ai été emportée par cet anime à tel point que j'ai du écrire une review. C'est de l'art, c'est tout ce que j'ai à dire et ne pensez pas que parce que c'est du shogi, une chose que vous trouvez peut-être ennuyeuse, que ça l'est forcément. Il faut se laissez aller et apprécier tout simplement. Action, aventure, combats et gros seins ne font pas tout... xD Un peu plus de simplicité fait du bien !

Les deux emporte par leur magie."", ""3-gatsu in the Lion may have been one of the best dramas I've ever seen-- in fact, it comes easy on a possible TOP 5 drama anime I've ever seen, after all. It is simply all very well done; From the incredibly elaborate plot to the very well-constructed events to a completely different and captivating premise, so that all the true drama that was presented fit perfectly into all relevant and irrelevant factors. The dialogues are great and the characters are sensational.The dramatization on the introversion of the Rei (protagonist), contrasting with the way he seeks to escape from this reality through the Shogi, is...beautiful to see.The comments he makes mentally throughout the episode are brilliant. Unlike any narrator, he does not describe the scene and the chewed and hand-delivered delivery to you, these thoughts make you reflect a second time about the scene and help you to understand it otherwise. It's the least, touching.Another positive point worth mentioning is comedy. The comedy is very well served, so to speak. In other words, it knows when it should appear. Perhaps she had intruded in some moments she should not, but in general, she knew when she should be present, and when she should not.The plot develops at a desperately slow pace. It would not surprise me if someone fell asleep in the middle of some episode, because considering this factor, it is quite understandable, but I think one of the main differentials of 3-gatsu in the Lion is precisely this calmness in addressing the events. So if you can stand up for the whole episode, it's going to be worth more than it's worth.Another thing worth highlighting in the 3-gatsu universe is that even a seemingly insignificant character can make the narrative of the story completely change. A simple helper changes the way you tell and work the plot. This is great.The characters are great. Seriously, the cast overall is very good. It does not have a character without utility or bad use. They all had their respective functions, and they performed very well (I have not yet decided whether I love or hate the Rei sister, haha).And technically, the anime was to take the blow. Holy shit, the scenery here is beautiful. Seriously, I really wanted to see Shaft work on a utopian feature film, just to see what the visual art of 3-gatsu would look like. If within a week, they made it possible, how would it be in a time of production and larger budget? I have mental orgasms just thinking ...3-gatsu has a cartoon style in graphic art, and in addition to being very beautiful, makes the anime's ambiance spectacular and, above all, perfectly emphasizes the theme of the work. It was very good. I definitely can not see 3-gatsu with a visual art (scenarios) otherwise, otherwise this; Think, 3-gatsu with the scenarios of the ufotable (Fate, God Eater), for example. It would really be very beautiful, but also, well anti-climatic.The animation is relatively above average. It is fluid and makes the movements of both the joints of the characters, hair and even the clothes, be in a perfect synchrony and much more pleasant to see.And finally, on the soundtrack, my God, what absurdly beautiful thing. What an incredible soundtrack. I believe that since Clannad, I had not seen a OST as beautiful and climatic as that of 3-gatsu, congratulations to all involved in this question, they did a wonderful job.In summary, 3-gatsu in the Lion, is basically more of the appearance. Not superficial, it may seem like a drama with a touching point and another touching with a set of characters that are there to develop the protagonist, but having a deeper point of view, you can realize how incredible the plot is, and how brilliant it is.

The way it has to take place."", ""AN ANALYTICAL REVIEW OF “3-GATSU NO LION”. (Spoilers - It's really for people who've seen already because I get into some detailed aspects of the anime)This anime needs no introduction because this is myanimelist and you can already get all the info you need, such as Studio, Director and all that. Instead, I’m just gonna ramble about why “3-gatsu no Lion” worked for me… and other people who might relate to my opinions. I’m also not gonna waste a lot of time with characters and story… because this review is really for people who have watched the whole thing and for whom the usual reviewing...aspects should be obvious by now.“3-gatsu no Lion” is one of the few anime that I found myself eagerly waiting for each week and yet, after downloading the episode (Because I’m a bloody pirate from a third world country) I would not actually watch it. I would probably wait 2 or 3 days before having the courage of doing it. Why is that? It is an anime that I love, obviously. And yet, each time, it would require an immense amount of courage for me to sit down and have myself go through it.“3gatsu” works on many levels. And not being in any way an expert on anime, I am compelled to write a review for it because of how I appreciate what the show has accomplished.1) Abstract Visuals as a Metaphor for Emotional DistressWhile there must have been other anime to do this before, “3-gatsu” is the one that has impacted me the most. Yes, the show has a great art style that is this mix between childish cartoon and then the normal anime style art with attention to realism and proportion (for most part). The art style itself is fundamentally very light and bright with use of pastel colours and paintings with a palette that is very vivid. It’s very reminiscent of the background art for “Yuri!!! On Ice”, which had the same watercolour style. This art style is more apparent when the Rei is happy and is with the Kawamoto family because this represent how he views the world when he’s the surrounded with people that he cares about and more importantly, people that care about him. That very palette changes when Kiriyama is alone and becomes much darker and thicker. You can feel the heaviness that he feels and see how the world closes in around him. But honestly, these styles are all pretty standard. What “3-gatsu” did which impressed me and touched me at the core was the use of abstract imagery to represent the emotional distress of Kiriyama and why the show chooses to show only his sadness through such metaphors instead of also applying the same technique to his more joyous moments.That is because Kiriyama understand his happiness. He knows the few things that make him happy, even if he sometimes questions it himself. His realisation is often gradual. He keeps analysing the situation until he figures out the exact element that is making him happy and for these scenes, the art style remains the same because we, the audience, are the see the logical and emotional progression and realisation.But we can see that many times, when Kiriyama is at his lowest point, when he questions the very foundations of his life and his choices, he cannot come up with an answer that he is satisfied with. And those are particularly apparent at the beginning of the show when Kiriyama was still very much under the control of his pain. Kiriyama knows that he is sad and he knows that the reason he is sad is because of the loss of his family, and the general outcome of having to move in with a foster family and having his siblings hate him and all that… but above all, Kiriyama is going through an actual depression. The guy is not just sad, he is depressed and as we all know, depression is when logics very often stop working. As opposed to happiness, Kiriyama cannot just analyse the situation. His sadness is something that he feels with overwhelming force… He FEELS it… and that is why the show chooses abstract visuals to represent his emotions. His reality is distorted, nothing makes sense, he doesn’t know what is wrong… he can only feel the sadness and for him that emotions resembles the scenes that we see. It can be him being submerged by an ocean… him withstanding violent winds… or just a cut where we see the colour black and white just blending in together in a storm with the sound of it becoming a threat to your senses, your emotions. While I believe that these metaphors might work more with some people than it did with others, I still think that they do an incredible job at portraying the emotional distress of the main character without seeming to be just pure time wasting art…. That’s the way I see it. Every cut has a reason to be there. (Apart from the weird 2 or 3 episodes where we would get that weird cat-shogi song in the middle of the episode). While the slow pace of the show gives the audience breathing room, to assimilate all the emotions, there is no denying that when they emotions kick in, they do take your breath away. That is why watching ‘3gatsu no Lion’ is always a viewing experience that I both dreaded and loved.It is also only in episode 22 that you see the visual metaphors being applied to his happiness, and you can already see that it is already better shaped than before. Much less abstract and more of a simile. Which is a splendid way of differentiating between the two emotions; happiness and sadness.2) Being a Masterpiece of Tonal Consistency (Cursing ahead, I got heated during the paragraph)A LOT of anime out there suffer from the tonal consistency issue. Have you watched “Akame ga Kill!”? Or “Bungo Stray Dogs”? These are two anime that I found the most astoundingly offensive when it came to directing because whoever directed those shows had obviously no idea of how to make these anime a pleasant viewing experience. Now, I know a lot of people enjoyed those shows, but I didn’t. Setting aside the issue of the stories just being generic and the characters being bland and boring (Except for the first 4 episodes of the second cour of Bungo), these two anime suffer from massive tonal inconsistency. In “Akame ga Kill!” You would have Tatsumi just witnessing the death of one of his comrades, and the background music playing would be upbeat and light, the shot composition would be this medium shot, cutting characters out with no obvious focus on any particular character’s emotions and literally after 1 minute, Leone or some other punk would crack a joke while they are all fucking attending the FUCKING FUNERALS or some shit like that. Or just pointlessly use “Le Chant de Roma” at any given scene when this soundtrack is clearly for the most dramatic and tense moments! Same thing for “Bungo”, where Dazai would actively go from one tone to another, disrupting the whole mood of the show with no regards to how this affect the narration. What “3-gatsu” does that so many anime failed to do is to have tone shift, yes, but all these tone shifts are occurring instead of being made to happen. Do you see what I’m saying? Probably yes, probably not. Bear with me. Kiriyama is a well-developed character, sure, but he is also very established… his behaviour is set. He will never actively do anything to change the way things are going, he will never just decide to be happy and then see the world as brighter and happier. He doesn’t cause the tone shift, he doesn’t disrupt the emotions that the audience feels alongside him. Instead all the tone shifts are brought about by external characters who enter the scene and cause it to change. Be it Momo jumping into his arms, or Nikaidou trying to change his mood. All the tone shifts happen for the sake of actually changing the tone from dark and sulky to light and funny. They take us by surprise yes but they happen in a way that makes us happy instead of confused about why a character is smiling at his friend’s funerals or why his head is in chibi style when everything around him is fucking Armageddon. Life is also a surprise and tone shifts happen all the time. There is no schedule and that’s why I think “3-gatsu” did a great job at portraying the realism in this way. The tone shifts are done quickly and completely. The mood changes completely without blending or lingering emotions from the previous scene. That is why this anime is gold!This show is not at all style over substance. It anything, its style has substance and its substance has style3) The Directing of Character DevelopmentI am not familiar with the work of Akiyuki Shinbo. I’ve only ever watched “Katte no Kaizou” which is just batshit crazy and fast paced with not much sense. And he seems to be the only director working at Shaft… But I honestly loved how he helmed the show, knowing exactly how to pace it so that the development of the character feels natural and progressive. The first half of the show focused heavily on Kiriyama as an individual and as the show continued, we begin to see how his interactions make him grow and know more about himself so that by the second half (Where the focus in more on shogi) , he is both growing… and discovering more about who he is. His development is done in both a backward and forward fashion as the audience learns more about Kiriyama’s past but also see how he is presently changing. We learn why he behaved the way he did at first and we see what makes him stop behaving that very way. And that is the best kind of development. It was not only about making sure that your character had an interesting past, but also making sure that he evolves over the course of the anime. In this aspect, the development of Kiriyama reminds me very much of Killua Zoldyck’s masterful development in “Hunter X Hunter (2011)”.Kiriyama is the only character who evolves that way as the rest of the cast are explored through backstory but that’s okay because they are actually legitimately very likeable and interesting characters. I’ve always thought that if you cannot make your character behave interestingly, then give him an interesting backstory and if you cannot give him an interesting backstory, then make him act interestingly and be likeable. Luckily, ‘3-gastu’ ensure that all its characters are likeable and are developed properly. The Kawamoto sisters do not change a lot throughout the show but that’s all right because they are genuinely good people who’ve suffered a lot… and their courage to keep moving on and to keep smiling through thick and thin makes them winning characters! We learn about their past and we see how they are, and I’m perfectly satisfied with having them the way they are. They are interesting. Momo is a toddler, she has no fucking development needed at this stage. I’m just happy she is sweet and doesn’t take too much space by just being the cute kids that makes you go “Aww…” but actually served a purpose in developing Kiriyama’s backstory. Akari is my favourite one but she is already an adult and all her development is very much in her backstory. As a supporting character, she is perfect. Hinata is the one which technically would have the most development happening if she were a main character but even she is very low key and doesn’t overstep her boundaries as a supporting character.What I also really enjoyed in the show were the quick cuts to facial expressions and how these definitely help to isolate a particular emotion of the character. That was a really cool bit directing choice. Like I said, every scene in this show is useful…While, I don’t think this show has everything that I need for it to be among my favourites, I still believe that it is one of the best shows of the last few seasons and is special enough in the way it is executed. Many episodes had me smiling like a kid, many episodes had me holding my tears in because I simply could not afford to relive the pain that I was seeing Kiriyama go through.So… is “3-gatsu no Lion” a masterpiece? Not for me. It is a great show with potential of being a Masterpiece had a few things been handled a little differently. I think the focus on Shogi is a little overwhelming at times, as someone who is not familiar nor interested in the game. That is especially apparent in the second half of the anime. The characters, while very well developed and memorable, still aren’t unique. Not enough for me, at least… But otherwise, yes, it is a fantastic show. It truly is. So… I don’t know if I made much sense at all… I felt like writing that shit, so I did. Take care guys.(If only I could put as much thought and dedication in completing my Uni work as I did for this “review”… *sigh*) aspects should be obvious by now.“3-gatsu no Lion” is one of the few anime that I found myself eagerly waiting for each week and yet, after downloading the episode (Because I’m a bloody pirate from a third world country) I would not actually watch it. I would probably wait 2 or 3 days before having the courage of doing it. Why is that? It is an anime that I love, obviously. And yet, each time, it would require an immense amount of courage for me to sit down and have myself go through it.“3gatsu” works on many levels. And not being in any way an expert on anime, I am compelled to write a review for it because of how I appreciate what the show has accomplished.1) Abstract Visuals as a Metaphor for Emotional DistressWhile there must have been other anime to do this before, “3-gatsu” is the one that has impacted me the most. Yes, the show has a great art style that is this mix between childish cartoon and then the normal anime style art with attention to realism and proportion (for most part). The art style itself is fundamentally very light and bright with use of pastel colours and paintings with a palette that is very vivid. It’s very reminiscent of the background art for “Yuri!!! On Ice”, which had the same watercolour style. This art style is more apparent when the Rei is happy and is with the Kawamoto family because this represent how he views the world when he’s the surrounded with people that he cares about and more importantly, people that care about him. That very palette changes when Kiriyama is alone and becomes much darker and thicker. You can feel the heaviness that he feels and see how the world closes in around him. But honestly, these styles are all pretty standard. What “3-gatsu” did which impressed me and touched me at the core was the use of abstract imagery to represent the emotional distress of Kiriyama and why the show chooses to show only his sadness through such metaphors instead of also applying the same technique to his more joyous moments.That is because Kiriyama understand his happiness. He knows the few things that make him happy, even if he sometimes questions it himself. His realisation is often gradual. He keeps analysing the situation until he figures out the exact element that is making him happy and for these scenes, the art style remains the same because we, the audience, are the see the logical and emotional progression and realisation.But we can see that many times, when Kiriyama is at his lowest point, when he questions the very foundations of his life and his choices, he cannot come up with an answer that he is satisfied with. And those are particularly apparent at the beginning of the show when Kiriyama was still very much under the control of his pain. Kiriyama knows that he is sad and he knows that the reason he is sad is because of the loss of his family, and the general outcome of having to move in with a foster family and having his siblings hate him and all that… but above all, Kiriyama is going through an actual depression. The guy is not just sad, he is depressed and as we all know, depression is when logics very often stop working. As opposed to happiness, Kiriyama cannot just analyse the situation. His sadness is something that he feels with overwhelming force… He FEELS it… and that is why the show chooses abstract visuals to represent his emotions. His reality is distorted, nothing makes sense, he doesn’t know what is wrong… he can only feel the sadness and for him that emotions resembles the scenes that we see. It can be him being submerged by an ocean… him withstanding violent winds… or just a cut where we see the colour black and white just blending in together in a storm with the sound of it becoming a threat to your senses, your emotions. While I believe that these metaphors might work more with some people than it did with others, I still think that they do an incredible job at portraying the emotional distress of the main character without seeming to be just pure time wasting art…. That’s the way I see it. Every cut has a reason to be there. (Apart from the weird 2 or 3 episodes where we would get that weird cat-shogi song in the middle of the episode). While the slow pace of the show gives the audience breathing room, to assimilate all the emotions, there is no denying that when they emotions kick in, they do take your breath away. That is why watching ‘3gatsu no Lion’ is always a viewing experience that I both dreaded and loved.It is also only in episode 22 that you see the visual metaphors being applied to his happiness, and you can already see that it is already better shaped than before. Much less abstract and more of a simile. Which is a splendid way of differentiating between the two emotions; happiness and sadness.2) Being a Masterpiece of Tonal Consistency (Cursing ahead, I got heated during the paragraph)A LOT of anime out there suffer from the tonal consistency issue. Have you watched “Akame ga Kill!”? Or “Bungo Stray Dogs”? These are two anime that I found the most astoundingly offensive when it came to directing because whoever directed those shows had obviously no idea of how to make these anime a pleasant viewing experience. Now, I know a lot of people enjoyed those shows, but I didn’t. Setting aside the issue of the stories just being generic and the characters being bland and boring (Except for the first 4 episodes of the second cour of Bungo), these two anime suffer from massive tonal inconsistency. In “Akame ga Kill!” You would have Tatsumi just witnessing the death of one of his comrades, and the background music playing would be upbeat and light, the shot composition would be this medium shot, cutting characters out with no obvious focus on any particular character’s emotions and literally after 1 minute, Leone or some other punk would crack a joke while they are all fucking attending the FUCKING FUNERALS or some shit like that. Or just pointlessly use “Le Chant de Roma” at any given scene when this soundtrack is clearly for the most dramatic and tense moments! Same thing for “Bungo”, where Dazai would actively go from one tone to another, disrupting the whole mood of the show with no regards to how this affect the narration. What “3-gatsu” does that so many anime failed to do is to have tone shift, yes, but all these tone shifts are occurring instead of being made to happen. Do you see what I’m saying? Probably yes, probably not. Bear with me. Kiriyama is a well-developed character, sure, but he is also very established… his behaviour is set. He will never actively do anything to change the way things are going, he will never just decide to be happy and then see the world as brighter and happier. He doesn’t cause the tone shift, he doesn’t disrupt the emotions that the audience feels alongside him. Instead all the tone shifts are brought about by external characters who enter the scene and cause it to change. Be it Momo jumping into his arms, or Nikaidou trying to change his mood. All the tone shifts happen for the sake of actually changing the tone from dark and sulky to light and funny. They take us by surprise yes but they happen in a way that makes us happy instead of confused about why a character is smiling at his friend’s funerals or why his head is in chibi style when everything around him is fucking Armageddon. Life is also a surprise and tone shifts happen all the time. There is no schedule and that’s why I think “3-gatsu” did a great job at portraying the realism in this way. The tone shifts are done quickly and completely. The mood changes completely without blending or lingering emotions from the previous scene. That is why this anime is gold!This show is not at all style over substance. It anything, its style has substance and its substance has style3) The Directing of Character DevelopmentI am not familiar with the work of Akiyuki Shinbo. I’ve only ever watched “Katte no Kaizou” which is just batshit crazy and fast paced with not much sense. And he seems to be the only director working at Shaft… But I honestly loved how he helmed the show, knowing exactly how to pace it so that the development of the character feels natural and progressive. The first half of the show focused heavily on Kiriyama as an individual and as the show continued, we begin to see how his interactions make him grow and know more about himself so that by the second half (Where the focus in more on shogi) , he is both growing… and discovering more about who he is. His development is done in both a backward and forward fashion as the audience learns more about Kiriyama’s past but also see how he is presently changing. We learn why he behaved the way he did at first and we see what makes him stop behaving that very way. And that is the best kind of development. It was not only about making sure that your character had an interesting past, but also making sure that he evolves over the course of the anime. In this aspect, the development of Kiriyama reminds me very much of Killua Zoldyck’s masterful development in “Hunter X Hunter (2011)”.Kiriyama is the only character who evolves that way as the rest of the cast are explored through backstory but that’s okay because they are actually legitimately very likeable and interesting characters. I’ve always thought that if you cannot make your character behave interestingly, then give him an interesting backstory and if you cannot give him an interesting backstory, then make him act interestingly and be likeable. Luckily, ‘3-gastu’ ensure that all its characters are likeable and are developed properly. The Kawamoto sisters do not change a lot throughout the show but that’s all right because they are genuinely good people who’ve suffered a lot… and their courage to keep moving on and to keep smiling through thick and thin makes them winning characters! We learn about their past and we see how they are, and I’m perfectly satisfied with having them the way they are. They are interesting. Momo is a toddler, she has no fucking development needed at this stage. I’m just happy she is sweet and doesn’t take too much space by just being the cute kids that makes you go “Aww…” but actually served a purpose in developing Kiriyama’s backstory. Akari is my favourite one but she is already an adult and all her development is very much in her backstory. As a supporting character, she is perfect. Hinata is the one which technically would have the most development happening if she were a main character but even she is very low key and doesn’t overstep her boundaries as a supporting character.What I also really enjoyed in the show were the quick cuts to facial expressions and how these definitely help to isolate a particular emotion of the character. That was a really cool bit directing choice. Like I said, every scene in this show is useful…While, I don’t think this show has everything that I need for it to be among my favourites, I still believe that it is one of the best shows of the last few seasons and is special enough in the way it is executed. Many episodes had me smiling like a kid, many episodes had me holding my tears in because I simply could not afford to relive the pain that I was seeing Kiriyama go through.So… is “3-gatsu no Lion” a masterpiece? Not for me. It is a great show with potential of being a Masterpiece had a few things been handled a little differently. I think the focus on Shogi is a little overwhelming at times, as someone who is not familiar nor interested in the game. That is especially apparent in the second half of the anime. The characters, while very well developed and memorable, still aren’t unique. Not enough for me, at least… But otherwise, yes, it is a fantastic show. It truly is. So… I don’t know if I made much sense at all… I felt like writing that shit, so I did. Take care guys.(If only I could put as much thought and dedication in completing my Uni work as I did for this “review”… *sigh*)"", ""The anime was one of the greatest animes everits not underrated like everything thinks , its actually popular enough in Japan .Story 10/10its an anime about life more than Shogi.the anime uses the shogi pieces to tell many parts of life , it does not only focus on the main character but on many other supporting  characters too.its one of the warmest, coldest and and calmest and most touching stories , some people might find it boring , but its a Seinen anime at the end , that's how its supposed to be , the whole show simply is about telling people...to appreciate and enjoy out current moments andnot to waste it ( especially the age of youth ) and also to tell Seinen people who already wasted their youth to not to be sad about it because many people did the same mistake and to be happy about the few memories they made and about the future .the Anime had its own moments in Slice of Life part ,and the Shogi matches partas for the Graphics and Art 9/10 they were pretty cool and they ,it to the storySound 10/10 everything was great especially the water drops .Characters,  I'm not going to talk because I might spoil somehow , but I will just say they were all good and well chosen for such a storyEnjoyment 9/10 , its pretty enjoyable thought , I had a few to go into  deep thoughts about everything the anime reminds me of so sometimes in the past , so I HAD TO REWATCH some few episodes again but the Recap episode did a good job .Enjoyment , kind of I was a bit disappointed about the singer's voice in the second OP  , it was somehow childish but the song was niceand here at the end it deserves 10/10 to appreciate and enjoy out current moments andnot to waste it ( especially the age of youth ) and also to tell Seinen people who already wasted their youth to not to be sad about it because many people did the same mistake and to be happy about the few memories they made and about the future .the Anime had its own moments in Slice of Life part ,and the Shogi matches partas for the Graphics and Art 9/10 they were pretty cool and they ,it to the storySound 10/10 everything was great especially the water drops .Characters,  I'm not going to talk because I might spoil somehow , but I will just say they were all good and well chosen for such a storyEnjoyment 9/10 , its pretty enjoyable thought , I had a few to go into  deep thoughts about everything the anime reminds me of so sometimes in the past , so I HAD TO REWATCH some few episodes again but the Recap episode did a good job .Enjoyment , kind of I was a bit disappointed about the singer's voice in the second OP  , it was somehow childish but the song was niceand here at the end it deserves 10/10"", 'There is no spoilers.Review will be changed when this show will be completely aired.Story:There is not actually a story about something specific.

It's a great show for those who are depressed and want a heartwarming slice-of-life show that doesn't just pander with aesthetics, but intelligent writing and relatively complex subject matter.

This aspect mingles very closely with character for me, so I'll discuss that too here. Rei's struggles to live alone compounded by his lack of family, his struggles...to understand and accept his relationship with shogi, and his introverted personality were all very relatable, as they were realistic and ultimately, very human.The unique art style that experimented with surrealism made what could have been possibly more mundane scenes highly meaning and engaging. It is difficult for me to go into details here, but I was very satisfied to see that this show would not settle for a conventional but cliche art style.The music was great, as the osts used matched their corresponding scenes and the emotions and thoughts involved very well. However, it was the visual metaphor of water in the opening that really stood out to me as outstanding.From beginning to end, the naturally slow pace of the show brought out my enjoyment and appreciation much more that if it had been a fast-paced, plot focused story. It was truly one of those rare shows that goes deeper than an interesting plot to see, or simply strong emotional moments. This is not to say that such shows have no value, but I, and I believe many many others too, appreciate literature that goes beyond plot and emotion at a different level.For me, this was the first anime that prompted me to write a review and receives a well-deserved 10/10 overall from me. to understand and accept his relationship with shogi, and his introverted personality were all very relatable, as they were realistic and ultimately, very human.The unique art style that experimented with surrealism made what could have been possibly more mundane scenes highly meaning and engaging.

Maybe not the genre, but a theme I see in most of them. Cause I have noticed that I can kind of separate drama shows into two parts. Ones that don’t have jokes, and those who do. Maybe this can seem kind of weird, but I have some examples. We have shows like “A Silent Voice”, “Darling in the Franxx” and (Maybe) “Violet Evergarden”. All of these have jokes in them, but they are far and few between. I could tell that they didn’t want to make a comedic show.But then we have shows like “Your...Lie in April” and “Anohana”, who have a lot of jokes. And while it isn’t necessarily bad to have jokes in a drama show, I find that most jokes in these shows don’t fit well with the dramatic aspects.And unfortunately, “March Comes in like a Lion” is one of those show.March comes in like a lion, directed by Akiyuki Shinbou who also directed Bakemonogatari, other Monogatari seasons and Nisekoi, is a really good show. It has some really good music and a pretty unique art style. But unfortunately, I found some parts of it to be boring (There, I said it). When the show is really serious or cute, it is really enjoyable to watch. The Kawamoto family’s interactions were really enjoyable. Making food or just talking, it was all really fun.And similarly, the more psychological parts of the show were also really enjoyable. We get to see how sad and afraid Rei is and how he realizes that when he finds a place he can be happy. It is probably my favorite part since it is where Kai Shimada, my favorite character in the series, gets a lot more development.But whenever the shows do something different, I just found it boring. There were entire scenes that were “comedic”. But I didn’t find it to be funny, and it just dragged the show. At least that’s how I felt.But at the end of the day, I really liked the show. Except for some of the flaws I had (Too many comedic scenes, some cheesy animation, too much “saying what you think”, some underdeveloped characters and parts where I wanted it to be more subtle) it was a very high-quality show.

And I did. Partly I was right, partly I was wrong. Now, more into details.To be clear about the story, you should realise that it's NOT about shogi. In first place it's about Kiriyama Rei, his attitude towards other characters and the world in general.

I could simply sympathy with them. Gosh, haven't I written yet about cats? Just forget everything I wrote till this point. You should watch this show because of brilliant cats :) I know you would love them. I mean, how a human being couldn't possibly like those cats?Heh, okay, back to being serious. There are still some characters whom development we have yet to see in the future. I hope so at least.I did enjoy this show a lot. It is so warm and homelike.

Besides, very interesting main hero, Kiriyama, there are a couple more characters which were unique as well. All characters are very good written. I could feel they were alive. I could simply sympathy with them. Gosh, haven't I written yet about cats? Just forget everything I wrote till this point. You should watch this show because of brilliant cats :) I know you would love them. I mean, how a human being couldn't possibly like those cats?Heh, okay, back to being serious. There are still some characters whom development we have yet to see in the future. I hope so at least.I did enjoy this show a lot. It is so warm and homelike. I can't complain about anything save the fact it's not ended. So, a lot of questions and problems remain unsolved. I have my hopes up for the sequel.I would recommend it to anyone who seeks in anime something more than simple entertainment. Yup, it's a slice of life anime. But not an ordinary one.Highly worth watching."", ""This will be my first time writing a review here and i m well aware no one's going to read this but i simply wanted to etch my thoughts on the show while its fresh in my mind. Alright where do I start?At first I passed 3 gatsu off as a sports anime on shogi. After watching chihayafuru and enjoying it thoroughly, I thought why not watch another niche sports show that i have put on hold for a long time. Thats how I started watching 3 gatsu and realised.....This show is hardly about Shogi. In my opinion if this show was based on...any other niche sports other than shogi, it would have worked just as well.3 gatsu no lion is a Slice of life and its different than most SOL where you have cute girls doing cute things or those shows where there is no defined plot and no character development. Now I m not saying all SOL shows are this way but lets face it, majority of them are. 3 gatsu however has a plot that moves forward and characters that have depth. The Main character, Kiriyama Rei is a pro shogi player who debuted back in middle school and referred to as a prodigy and 'one who will become the future meijin' (master of shogi) but he suffers from many social issues. Then there is his adoptive sister kyouko, who is nothing but a pain in the ass to Rei but somehow, somewhere you realize that she too is an important person to him. Even tho there is nothing to like about Kyouko and really you should be despising her but you kind of understand where she is coming from and sympathise with her to some degree, that in my opinion is a sign of a well written character.Another beautiful  aspect to this anime is how well it uses Visual Metaphors to describe certain scenarios. To name a few, The cuckoo bird to represent how Rei perceives his place in his adopted family, Kyouko as a cracked glass, Kawamoto house as a kotatsu.The soundtracks and especially the second Ending「Orion」by Kenshi Yonetsu was just icing on cake.I m gonna keep this short. Overall I would say a must watch when you are getting bored of repetitive shounens and isekais and wanna watch something fresh.Thats all from me;Jaa ne ~ any other niche sports other than shogi, it would have worked just as well.3 gatsu no lion is a Slice of life and its different than most SOL where you have cute girls doing cute things or those shows where there is no defined plot and no character development.

This is an anime of Fall 2016 that I just started on a whim. I really didn\'t know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised cause this anime was fuckin brilliant. So good that only 12 episodes in, it made it to my end of the year list for Top 5 anime of 2016, and only went on to solidify that position 10 episodes later.Being a Huge Slice of life fan, this anime really stood out to me as unique and one of the best in the genre. The story has a lot of substance and progresses very well, the...main plot about shogi is very unique and at times feels a lot like an actual sports anime. It\'s really great and is very well paced but this anime\'s strongest point are it\'s characters, who do a great job carrying the plot. There is a lot of range and variety in them, They are extremely realistic and relatable, their designs are very unique and everyone is just written so well, Oh, and there are some parallels too. Especially our MC, Kiriyama Rei. He is really how good an introvert MC can get. He is considered a Prodigy Shogi player but he has a really dark past and he is such a loner. To see things from his perspective is something that\'s very interesting and this show does it extremely well. You sympathize with him and start to genuinely root for him, watching him grow and develop along the way is such a joy to watch. I love his first person narration too, It feels like having a real conversation with him and he says a lot of deep things, I could just listen to him all day.There are a lot of cute and lighthearted moments that puts a genuine smile on my face. It\'s another thing this anime does very well, It does a great job at balancing the dark and light themes. Which is possible through the great quantity and quality side characters. Especially the scenes with Kiriyama and the Kawamoto family. Momo-chan and the Nekos are so cute, they alone make the show worth watching. The other elder sisters and Kiriyama empathize with each other, They provide some much needed hospitality and help Kiriyama overcome his loneliness. Those scenes are really warm and make you go like ""Ah..That\'s such a lovely family"" but nah, they\'ve been through some shit too, there is always that lowkey sadness under that bright smile. They\'ve been holding back a lot, but we all want to be happy, we all want to or should at least try to look forward to a bright future no matter how dark our past is or how big of a mark it left on us. This is something the anime conveys really well.Again, This anime has a fine amount of well written side characters, some of my favorites are Nikaidou, He considers himself as our MC\'s rival and best friend. He\'s a very charming and energetic character and it\'s hard not to love how passionate he is about Shogi. Kyouko is someone who\'s negatively affected our MC in past, She is that character you\'ll hate but still feel for. Shimada is one of my favorite characters, He\'s very calm and mature. But his ambitions and back story are what make you wanna really root for him. Touji Souya is the #1 Shogi player, He has ""Loner"" written all over him and I really like the mysterious vibes i get from him, also has like parallels to Kiriyama which I mentioned earlier. Can\'t take my eyes off him during his screen presence. I could talk about them all day, just few of brilliant characters here.I love the animation and soundtrack. The art style is very unique and refreshing. some of the city and water landscapes are breathtaking as well. It does a great job of making the quiet and lonely atmosphere feel like a quiet and lonely atmosphere.The Soundtracks are soooo good. Sometimes they come in so well it gives me chills. It\'s just excellent. I love all the OPs and EDs as well. I watch the second OP at least 5 times before starting the episode. It is Performed by Yuki. Who also performed the OP of ""Sakamichi no Apollon"". Another one of my favorite OPs. Her voice is kinda weird but brilliant and goes incredibly well with the production. I love the 2nd ED too! It gives me some lonely, nostalgic vibes. Love it.Overall I really enjoyed this show, I\'d give it a 9.25/10. This is an anime I\'d highly recommend. Again, one of the best shows of 2016 in my opinion. I\'d suggest it to even people who don\'t normally enjoy Slice of life as well. It has something for everyone so just give it a shot and hopefully you\'ll enjoy it as much as I did! main plot about shogi is very unique and at times feels a lot like an actual sports anime.

It takes it's time and addresses many small details, which can make it seem slow. However, I thoroughly enjoy this sort of storytelling, and it allows me to really think on every situation and dilemma. There are plenty of explanations about the story, so I would just like to focus on what this show did and why I rated as high as...I did.First, the general writing. By the and of the season, I felt as if I knew the characters personally, that I understood what drives them and what they struggle with on a daily basis. The characters were felt so real, that I was captivated whenever they spoke. The main character, Rei, is obviously dealing with some form of depression, and perhaps even social anxiety, but this doesn't take over his character. Too many times have I seen characters with a single defining personality trait: always happy and excited, always quiet and calm, always emo and sad, etc. Rei is seen feeling lonely, excited, happy, content, depressed to the point of sickness, and even more. Rei, I feel, is a character that many teenagers can relate too on some level. He wants to have a place where he firmly belongs and he wants to have control of his life.Meanwhile there are the three girls: Momo, Hinata, and Akari. They are also dealing with their own problems (though mostly Hinata and Akari, as Momo is still a small child). However, unlike Rei, their tragic losses have helped them grow closer as a family, making their home warm and comforting, and Rei even compares it to a kotatsu. This is what we all want: a place where we can feel safe, at peace, as though our troubles are gone even for a moment. Regardless, the three sisters still cope with their loss and sadness.What stood out to me the most in the show was the realness of it, and how well it was written, to a point where I'm not sure I can talk about much else. The art was consistently beautiful, the soundtrack was moving, and the story was endearing. If you're looking for an amazing story, watch this. If you aren't a fan of slow pacing, try it out anyways! I think this is a show everyone should at least try, because god knows this has risen to my top favorites in anime.

As they sing of spring, I hear a voice calling in the distance…. And I think, if I ever really were a bird, then at least I would pass through the days oblivious to such agonising torment as this.” – Rei KiriyamaAgainst the backdrop of these lines, I introduce you to Kiriyama Rei the protagonist and primary narrator of the anime Sangatsu no Lion (March comes in like a Lion). A boy who is not quite a boy anymore, ripe on the outside but still pretty rough around the edges, our...window into this contemporary urban Japanese setting which is an interplay of his professional life as a prodigy Shogi player and his personal life as an introverted Highschooler staying away from home and fending for himself.But don’t be fooled into thinking of it as another one of those cliched high school settings with prodigies, and it is neither an excitement-filled or passionate journey to become the very best either. Instead at the heart of it lies something much more basic, fierce and cold at times, yet warm bouncy and calming at times, it is life itself. In the simplicity of this show lies its strength. It boasts of well-developed characters with deep personalities, and they feel like human beings, and it is only the circumstances that lead to how you perceive them.In a setting such as this, emotions and mental mindset play a central role, and Studio Shaft has really delivered. The sceneries are gorgeous, with brilliant use of colours, the same landscape speaks differently depending on the mood of the characters, you can feel warmth and comfort at times, and the same background is also capable of sending shivers down the spine. The colours fluctuate with the mood of our characters. The art style and story is faithful to the manga, and the way faces are drawn may weird you out initially, but they play a huge role in emphasising emotions. It’s a coming of age story which develops at a languid pace, tackling issues very relatable for us and perhaps providing an answer to some of them and leaving some of them open as an exercise for the viewers.A central theme is how it showcases life as a battle. It shows how everyone has their demons, and while comparatively, one could be better off than the other, but in the end, the biggest battle is with oneself. This individualistic nature of this war doesn’t mean it has to be waged alone, to progress further you will have to reach out to your fellow comrades, you will gain from them, you will get hurt at times, you will hurt them, grow with them, lose them, cast them aside, slowly but surely you would find some people with whom you will have both ways interaction and call them your friends and family and a place with them you’ll call home. The irony in all of this is that no matter how many people you have, in the end, you are still alone. Still, the idea is to make that little effort to realise there the two situations are infinitesimally close to each other yet possess an enormous difference of mindset.

That’s a good chunk of the show. However, a lot of the monologue is particularly relatable and profound.The scenario is the main reason I began watching this. It reminded me of Your Lie in April for some reason. I'm happy to report that it is nowhere near as sad... at least not in the same way.The characters are also particularly well done. They are human and damaged. I found myself painfully familiar with...some characters, as I know people like them. At the end of the day every one of them is just struggling to find meaning and love whether they think they're worthy of it or not.The only major criticism I have is the shows issues balancing shogi and relationship arcs. The first half focuses pretty heavy on the latter. Then it finished up strong on the shogi. If anything it should have been reversed. But hopefully they’ll do a better job interweaving the two in season two, which I am already watching as it airs.It's hard to rate the overall story at this point, as the second season is still airing. It has a lot of potential.A definate watch. some characters, as I know people like them.

But there's just something missing from this series as a whole. The best way I can describe it is that it just feels mundane. As a whole it's definitely a nice mellow series with the beautiful art and calm soothing sounds but there's just a huge gap that cannot be filled and that for me is the plot.The plot is just so empty it makes watching this show feel...like something I want to do when I'm really bored or when I just want to chill for a while. It's not going to be a page turner that's for sure but if you're into stuff like that (which I thought I was because I really like slice of life stuff) then sure give it a shot but after 5 or 6 episodes I couldn't see a point in really pursuing it although I have watched through the whole series. The MC just feels pathetic and his self deprecation throughout the show borders on irritating but there are nice moments in the show too where I feel good just listening to the sounds and watching the characters laugh and smile.

How is Sangatsu No Lion different from Your Lie in April? Your Lie in April was focused on the love between characters and their emotions for each other well Sangatsu No Lion switches it up and focuses on the love between family members and their feelings for each other.The premise is still the same, Main character with a sad backstory focusing at becoming the...best at something he doesn\'t love anymore, meets a person (or people in this case) that pulls him out of his depression and shows him there is more to life than just piano or shogi. Both show struggling characters climbing up and meeting other characters with similar problems to them. However the big difference here lies in the love. Your Lie in April deals with love to one person between all the characters well Sangatsu No Lion deals with love for family members and people so close that they feel like family.Sangatsu No Lion is very similar to Your Lie in April but is still extremely different in lots of aspects. I really think Sangatsu No Lion did an amazing job at being enjoyable even if I didn\'t really understand shogi, I think one of the best parts of the series is when Nikaido is teaching Hinata and Momo how to play shogi and the whole time i\'m thinking ""This is just for us people who have no idea what they\'re doing"" after that I went and did research on shogi just because I felt sad that I was being taught like a child. I still have next to no idea what i\'m doing but at least I can proudly say I know what the different pieces do (kind of.)Anyway, I definitely recommend this anime to everyone, especially if you enjoyed Your Lie in April. The anime all around tells such a good story and all the characters are so goddamn lovable that there\'s no way I could not recommend it.

I can’t say for certain what caught my eye with the story, since it’s a slice of life. I’ve always loved this genre and the calmness behind it, which was very well portrayed throughout the anime.The awesome first-person narration manages to describe, without explicit telling, exactly what goes through Rei’s mind and his feelings at the moment. I could even say that every line has some kind of poetic depth to it, with the main focus being the confusion and sadness...of the character. The addition of the three sisters in contrast to Rei’s apparent depression was a big yes for me, along with the no-romance path this first season took, showing that a slice of life can be very joyful and entertaining even without a dramatic relationship.The art. I wasn’t used to Shaft’s drawing style, (and i had a problem specially with the mouths) - not meaning that it’s poorly drawn. But characters’ aside, the art with the background, the city and mainly the expressive way of showing Rei’s feelings with distinct images, added a huge depth to the story. In this anime, i must say narration and art had a complementary relationship. That perfect mix gave me chills during some parts of it! Simply a piece of art in storytelling.The sounds. Aside mundane sounds and narration in general, nothing else caught my attention in special. Notice that anime didn’t require much of it, and when it did, it was a perfect job overall.The Characters, as mentioned, were a good mix in contrast. The three sister’s home being Rei’s safe place added a warmth tone to the story that the main character was lacking, due to all his emotional scarring. Calmness was noticeable with all the characters. But there was constant sadness within Rei and even the sisters, even though they were portrayed as the safe zone and contrast to Rei. Another example of the explendid of narration lays right on this point. The emotional baggage with all of them was so unbearable it could almost be palpable. Merging with the joyful scenes between them in the sisters’ house, it was discreet, the “elephant in the room”. Not talked about, but seen, felt.I’m including “enjoyment” and “overall” scales in this last topic. This anime was sowmthing to pay attention and just feel. It didn’t require you to do anything else. A mere art to be enjoyed. Although, i have to admit it got tiring on some episodes, for example the ones with only shogi talk, it was probably fun for those who knew the game, but that wasn’t my case.

Although, i have to admit it got tiring on some episodes, for example the ones with only shogi talk, it was probably fun for those who knew the game, but that wasn’t my case. Overall, i hope you guys had a nice ass time watching this, because i did!', ""Although I like anime in general, I have a critical side that doesn't let me like many of them, be it for the plot, the characters, the genre, etc. This even among my favorite animes, that although I love them a lot, some I don't even consider masterpiece but I for sure do for 3-gatsu no lion.First let's talk about the simplest part. 3-Gatsu no Lion is an anime of slice of life, drama and sport. We followed the story of Rei Kiriyama, a 17-year-old teenager who recently started living alone in an unknown city in a small, empty apartment, financed by his salary as...a professional shogi player.Rei has a lot of problems that come from his childhood (I will not go too deep to avoid spoilers), he is isolated and almost does not go to school, partly because he is too busy with shogi matches, partly because he has difficulties in socializing and interact, so he doesn't get along very well with his classmates.We also have the Kawamoto sisters, three sisters who live a very happy and simple life in a busy house with little space. They welcome Rei as if he were part of the family, and he visits them frequently, receiving much affection from the three of them.It's a story that has everything to be boring and tedious, and that's where the magic of this anime happens, it's not boring at all and much less tedious.Despite having sports in the genres, 3-Gatsu no Lion doesn't get caught up in that, and you don't need to understand shogi to watch the anime (for example I didn't understand anything about the game from the beginning to end of the anime), and he doesn't try to teach you, there is even an episode that “teaches”, but you can’t understand much, shogi is a very complex game and if you want to understand to see the anime, you’ll have to do it from the outside, but as I said before, it’s not necessary. That's because the focus is not shogi, the game is practically just a mechanism for the story to unfold, the real focus it's the plot and the relationship between the characters. This anime does not get caught up in his genres, it goes further and manages, with mastery, to approach various themes and various genres.It has funny scenes; sad scenes; exciting scenes; cute scenes, just like the characters, ones you love; some you hate; others you don't even care so much, because they all have a magnificent development, you don't have to go through what the character went through to understand and identify with them. This is the magic of this anime, all the characters have an importance within the work, they all live their lives, regardless of what happens with the protagonist or with others, their life continues and doesn’t stop to focus on a specific character ,sometimes not even in the protagonist (who has episodes that don't appear as much). It is literally a masterpiece.There are two factors for this anime being such a masterpiece: The first and most important is the creator Chica Umino, for creating this incredible story and all these super well developed characters. The second factor is the SHAFT studio, throughout the anime adaptation, and those who know the studio know how good they are at picking up stories that, by themselves, are great, but they are not done with that and they improve a lot those stories in the adaptation. The studio manages to do all the technical part of the anime in an incredible way; art direction, animation, soundtrack, dubbing. Literally everything is there in a very well done and well placed, with extreme care.3-Gatsu has rich and real interactions between the characters, and together with these poetic monologues and “deconstructed” scenes from SHAFT, it makes the anime very interesting and very good to watch, it manages to strike a balance between the story and interaction of the characters without leaving any boring and dull sides, something that is hard to find on this types of anime. You are not sleepy or tired watching because it has lot of story for you to know or has a lot of dialogue, on the contrary, you will probably want to see more.So, why should you watch 3-Gatsu no Lion?- It has incredible openings, closings and soundtracks.- Wonderful animation and very focused on art, often almost like a painting, which makes everything more interesting.- Very poetic / metaphorical dialogues and scenes.- The protagonist has one of the best depictions of depression that exists in anime.- Extremely well developed and dynamic characters, almost as if they were real people.- Finally, cats have voices for their thoughts. And that's is super cute..Once again I can for sure say this is my favorite anime in the category Slice of life/Drama it's really a trully masterpiece and I recommend to everyone who's into those slow deep shows, this one is a really good one and full of love :smile:This post does not go so much into details but explains and shows the essential for you to start to watch and btw... The 2 season is even betterOfc if u are only into mainstream animes or different genres and u don't characterize at all with what u read, then u probably won't like it but u can always give it a try :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: a professional shogi player.Rei has a lot of problems that come from his childhood (I will not go too deep to avoid spoilers), he is isolated and almost does not go to school, partly because he is too busy with shogi matches, partly because he has difficulties in socializing and interact, so he doesn't get along very well with his classmates.We also have the Kawamoto sisters, three sisters who live a very happy and simple life in a busy house with little space.

I had seen it on the recently updated tab on Crunchyroll one day and as they say the rest is history. I went in completely blind to this show with absolutely no expectations. While watching this show it simultaneously felt like being called out and getting a warm comforting hug. The storytelling is just phenomenal. The characters are relatable and realistic. They feel like real people that you might one day be able to meet. The art is gorgeous and atmospheric. If anyone is thinking about giving this show a chance, I...implore you to please give it a chance. implore you to please give it a chance.', 'Amazing show. Different type of show than what the studio usually makes (e.g., Monogatari series, madoka magica, etc). Awesome main character. Lips might look weird, but art is very nice. Lovely soundtrack. Show has Shogi but is focused on the characters. A little slow at first but is definitely worth watching.The story is extremely unique, and the characters are realistic and well-rounded. Main character is a child-prodigy but is still a real person. Not overpowered, not flawless.No knowledge of Shogi is needed, and anyone will enjoy this anime. The second season is also peak and definitely worth reaching even if this season is...not your favorite. 10/10 would recommend. not your favorite. 10/10 would recommend.', ""Maybe it’s just that I’m a sucker for down-to-earth, character-driven dramas but this was certainly a good watch for me, even though they did start to lose me a bit during the shogi matches.This is an anime about a boy who finds solace in shogi. Maybe because, despite everything he has been through, it's the one thing that will always be there and has always been there.What strikes me about the life of Rei is how simple it is, but that is exactly why it is so charming. Everyone goes about their day, talk to the people they talk to, eat the food...they eat, maybe give themselves a little treat because a compliment they got hit the right spot. And then, a driver who was too piss drunk to be on the road rams into your car.Tomorrow would have just been another normal day, if I hadn't gone out tonight, you might think.This story shows the ripples of disaster that disrupts Rei's daily life. But he always finds a way to find a comfortable place for himself. Whether it’s through honing his skill in shogi by going against great players or by spending a warm evening with the sisters, he always finds a way. This could be to show that life won’t always be the same. Everyone struggles even when they’re at their best, but one can also find rays of light in a dark place. Rei had a difficult childhood, and still leads a life that he often finds to be confusing, sometimes overwhelming. But, every so often he forgets about all that when he finds one of those rays of light.3-gatsu has a very relaxing nature to its storytelling. Even at its most intense moments, it isn’t exciting, better described as simply engaging. All the characters are able to form a solid cast that show off their quirks to distinguish themselves within the sizeable cast and act as connections to different parts of Rei’s life. I don’t feel the need to comment on production, as its quality speaks for itself.I have a few unanswered questions that I imposed to myself, regarding the plot, such as Rei’s name (which means ‘zero’) and what significance could the way he plays shogi have to his experiences and behaviour. Well, this isn’t an English paper I’m writing for the end of term, it’s a review, and hopefully you have found a reason to watch or continue watching this show. they eat, maybe give themselves a little treat because a compliment they got hit the right spot.

It presents itself like a form depression, but not necessarily one that affects you that same way. Its more like a lingering presence, or a sad realization. “It is like walking up the stairs to your bedroom in the dark, and thinking there is one more stair than there is. Your foot falls down, through the air, and there is a sickly moment of dark surprise as you try and readjust the way you thought of things.” My favorite quote concerning this topic.So, at this you’re probably aware that grief plays a part in 3 Gatsu No...Lion. It certainly is a unique adversary in a show that presumes to make you think it’s in fact about shogi. It is about shogi, but it’s also about grief. At least, as the show progresses, we’ll come to understand they are one and the same. One connects our character to the other.But our protagonist is not completely without some fortune, as we slowly a drown into his world through the first episode. Characters will present themselves and we’ll begin to see all the making of a happy life, but one constantly weighed down upon by the conflicting memoires of loss. At times, it will almost seem as though even the greatest of friends can’t fill the void, but it certainly helps lessons its toll.Needless to say, the art style in 3 Gatsu Lion is unique, it bears a soul. Every picturesque establishing shot, or subtle in between frame, captures a would alive with its own heart. Its light and warm at times and at others its gritty and dark, constant contrasts of emotions seamlessly bleed though every beautifully drawn moment. This is a show that speaks as much during silence as it does during commotion. A wordless conversation conveyed with nothing but the gestures of pieces moving on the board.This it certainly a show that knows how to express itself. Whether its during a wacky bubbly scene amongst family members, or the moments when it feels as though water is coming in all around, and nothing can save our protagonist from drowning in the all-consuming darkness. But there is almost always a light there, even if one must begrudgingly make their way toward it.It’s not up for debate why this show is good, you simply need to see it to understand. It is an exploration of a character that it uniquely conflicted, who doesn’t understand why he continues, but he does. We learn as he does throughout the show, what the value and meaning of life is, what its purpose is. And most of all, what it means to us. Lion.

I also like that Rei is not treated as just another sympathetic character with a tragic backstory. Yes, some of that is present in the show, but he himself made mistakes, distanced himself from his adoptive family, and caused some problems for himself by isolating himself. And he does it more whenever he feels melancholy, which just makes it worse, having to deal with his emotions himself.I also like that, while Kiriyama is extremely good at Shogi, he isn't perfect and doesn't win to...anyone and everyone. That is what I expected going in, that he was a prodigy once who had lost his way and was getting back to where he was. But no, he himself is a good player who isn't a God-level prodigy. His losses were surprising and afforded a wealth of development for him and the person playing against him. This is better with the off-screen losses, because it doesn't treat a loss like it's the end of the world.The Kawamoto family is adorable. And the contrast between the warmth of the Kawamoto family and the cold isolation of Rei and his adoptive family is very interesting and was very intentional. It makes me yearn to see him visit them because he feels at home with them and they see him as family. And the music used during these warm or touching scenes is beautiful. The Kawamoto sisters aren't as heavily used in this season as they are in Season 2, but that just makes Season 2 all the better, especially when it begins to give them more character development. anyone and everyone.

But where these anime fails, 3-gatsu succeeds. It doesn’t bring any new concepts in the table rather executes the already “cliché” ideas in a poetic way and this was certainly a beautiful experience for me as I hope will be for you too.Enter Rei Kiriyama,who from 1st impression appears to be an independent/lonely high school kid...living alone and also appears to be a pro shogi player. Did I mention he is introverted too? And to establish these understandings about his character the anime does a fantastic job as the first couple minutes of the 1st episode has no dialogue or interactions rather we see “Life”. Life presented in such a poetic way which instantly sucks in the viewers for the rest of the episodes. Through Rei, we get to see his life from early childhood up to now through bullying, loneliness, tragedy. But despite these, Rei moves on as if swimming through huge sea trying to reach a island and through this the only thing that accompanies Rei’s mind is Shogi as he sees it as his only ticket out of this dark, lonely world. But contrary to Rei’s believe Shogi isn’t the only thing that accompanies him as we slowly get sucked into the lives of the 3 sisters, his adoptive family, Shogi partners, the school teacher and more. Each of them has their own story to tell as we get to see glimpse of it through Rei as the story progresses. Now, what made the story stand out is the execution of Rei’s own inner problems. Despite going through an one year journey while making friends,acquaintances while experiencing many things Rei believes he hasn’t changed at all and so are the others; all searching for that one ticket to board the train of happiness.Now, the story is near perfect but it does get over dramatic at times which isn’t necessarily a bad thing but even beautiful repetitiveness has it’s limit. So, be expect to get “bored” in certain episodes especially in the later half where the story kind of loses it’s direction but gets back on track in the final few episodes, so not much of a problem. Also despite having zero knowledge about shogi, I thoroughly enjoyed watching the matches. This was only possible due to the poetic nature of the anime and I absolutely love it.As for characters, most of the cast were well written and made the overall story impactful. Only problem I had was vagueness of certain characters motives or intentions in the story which hopefully will be resolved in s2. Despite these tiny nitpickings the story does great job in presenting characters in unique situations. One moment it can get really tragic while the next moment is pure wholesome before the viewer can even notice it.Furthermore, the art style is tragically beautiful as the mixing of dark-white color was the best I have seen. Besides, Use of lightening to represent certain character moods and the aesthetics of the overall animation were also another great job done by the studio. This along with the pleasant soundtrack made the anime so much more impactful to the viewers.Overall, this is without a doubt one of the best slice of life anime out there. Also I heard some viewers get put off the anime due to the art style (or should I say face style heh) which I was also kinda bothered with but trust me, getting used to it will result in one of the best experiences from watching anime and you won’t certainly regret it.Story-8/10Characters-8/10Art-10/10Sound-10/10Enjoyment-9/10Overall – 9/10 living alone and also appears to be a pro shogi player.

The story is great and very touching, the characters are probably my favorite part of the show, especially rei. The art and animation is amazing, but that\'s to be expected from shaft. The sound in this anime is so good as well, and the first opening is just really really good.

Highly recommend it to everyone!!! I thought I could never see a great anime after You Lie in April, but then I started on this and was amazed! It is very sentimental and emotional, at the same time it has great story and some serious matters of the reality we live in.After finishing the show i feel so nostalgic and kind of depressed:( like no more of Rei and the Kawamoto sisters:( I really hope they come back with a 3rd season!!! But then again, even that will end with time.. like they say, life is nothing but goodbyes:( ', '-Story and characters-3-gatsu no lion falls into the ""slice of life"" category. I find it hard sometimes to enjoy fully most of these animes. However when I find something I like, I quickly fall in love with the story. The main chara Kiriyama is an introverted and quiet teen who is going through traumatic events, on top of that he shows signs of depression and guilt. Throughout the show we can see and feel his anxious mind going through a lot of pain and that made me so sad I could almost feel this pain. But as the show goes on at a very slow...path, they teach us the importance of caring for others and seeking help when in need. I strongly appreaciate mr .Takahashi\'s  (his high school teacher) words. The sisters that have been helping Kiriyama are becoming his support and new found hope. But let\'s not forget it envolves  Shogi, a tradictional eastern chess. I have to admit that there are several long scenes about shogi that are kinda confusing. The show won\'t tell you exactly what\'s happening but it would rather narrate the players feelings and strategies. As a charather I really like Kiriyama, he seems very mature but he lacks the ability to take good care of himself and to be more open about his feelings, I sometimes doubt he knows himself. Only when people around him look for him then he realises how much he was holding in.-Art and sound-The animation fits perfectly with the mood- the inner feelings and the outer enviroment- As many people have noticed, the town where Kiriyama lives is surrounded by a river. There are a lot of moments where water and river are mentioned : when he feels so lost all he can do is drown or how peaceful it is to him to watch the surface of a clear river. The bridge that links his neighbourhood with the sister\'s house  is shown to visually represent his barrier to the outside world. Sometimes this can bright and warm and sometimes it could be windy and dark. The art for the op and ed are original, I love the hand drawn style and the soft colors, the glowy eyes and dramatic scenes. The songs aren\'t remarkable but plays well with the story. path, they teach us the importance of caring for others and seeking help when in need.

Coming to terms with his family's sudden demise; the lack of acceptance of his half-siblings and the stress of meeting people's expectations all while exploring the thought processes of an introverted teenager yearning to find acceptance in society and ultimately achieving Self Acceptance.The Dichotomy of Kiriyama's despair & the wholesomeness of the Kawamoto family set in motion a rollercoaster of feelings which always left me feeling immensely content.I'd eagerly anticipate each new episode, waiting impatiently throughout the week, just to experience that wonderful...feeling of catharsis each episode emanated.This is a Slice of Life which goes above and beyond to immerse the viewer into it's world.

Then, somewhere along the winding path that is Rei Kiriyama\'s life, I was hooked.  This isn\'t just a sports anime, where it\'s only about the protagonist progressing through a shogi championship.  It isn\'t just a comedy about a lonely outcast making friends with the Kawamoto sisters.  It isn\'t just a drama about a boy dealing with his family.  It\'s all of those wrapped into one.  It\'s a truly interesting mix that I can\'t wait to...keep watching in season 2.Characters 10Rei Kiriyama may fit into the ""troubled young prodigy"" archetype, but to me he seems different.  He slowly grows on you, you start to understand him, and soon you care about him more than anyone else in the world.  He\'s genuine and complex, and a fascinating character to watch.  The Kawamoto sisters (and their cats) are hilarious, and you just fall in love with them at first sight.  The shogi players Rei meets are interesting and well-developed, especially Shimada.  Rei\'s adoptive sister Kyouko is a despicable character but well suited to the story.Art 10The art matches the story perfectly.  The style and colors shift depending on the mood, and much like the anime itself, I found myself initially hesitant about it, then completely immersed.Music 9Very good openings and endings that capture the feel of the anime.Overall/Enjoyment 10This is a profound, must-watch anime.  As I mentioned, the art, music, and story all work together to create a unique and distinctive feel for this anime.  I am completely hooked and fully invested in the story now. keep watching in season 2.Characters 10Rei Kiriyama may fit into the ""troubled young prodigy"" archetype, but to me he seems different.

So yeah extra advice..download the op nd listen it..Moving on next, the storyline of March comes in like a lion..i.e sangatsu no lion..a typical slice of lyf sports seinen drama..the anime revolves around the extreme loneliness of Kuriyama Rei, a pro shogi player as a mere high schooler..(shogi is  Japanese chess)...who left his home at an age of 17 yrs..to live in a separate...apartment in Tokyo..yeah same reason due to his loneliness nd ultra introvert nature (his parents nd a younger sister died when he was just a child)..and thereafter Kawamoto sisters namely Akari, Hinata nd Momo,  trying their best to relieve his loneliness.Since it\'s a sports anime..so there\'s a lot of moments of breathlessness..nd then is the darker side of the anime as its seinen..which can be justified from Kuriyama Rei\'s monologues. I felt the most captivating  past of Rei is the dark statement of Kyouko Kouda, his step older sister.., telling Rei that his name actually signifies zero..tho literally rei means zero..but she states this out of her sheer jealousy over his inbuilt shogi talent as she had been a shogi player herself...all cuz of her own father acknowledging Rei\'s talent instead of her.Now if u like slice of lyf genre..then it\'s a gold mine for u..but those who think slice of lyf moves at a slower pace nd u may doze off like me..then it\'s so boring don\'t watch it..this is one of the reasons for me not continuing season 2.But even if I didn\'t like the concept much since it doesn\'t suits my taste..the anime picture nd sound quality r marvelous..it makes u fall in the anime itself..afterall what less can u expect from the ""monogatari series"" production house, SHAFT. apartment in Tokyo..yeah same reason due to his loneliness nd ultra introvert nature (his parents nd a younger sister died when he was just a child)..and thereafter Kawamoto sisters namely Akari, Hinata nd Momo,  trying their best to relieve his loneliness.Since it\'s a sports anime..so there\'s a lot of moments of breathlessness..nd then is the darker side of the anime as its seinen..which can be justified from Kuriyama Rei\'s monologues.

Its storytelling is on par with the best that anime currently has to offer, and is one of the most relevant stories to young adults that has been recently told.Story: 9/10The protagonist, Rei Kiriyama, is a shy, quiet, and reserved person. Many an issue plague him throughout his life, which proves to test his resolve greatly. The story follows Rei in his journey through his life as a professional shogi player, and also...his many personal trials and tribulations outside of his shogi matches. A very simple premise, but one that is told both beautifully and realistically. Newcomers to this series should beware that it is a very dialogue-heavy show, rife with characterization and gradual plot progression. The shogi aspect of the story may feel somewhat boring or monotonous for those who are not familiar with it, but they are done well enough to immerse the viewer from the very first time. When one digs deeper, however, the themes behind this narrative are truly beautiful, and relevant. Rei\'s battle with depression and his subsequent triumphs speak volumes about perseverance, while the Kawamotos lend to the importance of having a support structure through life. Rei\'s relationship with shogi accurately represents life\'s unforgiving nature, and further reinforce the importance of persistence. This is just scratching the surface of the many statements that the narrative makes! This all being said, it is not a show that any anime fan can sit through and stay engaged in. If you are into character-driven, realistic fiction narratives, then this show is right up your alley.Art: 10/10From the first moment of the show, the distinctive art style is prominent. Personally, I have never seen an anime with an art/animation style quite like 3-gatsu no Lion. It may take some adjustment at first, but by the end it\'s likely to have grown on you immensely, as it did for me. Not only are the character designs almost perfectly faithful to the manga, but it is very clear that the manga\'s use of visuals as symbolism is taken to an entirely new level in the anime adaptation. The use of colors and cutscene-like  simulations (dramatized versions of characters\' thoughts on screen) scattered throughout each episode are used brilliantly in conveying the tone of the scenes. Backgrounds are always clean and well-done, and not a trace of CG animation was used when animating the characters, even for scenes with large crowds.Sound: 10/10Perfection. From voice acting, to OST/OP/ED songs, to background noise, 3-gatsu no Lion shines as an example of the highest quality of production that anime has to offer, among the best ever produced. Characters are brought to life with profound beauty and emotion, with no exceptions. Rei, the Kawamoto sisters, and Kyouko are particularly well-embodied by their voice actors, perfectly balancing their characters\' emotional ranges and effectively conveying them to the viewer. Accompanying the quality voice acting is thoroughly realistic ambient noise, which essentially sounds identical to the real world. It was made abundantly clear that every cup being put on a table, every door being closed/opened, had quality work behind it. While other shows may skimp on these minute details, 3-gatsu no Lion shows once again that it is of the highest quality of anime. The show\'s music is beautiful in its own right, but is also used as yet another way to convey the tone of the narrative. The two opening songs, for example, contrast each other in tone and visuals, the former being more negative/depressing, and the latter taking a lighter tone (reflecting the progress Rei makes in his life and in his battle against depression).Character: 10/10In any anime series I\'ve seen (including other great shows, such as ""A Place Further Than the Universe"" and ""Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu""), I have never experience characters that are as well-developed, realistic, and complex as in 3-gatsu no Lion. While other series\' may only flesh out their main characters, time is taken to develop each prominent character of the show. This characterization is done subtly, over time for most of the main cast, including Rei, his family, the Kawamotos, Kai Shimada and Nikaidou. The seeds of suspicion are planted early after each character\'s introduction, through dialogue and behavior, and later expanded upon in flashbacks which rarely obstruct the narrative of the episode. The result is characterization that does not only feel realistic, but also natural. In short, each character feels like they could be a real person. Each character is complex and distinct, in both behavior and backstory, with Momo being the main (obvious) exception.Enjoyment: 9/10As someone who enjoys getting to know characters, and being immersed in a narrative (maybe even forgetting it\'s fiction periodically), this show was great to sink my teeth into. With a hefty episode count, and plenty of quality narrative material to absorb, it was one of the best anime I\'ve seen. This being said, my unfamiliarity with shogi made some scenes harder to get through than others. I found the scenes exploring Rei\'s relationships with his adoptive family and the Kawamotos, his new ""unofficial"" family, among the most enjoyable and believable fiction I\'ve experienced, but the shogi scenes often made my interest drop until the ends, where the results of the games were revealed. For this reason alone, I could not rate it perfectly. This being said, it did not detract from my experience nearly enough to keep me from rating it less than a Masterpiece overall.Overall: 10/10If you especially character-driven shows, I couldn\'t think of a better anime to watch than this one. The episode count is on the higher side for slice-of-life, especially by today\'s standards, so be prepared to pace yourself. This is a beautiful, touching story that I believe everyone should experience, if they have the time and patience. his many personal trials and tribulations outside of his shogi matches.

Because they deserve awards for this anime, they deserve praising and recognition. To be honest the only Shaft anime I loved before was Soremachi, and the art there wasn't really a reason. I found the art in Nisekoi and Mekakucity confusing sometimes, super creative, though, but none of those really clicked with me. This time? This time I was awed from first second to the last. If for nothing else, I would recommend Sangatsu no lion to be watched for the art and creativity...of the staff. They did such a wonderful job, that I couldn't stop feeling like this is why anime exists. To suck you into a world of wonders, and that is what Sangatsu no lion was for me, a world of wonders.I'm reading the manga, so I was really glad it got an adaptation, but I was never this hyped about it before the anime. The anime pulled up this manga for me so much that I'm not even sure how to express it, because I'd like to just scream about how mindblowingly amazing it was every week.About the story. I saw people saying this story is boring, and I saw them dropping it after a few episodes. Maybe if you never had depression, or never had to deal with someone with depression, you can't really appreciate this story. Because it is mainly about a boy who suffers from severe depression. I saw people saying Rei annoyed them with his tone of voice which was dark, or they could do nothing else but pity him. As someone who had depression, it kind of pains me, to be honest, but what can you do? We can be annoying.However, if you are curious about what it feels like to have depression, or how to try to help your friends with it, give this story a try with open mind, please. It's really good. The art helps you understand how it feels SO WELL. All those scenes when Rei was suffocating under water? All those dark, monotone colors? All the coldness? Ohmygoodness, so well done, so expressing, so easily sucks you into the story.And the part about how to deal with someone who has it? Look at Rei's teacher. Look at how he never pushed him over his limits, but never gave up being a positive influence either. Look at Shimadasan who waited till Rei was able to make the first step, then held this boy's hand tighter than anyone before him. Look at Nikaido who kept coming back, who never was discouraged by Rei's rejection (and also, please try to understand why Rei rejected him, because people like Nikaido, so so full of drive, they are too much when you are under all the weight of the shadows of your mind) And last, but not least, look at the Girls  look at them, and maybe try to understand even if you are the kindest, the most shining person to be around, then you are the goal, you are the dream that needs to be quietly, peacefully be around and always holding your hand out for us, so when we are ready, we can go and grab it - but never rush us.The stages of Rei's recovery are pictured perfectly. He was a fighter before he met the girls, ohmy, never underestimate the power it means to not kill yourself, to wake up in the morning, to decide you'll go back to school - the teacher in the last episode with telling Rei that he won't ask him to do his best, because he is already doing it!!! -, he clung to shougi with all his might to not give up on life, but he was on the verge of losing. Without meeting the girls, without getting that new ray of sunshine to thrivetoward, he would have never been able to let the teacher, Shimadasan or Nikaido help him.In the last episode Rei says he hasn't really changed. I don't think that's true. No, his personality did not change, he will be the introvert, determined kid that he is from now on too. But he did change how he accepts life. He changed the way he looks at other people. Rei in the first half of the season wouldn't have been able to look at the other people around him as companions, but he is now. And that is change. There are relapsing times, there will be from now on too, but he is getting there. And it's maybe just me, but it gave me so much hope. It's so nice to see a character with depression GETTING THERE.It's strange, I wanted to write a review from like the 11th ep? - the one where Rei gets angry for the first time at that old guy for blaming him for his losing, because that was the first real moment to show his shadows are getting thinner, also the first moment when I was awed by Rei's seiyuu's performance - but until this point I thought my main take on the story would be about the people who made Rei like this. But that last episode, the positivity of it, makes me unable to do that. I REALLY liked his step family's problems, you know. They are so contradictory, so flawed, and I could probably hate them if they weren't so human. Everybody is just so human in this story, nobody is black/white, everybody is gray, so you can see them at their worst and best.So yeah, the art, the characters, the story, all of those are just 10/10 for me. And let me tell you the sound is perfect, too. The first part's op and ed? THE FACT THAT BUMP OF CHICKEN GAVE THEIR NAME TO BOTH??? Omg, Bump's music is the equivalent of Sangatsu's story. And the soundtrack is great, too. Emphasizes the coldness of the first part at first, then in the last ep that huge turning point to the happier music? Gawd, I was crying. (Lowkey here for all the seiyuu, too. THIS CAST éaksélaksdékaséka)With that in mind, what else could the enjoyment be than 10? The overall should be 1000, though. I'm sorry, but I'd fight anyone on the importance and perfection of this story. Mental health is important, and it is amazing to have such a well done anime with it in the center. It's not action, it's not sport, it is slice of life, and one of the bests ever done in that genre.Cannot wait for the second season, and more Souya and more of the Girls. And most importantly more of Rei's recovery <3 of the staff. They did such a wonderful job, that I couldn't stop feeling like this is why anime exists.

And most importantly more of Rei's recovery <3"", '(woah woah woah, everything is a 10 but the overall is a 9 ? the explanation is at the end of review. )First and foremost, I truly believe this anime to be a masterpiece and is definitely worth your time. In fact, you should go watch the show right now. If you are still skeptical, I hope this review can change your mind. I believe that you should experience the whole story yourself so I will only be giving the minimal amount of information about the setting of the story.March comes in like a lion revolves around the daily life (and the development...as a person) of a professional shogi (Japanese chess) player , a young 17 year old boy  - Kiriyama Rei. On his journey to escape his past he met the Kawamoto family in an unfamiliar town, from there his life started to change bit by bit….I don’t consider the show to be slice of anime, at least not in the same vein as K-on or Lucky Star, to me, the show is more of a hardcore drama. It can also be considered a sport anime in the same way Ping Pong the animation is one. Some may say the shogi scenes are boring but I think they only add to the show. Shogi matches are merely an excuse to see the interactions between our MC with the supporting characters and a tool used to develop both Rei and his opponent. The characters in this show, especially Rei and the three sisters of the Kawamoto family are very realistic. Their stories are like the lives of someone out there living in the real world being told to us. The depths of the supporting characters are nothing to scoff at either; you’ll clearly see this fact through the previously mentioned shogi matches. It is incredibly enjoyable to watch the growth and maturity Rei gains throughout the series. The character writing in this series is simply superb.At it’s core, March comes in like a lion is not a shogi anime, it’s a coming-of-age anime, a story about overcoming depression, loneliness and traumas. Don’t come into the show expecting all smiles and rainbows. Something I also really like about the show is how it’s also a powerful tale about the struggle of becoming successful and what it actually entails. I think many people can relate to this at some kind of level. This was made apparent in the 10th episode of the show but I won’t go much further into details, you’ll just have to trust me on this unless you want this master piece be spoiled to you.Having the same author as Honey and Clover does really show through the art style and character designs. She has a unique and distinct style that can make some scenes so sweet that you’ll get diabetes but can also make the characters so much more emotional and heavy. The anime is adapted by Shaft, famous for their creative, innovative and experimental adaptation for the Monogatari series. As a manga reader myself, I have seen many of my fellow readers vehemently “hating” on Shaft being the studio who will adapt this manga of the same name. Their arguments being: Shaft’s style does not fit with this manga and so on. However, Shaft being the studio of choice for the author herself; have pulled through yet again with their artful and stylish yet still very genuine animations. Shaft made the transition between the more slow, dark and heavy shogi scenes with the more light hearted and comfortable scenes so seamless, which is a remarkable feat. Dare I say that the soundtrack of March comes in like a lion is one of the best in recent times. It is incredibly gorgeous; the heavy-hitting tracks that are sparsely used always instill very complex emotions into me. You only really need to watch the opening episode to see this. I enjoyed all of the Openings and Endings, they matched well with the show.The show does have slow pacing at times and the dialogues are heavy (very fitting for Shaft). The show does take quite a while to pick up it’s pace, but if you have the patience, you’ll greatly be rewarded. March comes in like a lion currently does not have a conclusive ending end won’t have one for a long time as the source material is also still running. There still many plot points unresolved, but fear not, FOR I AM HERE, the second season of the show (coming October 2017).So in the end, how good is March comes in like a lion ? To me it’s the only thing that had such a huge impact on me in recent times since Aria and Space Brothers. I’m giving it a 9.5/10 and I’m only withholding the 10/10 for future sequels, since I already know as a manga reader that the series is only getting better from here.PS: Kawamoto sisters and owl cats. as a person) of a professional shogi (Japanese chess) player , a young 17 year old boy  - Kiriyama Rei.

It is incredibly enjoyable to watch the growth and maturity Rei gains throughout the series. The character writing in this series is simply superb.At it’s core, March comes in like a lion is not a shogi anime, it’s a coming-of-age anime, a story about overcoming depression, loneliness and traumas. Don’t come into the show expecting all smiles and rainbows. Something I also really like about the show is how it’s also a powerful tale about the struggle of becoming successful and what it actually entails. I think many people can relate to this at some kind of level. This was made apparent in the 10th episode of the show but I won’t go much further into details, you’ll just have to trust me on this unless you want this master piece be spoiled to you.Having the same author as Honey and Clover does really show through the art style and character designs. She has a unique and distinct style that can make some scenes so sweet that you’ll get diabetes but can also make the characters so much more emotional and heavy. The anime is adapted by Shaft, famous for their creative, innovative and experimental adaptation for the Monogatari series. As a manga reader myself, I have seen many of my fellow readers vehemently “hating” on Shaft being the studio who will adapt this manga of the same name. Their arguments being: Shaft’s style does not fit with this manga and so on. However, Shaft being the studio of choice for the author herself; have pulled through yet again with their artful and stylish yet still very genuine animations. Shaft made the transition between the more slow, dark and heavy shogi scenes with the more light hearted and comfortable scenes so seamless, which is a remarkable feat. Dare I say that the soundtrack of March comes in like a lion is one of the best in recent times. It is incredibly gorgeous; the heavy-hitting tracks that are sparsely used always instill very complex emotions into me. You only really need to watch the opening episode to see this. I enjoyed all of the Openings and Endings, they matched well with the show.The show does have slow pacing at times and the dialogues are heavy (very fitting for Shaft). The show does take quite a while to pick up it’s pace, but if you have the patience, you’ll greatly be rewarded. March comes in like a lion currently does not have a conclusive ending end won’t have one for a long time as the source material is also still running. There still many plot points unresolved, but fear not, FOR I AM HERE, the second season of the show (coming October 2017).So in the end, how good is March comes in like a lion ? To me it’s the only thing that had such a huge impact on me in recent times since Aria and Space Brothers. I’m giving it a 9.5/10 and I’m only withholding the 10/10 for future sequels, since I already know as a manga reader that the series is only getting better from here.PS: Kawamoto sisters and owl cats.', 'Sangatsu no Lion is listed as a \'game\' anime first, but that definitely takes a back seat to the slice-of-life/drama genres. It\'s very much a show about shogi, but not the technical aspects - it\'s a show about shogi players, and their struggles and lives.I loved this show, I should just put that out there. I\'m not always a fan of what Shaft does, but in this case they really hit it out of the park. The artistic direction of the show combines perfectly with the story to make each episode a real experience. The first episode is a perfect example of this. I...won\'t spoil anything, because the first episode is one of my favorite \'first episodes\' to air last year, but it\'s super great stuff.Another of this show\'s strong suits is the charm of its characters. Over the course of the show you get to know a lot of people, and come to love (most of) them. Rei in particular - you really get sucked into his story and his troubles and come to feel for him.I had one major con with this show: I don\'t feel it properly resolves all the issues it brings up over the course of the narrative. The issue with Rei\'s family, in particular, sticks out as something that is never dealt with with any finality. I was thinking this might be intentional? To make it feel more ""realistic"" (in life, we don\'t always resolve all our issues at once, after all), or it could be that things were just meant to be open-ended. Either way, I would\'ve appreciated some closure.But basically, Sangatsu no Lion is a great little show, everything you want out of a slice-of-life/drama. It\'s serious and funny by turns, with a character journey I found deeply relatable.

This anime is nothing similar to that anime and I really regretted thinking like that without even giving it a try.This anime has a wonderful story and animation. I am more than satisfied with the character development and the realism felt in the anime. The main character, Kiriyama Rei's emotions and the situation in is very well displayed through the Shaft Studios very own techniques such as monotone colors in the background and simple basic color in the art....I think studio shaft nailed on making this anime personally. They were able to add the soft drawing and funny moments and when the anime was on its serious tone they were able to capture that very well.I have literally no bad comments on this anime and it makes me wonder why this anime wasn't recognized. I may think it is due to the fact that the anime is based on shogi, a board game that isn't well known. But I think while watching this anime you are able to learn about shogi.I am looking forward to its 2nd season.As a person that loves opening and ending themes of an anime, artist Bump Of Chicken sang season 1 (opening and ending) and season 2 (opening) and Yonezu Kenshi which is my favorite singer sang the ending theme of season 2 did great job and the song matches the anime perfectly.

The pace of the relatable slice of life with a hint of unrealism just to relief our stress from our daily life. If this is your slice of life anime, I have to warn you, it either is your cup of tea or it is not: the pacing of the episodes are too slow for some, and too much realism, intensity and lack of comedy in the genre makes it hard to grow likeable. Doesn\'t mean you shouldn\'t give it a shot.March Comes In Like A Lion starts...off great. The story has a main point and focus with a rich background with relatable feelings. It becomes clearer halfway through the anime that the main theme was ""depression"" and ""shogi"".  However, it is hard to convey depressive messages when every 5-10minutes the scene is interrupted by cheerful side characters or cheeky ones. It is not to say it is not allowed but it is overused and reached borderline hateful. It destroys the mood, the audience is unable to digest and digress lessons learnt in the episodes and hard to keep up the pace of the characters as they keep getting interrupted.Most importantly, because shogi is a japanese board game, the chess pieces are in kanji characters, it is not appreciated when they do not fully explained the rules properly and instead entertained it in such an annoyingly enlightened mood which is not catchy. When it is hard to grasp the rules of the board game, it is very anticlimatic and felt like the audience is ""holding lottery tickets to hear the news on the radio on who wins this round"".On the brighter note, the character development was great, considering that aspect alone. There are main but subtle changes in the main character and the side characters are very great developed. The sound is fittingly amazing to the brilliant animation where every scene surely captivates the audience heart, making it memorable. Watching the anime definitely makes you appreciate the minute details you have in life, and how wonderful it is.Should March Comes in as a Lion be you first slice of life? No, unless you like it to be super comedic. However, there are classics out there, that will captivate your heart and breathe you life to your world a perspective you never seen before: an appreciation to live.For others, should you watch? Not unless, you are really bored and need more slice of life entertainment. Nothing wrong with that. No one is perfect. off great.

No one is perfect.', ""i finished this anime yesterday and this is a review for only season 1[SPOILER REVIEW AHEAD]i tried to watch this before, when it came out but i dropped it after 4 episodes, mainly because i felt it's not for me.... i couldn't have been more wrong.I had taken a break from watching anime for a year now and feeling burnt out, i took to give this another try. Around 5th ep the show had me in its grip, It still was a slow start, i suggest to bear through first 4 eps, its not particularly bad or anything. These first few eps, show you...character relationships which are not yet explained how it came to be...Around 5-6 eps in, we are shown rei's backstory and much is shown here on of how he was adopted and how the family crumbled and deteriorated. It's always shown how lonely and depressed rei feels. And yea this really hit home for me... i have gone through much of the same feelings and i was able to sympathize alot with him. All the torrent of emotion be it sadness or happiness are captured so perfectly.In these first few episodes, we only see glimpses of kyouko, his step sister. She blames rei the way she is treated by her father. Gotou, kyouko's lover, at some point has beaten rei and it really stings to see it. Honestly their relation is difficult to put it into words, it's is way too complicated to describe the way rei feels about her. it's is complicated yes but in a good way. The scenes with kyouko are always so forlorn and mysterious. The series develops all the characters and explores them significantly. This show should be watched for its characters more than its story.I particularly adore the 3 sisters who help out our protagonist, without them, this show would have turned too serious and sad. I like how akari and hina are always there for rei. The few times rei smiles is when he is with them.I havent even talked about the other major theme of this show yet. I didnt know much about shogi, but after watching this show, i at least know the pieces and how they move. This is not a sports show, albeit it does a good showing of one. We are shown alot of shogi matches in the second half of the show. The matches are intense even for someone like me who doesnt know about the game at all. I thought gotou and rei would face off at the finals but rei loses to shimada at the semi finals. The matches are never predictive and even if you dont know shogi, you will feel the weight of each move in the match.I really liked how shimada waits for rei to take the first step in asking for help and joining the workshop. Even after working so hard, it became impossible to defeat Souya. The workshop is the key to be better at shogi, i hope rei grows his relationship with shimada further. I really hope rei overcomes his depression which has tormented him for so long. It's something i really want to see from this series.other than that, the ost and animation for the show are phenomenal. all in all, this is a fantastic show, a must watch...currently i'm watching season 2 and enjoying even more than season 1. character relationships which are not yet explained how it came to be...Around 5-6 eps in, we are shown rei's backstory and much is shown here on of how he was adopted and how the family crumbled and deteriorated.

It\'s a seinen/slice of life/sport-game anime! Of course, shogi is not exactly a sport, however everything concerning competitions has the same feeling for me. The same exciting feeling!Rei is our MC and he is really similar to Arima Kousei (Shigatsu) and of course I liked him the moment I saw his sad ""megane"" face. Rei is a ""zero"" in a ""common"" society. Almost invisible, he fails to be a normal high school kid not only because he is a...genius young shogi player but also due to his tragic past. He is a lonely kid trying to be an independent adult. In the anime, we will see how his life changes when he meets new people, some of them are reliable friends, that will help him to find his place on the world.The anime is funny, sad, realistic and exciting at the same time.

I\'ve already added to favorites, it deserves! 3-gatsu no Lion is a masterpiece!', 'I have been avoiding this anime for like two years now, thinking it was ""Oh... another silly melodrama"". So, I waited until the anime was finished airing, then I checked out a few clips of it and thought maybe it wouldn\'t be as bad as I thought. It turns out in some ways, I was right, there were a couple of overemotional parts but the anime in general was fairly decent. I was worried about how the story would turn out from the beginning.The anime is more like a Kyoani anime, since you have your male protagonist meet and befriend some girls. It has a...little melodrama in it, but it doesn\'t try to pull at your emotions as often as a typical Kyoani anime.The story isn\'t anything really special. It\'s about this orphaned shogi player with a traumatic family background and he struggles with socializing and depression. It tends to be too slow-paced and struggles with inconsistent pacing. The first like 10 episodes of the series has Rei bonding with these three girls named Akari, Hinata, and Momo, but the rest of the series is about shogi and Rei withdraws from the girls more. One of the good things about the series is Rei\'s bondage with the three girls, the girls were my favorite character but in the teen episodes, the series throws that out the window and the girls are reduced to side characters. Add in a little excessive drama but we\'ll get to that with the characters.The show mainly focuses on Rei and to a lesser extent, Akari, Hinata, and Momo (before the teen episodes, that is). After that, the show starts focusing more on Rei\'s relationship with the secondary characters who didn\'t get much screentime during Rei\'s bondage with the girls. Those are Rei\'s family and his shogi associates. Rei is an okay character, it took me a lot of time for him to grow on me. He\'s a quiet character who struggles with depression which can make him come off as a crybaby to me.The three girls are adorable and they provide the levity and light-heartedness of the show and that\'s why they\'re my favorites. They\'re a good balance to the gloomy melodrama of Rei\'s life. They are also resilient, strong, caring people who are going through a hard time too but take each day as it comes and I respect that in characters.As for the secondary characters who Rei interacts with beside the girls, they don\'t really get much development. I remember Nikaido and Kyouko getting a little development and backstory but they are still weak characters as they do not get that much backstory or character development as to why they\'re the way they are so I couldn\'t sympathize or relate to them. They both just come off as arrogant, loud characters to me. So, overall, the secondary characters are weak and not compelling.The art and animation is the most beautiful, realistic I have ever seen in anime. Shaft\'s quality could rival that of Kyoani\'s art and animation. I do remember the character designs in the beginning were inconsistent since some of them didn\'t really fit the scenery but that was brief so that\'s forgivable.Do I recommend this anime? Maybe, it\'s not for everyone. It\'s not great but it was fairly decent to me. It turned out better than I thought it would be but I do think that the anime should\'ve laid off some of the melodrama it had.

I would rate it like a 6.4./10.', ""Chess remains one of the oldest and still most popular games of all time. There’s a good reason for this: it’s simplistic layout and rulings with a variety of pieces give it an ocean of depth. The art of trying to put your opponent’s king in a state of inescapable capture while simultaneously keeping yours safe can be as complex as the players want it to be, giving the game a fresh feeling even after all its years of play. Besides the chess most are familiar with, variants of the classic board game are popular in different regions of the world. Shogi, the Japanese variant,...has some unique properties that give the game its own intrigue. It has a bigger board (9x9 vs. the standard 8x8 checkerboard), new or different pieces to chess (gold/silver generals, lance, no queen, etc.) and even has a “revival” system where captured pieces can be used against your opponent. Though both shogi and chess have a near infinite number of options, the way its played is ultimately decided between it’s players. As March Comes in Like a Lion shows, it’s often the players, not the pieces, that are the most complex.The premise for March Comes in Like a Lion is simple. It follows the life of Rei Kiriyama, a 17-year-old shogi player who has become quite notable for his skill at the game despite his age. When not playing or practicing shogi, Rei can be seen eating dinner with the Kawamoto sisters in June City or attempting to be a high school student with the support of his homeroom teacher, Mr. Hayashida. If this premise was seen in a bubble, only going as in-depth as the basics to kickstart a shogi-centric plot, it’d be an otherwise average-to-good sports/game series. What sets March Comes in Like a Lion apart from its competitors is its meaningful look at its ensemble of characters. Though the show has shogi as a holdfast, it is instead a means to an end to examine the lives of its players and their peers. Like the metaphorical river Rei seems to sink in, March shows that there is a lot to each character below the surface.The lead, Rei Kiriyama, is the quintessential example of this. From an outsider’s perspective, he’s an introverted loner type who is prone to awkwardness and stubbornness in making decisions. It’s during the conversations and moments in his life, both past and present, that we see the events that has shaped the way he’s become. A victim of tragedy, Rei is often caught in the crossfires of other’s misfortunes, developing a hedgehog’s dilemma similar to that of Evangelion’s Shinji Ikari. The events he encounters in his life, from his time spent with another family to becoming aware of the current lives of the opponent’s he faces, brings multi-layered psychology to his character and gives believable backing to his hesitant nature. Examples of this can even be seen on the Rei’s external actions. Rei’s most observable quality, his “independence”, is true more so than in name than in action, living in a near empty room, eating rice and cup ramen while only focusing on his next shogi match. Though Rei might not be a charismatic lead like many sports/game genre protagonists, he still remains a strong representation of a dejected individual.Rei, however, is not the only character who has experienced personal misfortune. A majority of the show’s cast, whether minor or major, have also gone through painful experiences. The most interesting part of this is how it has shaped their character. Rei’s “sister”, Kyouko, is often seen angry and mean towards Rei. However, a closer look at her own upbringing and relation to Rei opens up the reasons for her attitudes and her actions (such as pursuing after players like Gotou). The Kawamoto sisters, Akari, Hina and Momo, have an external attitude of being motherly and almost doting towards Rei. Behind it lies personal scars that seek Rei out beyond a level of friendship into a way of healing those wounds. Nikaidou is a boisterous individual who seeks to be Rei’s rival in shogi but carries struggle due to health problems. Shimada is an experienced shogi player whose reserved and frail demeanor hide a deep motivation of the game from his upbringing in the town of Yamagata. While not every character is explored as well as Rei (with the occasional feeling of “drama for drama’s sake” bubbling under), it never reaches a level of hindrance in the story and gives the cast more layers to evoke more realism within the show’s cast.Though as solid as the characterization is, the biggest problem with March Comes in Like a Lion is actually found in its execution/style. Studio Shaft was behind this work and, with director Akiyuki Shinbou on board, you can expect the show to be more colorful and visual than other titles. Though this may work for other series he’s directed (such as the Monogatari series), it often feels as if it’s a major detractor to March’s message and delivery. The show will sharply go from serious to comedy as a way to break the negativity, but it does so in such a silly way that I felt that the tone or impact of a scene was hindered. The infamous “head tilts” found in Shinbou’s work are in full force here. They’re good for emphasizing a point or belief of a character, but when used in excess, it feels unnecessary and detract away from what a character is saying or doing. Because of these decisions, it can feel like Shaft are pouring their resources in heavy artistic flair in a show that doesn’t really need them. There are also a few animation goofs, seeing characters jog in place as if they’re trying to run away or the head tilts leading to a shot that doesn’t match the direction or place a character was. This is partially caused by the animation oversights/limits and partially because of the focus of making this appear more artsy.Ultimately, though, a lot of what the show is at this point will strike people differently. Though the show is indeed a drama, you wouldn’t be remiss to say that it also has quite a few slice-of-life elements. While seeing them can be a nice breather and way to counterpoint the work from becoming too dramatic, I didn’t find as much enjoyment in these more relaxed environments. Though many of them in theory open up Rei to the surrounding world, I don’t always see the immediate or long-term impact from these decisions. I’m more moved by Shimada’s game against Kiriyama than I am seeing Rei eat with the sisters or Nikkaidou’s commentary speech towards Rei. As said before, every moment in the show technically makes an impact in a slice-of-life sense, but it’s more dependent on the viewer as to how much they take away from each scene.Regarding the sound of the show, the seiyuus all did an admirable job portraying their characters. Kengo Kawanishi, Rei’s seiyuu, does a good job portraying Rei’s sensitivity and even his expressions of pain. Nobuhiko Okamato showcases the loud, extraverted passion of Nikaidou, while Misaki Kuno gives Momo a cuteness that would make anyone say “Aww!”. The music itself, outside of the OP’s and ED’s, wasn’t as memorable as I’d like, though there was a pleasant piano piece utilized in the last episode. BUMP OF CHICKEN does a great job capturing that wistful melancholy in OP “Answer” and ED “Fighter”. OP 2, “Sayonara Bystander” by YUKI, doesn’t capture that same feeling. Despite a more raw, “honest” vocal delivery, it has a buildup that doesn’t hit its mark, coming off as flat by the time the OP ends. “orion” by Kenshi Yonezu is a modern smooth pop track, with catchy tenor harmonies and finger snaps. It’s not really for me but I can see the appeal the track has. The only real problematic element I had was found in the sound effects. As an extension of the comedy, the sound effects of the show were said out loud by an overdubbed female seiyuu. While it wasn’t anything very detrimental, it was a contributor that broke my immersion of the show, making the character’s lives feel more silly than serious. Like many of my detriments with the show, though, this will be all dependent on who’s watching and they might appreciate this comedy more than I would.Overall, I give March Comes in Like a Lion a 6/10. At face value, the score looks rather low for my praises, but don’t be fooled. I still think of the show has having great characters and an otherwise good story, but I’m just not sold on Shaft’s interpretation of these events. I feel I would enjoy the manga’s version of what I’ve seen vs. the adaptation. Perhaps I still need to get used to it. Regardless, fans of shows such as Rakugo or other character dramas should definitely watch this show. If you also like Studio Shaft or Shinbou’s style, this will also be another favorite as his fingerprints are all over this show. At its core, though, March Comes in Like a Lion has a lot of good elements and I can easily see users listing this as an essential watch.Do you like or dislike this anime?

It has a bigger board (9x9 vs. the standard 8x8 checkerboard), new or different pieces to chess (gold/silver generals, lance, no queen, etc.) and even has a “revival” system where captured pieces can be used against your opponent. Though both shogi and chess have a near infinite number of options, the way its played is ultimately decided between it’s players. As March Comes in Like a Lion shows, it’s often the players, not the pieces, that are the most complex.The premise for March Comes in Like a Lion is simple. It follows the life of Rei Kiriyama, a 17-year-old shogi player who has become quite notable for his skill at the game despite his age. When not playing or practicing shogi, Rei can be seen eating dinner with the Kawamoto sisters in June City or attempting to be a high school student with the support of his homeroom teacher, Mr. Hayashida. If this premise was seen in a bubble, only going as in-depth as the basics to kickstart a shogi-centric plot, it’d be an otherwise average-to-good sports/game series. What sets March Comes in Like a Lion apart from its competitors is its meaningful look at its ensemble of characters. Though the show has shogi as a holdfast, it is instead a means to an end to examine the lives of its players and their peers. Like the metaphorical river Rei seems to sink in, March shows that there is a lot to each character below the surface.The lead, Rei Kiriyama, is the quintessential example of this. From an outsider’s perspective, he’s an introverted loner type who is prone to awkwardness and stubbornness in making decisions. It’s during the conversations and moments in his life, both past and present, that we see the events that has shaped the way he’s become. A victim of tragedy, Rei is often caught in the crossfires of other’s misfortunes, developing a hedgehog’s dilemma similar to that of Evangelion’s Shinji Ikari. The events he encounters in his life, from his time spent with another family to becoming aware of the current lives of the opponent’s he faces, brings multi-layered psychology to his character and gives believable backing to his hesitant nature. Examples of this can even be seen on the Rei’s external actions. Rei’s most observable quality, his “independence”, is true more so than in name than in action, living in a near empty room, eating rice and cup ramen while only focusing on his next shogi match. Though Rei might not be a charismatic lead like many sports/game genre protagonists, he still remains a strong representation of a dejected individual.Rei, however, is not the only character who has experienced personal misfortune. A majority of the show’s cast, whether minor or major, have also gone through painful experiences. The most interesting part of this is how it has shaped their character. Rei’s “sister”, Kyouko, is often seen angry and mean towards Rei. However, a closer look at her own upbringing and relation to Rei opens up the reasons for her attitudes and her actions (such as pursuing after players like Gotou). The Kawamoto sisters, Akari, Hina and Momo, have an external attitude of being motherly and almost doting towards Rei. Behind it lies personal scars that seek Rei out beyond a level of friendship into a way of healing those wounds. Nikaidou is a boisterous individual who seeks to be Rei’s rival in shogi but carries struggle due to health problems. Shimada is an experienced shogi player whose reserved and frail demeanor hide a deep motivation of the game from his upbringing in the town of Yamagata. While not every character is explored as well as Rei (with the occasional feeling of “drama for drama’s sake” bubbling under), it never reaches a level of hindrance in the story and gives the cast more layers to evoke more realism within the show’s cast.Though as solid as the characterization is, the biggest problem with March Comes in Like a Lion is actually found in its execution/style. Studio Shaft was behind this work and, with director Akiyuki Shinbou on board, you can expect the show to be more colorful and visual than other titles. Though this may work for other series he’s directed (such as the Monogatari series), it often feels as if it’s a major detractor to March’s message and delivery. The show will sharply go from serious to comedy as a way to break the negativity, but it does so in such a silly way that I felt that the tone or impact of a scene was hindered. The infamous “head tilts” found in Shinbou’s work are in full force here. They’re good for emphasizing a point or belief of a character, but when used in excess, it feels unnecessary and detract away from what a character is saying or doing. Because of these decisions, it can feel like Shaft are pouring their resources in heavy artistic flair in a show that doesn’t really need them. There are also a few animation goofs, seeing characters jog in place as if they’re trying to run away or the head tilts leading to a shot that doesn’t match the direction or place a character was. This is partially caused by the animation oversights/limits and partially because of the focus of making this appear more artsy.Ultimately, though, a lot of what the show is at this point will strike people differently. Though the show is indeed a drama, you wouldn’t be remiss to say that it also has quite a few slice-of-life elements. While seeing them can be a nice breather and way to counterpoint the work from becoming too dramatic, I didn’t find as much enjoyment in these more relaxed environments. Though many of them in theory open up Rei to the surrounding world, I don’t always see the immediate or long-term impact from these decisions. I’m more moved by Shimada’s game against Kiriyama than I am seeing Rei eat with the sisters or Nikkaidou’s commentary speech towards Rei. As said before, every moment in the show technically makes an impact in a slice-of-life sense, but it’s more dependent on the viewer as to how much they take away from each scene.Regarding the sound of the show, the seiyuus all did an admirable job portraying their characters. Kengo Kawanishi, Rei’s seiyuu, does a good job portraying Rei’s sensitivity and even his expressions of pain. Nobuhiko Okamato showcases the loud, extraverted passion of Nikaidou, while Misaki Kuno gives Momo a cuteness that would make anyone say “Aww!”. The music itself, outside of the OP’s and ED’s, wasn’t as memorable as I’d like, though there was a pleasant piano piece utilized in the last episode. BUMP OF CHICKEN does a great job capturing that wistful melancholy in OP “Answer” and ED “Fighter”. OP 2, “Sayonara Bystander” by YUKI, doesn’t capture that same feeling. Despite a more raw, “honest” vocal delivery, it has a buildup that doesn’t hit its mark, coming off as flat by the time the OP ends. “orion” by Kenshi Yonezu is a modern smooth pop track, with catchy tenor harmonies and finger snaps. It’s not really for me but I can see the appeal the track has. The only real problematic element I had was found in the sound effects. As an extension of the comedy, the sound effects of the show were said out loud by an overdubbed female seiyuu. While it wasn’t anything very detrimental, it was a contributor that broke my immersion of the show, making the character’s lives feel more silly than serious. Like many of my detriments with the show, though, this will be all dependent on who’s watching and they might appreciate this comedy more than I would.Overall, I give March Comes in Like a Lion a 6/10. At face value, the score looks rather low for my praises, but don’t be fooled. I still think of the show has having great characters and an otherwise good story, but I’m just not sold on Shaft’s interpretation of these events. I feel I would enjoy the manga’s version of what I’ve seen vs. the adaptation. Perhaps I still need to get used to it. Regardless, fans of shows such as Rakugo or other character dramas should definitely watch this show. If you also like Studio Shaft or Shinbou’s style, this will also be another favorite as his fingerprints are all over this show. At its core, though, March Comes in Like a Lion has a lot of good elements and I can easily see users listing this as an essential watch.Do you like or dislike this anime?

Other anime are able to capture their audience into an uninteresting sport such as Chihayafuru but 3-gatsu doesn't delve into shogi enough for the audience to care, but focuses so much of the show around it where the audience must sit through...it.

The show that disappointed me in a multitude of ways. Having already seen (and reviewed) the second season of Sangatsu No Lion, this review will be rather short. Indeed, I feel as if everything that the second season does and fails to do, the first season does in almost exactly the same fashion, albeit in a way that manages to be less engaging, more frustrating, and ultimately less deserving of a high rating. Indeed, it’s very hard for me to see this season as anything more than an average show that I wanted to love and was...disappointed with time and time again.Let’s start with the basics. This show, produced by shaft, tells the story of a male Shogi prodigy who learns about relationships as he navigates life as a young professional. This premise is actually really interesting and unique: when was the last time your last MC made it through on professional board game playing? Rei comes from no privileged background, he has no untold prophecies surrounding his birth, and generally avoids some of the tropes surrounding shounen/seinen protagonists. Yet he somehow fits many other tropes: entire family died in a tragic accident at a young age, has a foster family that resents him, lives alone and broods over the city in an isolated training dojo. Maybe I could turn a blind eye to this if the rest of the anime actually came across as the slice of life that MAL has listed in the Genres category, but it doesn’t. Rei’s entire life is one of battle after battle punctuated by angst and attempted comedy scenes.But no, one says. You’re missing the point: 3-Gatsu is about relationships and learning how to live with others. That, I can say, is true, but the show fails to provide good character development requisite to such themes. The show involves a huge breadth of characters that are shown as little more than skin-deep. I’d like to take the Kawamoto household as an example. Although improved significantly in the second season, Hinata is little more than a source of distraction to both the audience and the MC, with the writers contributing to her character a vapid interest in sweets, shogi, and anything else related to Rei. Surely the death of his wife and daughter, along with the disappearance of his grandchildren’s father and his role as major provider for a sizeable family, would lead to some interesting insight into Someji’s story? Oh no, he only exists for some comic relief and to spur Rei and Nikaido on. Akari’s role as stand-in mother for her own two sisters, along with her own task as provider rather than following her own dreams? Nonexistent, because according to the writers, all she cares about is her own cooking. Even Momo seems to be present only for cute preschooler appearances and to remind Rei about his own departed sister.This superficiality is particularly frustrating when you realize that Shaft is capable of good character development, but places it in all the wrong places. Every opponent that Rei faces is carefully scrutinized and analyzed with 100% focus that soon dissipates as soon as he inevitably wins the match or loses and returns home to brood. If only the writers could develop the other main characters, or heck, even the protagonist himself, with such intensity! Instead, they are relegated to supporting roles, either to supply filler episodes while Rei does his thing or to provide bizarre, poorly-draw caricature insert scenes that I think are supposed to be funny or something. If you’re like me, you’ll probably laugh just because how out of place they are. Even the actually interesting and round characters – Shimada, Gotou, and Nikaido come to mind – somehow remain endlessly on the fringes, given frustratingly little further development.I’d like to return now to the main point that I made in the review of the second season, as I think it rings true here too. 3-Gatsu is a superhero anime masquerading as a slice-of-life. Rei behaves so incredibly unrealistically that it’s hard to see otherwise. Neither I nor the vast majority of the people reading this sentence are capable of supporting ourselves, in high school, by playing exceptionally good board games, winning against seasoned veterans while a curated rival spurs us on. Yet we are capable of retreating within ourselves, having difficulty forming and creating good relationships, and dealing with loss and heartache. I feel that Shaft tries to make its viewership identify with Rei through the latter characteristics, but still attempts to show his superhuman powers by means of the former. Perhaps this odd juxtaposition of incredibility and believability is attractive to some people, but I found it hard to live with. I said this before and I’ll say it again: I think this anime would have been significantly better if it was about a normal, unremarkable kid navigating loss and building relationships, without the need to defeat boss after boss in a game of prodigious power and skill. Or, alternatively, not marketed as a slice-of-life at all and given all the free reign of fantasy that so many superhero anime already show.I think I’ve said all that I want to about the first season of this show. My second season review (first ever on this site!) is a far deeper look into my criticisms of this series and covers in depth some of the same points that I alluded to here. I realize that this show is incredibly well-received, at least on MAL, and giving the show a 5/10 might seem suspect, but in my opinion the show’s many shortcomings surpass its limited strengths. disappointed with time and time again.Let’s start with the basics.

It is very interesting how a passion saves the protagonist, makes him connect with his father. Also how he develops relationships with other people thanks to the game.

It also shows you the life that the other characters have and because they are the way they are in an excellent way at no time do you feel forced to anything. I think one of the most beautiful things is when he...interacts with the three sisters, how they try to fill a void he has and so does he.

I really connected with Your Lie in April since it was about the Piano and Violin, both of which I play.I could not connect **as much** to this anime since I have never played Shogi, but this anime does a good job connecting me to Rei. I really saw Rei, his struggles, and what type of person he is.The Story: About Rei, a Middle-School Shogi prodigy. He goes through a lot of things, and he is also taken care of by the Kawamoto...family as well.I just wanna say, the episodes the Kawamoto family is in, it makes the entire episode so so so much better.(Momo reminds me of Anya from Spy x Family lol)The Kawamoto family is so wholesome, kind, never demeaning, and has suffered loss so it is even more empathetic. I also love how they are so affectionate and kind to strays (rei and cats) as well.Cannot explain the rest of the story without spoilers but it is a really good story. I really enjoyed it. There were sad moments, happy moments, and all in between.The Music: I really liked the first opening, but not the 2nd opening.The first opening had high notes and the music and the melody. All of which was good. The second one did not stick with me. Maybe a 5/10 for the music. The in-episode music was also meh.Not comparable to Your Lie in April or Bocchi, though those are music-focused animes.The Animation: I think it was animated well, though some of the character design is questionable. For example, Rei always looks so depressed and sad. Why does he look like that? It is very weird. But some of the scenery is well-animated so I will give it a pass.All in all, very interesting anime, and Season 2 is hyped a ton so I am excited by that!Final Score: 7.5/10 (Rounded to 8/10)Thanks!-CyanCheetah family as well.I just wanna say, the episodes the Kawamoto family is in, it makes the entire episode so so so much better.(Momo reminds me of Anya from Spy x Family lol)The Kawamoto family is so wholesome, kind, never demeaning, and has suffered loss so it is even more empathetic.

But its flowing onwards and I cant stop it hinata kawamotoTL;DR- Rei Kiriyama’s life is one that is far from ordinary, he reached professional status in shogi whilst he was at middle school. His life has been anything but happy, with the death of his entire family looming over him, breaking apart his foster family because he was good at shogi and much more. Wherever rei is, only destruction seems to be left in his wake. He begrudgingly participates in activities that he doesn’t necessarily like but to appease a certain few in his life and feels as though he...has no purpose until an encounter occurred. An encounter changed him. For the better. He meets the kawamoto sisters. These three bubbly siblings have their own hardships on par with his own but allow him to join in on family activities such as eating as a family and this allows him to break the shell. The shell placed on him by others. The shell placed on him by his fame. The shell placed on him by himself. This anime delves deep into extremely complex situations and emotions with personal struggles thrown in the mix and is heart wrenching and heart warming at the same time, which honestly goes to show how brilliant the story is.Similar-Your lie in april- Both share a teenage boy who is struggling under the substantial weight that comes with being a professional in their field, shogi for march comes like a lion and music in your lie in april.They deal with the undertone that comes with being a so called prodigy, being ostracised by others and thuis isolated, with loss of family to boot. Both serve as a deep delve into internal thoughts such as anxiety and depression whilst juggling the responsibilities placed on them by others. Your lie in april is much more bittersweet and has a story to follow whilst 3 gatsu no lion is about character progression not story progression. Both main characters are a shell of their former selves and restrict their personalities to appease others but all it takes is a woman’s perspective to shine light on their situations for the better.Honey and clover- Both written by the same author, honey and clover also follows the melancholic undertone present in 3 gatsu no lion whilst also being extremely fulfilling to watch. In both the comedy is not forced and comes naturally, the stories aren't melodramatic hyping irrelevant feelings with real to life feelings and hardships being conveyed in both of them. All the characters are fully developed with separate unique yet linked pasts and show ways to deal with the hardships that we may face in life. With a similar art style, they both combine heartwarming and heart wrenching scenes perfectly, hitting you right in the feels every single time. There’s a lot of introspection between the two of them and they both felt as though they were a breath of fresh air to watch and honestly like my time was used to learn something profound rather than watching an anime for fun.Art- Shaft used a very interesting art style, where they made scenes with little in them extremely powerful and crowded scenes relatively irrelevant. It was as though we were seeing the anime from the eyes of the protagonist. The art reflects each and every situation, with muted colours being used when shogi was being shown to us to allow us to understand that shogi was the only concentration in that scene, to the splashes of colour that brought metaphors to life that werre used in emotional scenes as each character realised their shortcomings and tried to change it. The art itself had a profound effect on me whilst watching and pulled at my heartstrings as it made the scene more enticing, more involved, more depressing, more hopeful and essentially more surreal. But that's the beauty of it, we will all find ourselves in similar situations which may feel surreal but looking back on them they are incredibly real, they did happen and they did change us. The character designs are more on the side of standard but again if we look at things from the characters perspectives, that's how they would see it too, characters are literally humans like them so no special attention is necessary for them. The cats are probably the funniest bit of art, with great personification of them which served as a bit of comedic relief from the anime.Music-The background music is quite soft, with little impact on some scenes but profound impact on others. The shogi music was brilliant and it managed to hype the situation and got me pumped up even though I have no clue how shogi works. The opening song and ening song were delights to hear, with each depicting a different story that could be applied to any number of the characters, at first it felt like rei, but then it felt like akari, the nikkaidou and so on. It was brilliantly composed and sung as it felt stifling, just how life for everyone may feel like at certain points. The ending was a brilliant score too, with how hopeful and yet bitter it sounded and was honestly great.VA-  The cat's voice actors stood out the most to me funnily enough, with good emotions and a mischievous tone maintained throughout.

The title of this video was inspired after I saw a brilliant video about how family is like curry from mawaru penguindrum by a creator called crabe and I’ll probably do a video similar to that since I have a lot to say about that anime but I digress. A kotatsu is a low wooden table covered by a heavy blanket with a heating element, and is usually used in the winter to keep warm. Everyone gathers around it at a certain time and most japanese have fond memories of using it. Ep 12 is where Rei proclaims that the girls' family house is like a kotatsu. He says ‘When I'm there, it's so warm and comfortable, I almost melt... But when I leave, I realize the daily life I was fine with before is actually freezing cold and I'm painfully reminded of that.’ That scene resonated a lot with me. Home is not necessarily a place. Its not necessarily a person. What it is is a collection of fond memories where you can be yourself and wind down after a long day, a short day, a bad day or a good day. It's where you can show your angry side, your mellow side, your hardworking side and everything in between. In these trying times that we just had, home is where we've been for much longer than before, and studies have been done into what makes a home. Home may be the scent of a grandmother’s cooking, the familiar fuzz of a worn cushion, the seemingly defiant thrill of hanging posters on the wall as a teenager, or the knot of tension in the stomach of a child listening to an argument in the adjoining room. Recent anthropological studies have looked beyond physical structures to understand what a home is in terms of diverse practices, meaningful and imaginative forms, and feelings which surround a sense of groundedness within the world. A set of studies also found that there are a lot of things that make a house a home arranging from a place, a space, feelings, practices or an active state of being. People have different interpretations for a home, for me it's a place where I can relax and still be productive without prying eyes filled with people who understand me but for you it might be something different. Home is something much less solid than a structure of stone or wood. It tends to be fragile, a domain not only of belonging but also of potential alienation. Home ultimately is what you make it to be, and is a reflection of those who live in it and those who interact with it. Rei hasn’t felt like he’s had a home for himself. His room is barren, desolate even, with barely anything in his apartment, being ostracized by the children of his adoptive parents but the kawamoto sisters have something that he lost with his family. The sense of belonging. That sense of trust, that people would be waiting for you through thick and thin with open loving arms, surrounded by the sweet smell of food that pains you from leaving there and makes you want to come back. Rei realises that being okay with not having a home is not okay, and he feels emotional over things that he previously would have considered trivial, from the hum of a fan to the gentle lull of a clock ticking. It's okay to be painfully reminded of where you could be, since that just makes going back all the more sweeter. Home is ultimately, just like a kotatsu.ThoughtsThis anime takes slice of life to a whole new level. Shogi is not a game I had heard of before this anime, hell, I don’t really understand chess either but that didnt stop me one bit from enjoying this anime. There's no direction nor a conclusion in the story and we are constantly painfully reminded that life doesn't always go in the way we expect, the way we want but that's totally okay. Problems haven't been totally solved, characters are slowly coming to realisations but they don't reach the end. But thats okay. The anime is packaged a little rough around the edges with obvious problems from an anime standpoint. But that's okay. Everyone in this anime has lost there family in some way or another, but thats okay. I honestly loved this anime, as it showed that everyone is human, having depression is okay, having anxiety is okay, feeling like you're going nowhere in life is okay, because at the end of the day, as hina put it, in a time like this, we say do your best.All in all, was a great lesson in what a home should be, what a family should be and ultimately that home is like a kotatsu. If anything you take from this anime, just have some time to thank those things you currently take for granted from the people that love you to your pet, since one day they may not be here, but thats okay, since you make your home like a kotatsu. has no purpose until an encounter occurred. An encounter changed him. For the better. He meets the kawamoto sisters. These three bubbly siblings have their own hardships on par with his own but allow him to join in on family activities such as eating as a family and this allows him to break the shell. The shell placed on him by others. The shell placed on him by his fame. The shell placed on him by himself. This anime delves deep into extremely complex situations and emotions with personal struggles thrown in the mix and is heart wrenching and heart warming at the same time, which honestly goes to show how brilliant the story is.Similar-Your lie in april- Both share a teenage boy who is struggling under the substantial weight that comes with being a professional in their field, shogi for march comes like a lion and music in your lie in april.They deal with the undertone that comes with being a so called prodigy, being ostracised by others and thuis isolated, with loss of family to boot. Both serve as a deep delve into internal thoughts such as anxiety and depression whilst juggling the responsibilities placed on them by others. Your lie in april is much more bittersweet and has a story to follow whilst 3 gatsu no lion is about character progression not story progression. Both main characters are a shell of their former selves and restrict their personalities to appease others but all it takes is a woman’s perspective to shine light on their situations for the better.Honey and clover- Both written by the same author, honey and clover also follows the melancholic undertone present in 3 gatsu no lion whilst also being extremely fulfilling to watch. In both the comedy is not forced and comes naturally, the stories aren't melodramatic hyping irrelevant feelings with real to life feelings and hardships being conveyed in both of them. All the characters are fully developed with separate unique yet linked pasts and show ways to deal with the hardships that we may face in life. With a similar art style, they both combine heartwarming and heart wrenching scenes perfectly, hitting you right in the feels every single time. There’s a lot of introspection between the two of them and they both felt as though they were a breath of fresh air to watch and honestly like my time was used to learn something profound rather than watching an anime for fun.Art- Shaft used a very interesting art style, where they made scenes with little in them extremely powerful and crowded scenes relatively irrelevant. It was as though we were seeing the anime from the eyes of the protagonist. The art reflects each and every situation, with muted colours being used when shogi was being shown to us to allow us to understand that shogi was the only concentration in that scene, to the splashes of colour that brought metaphors to life that werre used in emotional scenes as each character realised their shortcomings and tried to change it. The art itself had a profound effect on me whilst watching and pulled at my heartstrings as it made the scene more enticing, more involved, more depressing, more hopeful and essentially more surreal. But that's the beauty of it, we will all find ourselves in similar situations which may feel surreal but looking back on them they are incredibly real, they did happen and they did change us. The character designs are more on the side of standard but again if we look at things from the characters perspectives, that's how they would see it too, characters are literally humans like them so no special attention is necessary for them. The cats are probably the funniest bit of art, with great personification of them which served as a bit of comedic relief from the anime.Music-The background music is quite soft, with little impact on some scenes but profound impact on others. The shogi music was brilliant and it managed to hype the situation and got me pumped up even though I have no clue how shogi works. The opening song and ening song were delights to hear, with each depicting a different story that could be applied to any number of the characters, at first it felt like rei, but then it felt like akari, the nikkaidou and so on.

As a result, he was faced with many pressures from both the Shogi community and his adoptive family. Seeking independence from a stressful home life, he moves to an apartment in Tokyo. As he lives on his own at 17, Rei has a tendency to take care of himself poorly, and his secluded personality leaves him excluded from his school friends and at the Shogi Hall.However, shortly after arriving in Tokyo, Rei met Akari, Hinata, and Momo Kawamoto, three siblings who lived with their...grandfather who owned a traditional wagashi shop. Akari, the oldest of the three, strives to combat Rei's loneliness and unsustainable lifestyles with maternal hospitality. Kawamoto's younger sister, who has faced tragedy in the past, also tells of the unique family bond he has been missing for most of his life. As he struggles to heal himself physically and mentally through Shogi, Rei must learn how to interact with others and understand his own complex emotions.Review contains spoilersOne thing that I would like to appreciate about the anime 3-gatsu no Lion is that the directing aspect I think is quite interesting. Whether with character presentation Ways of presenting scenes Character gestures when Something like this, I think I'm quite fond of the direction of this anime. But even if there is an interesting directing issue, this is still not that good in my opinion. I have a big problem. What this story presents me This story is about a young boy drama Rei who has had many problems and clues in his life. Whether it was his family who had an accident The family he loved and supported him in the blink of an eye. To be adopted by the family of his father's friend But that family did not make him happy like the old family. In addition to not being healed from the wound in the heart It is also an aggravation to him ... After listening to something like this, what do you think this is going to offer? Growing up and solving the problems of Rei ... Good Drama, if you expect anything from this anime you will be disappointed. First of all, you rarely get to see the Rei character's growth at all (meaning in the beginning), because the first part of the story took time to present to Rei's drama around him. I am not going to say that this story does not represent Rei, so I really don't like it. This story is about Rei's surroundings. I do not matter. But help loosen the knot as well Because what this story does is to present Rei's drama all around, but without loosening any clues or anything. We hardly see the process of solving this anime's drama issue at all. A big part of what happened was that no matter where Darma was left behind, the story was acting like the characters suddenly thought and cut the end in stubbornness. Well, in fact, I rarely see anything I think is the growth of the Rei character, because, as I said, the early story keeps repeating the same plot with a twist. Drama did not edit, leaving it at the end of the episode.Starting a new drama like this, it made me stop watching this for a while becauseI was brave enough to find something like this. Even though the story has an interesting directing, when the OP changes things, things change accordingly. With a drama that does better with both dramas and the unfolding, Rei may not have had much growth yet. But at least we can see I think I'm quite involved with Kai's dramas. A lot of things are quite perfect these days. But that's it. During the presentation of characters like Kouda, it was still the same narrative. Even so, the time of kai's drama spanned quite a lot of episodes. It did well and had an effect on Rei's body, although loosening the knot was a little weird. But overall, I quite like this part of the story. Oh, there is another part, it was Rei's time back to school, it was good too. grandfather who owned a traditional wagashi shop.

It covers so many feelings and emotions in its run time that I feel like anybody would be able to take away something meaningful from it.  It has such a deep understanding of what makes us humans, and the different ways people can respond to the hardships life throws at them.  It is one the most powerful anime that I have ever seen, and its one that I know will stay close to my heart for a long time.Story - 10March Comes in Like a Lion tells the story of Rei Kiriyama, a...high schooler who lives by himself and makes a living off of his winnings in Shogi, which is basically a Japanese version of chess.  One misconception that I feel should be cleared up is that you don't need to know anything about Shogi to watch this show.  The show simply uses Shogi as a platform to tell the lives of its characters.  As Rei trudges through his rough life, he meets a variety of people, both through Shogi and his personal life.  As he meets and gets to know these people, he learns a lot about them, the hardships life has thrown at them, and how these people respond to those hardships.  On of my favorite things about this show is how most of these people view life in a positive light despite what they go through.  As a result, this show is incredibly warm and uplifting with a lot of its messages and themes.  While there are dark moments, the show masterfully manages to keep a positive light in spite of the darkness.  This show is very slow paced. It doesn't have an exhilarating, fast-moving plot, so it may not be for everybody, but if you like slowly paced shows, I feel that this is a must watch.Art - 10The art and animation in this show are incredible.  The show manages to have very realistic and vibrant backgrounds, while still maintaining the unique art style that defines the show.  The character designs are great, and the art quality never decreases.  Now let's talk about the animation.  The animation in this show truly takes advantage of the medium of animation. Studio shaft really goes out of their way to find the most impactful way to portray a certain emotion or a certain feeling in animation. This show has so many moments that are elevated to legendary status purely because of the animation in those moments.  From my knowledge, no anime has utilized the medium of animation quite like this one.Sound - 10All of the voice acting performances in this show are top notch, and the sound design compliments the show's crazy animation really well in some scenes.  The music in this show is charged with emotion as well, the music in some scenes really make them stand out.Character - 10The characters in this show are incredibly human.   They have realistic struggles and realistic responses to those hardships.Enjoyment - 10One thing about this show that I feel I need to stress is that it is not sad.  It has sad moments, but it always flips that sadness on its head and turns it into something wholesome and uplifting.  This show will make you cry from how uplifting it is, not from how sad it is.  It's a funny, too.  There are plenty of moments while I was watching it where I was laughing my head off.Overall - 10I don't think I need to explain why this is an overall 10.

Through 24 episodes, we hardly got anything that was noteworthy happen to Rei.The art seemed alright. Sound was good as well. The characters were really great, which had me feel throughout the entire span of the season that there was a great story that could be told by these characters that was missed.Overall, the slow pace, and nothing of interest happening to the MC, made it a really boring watch.

A life in Shogi is extremely difficult, with almost every bit of their life intended to be spent on this game to master the craft, and 3-gatsu no lion has perfectly highlighted this. The protagonist Rei is an adult who has been living a life in Shogi since childhood, and its a major part of his life; being the only thing that he knows how to do, it directs his life...in a completely straight path, a life in shogi.Now, 3-gatsu no Lion is definitely an anime you should watch; if you absolutely fucking understand shogi that is. When I started off watching this anime after reading a short amount of description about it, I thought it would be a show that would be heavily psychological and touching on ideas such as depression heavily, however this is not the case. I do not know how to play Shogi, and even Chess in general and watching an anime that is fucking 90% just Shogi was a major waste of time. The show heavily revolves around Shogi and this can be either be extremely refreshing or utterly terrible, not know what the hell a damn thing is going on (my case.)The art in 3-gatsu no Lion is very well made, being extremely distinctive, unique and really well-made. No complaints here; the artwork is fluid and extremely fantastic.Good soundtracks as well, being very good in amplifying the story and visuals even further and isn\'t monotonous. And thank fucking god they didn\'t use ""You Say Run"" from My Hero Academia.Now, the protagonist Rei is a Shogi prodigy who has been expected to be extremely good at the game considering such. Hence, Rei is frail; feeling like he has to win every game and is otherwise a failure if he does not, provoking depression and anxiety. Rei can be an extremely relatable character to some extent, as someone who shares a common interest with us; winning. Rei develops slowly as a character after meeting a family of sisters (slowly turning into a harem anime,) and has multiple experiences with them, changing his outlook in not only Shogi but his life as well.The big question now is whether or not I actually enjoyed this anime. Before I proceed to provide an answer, I\'ll let you know something. I don\'t know the rules of Shogi, I never knew Shogi existed, I never played Shogi and I probably never will. Hence, I thought this anime was absolutely fucking boring and I did not enjoy it, considering that 90% is mostly Shogi and does not exactly focus on the development of our protagonist much at all.Therefore, if you are willing to watch this anime, make sure you actually know what the fuck is going on with Shogi; this anime is really good and you shouldn\'t have to ruin your experience with it by not understanding it. If you want to watch, you need to learn a bit more about Shogi. This anime has tried teaching us a bit about Shogi but ironically it was after all the parts with Shogi (towards the end of the show) so make sure you make that a episode filled with shit you already know. in a completely straight path, a life in shogi.Now, 3-gatsu no Lion is definitely an anime you should watch; if you absolutely fucking understand shogi that is. When I started off watching this anime after reading a short amount of description about it, I thought it would be a show that would be heavily psychological and touching on ideas such as depression heavily, however this is not the case.

It blends the game element of anime alongside the personal life of it's players in a more nuanced way comparted to many game/sports based anime.My only critique is that whilst the story is generally very good I felt they could have done a little more with it in the second half, but it sets up the seconds season of the anime nicely. Definitely a recommended watch.Art and the soundtrack are great, the depth of the protagonist is nicely portrayed and you are left with a good sense of...the world of professional shogi as well as the warmth of the three sisters watching over the protagonist. the world of professional shogi as well as the warmth of the three sisters watching over the protagonist."", ""March Comes in Like a Lion is definitely one of the best anime I've seen.

This is utilized very well throughout both seasons. I was also a fan of the character designs for the main characters, particularly the style the eyes were drawn in.This doesn't have...much to do with the story, but I also loved how often the Kawamoto sisters cooked dinner and were shown with food.

It narrates emotions as physical entities by personifying a person's feelings which makes it realistic and relatable. It gives every character depth by showing their emotions in different circumstances.

There are a lot of really solid elements but there are also some problems that I have to call out. So let\'s go.I\'m going to start this one with the negatives because I want to get them out of the way. This anime suffers from good ol\' ""slice-of-life syndrome"". I often give this sort of anime a nine but never a ten because there\'s always one distinct problem that always gets on my nerves. This is, of course, the continuity. The story in Sangatsu no Lion really suffers from the lack of a theme holding it all...together, and the finale doesn\'t really feel like a finale because it doesn\'t really close the book on anything.  They left out Akari and the girls during almost the entire second arc, which was upsetting because they were my favorite thing about this anime to begin with. The art is also pretty weird. It\'s kind of all over the place and the animation at the beginning and the animation at the end are worlds apart. The mouths look weird, but the textures are stunning. The artistic scenes are incredible, but Rei\'s face scares the crap out of me half the time. I don\'t know how to feel about it! I also hate the Shogi cat song. It\'s honestly the most annoying thing since Dora the Porra Exploradora.Now that we got that out of the way, let\'s move on to some positives! The art, for as much of a hard time as I give it, is very artistically stunning. It\'s very innovative and unique which is why I opted for the eight instead of giving it a seven. The sound is absolutely incredible as well. Maybe it\'s because I\'m a SIMP but there were times where I wanted to cry just from the OP. The sound throughout the whole thing is really great and captures the emotions well. The anime\'s strongest point is the characters. I absolutely love every last one of them. Rei, Akari, Hinata, Momo, Nikaidou, Kyouko, Shimada, they\'re all fantastic! These are some of the best characters of any anime I have ever seen and are the saving grace that netted this anime a nine instead of an eight. They all feel so real, and despite the fact they have their flaws, you feel for all of them and you really like them. None of them are stereotypes and all of them make complete sense. Especially Momo she\'s adorable lol.So the main takeaway is pretty positive. It\'s definitely worth watching. The second season is top ten so I have A LOT of high hopes for it (as I have yet to be disappointed by a top ten anime). I\'ll probably finish it in a week or so, so keep an eye out for that review. If you guys play Shogi you\'ll probably appreciate this anime a lot more than I did.

This is different. By no means do I mean it is bad different, it's good different.The anime itself is paced like a book, like you are reading chapters of stages of life of Kiriyama Rei (The main character). The anime showcases the various highs and lows in his life and hence, how he develops from each of them. The basic premise of the story is that Kiriyama loses his parents at a young age and is adopted by his father's close friend who is a...shougi enthusiast. Although, the series has a lot of scenes showcasing shougi being played, by no means are you required to have basic knowledge about shougi.In the 1st episode itself we see Kiriyama spending time with three sisters who are not related to him by blood but seem to be the only sweet little things keeping him together. As the story progresses we get to analyze his relationship with his colleagues both at school and at shougi, his father, his adoptive sister and other minor characters.I personally liked the story a lot as it is very detailed and the viewer is many times given opportunity to think about the relationship of MC with other characters. Mostly the relation between the adoptive sister and Kiriyama has many levels to it. At once you feel that the two don't really like each other but there are hints showing that they are intimate in a different manner.The are is specially good. The art itself reveals a lot about how the scene is going to progress. You are able to determine if it is the cheerful part, the serious part, the sad part or the many plethora of emotions that the show showcases.When I talk about sound I talk about the voice actors and the music. I won't lie, I like that starting and ending songs. Although many people tend to ignore this since the studios almost never make a mistake here but the voice actors perfectly fit the art of each character. They sound exactly the way you would expect a character to.As I mentioned earlier this anime is like reading multiple chapters out of the life of Kiriyama rei and hence, I love how the character of the MC has developed in the anime. You also see character developments for the adoptive sister and only a little of the same for the three sisters.When we talk about enjoyment, I wouldn't say it's something that is happy go lucky. It is something that begs you to think. Hence, I would say enjoyment is 7 out of 10. Given that you, like me consider enjoyment to be something cheerful and funny.I award the show an 8 only pertaining to enjoyment. Otherwise I would say it could easily be a masterpiece. shougi enthusiast.

In the case of March Comes In Like a Lion, this involves Rei and his interest in shogi as he is under pressure to use the winnings from his victories in the game to maintain living independently from his estranged adoptive family. However unlike Your Lie in April,...this series offers some major improvements in how it explores its somewhat similar premise.Whereas Your Lie in April resorts to melodrama in exploring the issues surrounding Kousei and Kaori, March Comes In Like a Lion is more grounded in the exploration of Rei's situation. While Rei is cynical and isolated to engage with others, the series does not overdramatize these elements to his character and the growth he undergoes to improve himself is more gradual instead of in large spurts as Your Lie in April does with Kousei. Also while Kaori serves as the sole trigger for Kousei's growth in Your Lie in April, Rei's growth is undergone by gradually bonding with others in and out of the game of shogi that he is part of.Another strength that March Comes In Like a Lion has over Your Lie in April is the exploration of its supporting characters. Whereas the majority of characters in Your Lie in April were mostly irrelevant in the series, many of the characters in March Comes In Like a Lion have their roles to fulfill in the gradual growth of Rei's character and a number of them even get fleshing out to give them more depth and not feel like mere archetypes as much of Your Lie in April's cast.And finally, the last major element that March Comes In Like a Lion is more polished in than Your Lie in April is the execution of its comedy. This was a major issue for my viewing of Your Lie in April because of the style and timing meshing poorly with the anime's more serious developments. With this series, its comedic timing is better executed to not be as abrupt in presence during more serious scenes and is more diverse in style depending on the situation that plays out for a comical moment, being either subtle or over-the-top without taking away from ongoing developments occurring within said scenes. While my mileage did vary on when I chuckled during March Comes In Like a Lion's comical moments, I did appreciate the anime's better timing and diversity of comedy compared to Your Lie in April.Still, this isn't to say that Your Lie in April edges over March Comes In Like a Lion in some areas. The visual presentation in Your Lie in April is far superior in detail and animation, as March Comes In Like a Lion utilizes a pastel-like animation style similar to Honey and Clover. While the character designs look decent with this drawing style, scenic shots looked washed out in comparison to Your Lie in April and the animation is noticeably not as fluid in comparison. Also whereas Your Lie in April had a conclusive ending, March Comes In Like a Lion ends inconclusively as its manga source material is still ongoing as of this review and a second anime season of the series is expected to continue the anime's plot when it starts airing during the Fall 2016 anime season.Still in spite of these minor issues with the comparisons, March Comes In Like a Lion is a series that can still stand on its own feet with the quality storytelling that it offers in exploring the developments of Rei's character and others who interact with him throughout this series.

Each of these issues are tackled through multiple characters with their own perspective on the matter and their own methods of coping. It demonstrates the numerous different ways we may define ""strength."" I would definitely recommend this series to everyone.What I liked best about this anime was that when learning to write a story we\'re often told that all the supporting characters need to be real, that they can\'t just exist for the sake of having people for your protagonist to interact with. They must each have their own stories...beyond the story, each with their own struggles. They must be, like here in the real world, the protagonist to their own stories. 3-Gatsu no Lion (March Comes in Like a Lion) takes this idea well beyond what we could imagine. To the point where you\'re not entirely sure who to root for during any of the numerous shogi matches. Even the cruelest antagonist has their story told such that we can sympathize with them and in the end realize that they aren\'t just ""that a-hole.""If you love to have your heart warmed, if you like to go ""DAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaawwww,"" or if you\'re a bit down in the dumps and are looking for something to pick you up this could be just the thing you need.WARNING: This series is a super slow burn the entire way through both seasons, all 44 episodes. beyond the story, each with their own struggles.

During shogi games it uses dramatized symbolic imagery, like a blizzard or epiphany, mixed with interesting shots of the physical world: the shogi board position, the room the players are in, using things like a drink going from full to empty to symbolize passing time and the players facial expressions during the game. While characters internal thoughts are often voiced to the viewer as is typical in anime, what makes this show effective is how much more is told without dialogue through the cuts, symbolic imagery, and subtle soundtrack. Like how the passage of...time is noted during shogi matches by slight changes in the room the game is being played, shots of Rei\'s room and Rei walking alone by the water are shots repeated throughout the show and makes it feel as if you feel the experience of Rei\'s day to day life and internal mental state.While the most prevalent atmosphere of this show is somber and self reflective there is warmth provided by community, whether it be friends or family. The most prevalent warmth for Rei, especially at the start of the show, is the Kawamoto Sisters who he often eats dinner with. Scenes in this household are always bubbly and happy with a pastel washed out bright color palette with pet cats thoughts narrated. The animal voices being humanized felt odd but it seemed to be used as an amplifier of atmospheric relief. The second most prevalent source of warmth is Nikaidou Harunobu, Rei\'s boisterous self proclaimed rival who is one of few who can spark energy into the somber Rei. There is also Rei\'s homeroom teacher who offers guidance and is Rei\'s only friend at school and later in the show Rei visits Shimada Kai\'s hometown and again the same communal feel brings warmth there as well.In contrast Rei\'s own family (foster family) and memories of it on only brings gloom. Rei feels guilty about having been so much better at shogi then his foster sister and brother (Kyouko and Ayumu) that he was favored by his foster father (Masachika). While Ayumu doesn\'t show up in the present, Kyouko Rei\'s older foster sister is sort of symbolically evil, with her mannerisms, voice, appearance, and how she is animated and presented emanating a temptress venomous feminine presence. It\'s clear through Rei\'s interactions with her that she has bullied and manipulated him throughout their life growing up in the same house, and it\'s vaguely suggested that she had sexually abused Rei through a single still shot of Kyouko straddling Rei while pulling open his shirt with a leer while Rei has a worried or fearful expression. In another episode she sneaks into his apartment and wraps her arms around him from behind as he sleeps saying ""don\'t touch me"" using him as a one sided emotional comfort doll. In any case Rei\'s interactions with her feel like a beaten dog that\'s lost it\'s will to fight so he just takes the abuse and it\'s unsettling to watch. Despite this there does seems to be an odd sense of genuine care between both Rei and Kyouko which makes it a very compelling relationship which I found to be the most interesting part of the show.The way 3-gatsu no Lion starts by showing you how things are in the present and then slowly unravels to you why things are the way they are, especially in the first half with Rei\'s backstory, is another thing the show excels at. You see how Rei behaves but gradually get the details of why he does, and it\'s very satisfying the more that comes together about him. As new characters are introduced a similar effect happens, although in the case of Shimada Kai it was a little more of a direct flashback, which was much less satisfying than the gradual increase of background information for Rei.Overall this show excels at visual storytelling and atmosphere more than anything else, so if you are in to that it\'s definitely worth a watch. time is noted during shogi matches by slight changes in the room the game is being played, shots of Rei\'s room and Rei walking alone by the water are shots repeated throughout the show and makes it feel as if you feel the experience of Rei\'s day to day life and internal mental state.While the most prevalent atmosphere of this show is somber and self reflective there is warmth provided by community, whether it be friends or family.

In another episode she sneaks into his apartment and wraps her arms around him from behind as he sleeps saying ""don\'t touch me"" using him as a one sided emotional comfort doll. In any case Rei\'s interactions with her feel like a beaten dog that\'s lost it\'s will to fight so he just takes the abuse and it\'s unsettling to watch. Despite this there does seems to be an odd sense of genuine care between both Rei and Kyouko which makes it a very compelling relationship which I found to be the most interesting part of the show.The way 3-gatsu no Lion starts by showing you how things are in the present and then slowly unravels to you why things are the way they are, especially in the first half with Rei\'s backstory, is another thing the show excels at. You see how Rei behaves but gradually get the details of why he does, and it\'s very satisfying the more that comes together about him. As new characters are introduced a similar effect happens, although in the case of Shimada Kai it was a little more of a direct flashback, which was much less satisfying than the gradual increase of background information for Rei.Overall this show excels at visual storytelling and atmosphere more than anything else, so if you are in to that it\'s definitely worth a watch.', 'Althought I did enjoy the first season of this anime a good deal, this second season for me entered into the realm of profoundness.  Though the anime does revolve around the main character as a professional shouji player, I found that even I, with as little understanding of this japanese board game, was able to immensely enjoy this anime.What this anime truly revolves around are the individuals surrounding the main character, and the lessons he learns from helping them through the hardships and trials they encounter within their own lives.  In turn he applies what he learned from overcoming these hardships...to his own life.  This anime to me exemplifies a journey of self discovery, a journey which as shown is this anime, is a cycle through suffering from uncertainty, and joy through the act of grabbing a hold of life. to his own life.

It is, quite simply, a masterpiece, and one of my favorite anime of all time.This is not your typical sports anime. The art and music are breathtaking. The plot takes unexpected twists, and the actions of the characters have consequences. There are some scenes that made me cry, completely unexpectedly, not because they were sad, but because how profoundly beautiful they were. These scenes I've rewatched dozens of times and have become part of me.The characters are probably the best part. The main character is me. And you. And everyone who ever felt alone. But the anime is extremely uplifting...at the same time: introspective, relatable, and profound.It is a deeply original anime, and in many ways, it subverts its own medium. at the same time: introspective, relatable, and profound.It is a deeply original anime, and in many ways, it subverts its own medium."", 'I believe this is my first true slice of life anime, so I would take my review lightly when it comes to the critical aspect of things. I never really thought that I would delve into the slice of life genre like this, as I was very much a heavy shounen watcher. However, a lot of the shounens that I\'ve watched recently have disappointed me for some reason, so I decided to take a break and try something different. Boy am I glad I did. sangatsu no lion basically overloaded me with feelings of wholesomeness.Story [9/10] - Personally, I do get a little bored with...animes that aren\'t as fast paced as shounens, and I can\'t lie and say that there weren\'t moments here and there where I got a little tired of hearing/seeing shogi moves and whatnot (it\'d probably help a bit if I actually knew how shogi worked, but it still ended up being enjoyable overall, so it wasn\'t THAT much of an issue). Besides that minor problem, I was flabbergasted with how much I was able to relate with Rei\'s struggles. The way his problems were presented was done in such a great way, it almost makes me wonder if the writers are okay. I\'m so glad I stuck with it and kept on watching despite my usual distaste for a slowpaced story, as I was able to experience a journey of emotions with the main character that I\'m not sure I\'ve ever experienced with an anime before.Art [8/10] - The art was unique and the facial expressions were very fitting as well. I wouldn\'t say it was top tier, but I haven\'t watched enough anime for my opinion here to be all that credible if I\'m honest.Sound [10/10] - The OST was fantastic! It not only fit every scene, but added to it. It seemed as if the OST was just that one last ""cherry on top"" that got me to the point of nearly crying multiple times during scenes throughout the anime. The OP and ED were nice as well.Character [9/10] - The main character\'s tragic backstory may seem cliche, but I don\'t believe that this is such a bad thing here. His backstory is not forced into your face very often in the story, and when it does come into obvious effect in the anime, it is done so in an actually effective and heartwarming way. I don\'t think there is anything wrong with using cliches like this as long as they are used in an entertaining way, and in 3-gatsu no lion it is indeed used well.also, MOMO is the cutest!!!!!!Enjoyment [8/10]Overall [8/10] animes that aren\'t as fast paced as shounens, and I can\'t lie and say that there weren\'t moments here and there where I got a little tired of hearing/seeing shogi moves and whatnot (it\'d probably help a bit if I actually knew how shogi worked, but it still ended up being enjoyable overall, so it wasn\'t THAT much of an issue).

If one is technical, Sangatsu no Lion can very well hold its own in those areas, the art is drawn in such a way as if it came out of a storybook. The contrasting colours and music tempo to depict a shift in mood is done masterfully. But what blows me away is how the show can convey a story in such a way that it looks more like a first person...view of the life of a young man whom all of us can see a part of ourselves in.Staying faithful to the manga by adapting chapter to chapter (and always reminding us so with a white frame), the pacing of Sangatsu no Lion is never an issue.  We slowly but progressively come to know of our Shogi prodigy – Rei Kiriyama who, as much of a genius as he is, is not invulnerable and is basically like us, facing the ups and downs in life.  The beginning of the show pictures how Rei came to this present point in life, how he interacts with the Kawamoto sisters, how he fights not just his Shogi battles, but also his inner demons that often plunges him into a dark mood. Though many would argue that the second half side-lines the Kuwamoto sisters and even Rei himself and shows technical, tedious Shogi games, I argue that the second half gives Rei the opportunity to look into the lives of his seniors, who have stayed on the path of competitive Shogi far longer than he has, thus allowing him to basically see what lies before in the future,  indirectly letting him understand himself further and develop his character.The show is a good balance between comedy and drama, giving off a bright, vibrant vibe with people in laughter in joyous scenes while showing the sadness and gloom after. It is an ever-going cycle that allows us the viewers to understand that the joy and happiness that our characters are going through is unfortunately bound to be disrupted; and on the flipside, the horrible phases that they are going through are bound to end with a light at the end of the tunnel. For example, as we see the hardships that Rei faces with his family background, he stumbles upon his eventual solace in the Kuwamoto household. As he enjoys the warmth and company and leaves with a rare grin on his face, he stumbles upon a relative who reminds him of why he was shrouded in dark depression in the first place.  It is not the Utopian fantasy that us viewers like to find escape in, nor is it the depressive carnage that makes us reflect on how fortunate we actually are, instead it realistically depicts how life is — a mix between the two.A resounding theme that this show reminds us of is that the success and joy of one sometimes come at the expense of another. With a show that has a setting based on competitive Shogi, this is bound to be a given. Unlike most typical shounen anime, however, where we feel the joy of our characters upon the finishing move, we see how Rei feels guilt as he sees his opponents drown in sorrow upon defeat.  The story masterfully depicts this in one scene —  As Rei sees his opponent walk away in defeat, he then looks at his own palms, similar to how people look at their own shaking hands upon harming someone. He breaks down in turmoil of how he himself struggles with his problems, as he understands that relying on his proficiency in shogi to survive has to inevitably bring sadness to others if it means to avoid his own. This reminds us that we do not live in our own bubble and that whatever we do and whatever that happens to us has an alternate effect on others.With this theme, comes the frequent ‘Light vs Dark' theme that this show utilises.  It shows how certain happenings can have both a ‘good' and ‘bad' outcome/ effect. Be it a contrast between the visit of a friend and the visit of a relative, or the contrast between how Rei's Shogi opponents take their defeats with newfound motivation or self-destruction.Contrastingly, the characters in the story are not just black and white, but a mix of grey. Kyouko, though depicted as the brash sister who takes advantage of Rei's feeble personality, is shown to have a lot more depth to her character as she is actually far closer to Rei than she presumably is, she gives off the ‘you really dislike but can't entirely hate her' kind of feeling. Rei himself isn't just a kind and feeble boy but also breaks down and shouts out his frustrations and his selfish desires to live on.  There are no character archetypes, no tropes, and each character acts and thinks like real people with their respective backgrounds and experiences.Sangatsu no Lion uses simple elements to show symbolism, it follows the basic principle of ‘show, don't tell' faithfully. It does not spoon-feed the viewer, it isn't too cryptic either, it prioritises letting the viewers pick up on the underlying meaning of scenes on their own. Be it the emergence of water that drowns Rei to show the depressing and suffocating stage of life that he is enduring, or the bright colours of the Kuwamoto sisters' home, in contrast to the almost monochromic colours at his own home, to show the warmth that it exudes. Daily life moments that if looked closely has a much more profound meaning –  the scene where Rei realizes how cold he is when he is not in the Kuwamoto household can also be a deeper illustration of how he begins to rely on the sisters like an emotional crutch, or even the game of Shogi where each move on the board looks like an emotional attack on Rei's opponents as he defeats them and feels guilt afterwards.What's so good about Sangatsu no Lion is that it feels natural, watching Rei charge and his goals and embarrassingly stumble at one of his obstacles, him finding the friends and family he needs due to the emotional scars that he received, it sort of reminds us of our own lives doesn't it? Though this is indeed a work of fiction, it could as well be an autobiography and none would be the wiser.

I enjoyed sangatsu no lion because the story of an introverted boy struggling to find his path in life and understand the feelings he grapples with daily was something I could easily relate to. Most importantly throughout the story the MC interacts with very interesting side character who help him to gain a better understanding of meaning in his life. These interactions also lead to some amazing heartfelt moments that really make the anime. One thing I noticed and...must applaud the creators for doing is that the art changes moods during these heartfelt moments and the art consistently reflects the mood of the show at any given moment! must applaud the creators for doing is that the art changes moods during these heartfelt moments and the art consistently reflects the mood of the show at any given moment!"", 'Wow.

I am aware that there is some further character development in season 2 which might raise the points for characters, but as it's divided by seasons, that's I've chosen to review it.March comes in like a lion or 3-gatsu no lion is... sad. Sad in the way that you're sad something wonderful is imperfect, the way that there is a crack in the old, beautiful porcelain vase on your grandmother's dining table. The production is splendid, but the reality of the world that our main character is, almost psychedelically, blended into...- with swirling colors and metaphorical imagery - opens a portal into the world of Shogi and a simple tale of a lonely person finding a new family.It's not an action packed tale, but intense nonetheless, without falling into the trap of melodrama.Story 9/10:There is a simplicity which works in 3-gatsu. Because after all, complex situations are not really required to tell a compelling story. It's not by levels of revelation or incredibly clever dialogue that this show grabs an interested viewers' heart (I might argue it's through the stomach as there are some lovely looking dishes in there...). It's by portraying the mental state of our character with imagery, a few words from his perspective and beautiful demonstration of animation skill that transcends portrayal and becomes almost a stream of consciousness.So what is it actually about? We have a young man who is a shogi (Japanese chess) master. We follow him through his matches and his very gray every day life. As he comes into contact with a lovely family and befriends them, his perspective of life begins to shift to a more positive one, with some issues that life presents affecting him. We get to follow him through his changes. There's nothing really challenging about him as he is a pretty kind fella. There are some rounded characters in the show, but this guy is the martyr of cold and rough behavior directed towards children.Art 8/10:Studio Shaft was probably the best choice for this adaptation. They have a way of giving warmth and emotion, even negative such. There are also some sudden and well-made closeups add a sense of intimacy that could have been difficult to ascertain were it animated by a different studio.The metaphorical imagery is made in such a way that you want to stay in them and not leave, sort of what you might feel looking at some early impressionist art. It truly captures this show's portrayal of melancholia simply bursting at the seems, slowly dying and giving way to life.Sound 8/10:I find sound a bit difficult to review, but I enjoy the intros - the sounds enveloping the scenes seem to grasp the emotions well and I particularly like what's going on in the mindscape imagery.Character 7/10:The weakest point of the season. There's nothing wrong with the characters - they just develop a bit slowly. I really enjoy them in fact, and I know that they develop further in season 2. It's just a matter of priorities, as some setup and aesthetics take a lot of room in 3-gatsu. These characters are likeable and relatable for a lot of people, which can't be said for all popular shows.Enjoyment 8/10:I was on the verge of scoring 9 here, but it would have been a fanboy move. I really love watching this show. It's an emotional ride with a hopeful message and a slow, calm pace that puts my mind at ease.Overall 8/10:A smack-dab winner among the newer long-running animes out there. It's got a powerful story with some well-maneuvered social drama.I hope this review is helpful, please take one episode at a time and let it sit with you before playing the next. - with swirling colors and metaphorical imagery - opens a portal into the world of Shogi and a simple tale of a lonely person finding a new family.It's not an action packed tale, but intense nonetheless, without falling into the trap of melodrama.Story 9/10:There is a simplicity which works in 3-gatsu.

I hated it. As far as positives go, I like the art style (mostly), the animation is nice and fluid and whenever they do those black and white scenes that look like inked manga panels, it\'s beautiful and a marvel to look at. As far as stories and characters go, I\'ve never been more bored or disinterested in an anime like that. The characters feel so one-dimensional despite all their efforts of trying to insert depth through their ""unique"" and tragic struggles.Firstly, the main character... his issue...is that he doesn\'t really take care of himself and focused intensely on Shogi, a game he was never really interested in but was very good at from an early age and continued to get better to satisfy his foster dad and later to have funds to live off of. He\'s an orphan, no family of his own, taken in by a family who\'s dad is really intent on shogi and that\'s about it so far. While I don\'t think this backstory is necessarily bad or stupid, it just felt really dull. This main character felt like he had no personality to me besides being anxious, insecure and somewhat arrogant. That does not create a full character. He was a bore to watch.As for the family he usually visits, they\'re all just the ""cute girl"" stereotypes from the hard working one, to trying too hard and anxious, to the child. They were also very boring as they were just cut and paste stereotypes who were similarly orphaned. It feels as if the show is trying to just place a need for sympathy or pity upon the characters based purely on their pasts and not their characters. Another bad taste in my mouth.Then there\'s the best friend character... this guy was really annoying to me. As far as character goes, he\'s another generic stereotype. The passionate, enthusiastic guy who wants to build people up. He was just so insistent on being a part of the main character\'s life and of course, outside of the stereotype, has no real character and once again they gave him the problem of having a chronic illness, forcing sympathy upon the audience, instead of it being earned from us liking the characters and being invested in their stories.As for the foster family he had growing up, I wasn\'t particularly interested in that storyline but I did find the sister character to be extremely interesting and once she came back into the main character\'s life again, I was excited and their short interactions only disapointed me because they were short. Nothing else to really say about them.The writing of the show is bad. Now, this is obviously my opinion but it really feels like they took every anime with an introspective character, took stock dialogue, and put it into the show including all the characters who have differing opinions from the introspective characters, people who challenge them, people who provoke them, people who help them, etc. The dialogue is some of the most boring, generic, cut and paste stuff in the show and it was just unbarable to me especially since I love the idea of writing, what can be pulled off with writing and writers. As I said earlier, the sister character really stood out from everything else. She had an interesting character, interesting dialogue and an interesting story behind her with her abusive boyfriend. Outside of that, the writing wasn\'t doing anything for me.Just as an aside, the mouths are weird. This detail is more of a nitpick than a critique; it just bothered me while watching it because the mouths always looked like they were slightly open and cut at the sides which was just very distracting.Now, I don\'t want to give a verdict saying it\'s a bad show since I haven\'t seen everything yet but as of now, it\'s not looking promising and I\'m very reluctant to continue watching. With that, it\'s solidly below average for me but not far below average since I did enjoy the sister character as well as the art. Hope you can enjoy the show more than I did, form your own opinion and maybe even justify some of the things I dislike.Thanks for reading! is that he doesn\'t really take care of himself and focused intensely on Shogi, a game he was never really interested in but was very good at from an early age and continued to get better to satisfy his foster dad and later to have funds to live off of.

It feels as if the show is trying to just place a need for sympathy or pity upon the characters based purely on their pasts and not their characters. Another bad taste in my mouth.Then there\'s the best friend character... this guy was really annoying to me. As far as character goes, he\'s another generic stereotype. The passionate, enthusiastic guy who wants to build people up. He was just so insistent on being a part of the main character\'s life and of course, outside of the stereotype, has no real character and once again they gave him the problem of having a chronic illness, forcing sympathy upon the audience, instead of it being earned from us liking the characters and being invested in their stories.As for the foster family he had growing up, I wasn\'t particularly interested in that storyline but I did find the sister character to be extremely interesting and once she came back into the main character\'s life again, I was excited and their short interactions only disapointed me because they were short. Nothing else to really say about them.The writing of the show is bad. Now, this is obviously my opinion but it really feels like they took every anime with an introspective character, took stock dialogue, and put it into the show including all the characters who have differing opinions from the introspective characters, people who challenge them, people who provoke them, people who help them, etc. The dialogue is some of the most boring, generic, cut and paste stuff in the show and it was just unbarable to me especially since I love the idea of writing, what can be pulled off with writing and writers. As I said earlier, the sister character really stood out from everything else. She had an interesting character, interesting dialogue and an interesting story behind her with her abusive boyfriend. Outside of that, the writing wasn\'t doing anything for me.Just as an aside, the mouths are weird. This detail is more of a nitpick than a critique; it just bothered me while watching it because the mouths always looked like they were slightly open and cut at the sides which was just very distracting.Now, I don\'t want to give a verdict saying it\'s a bad show since I haven\'t seen everything yet but as of now, it\'s not looking promising and I\'m very reluctant to continue watching. With that, it\'s solidly below average for me but not far below average since I did enjoy the sister character as well as the art. Hope you can enjoy the show more than I did, form your own opinion and maybe even justify some of the things I dislike.Thanks for reading!', ""Other people have said more than I can about this anime so I'll keep it (mostly) brief.This anime is worth watching, though for me I had to revisit it just to finish it. It didn't immediately hook me, but I gave it a second chance and I did like it mostly. The art style is initially off putting, but its well drawn overall. While there are good characters the antagonists aren't very good, specifically *spoilers* Rei's sister and G dude. Both psychopaths apparently and how do you redeem that?However, the non crazy asshole characters are worth watching and Rei seems to be changing for...the better. Or for the Shogi. Rei is kind of messed up but still good.Overall: Watch with patience. It's good even if not great. the better. Or for the Shogi. Rei is kind of messed up but still good.Overall: Watch with patience. It's good even if not great."", ""March Comes in Like a Lion for me one is one of the few anime which has caused me to reflect on my life. In a sense it gives of the same vibe as Your Lie in April as both of the main characters are confronted with their fears and their dark pasts which they are forced to face in an attempt to overcome them. It also gives off the same poetic feel to it. If you are in the mood for a heart-warming anime then, you my friend have chosen the correct one.Now, I don't want to reveal too much about the plot so...I'll attempt to scratch the surface of this story-line and try to reel you in. Rei, the main character is a shogi protege. Despite being only 17-years-old he is a professional shogi player. One of the typical characteristics of a genius is the fact that they are usually loners and Rei doesn't fall short of this characteristic. To be generous, Rei probably has enough friends to count on his left hand (I don't know why I said left). However, for Rei this is his normality and it was like this for a while. Even before he estranged himself from his own family. His daily life becomes shaken up once Rei meets a young woman (Akari Kawamoto), her younger sisters - Hinata and Momo as well as their grandfather. This family that Rei slowly familiarizes himself with is not strictly comprised of humans, no there are also a few cats with entertaining personalities in this family too. He spends a considerable amount of time with this family, to the point that Akari treats him similarly to a younger brother. Akari dotes on him and her family and Rei learn that they share a common trait, they feel alone. This is explored as the story progresses.During the time that Rei spends with this family he matures. But this all not due to a mere family, no no no... Rei is also challenged by his rival and childhood friend Nikaidou, other formidable shogi opponents and his past. The more you watch, the more you learn about Rei's dark past. As Rei faces each challenge, he is given the opportunity to grow as a shogi player and mature as person. During this, he develops and attains key relationships giving both parties equal opportunities to mature in their respective area or trait. Honestly this series is gripping and it's hard to turn away and not have your eyes glued to the screen as the story progresses. I'm one of those people who begin to read the original manga if I become invested in the story and trust me, I cannot take the anticipation anymore and I will surely read the manga very soon.

I love Chica Umino's works but the start of the story was heart wrenching. As I continue watching, I found the characters to be three dimensional. They struggle, they love, they hate, they desire. Often times, the story is pure and simple with moments that makes me laugh hysterically. Then the sad moments rushes in and I'm in tears.Oh how I love the friendships and familial bond. The characters both well liked and hated that you can't help but dive deep into their back story. The art is not only breath taking...but the story is undeniably complex.

It feels real.- The storyline was just on point, I didn’t miss a word.- The characters development is on point too, unlike other similar anime series it wasn’t over the top which is very good because...it’s really annoying when characters goes crazy and their body language gets weird if you know what I mean. it’s really annoying when characters goes crazy and their body language gets weird if you know what I mean.', 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlsXZMtm4iAmzAtWgW9oj2x0mHCDgJ-OTwqkQyumxKU/edit?usp=sharingMy thoughts were mostly covered above ^3-gatsu no lion is the equivalent of hitting rock bottom and deciding to spend your life on wooden pieces.

But this anime is not widely known as other anime's so I thought by giving it a perfect 10 I might increase its rating which will encourage other people to check this anime out.The Story :Rei kimiyama is a...17 years old teenager, who is professional Shogi player and lives alone because he did not wanted to be any burden on his adoptive parents. By living alone he encounters the Kawamoto's family, who are the nicest people he has ever known.

That is the gist of the story.The Characters :For characters lets talk about our main characters here first. Its indicated from the start that Rei hates himself for various reasons, that are later revealed in the story so I am not going into any spoilers here but I am just gonna say that he hates himself because of his adoptive family.

I have deep interest in action-adventure anime, something that focuses on a protagonist that is usually accompanied by a strong cast at his side, going on adventures and saving the day. That, or a rom-com that focuses heavily on the development of relationships between the protagonist and one or more girls around him until he decides who he really loves. Lion was a complete gamble when I watched it because it was merely a suggestion my friend made and I went in with low expectations. I was completely absorbed...after two episodes. Not because of any action or romance that was put on screen. I was drawn in by the deep characters and the beautiful display of the terrible emotions and feelings that a lot of us experience in life. The main character, Rei Kiriyama, is a troubled young man who plays Shogi, a form of Japanese Chess, professionally. He doesn’t hate the game, but he doesn’t love it, playing it simply as a means of living in life. He lost his parents at a young age and was brought into a house that brought conflict between him and the children of his adoptive parents. This troubled him through his entire life, and the best he could do was isolate himself from those around him as a way of dealing with it.The story is less about what’s going on around him and more about what Rei and those he cares about are experiencing in those moments. Rei is a great protagonist, not feeling too depressing as a character and carrying a lot of small quirks and problems that make him feel real. The cast around him are also great, most usually bringing some light into Rei’s life and giving him a much needed push toward a less isolated lifestyle. Along with the art style that displays the waves of emotions and troubles through imagery, the characters are no doubt a huge highlight in the story. Rei’s depression is expressed through the feeling of being stuck under water, constantly drowning with no way to air. His isolation portrayed as a whirlwind of darkness that constantly surrounds him. When he sees the Kawamoto family though, they radiate with light and warmth that he desires.Lion makes you feel for each character and understand the emotions they experience with force, making your heart strain when something goes wrong and making your heart leap when something finally works out. It doesn’t drown you in depression despite the amount of emotions it pushes on you, always showing that even when things get bad, you always have a chance to bounce back and change. After losing to Shimada before the finals, Rei becomes bedridden and depressed. He spends most of his time curled up in bed and almost starving himself because of the pain. The Kawamoto family realize they haven’t seen him in some time, come to his home and take care of him until he’s feeling better. It’s moments like this that show that even when things seem to be their worst, there is always a way to recover. In this case, it’s through the sisters that he can come back.Each character has something to bring to the table. Certain ones do provide only a bit of intrigue to the story, while others persist as either fundamental players in Rei’s life or are presented with very real problems of their own. One prominent person in Rei’s life is his step sister, Kyouko. She can be very confusing in her relationship with Rei, constantly trying to push guilt on him over his victories over other players but still relying on him as a form of comfort when her own strained romantic relationship isn’t working out. At times, you think that she hates him for taking attention away from her to their father, but other times she is seen confiding in him. At times, their relationship seems to even border something taboo, small flashbacks alluding to Kyouko possibly sexually abusing Rei. Their relationship is tricky to understand, but makes for great moments in the story.The most prominent good in Rei’s life is the Kawamoto family, who consists of three sisters and their grandfather. They provide a warmth for Rei in his dreary, cold world that he is constantly putting himself into due to his bouts with depression. As much as he loves the sisters, he is constantly putting on the breaks to keep himself from getting too comfortable. Insecurities and fears drive him to think that like his foster family, he will somehow drive this family apart with his presence. Despite this, the sisters constantly invite him over, using his tendency to be unable to refuse people to make sure that he comes over. They serve as the family that he always wanted, becoming too attached to them to ever outright abandon them, even with his lingering fear.Rei’s biggest thing in Lion seems to be that while he’s great at Shogi, he doesn’t enjoy it. It’s his way of life and what he does for a living. Rei doesn’t play to win, he plays to ‘not lose’. It has become his only way of surviving in the world as his profession. This entire concept is finally turned on its head for him when he plays against a superior Shogi player, Shimada, who later on becomes a mentor of sorts. Shimada provides Rei with the knowledge of what he’s missing as a Shogi player, the hunger to win rather than not wanting to lose. Rei comes to admire his skill and drive, allowing himself to be humbled by Shimada and become one of his students of sorts. Shimada has great development of his own, almost taking center stage for several episodes that depict his own troubles in the Shogi community, having challenged the champion several times but always falling short. This is another great display of character development done right in a story, exploring his thoughts and pains throughout his endeavor to beat the champion.Character development and imagery of this level is rare, and I’m always happy to find a cast of characters that has me interested in every single one. Lion speaks to you about the emotional struggles of the heart from all angles, ranging from depression, loss, defeat and many others. But despite the turmoil, you have to keep fighting until you’ve won. Even if you keep falling down, don’t let it stop you from pushing forward.

I have named it one of the instant classics among the anime I have come to watch and will continue to enjoy it as long as it keeps going.', 'To start of this is one of the most recent anime that has given with a relaxing great feeling as i watched it and followed it through atleast the early stages.While this is strange to  say this but i enjoyed this less in some ways as i went further out in the story but let me start at the beginning. The beginning is great in many ways that it gives you a good cool feel to it although that might feel slow for some i kinda love those beginnings that start that way. As the story progress we learn more about the main...character story and what has happened through his life that gets alot more interesting. Its what i would call a low key dark anime that stays on the grey side of the world early on in the anime. As we get further there are some annoying parts which i have to blame some of the characters for the main character kinda being one of them mostly. Since as the story developes and sound more interesting it also goes away from being one of the more unique into what i would like to call a predictive plot line which in some ways starts to get slightly irritating for me as i watched it since it was ah yeah now this is gonna happen and now we have to wait that long for something new.Nice feeling to the art i felt i liked the way the eyes were made in this anime was very nice.The first opening and ending are one of those great ones you almost cant skip but you just love hearing it again and again. And if i combine it with the good and calm soundtrack i find myself saying only good things. The second opening and ending though is not up to par. They are less than interesting and feels like good enough op and endings but nothing special about them.I personally really like the main character Kiriyama, Rei alot atleast i do in the first 13 episodes or so and some later might have to do with the impact is lessening after a while but i feel he gets more uninteresting at times  in the later stages of the anime. Early he is this cool , calm and almost empathic feeling character thats interesting to follow but later he softens too much and starts to feel less like the one you started with in many ways.The Kawamoto sisters are an interesting bunch with personalities from 3 different of stages in a persons life. Child , Teenager and nearly adult. Although i at times can find them too imposing on the story and they can be a little too friendly in a sence.

If you like calm and relaxing anime that also gives you a great story then you will love this. I will almost say that you should love it in that case but if your not very fond of main characters that arent as action packed/ in your face or stories that arent as straight forward and a little slow then this anime might not be there for you but i hope most people will atleast give it a try. character story and what has happened through his life that gets alot more interesting. Its what i would call a low key dark anime that stays on the grey side of the world early on in the anime. As we get further there are some annoying parts which i have to blame some of the characters for the main character kinda being one of them mostly. Since as the story developes and sound more interesting it also goes away from being one of the more unique into what i would like to call a predictive plot line which in some ways starts to get slightly irritating for me as i watched it since it was ah yeah now this is gonna happen and now we have to wait that long for something new.Nice feeling to the art i felt i liked the way the eyes were made in this anime was very nice.The first opening and ending are one of those great ones you almost cant skip but you just love hearing it again and again. And if i combine it with the good and calm soundtrack i find myself saying only good things. The second opening and ending though is not up to par. They are less than interesting and feels like good enough op and endings but nothing special about them.I personally really like the main character Kiriyama, Rei alot atleast i do in the first 13 episodes or so and some later might have to do with the impact is lessening after a while but i feel he gets more uninteresting at times  in the later stages of the anime. Early he is this cool , calm and almost empathic feeling character thats interesting to follow but later he softens too much and starts to feel less like the one you started with in many ways.The Kawamoto sisters are an interesting bunch with personalities from 3 different of stages in a persons life. Child , Teenager and nearly adult. Although i at times can find them too imposing on the story and they can be a little too friendly in a sence.

When I read the story, I thought that it was a boring Slice of Life anime.I was so wrong.Sangatsu no Lion brings you a tragic backstory of the MC (no innovative) and how he ""fights"" this with an curious sport: Shogi.Shogi is like japanese chess, for saying it in a nutshell. I don\'t know how to play it, but that\'s not important. In this anime, Shogi is the thing who brings Rei (MC\'s name) back to life. Rei loves Shogi, but does he love it personally or just because...Shogi save his life?That\'s the enigma, until Rei finds about an peculiar family, who will help him to, maybe, find an answer.If you want to know why this is a masterpiece, I highly recommend you to watch it.Incredible.

However , the actual plot and main character were lacking in my opinion.', 'Can we please stop for a moment to talk about how well portrayed is the theme of depression here?THINGS THAT I LIKED:- Straight out of the bat, the animation is GORGEOUS. I especially like the colors, just like in the manga, it all looks so cozy and wholesome visually. As a matter of fact, apart from the synopsis, that´s what first caught my attention when I began watching this.- Music is also beautiful, settles perfectly the mood (btw, I was not expecting a song in French to be played at the beginning of episode 1, that was a nice surprise).- The story looks realistic and...they don´t take depression lightly. This is not one of those stories where the main character (who´s depressed) magically fels the joy of being alive after one or two random encounters. No, instead, it´s all a process. During the entire anime you can see how Kiriyama starts opening up more to people, and maybe even feel a little bit better, as the plot continues to go forward.- Awesome supporting characters. They all have a story, and also their own struggles. It´s nice to see how Kiriyama interacts with them and eventually relizes not only that he´s not alone, but that a lot of people has passed for similar things as he did.- Maybe because I like games like chess, the fact that they used shogi to give the MC that escape from reality seems so interesting to me. And speaking about shogi, I like how they took the time to show some of the stories of another shogi players. I think this all makes Kiriyama feel less and less isolated.- There´s no villains in this story. Just humans.THINGS I DIDN´T LIKE:- I´m gonna get cancelled here, but... I didn´t really appreciated the sisters plot. I mean, not like I totally disliked it (I certainly didn´t) but they´re just so fvcking shinny it hurts my eyes. I cannot say that´s a bad thing, though, because they play a mayor role in making Kiriyama feel at home again. Just you know, not my style.- ""Not my style"" and I can say the same about those cute fragments with the youngest of the sisters, when the cats talk and the animation turns too adorable (then again I repeat, it´s my opinion, you´re probably going to enjoy it if you watch it because it´s still nicely done and blends perfectly with the plot).- Isn´t it a bit cliché that Kiriyama is an orfan...? Oh, well, nevermind.OVERALL, I became interested in this anime for two main reasons: First, the shogi plot (my nerdy side wants to know more about the game itself and players cause they all felt so realistic). Second, and more important, the deppression part of the story which is treated like it should. they don´t take depression lightly.

The character development is sublime, and their personalities and backgrounds are highly relatable. This relatability is essential in a show that aims to create a comfortable space for the audience and allows them to simply vibe with it.Just thinking about the show sends a chill down my spine, reminding me of how great the scenes are.

The duration of one episode is about 25 minutes and is recommended for 13 years.STORY - 9/10The story, in my opinion, is quite well presented. It is about a boy who managed to become a professional shogi player in high school. The main character, Kiriyama Rei leads a very busy life because he is one of the few players to...reach such a high level. He is only 17 years old, but already lives alone, does not take very good care of himself and although he has the opportunity not to go to school because he is not obliged, he decides to return and complete his education. He has to deal with the life of a professional player and that of a teenager who has a lot of problems in his life.ART AND SOUND - 9/10The art in the anime is wonderful. The characters are well drawn, the picture well represents the emotions of the characters. The same goes for the sound system.CHARACTERS - 9-10Kiriyama, Rei - he is the main character. He had a difficult childhood, which prompted him to take shogi very seriously to impress his stepfather and ""stay on the train,"" as he puts it at the end of the first season.After growing up and earning money from professional shogi, he moved out of the home of the family that raised him due to a misunderstanding with Masachika Kouda\'s children. In the new place where he lives, he meets the Kawamoto family, who help him with his emotional problems and change his anti-social behavior. Unfortunately, they can\'t help him get over them completely and such emotional problems haunt him until the end of the season.As the story develops so does Rei\'s character.Akari KawamotoShe is the eldest of Kawamoto\'s three sisters and has played the role of mother in the family since their parents died.

Both from a technical point of view and in terms of artistic merit. The direction is excellent. The writing seems excellent (I plan to read the source material). Visually it is excellent and I applaud their frequent use of 'visual metaphors' in scenes. Visual direction is excellent. The studio is Shaft if you care. Characterization is extremely well done. The characters are rich and elaborate, as are their interactions. I liked character designs -- especially the unique style of the faces. OST was good but not spectacular. Given...the dialogue-heavy nature of the show though OST is relatively less important.Drama is one of my favourite genres. Sangatsu no Lion excels in this context. The drama utilizes the rich cast of characters well. It is multidimensional in nature as opposed to a simple linear romance. There are many axes along which drama is developed, and it follows that there are many aspects through which you can engage with this anime emotionally. I personally found many characters relatable and this enhanced my experience. There's a high probability that you will as well and with this in mind I strongly recommend watching Sangatsu no Lion.10/10 overall. Highly emotionally engaging and exceptional in many respects.I found myself rewatching many scenes over and over.I think I liked season 1 slightly more than season 2, overall. They're both great -- I just found the plot in season 1 more personally engaging. I don't want to elaborate more because whichever plot one prefers between the seasons is highly subjective and any discussion of it will inevitably result in spoilers.Also an afterthought about humour: the show has a lot of genuinely funny gags. I laughed out loud many times while watching. Comedic relief is used effectively to create sort of an emotional rollercoaster. The flavour of humour itself is objectively kind of lame but personally I'm a sucker for silly puns and stuff like that. There is a lot of (social) situational humour as well, which I find enjoyable.

Sangatsu was quite a journey tbh. I didn\'t love it at first, even though i identify myself so much with Rei, my love for 3-gatsu kinda grew with each episode. I had it on hold for a while, but after that i finished it so quickly, the Shimada arc was so good, i loved getting to know more about the character, and i loved how they explored his relationship with Rei, absolutely amazing, my favorite arc in s1.Story - 9/10Ok, its pace can be slow sometimes and leave...you bored for some minutes, but the story itself is very good, a teenager who has no friends at first, is a somewhat gifted kid who has burnt out, and feels like he has no place in the world. It is very clear that Kiriyama is depressed, he struggles to do many daily activities, he overthinks and can also be super sensitive. *SPOILER WARNING* In the last arc, especially during the last chapter; ""Warrior"" we see young Rei and his classmates going on a trip. The first thing we see is a boy saying many times he doesn\'t want to sit next to Kiriyama. This chapter is truly beautiful, we see how lonely and social anxious he was from a young age, and we are able to see his development. He states he hasn\'t changed, nor the people around him. But, is that true? Is the present Rei the same as the young boy we saw? One of my favorite lines is when he says to himself ""Sensei, is this sit next to me going to be empty my whole life?"" And the answer is no, it\'s not going to be empty. He was able to make friends, Nikaidou, Shimada, and the three sisters who are very special to him, and we can feel it. We are actually able to feel what Kiriyama is feeling, and this is one of the best aspects from 3-gatsu. The way they can make us feel the emotions is brilliant and unreal. Another quote i personally felt so connected with was from Rei\'s sensei ""You\'re already trying your best aren\'t you? So i can\'t tell you to work harder, because you\'re already doing it."" (this is not the exact quote), I loved when he said that, because sometimes we are trying our best, but it\'s not enough for the rest of the people, and we feel terrible because we are not able to fullfill other\'s expectatives. Rei is trying his best and we can see it during the series, so it was very good to see someone acknowledging Rei\'s hard work.Art - 7/10Ok hear me out, i\'m not a big fan of the way they design the characters, i really don\'t know why, it suits the series perfectly, i just personally don\'t like it. On the other hand, i really really love the way they portray Rei\'s emotions through the animation, for example when he is feeling overwhelmed we actually see him drowning in a deep ocean that represents his feelings. I think this is one of the things that help us to identify with Rei. It is very hard to explain using words how depression feels, and watching 3-gatsu representing it visually gave me chills sometimes. Absolutely amazing.Sound - 10/10There isn\'t much to say about the sound. I really enjoyed the soundtrack and the openings. Op 1 is better in music, op 2 is better in giving meaning to the opening,Characters - 8/10I\'m excited to start season 2 because there are some characters that weren\'t developed in this season, and that\'s why i gave an 8/10. Rei\'s character is terrific, we are exploring his emotions and learning with him, and that\'s absulutely incredible. Shimada and Nikaidou are characters that are important to Rei, they care about him and he do the same for them, he is learning more and more about shougi and life with them and that is beautiful. I really like Shimada\'s character, as well as the three sisters. Akari, Momo and Hina saved Rei\'s life, by being there for him, inviting him over and basically just spending time with him. They care so much about him, their relationship is very cute and nice, i hope to see more about it on the next season. The only character i used to hate (besides Gotou, i still hate him by the way) was the psichotic sister, i forgot her name since she is so forgetable, but i did enjoy learning more about her and her feelings, i hope they show us more about her and his adoptive family, as well as his biological family.Overall - 8/10I feel like the beginning of the season was somehow slow in some aspects, and it may leave the wrong impression on some people. However, i really recommend watching it, because the last 5 episodes or so are incredible. This show really grows on you after a while, you just have to be patient and enjoy the journey in Rei\'s life and see how things that are easy for some people, can be really complicated for others.  I\'ve been told that season 2 is way better than season 1, so my expectations are pretty high, I\'m very hyped and excited for it. you bored for some minutes, but the story itself is very good, a teenager who has no friends at first, is a somewhat gifted kid who has burnt out, and feels like he has no place in the world.

It now sits atop the mountain of anime I've seen as a favorite, standing above even Natsume Yuujinchou and Mushishi.I have no interest in shogi. I don't care for sports or competitive games in general, but that hardly matters here. Yes, the story is about a shogi prodigy but it is about his intricately characterized inner life and struggles to come to terms with, essentially, being alive. Shogi is a medium, but we are here to witness the travails of a young man as he comes into himself, and learns to...care for himself in the wake of profound grief and turmoil, brought about by the deaths of those he was closest to and the resulting chaos in which he found himself.The show has everything, with its believable characters, none of whom are villains or saints, but merely humans with their own struggles. Some of them are likeable, some are not, but, ironically, none feel cartoonish. There is warmth and despair, the former provided by the family whom Kiriyama finds himself befriending, and the latter coming from within his own mind, and from his foster father and sister.Shinbo Akiyuki is an excellent director, most of the time. He has a unique way of depicting pretty much everything, from his work on the Monogatari series and Madoka Magica to the sillier fare of Hidamari Sketch and Arakawa Under The Bridge. His talents are on full display here, and he delivers a story that feels perfect in its execution not only as a narrative character study but as an anime. The way the story is told feels perfectly suited to the format, delivering an experience that could not be matched by a live action work, or even, to my mind, by the excellent manga on which this series is based. I've never before thought a series was perfect, but to me, San Gatsu no Lion is. If you don't care for slice of life shows that focus on human interaction and the inner lives of their characters, you won't get much out of this. The stakes are low, but immensely high on a personal level. Many of our characters, in various ways, need saving, but mainly from themselves, and we watch our protagonist on his long journey towards doing just that. It's truly wonderful.I also think this is a great show to introduce someone to anime with in general. There's not a shred of fanservice, and its themes are accessible to anyone who has struggled to make sense of their place in the world, which is pretty much all of us. If I had to compare it, I would say that it is on the same level as, though it is quite different to, the works of Hayao Miyazaki.

While it is not as complete as Assassination Classroom in terms of what the series can offer relative to my preference, 3-gatsu no Lion compensates with unique cinematography, example showcased in the form of 5-seconds close up shots, unique music scores, etc.The story is anything but one-dimentional, bringing in multiple themes applicable to real-life situations (such as depression, the importance of companions and how to be a valuable...companion, etc.).

Artistic direction and the use of colors really brought metaphors to life and perfectly captured the emotions and atmospheres of each scene.The story follows Rei when he begins to open up to others and understand his own emotions. Haunted by his past, lost in the present and uncertain of his future, Rei is a protagonist in which many people can see themselves, even if they are not 17-year-old professional shōgi players.The anime has the potential to alleviate any concerns you may have, it may be of great help. "", ""3-gatsu no Lion starts off splendidly, frankly one of the best beginnings I've seen in any work of any medium. The protagonist is introduced to us on a day like any other, walking through a city in Japan accompanied by an incredible visual and musical display. Only with that little amount of time, I knew that this anime was going to be incredible.*This review contains spoilers about the show, I think that without spoiling a little bit I couldn't express myself well enough*Superficially, March comes in like a Lion tells the story about a young Japanese man who becomes a professional shogi player...(which would come to be a Japanese version of chess) at a very young age, but in reality this anime is much more than that: in my opinion, it’s a very accurate portrait of depression and, beyond that, of life itself, and all of this is achieved thanks mainly to the incredible development of the protagonist, Rei Kiriyama, and two of my favorite characters from the show that are the Hayashida Sensei and the professional shogi player Shimada, who also happen to have spectacular voice actors that I love, mainly because of their previous jobs in Monogatari Series (Oshino Meme and Kaiki respectively).The main aspects that made this anime one of my favourites were above all these three: the well-done representation of japanese family culture, with its typical superstitious inclinations moved by deep devotion to tradition, which was almost exclusively carried out from the house of the trio of sisters Hinata, Akari and Momo; the feeling of warmth that these scenes gave not only to Rei Kiriyama but also to me personally, thanks in part to the dynamism of the 3 before mentioned characters and the protagonist and to Shaft's incredible artistic work; and finally the path of self-discovery carried out by the main character throughout these 22 chapters, obviously far from giving us a conclusion but close to explaining in detail what it’s like to live depressed and that your only role in life, after having passed it without a true family or friends, is something that most of the time does not bring you more than misfortunes. The answer to how to overcome all this is far from being answered, Rei despite now having friends and something to call “family” continues to carry a huge weight with him.Clearly not everything is perfect, 3-gatsu no lion in its first season has things that I didn’t like, such as the amount of comedy it has, but these are minimal errors compared to how well and how happy it made me be while seeing these first approaches to the life of Rei Kiriyama.As a fan of Shaft's works (Madoka Magica and Monogatari), I decided to watch this anime since it was known as one of the great works of the studio, so I went to watch it with many expectations, and it exceeded them widely. What differentiates it so much from many other works that I have seen, and above all from what I have seen by Shaft (although this doesn’t mean that the other works are necessarily bad, they are simply different) is that this show feels real, they managed to do a very vivid and well done portrait of human life. Like Gigguk once said in his video about Your Name, I think March comes like a Lion is quite the same about this: that this anime doesn’t speak to your brain, rather speaks to your heart.From Sangatsu I keep with me those little moments like when Shimada tells Rei what his life was like in the town, how Hinata collapses leaning on the railing of a bridge remembering her deceased mother while Rei feels totally identified with her, when all the Kawamoto family is dining in harmony and everything feels so warm and like home, when Kyouko totally discharges herself with Rei for ruining her childhood, among many other things; I am left with those little moments that have not only made me excited but have also taught me many things, but mainly that no matter how much sadness and depression overwhelms you, that doesn’t mean that there won’t be people who will be by your side , and although in the end the one who has to overcome it is no more than yourself, always keep in mind that this is normal and what makes us human.

The nights where the MC is outside walking home and to the girls\' place, I could feel the warmth from the starry night. The facial designs of the characters were very very pretty, I like how their lips were drawn slightly frowning, as if it\'s implying that everyone\'s going through some shit in their lives.The juxtapostion between the cheerful moments and the sombre & solemn vibes were were pretty cool, I rarely see anything like that. It shows the truth, the lives of everyday people, their miniscule problems that have a compounding effect...on the latest version of their character.The music was great as well. I loved the tune that plays when the MC is walking home. I think it\'s called ""on the way home 帰り道"", found it on youtube. It\'s a really charming, mellow tune, for a warm summer\'s night.Fuck his sister though, real piece of shit.

This review is really subjective so forgive me, even I am mad at myself for feeling like this, I really feel like maybe I missed something at the end. Although I know nothing about shogi, the slice of life in this is both very heartfelt and heartwarming. The artistic depiction of human emotions is portrayed in every frame with such beauty that makes it hard for you not to want to observe and understand what the character on screen is feeling....The animated portrayal of things you can't put into words was executed in a top-tier way. I really lack the vocabulary that can properly describe how beautiful this series was in its 10/10 head start. Now, although this anime started with a 10/10 score for me and got me to witness studio shaft's head tilts again, the plot at some point started to feel monotonous, at least for me, not the repetitive monotonous plot but a plot that doesn't have the ability to make you more curious leaving you wanting more episodes or content. Even I am mad at myself for thinking that because this anime is cute so I'd like to believe that this is a subjective take, especially that I don't know a thing about shogi so I'd like to believe that the plot was developing on its shogi side without me catching it. I'm just disappointed that this went from a 10/10 to a 7/10 for me because at some point I really thought it was boring, I had to push myself to make it to the final episode. Overall if I had to say it, I only enjoyed the first part of it and a little of the final episode, if I was being genuine I'd give it a 7. I'm still hopefully going to watch the second season of it because it could offer the good heartfelt shit this plot and characters can offer.

However, before I say anything else I just need to make it clear that this anime is one of the best slice of life ones. The authors and everyone who worked on this anime knew how to portray the character's feelings both in the expressions but also the way they just formulate the sentences hits the watcher so hard. There's a lot of metaphors throughout the whole series that I think only make it easier to understand how the...characters are feeling. The story might seem boring as it's showcased as a sports anime with Japanese chess being the main topic but no, there's so much depth put into the MC that shows his struggles and overall thinking regarding life. I don't want to give away too much to not spoil anything but I think this anime gives justice to depression, anxiety, and other struggles such as being a high achiever, being expected to do good and trust. Not many anime manages to actually show the raw emotions the way san-gatsu does. So if you're like me and loves a heartbreaking story then this is the perfect pick for you. You don't even necessarily need to be into sports anime to enjoy this, I believe would be able to relate to the MC's feelings in other scenarios. characters are feeling.

Kiriyama is suffering from social anxiety and maybe depression. There is nothing new about stories depicting a main character suffering from psychological problems but it feels fresh when it's placed in a competitive game setting. Unlike most sports anime series who continually shows a character's love for the sport and their live revolving as a sport, Sangatsu shows the otherwise. Shogi is only a backdrop for Kiriyama, he continues to move on life as he uses Shogi as a means for living.Art:If...I could sum it up in one word it would be, serene. Lively, light-hearted moments are portrayed in vibrant pastel distinguished with Shaft's style of character animation. Monologues and dream-like sequences are placed in cool colors with a refreshing placement of blacks. These contrasting palettes gives off a very emotional feel like we're Kiriyama himself.The character designs seems very similar with Umino Chika's other series, Honey and Clover. There is nothing unique, nor eye popping in these. It just feels, at home. Normal. The cats are very well characterized, I give them that.Sound:So far, the soft music accentuates the backgrounds with a few exceptions like that edm shogi-fight which honestly sounded off. Apart from the acoustic guitar and piano music, I think the OP and ED stands out the most. Bump of Chicken brilliantly voiced out emotions out of the songs. It sounded deep with a sense of choking but it lets you breathe out during the chorus.I have no qualms about the voice actors. Nothing feels off and I heard some familiar seiyuus. I do however love the cat's voices, it definitely feels comedic and adorable.Character:Most of the characterization so far portrays Kiriyama, we already communicate with him through his monologues. We are also shown a variety of other characters which do not fall into the normal character tropes. We look into the other characters like Kiriyama's self proclaimed rival, Harunobu. He was initially shown as a lively comedic character and yet his background made him a person who will tolerate anything just for the sake of the game. It was humanizing.Overall, Sangatsu no Lion has an involving drama between characters accompanied with a beautiful art and calming sound. It's currently running as the best series this season.

It's certainly not like a sports anime centered around shogi. But it's also not like shogi is just some backdrop that doesn't actually matter. It very much does play a crucial role throughout the anime, and I think that having at least a basic understanding of how shogi is played would definitely enhance one's viewing of the anime. That's...as far as a statement as I can make, as a minimal knowledge of shogi is all I have. There are segments that explain the absolute basics of shogi through the use of adorable cats, which I thought were incredibly creative and very well made, but I don't think that's enough of an explanation overall. Why I think that having an understanding of shogi is important is that while its generally not important to be able to understand the specific tactics or strategies involved, I think it is important to understand the flow of the game and appreciate just how far shogi can go, and it's not as simple as just thinking of it like chess. Otherwise I think people would just find aspects of it strange, especially as the anime doesn't really try to explain any of it.With all that said, more so than shogi itself, I feel that what matters more is professional shogi and the world surrounding that. Though once again, to be clear this is not a sports anime where the focus is on the protagonist slowly getting better and rising in the ranks. Rather, it's about the protagonists place in that world, how he got there, the effect that had on others around him, and where he wants to go from there. To give a more concrete example of how this is different, this isn't an anime where the protagonist is shown losing as a build up to a satisfying victory, this is an anime where he's shown winning as a build up to him devastatingly losing, as it is in failing that we really question ourselves and grow, and that's what matters.Now, with all that also said, I wasn't actually all that fond of the shogi aspects of the anime. The world of shogi itself as it is portrayed in the anime was immensely interesting. There's a large series of interesting characters with unique personalities, and I think that the anime did a good job of portraying them well, especially Shimada who during the latter half felt just as much a focus as Rei. Something that I think makes shogi stand out compared to other anime centered around games is that there weren't many young professional players. However, the protagonist is quite young, being only in high school. As a result, this is the series of a boy trying to do his best to act like an adult while also constantly dealing with far more experienced adults and their problems. As is completely fair, that is too much for him. Hence, it feels like a heavy portion of the anime regarding the parts centered around shogi have very little to do with him and do not contribute to showing him going through growth or development. They are well made in and of themselves, but feeling disconnected from Rei makes them feel quite slow as it feels like it would be much more preferable to watch something that contributes to Rei's character growth as he still stands out far more than any of the other characters focused on.That brings up what I think is a major difference between this and most similar anime. The anime very much is about Rei's character and him growing. However, he doesn't actually grow that much, or really at all over the course of the anime.\xa0It is relatively common for stories of character growth to be built on a starting foundation of personal failings and past traumas. Rei certainly wasn't lacking in that regard, having quite the troubled past that led to him having a number of character flaws. However, his involvement with shogi didn't feel like it was helping in that regard. True, there were certain areas where it felt like things related to shogi were helping him move forward, but in hindsight that's not really the case it seems. Rather, they were simple areas that weren't causing him more pain, with the obvious implication of this is that most of his involvement of shogi is causing him suffering. New sources of pain weren't limited to the world of professional shogi either, as his school life was also causing him a lot of trouble, and his old wounds were also constantly being reopened. As such, for the most part this isn't the story of someone troubled getting over their troubles. Rather, its the tale of someone troubled gaining more troubles. And that's kind of painful to watch.With that all said, its not entirely depressing. Rei does manage to obtain a series of connections to people that truly do seem to care about him. The first that comes to mind is the Kawamoto sisters who are also suffering from their own issues related to a troubled past, though it doesn't get too much into that yet, but because of that are able to connect with Rei. Watching Rei and their interactions was the best part of the anime for me because it stood out as a lighthearted oasis, or as Rei himself puts it a warm kotatsu, and it really struck a chord with me. His growing bond with Nikaidou and Shimada was also interesting. They were both character that I felt would be minimal side characters that turned out to be incredibly important, and that serve as another series of important bonds but from a completely different direction of looking at shogi in a more positive light. Also of note was his teacher, Hayashida, who was going well beyond what would be expected of him to help Rei with his school life. The thing though is that while all of them definitely care for him and want to help him and he very much realizes this, he still isn't actually moving forward. The biggest issue with fixing issues related to personality, view point, and character are that if you're the type of person that can fix them you wouldn't need to fix them in the first place. That's where it feels like Rei is over the course of the entire anime. Still, where things leave off are a place where it definitely feels like he'll be able to grow and if it follows up on that I would be incredibly satisfied, but whether it was worth it to spend an entire season to get there I believe is highly questionable.The art and the animation in the anime are very well done. It gets a bit bizarre stylistically at times, though considering its Shaft I suppose its actually not that much for them. The designs are very plain and realistic as one would expect of such a story. The first OP and ED are pretty mellow and sad while the second are happier and more exciting, which I found strange as the tone and atmosphere of the show didn't seem to change at all. All of them were decent in terms of audio and visuals. I think the soundtrack was really good for fitting with what it was portraying, though I don't think any tracks stood out as particularly memorable in and of themselves. I would also like to note that I thought the format, which adapted each chapter separately with a title card for each was an interesting idea and worked very differently from how Shaft did it with Sayonnara Zetsubou Sensei. as far as a statement as I can make, as a minimal knowledge of shogi is all I have.

All of them were decent in terms of audio and visuals. I think the soundtrack was really good for fitting with what it was portraying, though I don't think any tracks stood out as particularly memorable in and of themselves. I would also like to note that I thought the format, which adapted each chapter separately with a title card for each was an interesting idea and worked very differently from how Shaft did it with Sayonnara Zetsubou Sensei."", '""should I watch this show?"" I believe you should. The animation invokes powerful emotions, the story carefully balances its drama with its cute slice of life moments, and the supporting cast is one of the most colorful ensembles in recent memory. The narrative touches on loss and isolation, and how those feelings can drive victims away from their families and circles of support. In this story, we see a young protagonist taking baby steps toward finding the strength to rely on others without feeling like a burden.On the finer points: the protagonist narrates a lot. Not everyone will like this storytelling approach. However Kiriyama Rei...internalizes almost everything, so narration is something we should expect in a story like this. In fact it would feel weird without it. The art of the animation is stylized in such a way as to suggest the director didn\'t want us to forget that this all came from hand-drawn manga. That hand-drawn feeling has the power to draw you in, making you feel warm when it wants you to while leaving you feeling cold if it deems it necessary for the scene.Overall, this was one of the better things to come out of 2016. It was so great it even moved me to learn shogi and order my own set. While the show doesn\'t end with any particularly compelling cliffhanger, it gives you plenty of reasons to look forward to season 2: for starters, more shogi, more wacky opponents, and possibly more singing cats! internalizes almost everything, so narration is something we should expect in a story like this.

Short personal thoughts on Anime/manga, heavy weight on personal feelings with minor objective valuations.  More explained how I rate on my site.Review layout: WP non-HReview type: AnimeNote: Still testing review layouts.

In a nutshell story takes likeable approach with bittersweet drama. It presents you with locked-in character with plenty of issues that drowns itself into game of Shogi, which story revolves around. As story goes on, slowly main character past, family issues, his personal issues and drama starts to unfold giving you this unpleasant drowning feeling. Which already is something really I personally like and can relate to a fair bit.. But the way story is presented, how impactful and such is done quite well. Anyhow, that is the premise and that start of how story unfolds with the bitter part. But over time story will start giving you droplets of sweetness, how the world, environment, people around the main character essentially in unlikely fantasy like manner start helping him out of that drowning shell.Anyhow…. story essentially juggles between such bad emotions and giving at the same time cozy feeling of warmth. Creating such very longing and fantasy like “wouldn’t that be nice” type of setting.That was the whole setting, drama part of the storytelling. Let’s not forget the second main aspect of the story. Shogi a.k.a Japanese Chess. I personally don’t really care much about it but, story revolves around Shogi tournaments, characters, growth and such. Here only part that matters that, there is progression. There are fairly interesting characters and Shogi is dramatized and made entertaining, because Anime can do any “sport” genre entertaining.*CharacterWell, since it’s drama story and character section go hand to hand so as mentioned before bittersweetness is this Anime main charm. We have main character who struggles with depression and solitude and has to deal with bunch of other issues whilst drowning himself into Shogi matches.And the 2nd biggest part of main cast would be the sisters trio he meets. Essentially clumps of happiness and warmth that obviously have their own set of problems. But their encounter with main character is the spark of things to come and how the main character essentially gets “saved”.There are a lot of other more interesting characters that play part in main characters past, growth and such. But in the end it’s slice of life drama, talking about those things would be too much of a spoiler.Long story short. Over the course of 2 seasons, I consider the the whole character growth, past, encounters and such were pretty well done. There are plenty of moments where I felt for the main character and there were unreal amount of moments where I felt emotional for his encounters and environment where I simply thought “….man… wouldn’t that be nice” or something along the line.But overall… felt glad for the main character and those around him. Wish for another season.*Art & SoundFirst things first. Animated SHAFT . So artistic presentation is absolute bliss to look at. Very vivid, well delivered and emotional moments have powerful impact. Scenes are high quality and overall everything was well brought to front that mattered whilst all the backgrounds were pleasant to see as well.As for music / soundtracks. There were lot of pretty soundtracks that were quite pleasant to listen to. Well delivered in most scenes with proper emotional impact.So yeah, overall when it comes to Art, Animation and sound part of this Anime. It was superb. Pretty cozy style, great animation, superb delivery. Nothing to complain about. Enjoyed it a lot.*Enjoyment & OverallI probably would have rated this Anime much higher if it would have hit those next 3 criteria. 1. Maybe less shogi mumbo jumbo 2. Hoped for some romance… 3. Somewhat hoped to see/hear more of season 1 earlier part MC monologues where he had darker mindset…. as it was somewhat relaxing and more relatable.But overall.. I found it still amazing Anime, like with “honey & clover” which is made by same author. While honey & clover had that bittersweet feeling related to various romance couple dramas. This Anime had that bittersweetness mostly revolving around to inner issues, family drama and social dramas. But how Author suddenly decided to go with Shogi, is beyond me.In the end….. if you are someone who can enjoy that bittersweet type of story telling. Someone who doesn’t mind getting edged by depression with sparkles of warmth & happiness then this is amazing Anime. Great characters, great presentation and especially great combination of emotional deliverance. Having constantly told in storybook manner some sad, dark stuff while at the same time being cozied up by warm characters and environment.#Total Score 8/10 #PROS+Absolutely superb bittersweet drama+Superb inner monologues around themes of loneliness and depression+Great heart warming drama+Beautiful art presentation+Touches some fairly great subject for drama+Shogi made at least dramatized and interesting to watch#CONS-Honestly… nerdy Shogi aspect wasn’t really my cup of tea… but at least was made fairly entertaining-Man…..

It made great use of lights, shadows, even minor things like bubbles in a bottle of pop being drunk. However, I do not think the style will appeal to everyone. I personally did not like the way the faces were drawn, especially the lines of the lips and the ‘pupils’ of the eyes. I also didn’t like how the scenery and background, and basically everything that was not a person had a gritty looking texture to it, while the people were flat colors. I just felt that the people and the world did not match and I didn’t like it....However, both of these things are a ‘style’ and a matter of personal taste.The anime makes great use of flashbacks that seem to just melt into whatever was happening in present time. In general it makes great use of time and appropriately place analogies, such as a nature documentary after a depressing flashback that explained exactly how Rei felt. It also makes good use of ost, lighting, and pays close attention to visuals.This anime centers quite a bit around Shogi, a game that many non-Japanese who watch it are not familiar with. The game is explained in episode 8 in a very easy to understand manner, but I think it is still hard for audiences to understand, especially as the pieces are identified by kanji. This makes it hard to get into the slow moving matches.I felt that the plot and scenes moved too slow for me. For example, the first episode dedicated a lot of time to Rei silently (there was music) went through the train station and streets to eventually make it tho his shogi match, to which we watched him play shogi. I watched this anime up until episode 10 but will not continue because it just moved too slow for me. I rate this a 6/10 but that is very much personal taste as some people really love the slow moving atmosphere. This might be a 10/10 masterpiece for some because it seems good to those who enjoy very slow paced anime.

The slice-of-life elements are excellent, portraying self-reflection and the complexities of dealing with emotional lows. However, the anime takes a deep dive into shogi in the latter half. While this might be...enjoyable for fans of the game, it can feel overwhelming for casual viewers with little shogi knowledge.Characters (8/10): Rei is a compelling protagonist. The anime portrays his internal struggles with depression realistically. The supporting cast, particularly the Kawamoto sisters, is heartwarming.Animation & Sound (8/10): The animation style is unique and complements the introspective tone. The soundtrack is beautiful and creates a melancholic yet hopeful atmosphere.Enjoyment (6/10): While the first half resonated with me due to its relatable themes, the heavy focus on shogi later on became a drag. The powerful and emotional scenes throughout partially redeemed the experience.Overall (6/10):  3-gatsu no Lion is a decent anime with a strong start.

But when it picks up, the pieces start falling into place and you can really start appreciating it. Loved the dealing with failure and depression themes that appeared throughout. Lots of relatable moments throughout if you're someone that struggles with social anxiety.Characters: Honestly, the characters besides the mc are all uninteresting and annoying most of the time. Most of the people mc is close with have annoying personalities and are very one dimensional. Meanwhile, the mc is the exact opposite. He's...a very complex character that is plagued with a plethora of issues.Ending: Not much to say about the ending, since there is a second season. It leaves off on a high note with mc looking to better himself.Production: Weird ass art style. It's off-putting at times, but weirdly beautiful at times. I personally wasn't a fan but I can see how it's enjoyable. Dialogue was fine, except for the moments when cats or inanimate objects would make random sounds for no reason.Overall, I'd recommend if you're into slow slice of life and complex mc's that have to deal with complex emotions and situations. It's a solid anime that doesn't really do anything great, but is enjoyable if you stick with it. a very complex character that is plagued with a plethora of issues.Ending: Not much to say about the ending, since there is a second season.

What we do have of a story is nothing remarkable. There are huge pacing problems throughout the story. Little of note happens in a majority of the episodes, the series would be much more digestible  if it was more concise, but there is plenty of repeitive melancholic scenes. We get it, Rei is a troubled individual. I expected more drama, but there is also plenty of ""humor"". This is the biggest offender of the story, it simply doesnt work, is super repetitive, and I found it very obnoxious. For a serious anime, I...did not expect obnoxious humor.ArtFairly distincitve style that is recognizable.SoundThe 2nd opening theme is pretty good.

It demonstrates an above average ability to write complex characters and emotional struggles, however uses it so little that it calls into question who the target demographic even is. The comedy seems written for nobody older than 12 but the weight and subject matter of the drama falls much more into the seinen category it is marked as. The music is perfectly adequate for the show and the OPs and EDs are very good, both in tone and overall quality. It also...has Studio Shaft's trademark directing, which is personally jarring with its erratic jumps and framing, but this is far more of a subjective comment. The art style is also unique, but is not inherently bad, and everything is well animated enough that there isn't anything to complain about.Overall, March Comes in Like a Lion is inconsistent in its quality where the good parts are very good, but there are so few of them that by the time they come around, you are so withdrawn from the show that they barely have any impact.Score: 6/10 has Studio Shaft's trademark directing, which is personally jarring with its erratic jumps and framing, but this is far more of a subjective comment.

Yes, this can be realistic, but it is also hopelessly boring and directionless because, as other reviewers have pointed out, nothing is moving forward or changing.The shogi aspect is not all that interesting and felt more like an...afterthought than anything.The side characters are flat - particularly the women, who either selflessly take care of our MC, or are a toxic draining existence (classic female characterizations in any piece of media).The art direction seemed to draw inspiration from the manga art, but has an uncanny valley effect when shown animated. afterthought than anything.The side characters are flat - particularly the women, who either selflessly take care of our MC, or are a toxic draining existence (classic female characterizations in any piece of media).The art direction seemed to draw inspiration from the manga art, but has an uncanny valley effect when shown animated.', '“Sangatsu no lion” is an anime with a focus all over the place. It isn’t really a good “drama” anime neither is it a good “seinen” anime, its shogi aspects is also sometimes rather forgotten and taken aside to have lots of slice of life comedy moments. Especially at the beginning there is probably 20% drama and 80% comedy.  So if you came to see a mature take on a sports anime with drama and a lot of maturity, in the fashion of something like “Ping pong the animation”, “sangatsu no lion” isn’t really the show you were looking for. However it does create...a very light hearted atmosphere and was easy to watch even for someone who didn’t really like the comedy all too much.  And it gets progressively better.The story focuses around a young high school student who became a professional shogi player. He lives alone in his apartment and has, at the start a very mysterious backstory, which is presented to be very tragic and we should feel sorry for him. The story starts of very one sided, with everything happening out of the perspective of the protagonist and many other character come around as rather one-dimensional because we know too little about them. This was fixed later on by adding backstories to side character as well to make them more interesting. There is also a clear distinction between characters, that are always in comedy scenes and character who mostly are involved in the drama part of the show. This approach is better than to just simply include every character in silly comedy to a point where you can’t take anything they do serious anymore (like in FMA brotherhood), but it still raises the question… why include both?I don’t really think that drama and comedy work well together. One of the 2 has to suffer in order for the other one to succeed. This could really be seen in this anime.The drama aspect of the show seemed to be just there to make the protagonist interesting, for me however it didn’t work and I found him rather bland with a backstory similar to so many other. That’s the main reason I really welcomed the later included focus on side character and their relationship to the protagonist.The shogi aspect is merely a tool and not too deeply focused. It took them 8 episodes to introduce the basic rules of the game to the audience, but then again, if the show thinks you just learned about the game it is understandable that it doesn’t go into any deeper analysis into professional shogi games. That’s probably why it was missing completely in this anime. For me this was a bit disappointing to see. The anime also didnt really manage to build up much of a tension with their shogi games (espeically at the start), but it gets better the more episodes you watch.The slice of life aspect seemed to be the most focused one, at least at the start. What they basically wanted to achieve was to take this introverted main character who only focuses on shogi and has a sad past and put him in a goofy environment with 3 sister who mainly function as comedic relieve. The reason for all of this is also very random, which sets it very much apart from everything else that happens in the show. I found none of these comedic relieve characters to be in any way relatable or interesting and the comedy felt very typical and unfunny (with a weird fetish around cats, which also didn’t do it for me). It tries to be self aware with characters constantly referencing how this and that looks like an anime or a manga, but this was just used to create cheap laughs and nothing more.However the whole start is very light hearted and because you still have quite a bit of shogi story aspects is wasn’t too much of a chore to go through to reach the more interesting part of the story.The sound design wasn’t really well done. The voice acting was ordinary, but the soundtrack was really not existent beyond forgettable background songs. There was one fine piano track at some point but it was very quickly forgotten.The art style is very weird. The characters have huge mouths and often large eyes to make them look cute (a bit different from typical anime character eyes) , but they sometimes look like cgi characters. You will get used to the art style and not notice it too much but at first it kinda annoyed me. Backgrounds were nicely drawn and I found it nice that they depicted the real design of the shogi hall building in Tokyo.For all the bad things I had to say about this anime I still have to add that I enjoyed watching it. Its story is engaging and grips you into it. It’s somewhat relatable and in many ways down to earth (at least compared to other anime).

I've seen some tedious ass shows I can get through with maximum binging efficiency, but that genuinely felt like maybe the most excruciatingly painful slog a singular piece of media outside of Evangelion has ever put me through. What is the incentive everyone is drawn in by please do tell me? It's literally a whiny ahh dude moving Shogi pieces for mf 22 eps in between 20 second long drawn out...shots that feel like they are meant to be deep or something. It doesn't even go into Shogi, the one thing that sets it apart from other shows. Like whatsoever! They just play the game.

Because seriously name me 3 even relatively important events within this series. To be honest I struggle to name one. I quite naively smashed through the whole season in hopes there was even potentially some kind of actual character progression or perhaps maybe surely one redeeming event that made everyone rave about it, but it ended literally exactly the same as it began, with what felt like absolutely not a speck at all of substance whatsoever in the middle. (I am aware of the genre that is slice of life btw 🧐🎩) I love deep stuff, honestly I do, but it felt like it was just trying so damn hard to be meaningful with every sentence/shot it delivered, with no reason whatsoever to be doing so at all. Almost exact déjà-vu with Evangelion ngl. With an accompanying equally annoying orchestra of cicadas to boot as the entirety of the wholeass soundtrack. Thankfully I can't quite put MC on the level of Shinji's over-privileged grating, infuriatingly b*tchy unprecedented whininess, but god damn it boi is it close. My hoemies & I have all been through substantially worse on a daily basis i swear that, and in real life the more sobering fact is that you'll be ostracized instantaneously for being anything like these aforementioned genuinely depressing characters. I feel like I'm missing something because all my friends on MAL rate it so highly too. I can say without a doubt top 3 most monotonous troupe ass shows I've ever had the misfortune too come across & its not 3rd.

201,"['When Tensura season 2 was announced last year, I instantly leapt for joy at the opportunity to see some of my favourite LN scenes adapted. I loved the job 8bit did with the first season and was confident that the series was in good hands. Fortunately, I had my faith rewarded with a great first cour.All the things that made tensura a hit when the first season aired are back and even better than before. The comedy, world-building, political drama and strategic planning that separates Tensura from other contemporary isekai are here in spades and make the second season very enjoyable. Like most things, Tensura’s...first cour is not without faults, however.While it was great to be back in Tempest and see some of my favourite scenes animated, too often this season there was poor pacing and anime original time wasting recaps. They really begin to be noticeable around halfway through the cour. Several scenes really could have been condensed into a few minutes rather than taking up half of an episode. When you get to these points it’ll be pretty apparent what I’m talking about, and unfortunately they prevent me from giving the season the highest possible grade. Thankfully, 8bit did such a stellar job on the final 3 episodes that it’s almost enough to make you forget about those issues.Despite the pacing issues that the middle of the cour had, I was extremely pleased with the overall job that 8bit did in these first 12 episodes and I’m looking forward to what will be an even better 2nd cour, based on the volumes I assume will be adapted. If you were a fan of season 1 of Tensura, it goes without saying you’ll want to check this out. Tensura S2 Pt.1 gets 9 sages out of 10. first cour is not without faults, however.While it was great to be back in Tempest and see some of my favourite scenes animated, too often this season there was poor pacing and anime original time wasting recaps.

Tensura S2 Pt.1 gets 9 sages out of 10.', '[Overall score: 6.90]This season is a mix of half disappointment with half satisfaction. Half disappointment because the pacing has been absolutely terrible for more than half of the episodes, and half satisfaction because they redeemed everything with the last 2 episodes.5 out of 12 episodes are Rimuru doing Rimuru things, just like in the previous season. And then, the story suddenly takes a 180. Half of the episodes are just boring. It’s so boring that the first few episodes feel like fillers. We should’ve gotten the entire Rimuru becoming Demon Lord thing way before, yet it took this many episodes. If you’ve read the manga...or the light novel, the pacing will be a huge issue to you. The biggest problem with this season is the terrible pacing. I don’t know what went wrong, but the pacing was so horrible, that even though I’ve read the manga once, I went back to re-read it.Shion was killed in the process of all the chaos, but of course, she wasn’t killed because there ‘happens’ to be some way to bring her back. I think this death was completely meaningless if they were gonna be alive again through some kind of magic.And of course, for some unknown reason, the anime decided to make Rimuru less badass than he was in the manga.“In other words, because you valued your own pitiful life more you’ve decided to damn my people.”This was the line that made me think that Rimuru finally had a change in his attitude, which of course, he didn’t. Because first, it was left out in the anime, second, moments after that he forgives Myulan. I don’t know why 8bit decided to do this, but it definitely wasn’t the right call.And don’t you think that it’s a bit ironic, how Rimuru is apparently ‘merciless’ towards the soldier who marched on Tempest, but then again, he simply forgives Myulan. The soldiers were in worse position than Myulan, if they didn’t follow orders, their family back home might’ve been killed. Some of them weren’t even involved in the killing of Shion and others, some of them were simply following orders. But of course, Rimuru is allowed to mercilessly kill all of them. Why? Because they aren’t cute anime girls. Why did Rimuru forgive Myulan so easily, without literally ANY FORM of punishment? Well, because she’s a cute anime girl. Isn’t it rule no. 1 to never hurt a cute anime girl no matter what kind of evil shit they do?And then the author tries to justify this shit cause by saying that he forgave Myulan because he needed Youm’s cooperation. It’s honestly such a laughable reason, I always get a big laugh when people try to defend Myulan or Rimuru for forgiving Myulan. Who cares about Youm? Who cares about Falmuth? Rimuru can be friends with Dwargon and all other countries while not giving a shit about what happens to Falmuth, but no, for some reason he needed Youm.Even Gabiru is more useful and important that Youm. This guy literally fell in love with a woman he barely knows, after staying with her for a few days. He loves her so much that he can even go against his master that he knew longer than he knew Myulan. He loves her so much that he can lay down his life for her or atone for sins she committed. It’s almost like he’s never been with another woman. And yes there’s some other beastman which I don’t give a shit about, that also likes her and will lay down his life for her. So she got 2 people in her harem within a few god damn days.Rimuru is the protagonist and the sole MC of this anime, yet side characters get more screen time than him. Good side characters like Benimaru and Souei barely get any screen time, side characters like Gabiru and Geld get too much screen time. The characters are a mess. The newly introduced ones are even worse, especially the antagonists. The antagonists are laughable. Every bad guy has a motivation or a goal, but these new antagonists don’t have any of them. The bad guys are terribly written, it came off as the author miserably trying to portray these bad guys as truly evil and annoying. Did the author succeed? Only partially. They are still horribly written. The king of Falmuth is a king, but he’s probably the most braindead character in the entire series. Almost makes you wonder, how did he become a king of an entire country?The animation is an upgrade since last season. It’s probably the most impressive thing about this season. But yeah, it’s okay, it’s nothing impeccable or remarkable enough to talk about.The soundtracks may be the second most redeeming thing, some time they decide to put some cool soundtrack over fights, which I can appreciate. Other than that, the opening is absolutely remarkable. It perfectly fits Tensura’s theme.I admit, this season has been lackluster and final 2 episodes could only do much to save the entire anime. Every other episode, other than the final 2 episodes, felt unimaginably boring. There were less fights last season yet it managed to stay more interesting than this season. Since I’ve read ahead into the source, does it get any better? Yes, probably..? I can only hope that the next season won’t have this pacing.Do we have something to look forward to? Yes, and that is Tensura Nikki. Unlike this season, Tensura Nikki will stay true to it’s core. If you want a wholesome, light-hearted side story, this is god damn it. Dare I say, it’s even better than the original. It feels less like a filler than the first 4 episodes of this season.As for this season, since it still has those key elements of Tensura and also a proper plot that works.. somehow.. a 6.90 will be the most accurate rating I can give to this. or the light novel, the pacing will be a huge issue to you.

And so because of that, season 2 is still a 10/10 in story. It's a continuation and there hasn't been any new time skips and so, it's easy to pick up from the first season which I'm really relieved about.Only small drawback was episode 1 when it had a small recap of around 2 mins,...which you can just skip. And that isn't enough to lower the score from a 10.Art: 9/10The characters and the feel is the same. I'm really, really happy about that. It also looks really good. I don't really know what else to say other than it's still as amazing as it was in season 1.Sound: 9/10The voice acting and sound effect are absolutely amazing, as it should be. Of course I don't really know what else to say in this category since as long as the story is good, I usually forget about stuff like sound and art, or at least don't pay as much attention.Characters: 10/10The characters are entertaining and funny the same way they were in season 1. Also I heard that the upcoming arc will be absolutely amazing and show the main characters from a different view point which I'm really excited about.Enjoyment: 10/10The humor is the same. Which I love. It has one of the funniest scenes in all of anime, especially in episode 3. But besides that, the characters, the world and everything else is just fun to watch and see how they evolve.Overall: 10/10Basically, it has almost 0 drawbacks, and even if it has some, they are way too minor for me not to give this a 10/10. So far, it's one of the best and most entertaining isekai out there. which you can just skip. And that isn't enough to lower the score from a 10.Art: 9/10The characters and the feel is the same.

I talked to some people on Discord  why they liked it and they said, ""I like the slice of Life elements in the anime"" and ""the anime is funny"". And still I dont understand, yeah I could see the slice of life elements but people this season die right and left and show blood because the anime is trying to be ""DARK"" but still the style is to childish for the theme of the anime itself. I dont like this anime maybe becuase it isnt for me or the...show is just objectivley bad just like my English.Story-The story of this season expands the worldbuilding and  introduces new races and characters and also the racism against humans. As I already said in the beginning of my review that people are dying right and left and its up to our Main Protaganist to revive pointless chracters but hey, he has to do it because the story tells him to. Look, we dont get a sad but good anime like AOT where a lot of characters die and where you are like damn, they will never come back but in this anime its like ""Oh no, this chracter died, anyways"". Fucking stupid. And its never established why humans are racist against monsters, is it becuase they are ""Different"". How the hell do humans have this much power, they arent as strong as orcs, they cant live as long as elves and they dont have that good of a smell compared to beastman but still they have this much control. Couldnt the anime focus more on that instead of our Protaganist killing a bunch of meatballs. An other problem with this anime is that the Protaganist is just to OP. The tension is just removed and I just dont care about any fight in this show because I know how its going to turn out. Also I dont understand the side-quest because those are fucking lame but hey, we got to have them or else we will lost our fans. And what the hell is up that the Mc is teaching a bunch of kids how to use magic, never understood that part but you know what. I dont care really, becuase of how bad the story itself already is. Also, the pace is insulting for how fast it goes but thats not that big of a complaint.Characters-Characters in the show belong in 3 catagories and none of them are well written or funny in any kind of way so lets talk about that.1. Comedic characters2. Fanservice3. Pointless side characters1. Man oh man, why are there so many characters in this catagory. Like 40% of all chracters of this show belonged here. In the entire 12 episodes of season 2 I didnt laugh or smile a bit. I was like, ""can this already end please"". For some reason the comendy is just bad in this show, characters make funny faces and annoying sounds and think I am supposed to laugh, the jokes get repetitve and just badly written just like the characters them self. And lets go back to an other point. Because so many characters in this show are ""Comedic"" is even trying to make the anime ""DARK"" an extremly stupid idea. For other anime like AOT its justified because there only like a few characters and they are also well written. So, please stop doing this to me.2. I dont even have to explain myself do I. Female chracters with boobs of the size of her head is already enough to make me hate an anime. Exept ofcourse if she is well written, well saidly no. None of the Fanservice characters are well written. Its just becuase the author didnt have a plan what to do in certian scenes so he was like ""hmmm, boobs are a good idea"" please, give me a break. I think like 15% belongs to this catagory. But still, fuck that trope man.3. Well, I dont understand but I cant even name a single character in the show besides the main character. This just shows that this show is just filled with pointless side characters that have something to say because of bullshit. I dont know why and how this happend but they could have at least some well written characters right? Sigh, I guess not. Verry sad indeed. And I dont know if I just dont pay a lot of attention or if the show is just bad.I forgot to talk about the protaganist but he is the best witten character in this show but that isnt really a plot-twist because he has the most screen time. I liked him more in his slime form then in his loli form because that is such obvious fan service. Not the worst Isekai Protaganist but not the best either.Sound-I tought it sounded fine, nothing special.Art-As I already said, I think that the art style is not that bad but if the show tries to have some darker elements, the art doesnt work well with that but the art isnt really that insulting like devilman crybaby,""Cough,Cough""Enjoyment-I dont know how I feel about the show but maybe its just me. Maybe this isnt my cup of tea and maybe it isnt even meant for me but I just didnt enjoy it alot. Yeah some of the fight were verry well animated stil, I knew how the fight was going to end and that kinda ruined it for me. Also as I said, the characters themself are just bad and dont add anything to the story or the anime. This wasnt a fun experience and thats sad becuase I expected more.Overall-You know how I feel about this anime. In my opinion it isnt a good anime and is as good as the average Isekai. It tried to be something diffent and they did it kinda, but still I see this anime as not good and I hope the next season isway better and fixes some of the flaws this season has. show is just objectivley bad just like my English.Story-The story of this season expands the worldbuilding and  introduces new races and characters and also the racism against humans.

Season 1 ended with some loose ends but was very satisfying none the less and I wouldn't expect anything different from season 2 keeping its enjoyable aspects all throughout the anime.I was able to enjoy this...anime VERY MUCH because of the wacky situations our main character gets into and the not so much wacky situations about the typical demon lord being the enemy. If you like casual anime with aspects of comedy, yet want some action, this anime is perfect for you!Overall, this anime is great and I personally love it.

It’s about a character that got reincarnated as a slime and now lives in this other world as one. We’ve all come to know Rimuru now as a charismatic leader with real life knowledge and skills imperative to his people. He has earned the praise and trust of his friends and comrades. From season 2, we witness Rimuru’s development as a character as the slime that got reincarnated.While this season doesn’t start off with epic battles, it does show that Rimuru can solve problems with diplomatic skills. After...all, action and violence doesn’t always decide victories. Through negotiation, we hear Rimuru’s wise words and show that when needed, he can be very clever with his way of words. The Kingdom of Eurazania in particular has a leader who isn’t exactly very softhearted. Applying his skills and experience, there’s no doubt that Rimuru carries his role as an exceptional leader. Thanks to their negotiation, not only are battles avoided but they’re able to gain access to new technologies and trust with another kingdom. It’s the type of sweet victory with no casualties or regret.Because of Rimuru’s abilities and great potential, it would seem that not every country see him as a dependable ally. The Kingdom of Falmuth in particular realizes that Rimuru may be a great threat and doesn’t take long for them to take action. And honestly, trying to invade a nation immediately sparks a war. Should we be surprised? In reality, no. However, it’s honestly depressing that peace can’t be maintained in their world and no one is truly safe from certain kingdoms from fulfilling their own interests. Tempest’s people learn first-hand what it means when it means to be invaded with innocent lives at stake. It’s a brutal reality to accept but when war happens, that means causalities. To make matters worse, Rimuru has to be concerned about his own life when he encounters Hinata Sakaguchi, a skilled warrior with the intention to assassinate him. In one of the series’ pivotal battles, we see Rimuru’s combat skills again this season. And to no one’s surprise, he hasn’t lost a touch.Unfortunately for the citizens of Tempest, without Rimuru to lead them at the time of the attack, the city took a heavy hit under the siege. It’s hard to say this but if you’re a fan of Shion in this franchise, then I’ve got some depressing news to bear. She’s not just the only causality of the invasion either. The invasion itself also breeds fear, hatred, and an emotional anger that I’ve never seen in the likes of Rimuru before. Even as a slime, his behavior mirrors those of a human and it’s quite realistic on many levels. Luckily, Rimuru’s strategic mind always look for solutions to problems and we find out that what’s dead may not need to stay dead. In addition, this season reveals more about Rimuru’s past life and what he was like as an actual person. The deep dive into Rimuru’s character remains important as he works tirelessly to lead his people. The planning of his strategy to protect Tempest and also defeat the invaders is an example of his growth as a character.How much should you ultimately respect Rimuru comes down to your impression of his actions. At this point, I think it’s safe to say that Rimuru is much more than skilled fighter or leader. His influence has become so great that other kingdoms knows his potential. There’s even assassinations put on his head as an example of Rimuru’s testament in power. To further his potential, Rimuru even goes to lengths to bring back the dead, something that goes against the natural law of order in the real world. Whether you agree with Rimuru’s action can be debatable. However, we must acknowledge his feats and achievements in this season.Action does indeed speak louder than words. Rimuru’s leader for the Tempest people knows no bounds when it comes to his accomplishments. Watching this season shows that Rimuru is more about just winning battles. He’s there to win the trust of the people and during difficult times, he goes to unimaginative lengths to unite them. That’s what I call the suitable leader and honestly, I don’t think there’s anyone in the show that’s more suitable to represent Tempest. As dramatic as this season sounds though, there are still moments of humor from Rimuru’s perspective. He hasn’t lost his softhearted personality either and is still open to making jokes. That being said, season 2 is a blessing to us, especially if you’ve waited for over a year. There’s not much waiting left for part 2 either because we’re getting more Tensei Slime goodness this Summer. all, action and violence doesn’t always decide victories. Through negotiation, we hear Rimuru’s wise words and show that when needed, he can be very clever with his way of words.

I love this anime until I finish the whole series of stories in the manga. Also i always watch every episode on this anime.

I really loved the first season. I waited three whole years for this season to air. Hopefully this season was worth waiting three years. You can say this season has all the elements the first season had plus some more new elements that would make you jump off your seats.::Minor SpoilersStory 9/10: This season is a bit more intense than the previous season which was a bit more happy-go-lucky. In the previous season Rimuru Builds a Nation now he tries to protect it from other Nations.Each episode left...me so hyped. This season has a pinch of Romance too (I am not a big fan of it though). You can understand when you watch it.Art 9/10: There art is so beautiful. I really love the art of the setting of the anime. The way trees are colored are so beautiful too.

But, now, my hope is all shattered. This season has the laziest writing. They are constantly talking. Too much attention on the unnecessary problems and stupidly long planning. It wants us to believe something is happening but in reality, nothing interesting is happening. The animation is still good but the story falls flat so hard. So, 5 is a fit.This is so frustrating. I am really looking forward to a good season but it seems it won't happen. "", 'well after watching 6 episodes I got to know that the first four episodes are for story development. ***For the haters: who thinks that the four episodes are filler episodes, I would like to gladly say that THIS IS NOT A RE:ZERO where for every episode there\'s a twist. This is TenSura and it will be TenSura.Let\'s talk slowly now:1. ""Rimuru\'s Busy Life"" :This one explains us about the recap (just for some 5-8 min) of Season 1 and the developing relationship with Animal Kingdom. Well this is a good episode as there is some recap and talking about the post-Charybdis war. Well the...behaviour of that white tiger girl pissed me too. So I would like to give 3.5/52. ""Trade with the Animal Kingdom"" :Yep the fight between Shion and the white tiger. I thought that there will be a good beating for her. But Albis stops it and says that it\'s just testing them. Well if that become a big fight and shine killed that tiger there might be a war with Animal kingdom. Hopefully the peace restored and now everyone\'s is enjoying the days in Capital city Rimiru. But here comes the twist why did the king Gazel invited rimiru. Hope I will see it the next week. A new character called Mjurran is introduced and she works for Clayman. Let\'s see what happens. I would like to give 3.5/53. ""Paradise, Once More"" :Here comes the most funniest episode of Season 2 part 1. Well we know those ELF ladies actually from s1. Now Rimiru and the brothers along with Gobta will enjoy there. But the most wicked thing is when shona finds about this.... I hope if I were reincarnated into a slime better I don\'t piss her off. The Clayman\'s subordinate Mjurran power is shown. She\'s powerful and she defeat Youm with a single spell. She joined him. Hmm a betrayal concept? My rating: 3.75/54. ""The Scheming Kingdom of Falmuth"" :Ya in this one the war arc starts right now. Mjurran came to tempest and visited Shion and Shuna along with Youm. Gobta and You fight with OLD GEEZER is pretty funny. Some romantic interests are developed. Introduction of  FALMUTH kingdom is done and their plan. Three otherworlders?? Not same as rimiru, I mean they are summoned right? Let\'s see how the trio gonna destroy the kingdom. (Basically I was pissed off, for insulting rimiru). Millim\'s looking mad, what might have happened? I like to give 4/55. ""Prelude to the Disaster""Well in this episode  I missed Rimiru but I think this episode is the core of the arc. It start\'s with a pure breeze of Lovey-dovey moments between Youm and Mjurran. Well Clayman finds about it and grants her a wish to save him if she successfully deployed a anti magic field. Well the beastman Grucius find she\'s the subordinate of Clayman. Youm hears this and confess his love. Pretty cute right? But still she deployed the anti magic barrier. On the other side Millim declares war and The three otherworlders are provoking Shuna and Shion. A Holy barrier is deployed and weakens the monster. A major development in the story. My rating 4.5/56. ""The Beauty Makes Her Move""Hmm I can\'t say what\'s going on but I feel so sad. Like I\'m falling down in a black hole. This episode makes me to feel like that. Hinata vs Rimiru is seen, damn Hinata she\'s not listening to him and attacks him. Meanwhile in Tempest, everyone is attacked. Gobta and Hakurou gets a slash and shion gets an attack too. The tempest is plunged into chaos. At the end rimiru is stabbed by Hinata...... Damn I can\'t write this!!! My rating : 5/57. ""Despair""So here comes the end of battle between Hinata and Rimiru. Well it comes to rimiru\'s win by escaping cleverly. But the sound effects are fu**ing awesome. Tempest is totally covered in blood and the villagers trying to hide it from rimiru but he got to know when Mjurran shows him. That was the first time I saw rimiru\'s eyes were scary. But great sage sort it out. At the end rimiru got to know that Clayman\'s is pulling strings. My rating: 4/5(Hey you damn director, increase the length of the episodes. those 23 minutes were like 5 min to us!!)8. ""Hope""Well I think if any slime fan didn\'t cry in the episode starting... they are not....This is a pretty good episode. Well it\'s starts with Mjurran, and how did she attack and everything. But the episode turns pretty intense at Shion\'s death. Well I cried today at this scene even though I know what\'s going to happen. But Eren.. (FROM S1) she reaches the tempest and tell her about a fairy tail about reviving from death and OUR BADASS RIMIRU WANTS TO BECOME A DEMON LORD NOW!!! pretty interesting right? also he saves Mjurran and request YOUM TO BECOME A KING OF FALMUTH!!! Let\'s see what happens next..  Rating: 4.5/59. ""With everything""I can say that this episode will be a low scorer than the remaining episodes for this season. In this episode there\'s a recap what happened till now for the first half. YOU\'LL FIND IT BORING FOR SURE!!But don\'t worry. The next part will be a slight okay except the last 5 min. They will be planning to deal with the Farmus kingdom and devise a strategy. AND THAT 5MIN END IS RoCkINg. It\'s like Calm before the storm. Overall the episode is not upto hype. But it\'s okay to watch. Rating 2.5/510. ""Megiddo""If you watch this episode then I don\'t need to tell you how\'s it. A REVENGE-TIC Episode for the first time in my life. The animation was crazy and the sound... Guys we need to give him an award for it. Hakuro vs the other worlder , I got what I want. I don\'t want to extend the review.Because it will be a spoiler... But today\'s episode is LIT!!! Rating: 5/511. "" Birth of Demon lord""See you on March 16th behaviour of that white tiger girl pissed me too. So I would like to give 3.5/52. ""Trade with the Animal Kingdom"" :Yep the fight between Shion and the white tiger. I thought that there will be a good beating for her. But Albis stops it and says that it\'s just testing them.

But today\'s episode is LIT!!! Rating: 5/511. "" Birth of Demon lord""See you on March 16th', 'I went in expecting the worst, and it did not disappoint. As with the first anime, it is nothing but a power-tripping main character defeating your generic super evil villain which is designed solely for the viewers to hate. There is nothing of value to this anime, it only exists for the viewers to live vicariously through the main character.The characters are bland and shallow; there’s your generic female sidekick, another girl whose only personality is her breasts, and two generic males who we know nothing about. They all exhibit sameface; the only way we can distinguish them is the gaudy color palette used on...each character: the main character is a bright blue, the main female sidekick is pink, the other girl is purple, and one male is red. They have no backstory; there is no emotional attachment to these characters, and as such, they can only be distinguished by their hair color.The animation is similarly of low quality. In one scene, they allocate two frames for a tiger-drawn carriage. Their paws just go up in one frame, and down in the other. In other scenes, you have your typical still frame fights, and panning shots of similarly still frames. I\'d wager that this video https://youtu.be/240Vq6tIxio has more keyframes than the two seasons combined. It\'s also obvious that the penultimate fight scene involving the main character is lazily animated. The main character\'s attack seems to have been designed to avoid having to animate complex moves.Let\'s talk about the story. It\'s your typical overpowered character power-tripping fantasy. We meet a few villains; most of them are framed as edgy, pure evil, with no complex personality; just someone that presents a barrier for the main character that everyone roots for to be crushed. The main character first faces off against a villain who overpowers him. He retreats and as he lost his sidekick, he suddenly gains more power, to the point where he can just massacre the tribe that said villain belonged to. After the initial confrontation with the main villain, she is nowhere to be found. Her entire tribe is massacred with her nowhere to be seen. She was only there to provide a minuscule bit of tension and nothing else.Obviously, the conflict within the anime is weak, as the main character is overpowered. When some of the supporting characters died, there might’ve been hope for some tragedy in this story, to provide a little depth. But as expected, their deaths were not permanent. Through some plot device, the main character\'s sidekicks are magically revived, and all goes back to normal. To some extent, it plays out much like a sitcom. The laziest plot device of this entire series is ""the sage"", a voice in the main character\'s head that is nothing more than an exposition machine. It powers the main character and grants him increasingly powerful abilities, in addition to spitting out verbatim exposition, with no attempt to integrate it into the story. The anime doesn\'t even attempt to animate an actual character to deliver said exposition; it\'s either a voice in the main character\'s head or a glowing sphere. He doesn\'t make much of an effort to acquire his superpowers either; they are just granted to him by the sage when the plot deems it necessary.All in all, this anime was nothing but another generic isekai designed for the viewers to live vicariously through the main character. It has no value; it\'s just another cash cow in a sea of mediocre anime. It\'s the poster child for modern anime: poor plot, terrible animation, bland characters, fanservice, nothing but pandering to a wide audience. each character: the main character is a bright blue, the main female sidekick is pink, the other girl is purple, and one male is red.

And yet there were a lot of people at Anime-Planet who kept commenting about how wrong it was, because I didn’t read the manga. Why should I? It was an overview about the first season of the anime, not a much later arc in the manga. Do I really have to point out how stupid this is? How would you feel if I was going on every person’s review of the first season of The Promised Neverland and I was telling them they are wrong in...everything they wrote, because the manga is different later on? It’s that sort of mental gymnastics that can make an average person to give up on reviewing, because he wouldn’t be able to tolerate the insanity of the fanboys. Luckily for you, I am not average and I watched the next season where the big twist happened. And no, it doesn’t contradict anything I said about the first season, because it’s a different season and it’s definitely not an ongoing manga. Holy crap, anime community, why do you suck so much?Anyways, I had said about the first season that it was a bland power fantasy about an overpowered protagonist who solves all the problems in a breezy, wholesome way. He does the same for half of the second season as well, until a bad guy cancels his hax powers with a barrier and a lot of his allies get killed by an invading army. Things are no longer hunky dory, he has to take his position more seriously, he has to realize he can’t solve every problem with hax powers, and he has to accept that he can’t save everybody all the time. This sounds like a great twist and all the author had to do was to not go back to the bland power fantasy.…And then he goes back to the power fantasy and completely destroys the twist, thus making the show even worse than it was before, because now it comes off as pretentious. The only thing the protagonist had to do is to get even more overpowered. The invading army that seemed unstoppable was easily annihilated by his hax powers, and all his allies who died were magically brought back to life. Hooray for taking things more seriously where there is still no tension or negative consequences. The fanboys of this bland power fantasy will insist it’s deep because he was forced to kill a lot of people and to be more serious hereon, but who gives a damn when he can easily solve every problem with his completely broken powers and to dragonball back to life anyone who died? Oh, as for the part where he is forced to kill people in order to protect his friends, did everyone forget the hundreds of creatures he has killed already, including the father of the wolf who carries him around like a pet?Therefore nothing really changed and all those idiots who were making fun of me for not reading the manga when I was reviewing the anime were full of crap. The show is still lazily written, it’s nothing special, it’s a run of the mill trash isekai for people who hate their lives and want to escape in a videogame where they are amazing and solve all their problems without having to actually work hard or sacrifice a thing. For a much better version of the same (supposed) twist, read my book. I also have a guy who becomes a leader and who doesn’t have hax superpowers for wiping out entire armies, nor he can resurrect anyone he likes, whenever he feels like it. It’s what the author of the Slime isekai can only dream of writing, because all he cares about is creating a bland power fantasy for gamer dorks, who will rush to defend his trash by making fun of anyone who didn’t like the anime, because he didn’t read the manga. Defenders of this trash, you all suck and I am both a better analyst of anime and a writer of better fiction. everything they wrote, because the manga is different later on? It’s that sort of mental gymnastics that can make an average person to give up on reviewing, because he wouldn’t be able to tolerate the insanity of the fanboys. Luckily for you, I am not average and I watched the next season where the big twist happened. And no, it doesn’t contradict anything I said about the first season, because it’s a different season and it’s definitely not an ongoing manga. Holy crap, anime community, why do you suck so much?Anyways, I had said about the first season that it was a bland power fantasy about an overpowered protagonist who solves all the problems in a breezy, wholesome way. He does the same for half of the second season as well, until a bad guy cancels his hax powers with a barrier and a lot of his allies get killed by an invading army. Things are no longer hunky dory, he has to take his position more seriously, he has to realize he can’t solve every problem with hax powers, and he has to accept that he can’t save everybody all the time. This sounds like a great twist and all the author had to do was to not go back to the bland power fantasy.…And then he goes back to the power fantasy and completely destroys the twist, thus making the show even worse than it was before, because now it comes off as pretentious. The only thing the protagonist had to do is to get even more overpowered. The invading army that seemed unstoppable was easily annihilated by his hax powers, and all his allies who died were magically brought back to life. Hooray for taking things more seriously where there is still no tension or negative consequences. The fanboys of this bland power fantasy will insist it’s deep because he was forced to kill a lot of people and to be more serious hereon, but who gives a damn when he can easily solve every problem with his completely broken powers and to dragonball back to life anyone who died? Oh, as for the part where he is forced to kill people in order to protect his friends, did everyone forget the hundreds of creatures he has killed already, including the father of the wolf who carries him around like a pet?Therefore nothing really changed and all those idiots who were making fun of me for not reading the manga when I was reviewing the anime were full of crap. The show is still lazily written, it’s nothing special, it’s a run of the mill trash isekai for people who hate their lives and want to escape in a videogame where they are amazing and solve all their problems without having to actually work hard or sacrifice a thing. For a much better version of the same (supposed) twist, read my book. I also have a guy who becomes a leader and who doesn’t have hax superpowers for wiping out entire armies, nor he can resurrect anyone he likes, whenever he feels like it. It’s what the author of the Slime isekai can only dream of writing, because all he cares about is creating a bland power fantasy for gamer dorks, who will rush to defend his trash by making fun of anyone who didn’t like the anime, because he didn’t read the manga. Defenders of this trash, you all suck and I am both a better analyst of anime and a writer of better fiction.', '(Dug up from manga and LN sources a bit)Ever think that you\'re getting tired of the average isekai trash with a plot where there isn\'t an end premise? With average characters getting OP powers? No character development? An Average fantasy world with average magic? With little to none enjoyment at all?Well you\'ve come to the right show, Slime gives you:Average isekai plot with an end premise. A character getting OP powers however he isn\'t the only one OP (more of that later on in the story). Amazing world building with character development. Easy to understand fantasy world with intresting magic system. Lastly, it is...filled with pure fun.Simply put, it isn\'t the perfect show it had it\'s up and downs with 8bit presenting it, however that doesn\'t make it another ""average isekai trash."" metaphorically speaking it\'s an ""Above average isekai."" In fact, i believe it doesn\'t stand out at all when compared to something like Overlord or Re:Zero. However that doesn\'t mean there isn\'t any enjoyment at all.It\'s not as perverted as Mushoku tensei, It isn\'t a snoozefest like Cheat magician, There isn\'t a gimmick/ twists like Re:zero. It\'s not as stupidly overpowered like Demon king academy. It doesn\'t try to disguise itself making us think that it isn\'t an average isekai, no. It\'s the ""ideal"" isekai. It has every trope in every average isekai we\'ve seen but does those tropes in a way that doesn\'t make it a snoozefest.Personally i would rate 10/10, but without biased opinions it\'s a hard 8.3-8.5. It\'s one of the shows that from the outside looks like your average Ugly Bastard. But in reality it\'s a diabetic enthusing vanilla filled with pure fun.Simply put, it isn\'t the perfect show it had it\'s up and downs with 8bit presenting it, however that doesn\'t make it another ""average isekai trash."" metaphorically speaking it\'s an ""Above average isekai.""

It would involve negotiating property, spheres of influence, and moral ideals with other races. If that conflict sounds interesting, you\'ll be disappointed. The story sweeps the perceived plot under the rug in favor of a one-sided war and meaningless dialogue. I would have preferred to see Rimuru gain equality for his people diplomatically as they hinted at. Instead, we got a formulaic fantasy war that became entirely pointless in the end. If you liked...the first season of That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime but wished it had been edgier, you might enjoy this.Despite the copious amount of dialogue, Slime is incapable of intelligently resolving conflicts without having characters fight. Aside from slightly better than average animation quality, Slime is similar to every other action isekai clogging up the seasonal anime roster. You could argue it\'s because the main character began a civilization, but it\'s surface level. Why is Rimuru\'s society so perfect? Why doesn\'t it have any problems? It\'s because he is perfect in the eyes of the author and the audience. He\'s written for you to project yourself onto a seemingly flawless hero. The weirdest part is, no one questions him. He\'s always right. The show had chances to prove it is mature by letting its dead characters stay dead. But death is never permanent unless it\'s the bad guys.The first half of the season spins its wheels like a carriage slowly approaching a cohesive story. Rimuru and co. fool around, and it is more or less what you\'d expect from an OVA of a typical anime. Plenty of fanservice to go around, the same lame jokes, no character development. The only \'story\' in this section is exposition dumps. Through conversations with aristocrats, Rimuru makes trade agreements for supplies. Their negotiations involve drinking alcohol, then immediately agreeing with each other. It’s boring. Rimuru still goes off on tangents explaining his next plans as an almighty leader to no one in particular. His dialogue continues to feel like meaningless word salad ripped directly from the light novel. He narrates to the audience as if the author has never heard of the term ""show-don\'t-tell.” The writers were somewhat aware of how dull the script was because Rimuru has a few unfunny quips to break up the monotony. The English dub makes more attempts at humor. That\'s even less funny than the Japanese jokes. His jokes read like they were written by middle-aged investors rather than someone with a sense of humor. The rest of the cast doesn\'t add to the humdrum script—or much of anything.There is no reason to care about any of these characters. Rinmuru\'s followers have individual drama, but it ultimately has no bearing on the story. Despite being nice to everyone, Rimuru doesn\'t seem to care when his people die—and I can\'t blame him. The side cast simply vomits exposition to progress the plot, and all of it is presented as slide shows that drag on for minutes on end: similar to The Promised Neverland S2.Compare these characters to the cast of Re:Zero; there are fewer of them, colorful personalities, they each get backstories, and the hero needs their help to succeed. Most of all, they have enough depth to intrigue us. In Slime Time, Rimuru can do everything on his own. There are unnecessary characters, and the relevant ones barely get characterization. Even the most present side characters are fanservice vehicles. Like Shion, AKA boob woman. In case you forgot her (I don\'t blame you), she is Rimuru\'s secretary who doesn\'t do anything except flop around and throw tantrums like a newborn child. Shion is your typical power fantasy waifu bait—she\'s inexplicably in love with the main character. Despite having powers, she constantly needs help, not just physically, but Rimuru needs to pacify her when she behaves like a child. It was almost laughable when we found out she was unceremoniously killed off-screen, along with scores of Rimuru\'s citizens. It was glaringly obvious they\'d be resurrected by the all-powerful Rimuru. At least that annoying scantily-clad loli was absent this season.The most memorable subplot told a sappy love story between two irrelevant characters. Their relationship progressed too fast even to care. Still, it was an attempt. The woman was a cliche damsel in distress; despite having powers (like Shion), she\'s incapable of doing anything independently. Hilariously, she even gets a powerup when her boyfriend hugs her. Unfortunately, the couple became little more than Rimuru\'s toys. In the eighth episode, Rimuru brutally murdered her. He declared, ""You need to die,"" with no explanation, then killed her in front of her lover. They embrace melancholically, he screams, she dies. Shortly after that, he reveals he had to rip out her heart and replace it with a new one to prevent the demon lord from controlling her. It\'s pretty convoluted, but what confused me the most is how unnecessary it was. Rimuru could\'ve easily done the replacement quickly, in private, or at least warned her boyfriend first. But no, this is Slime Time. Rimuru plays with their lives and our emotions for artificial drama. This scene is a microcosm of the show\'s biggest problem: The sad moments are inevitable and blatantly mapped out. If a villain dies, they stay dead, but the good guys rarely die permanently. I\'ve seen people defend this lack of stakes by saying, ""It\'s a comedy show. Of course, they come back to life."" But why kill the characters, to begin with? There\'s nothing funny about it unless you find ridiculously predictable writing hilarious.Warning: Discussion of sexual assault below.At around the halfway point, the most contrived conflict in all of Slime Time began. One of Rimuru\'s civilians, a goblin kid, gets falsely accused of sexually assaulting a girl—and that\'s how the war ignites. Although the second season\'s political backdrop is one of uncertainty, it is not why the war began. Rimuru and his followers want things to change, namely integrating his mixed-race society with the homogeneous human civilization. The church represents the humans, who want society to regress—to achieve this, they endeavor to genocide all monsters. Rimuru\'s solution to the war is to win the war in five minutes (even those who surrender) and colonize their land. I cannot root for a protagonist who willingly kills people who surrender. That\'s a war crime in our world. Though I suppose that makes Rimuru no different than the average politician in the US. He\'s like the US president of the isekai genre.To tell you the truth, none of this intriguing political tension began the war—just comically evil villains who stirred drama for the sake of it. The girl who accused the goblin smirked menacingly when all the townspeople believed her immediately. It\'s lazy writing, at best. At worst, it shows the writer is out of touch with reality; women rarely falsely accuse men. Portraying these kinds of shallow conflicts makes women who speak up about sexual harassment only adds to the stigma that they deserve to be ashamed and discredited. If you\'re familiar with these kinds of controversies, you\'ll know the anime community harbors an inordinate amount of people who harass the victims. I should\'ve known Slime wasn\'t above using these tinker-toy Shield Hero plot devices.One of the girl\'s partners, a human with dark hair and a hoodie, is a 1-dimensional pervert—no different from Sword Art Online\'s antagonists. He objectifies Rinmuru\'s female companions by saying, ""I\'ll make her my slave. I\'ll torture her until she cries and begs for forgiveness."" Then when he fights Shion, he makes her collapse. He smirks creepily, and the camera is below her boobs. It\'s trying to make the threat of sexual assault titillating. This hentai-tier screenwriting does nothing but pander to the lowest common denominator.The accusation leads to an all-out war fueled by racism towards the goblins. When Rinmuru sees the aftermath, he realizes there are consequences to his actions: Humans kill and injure his orc followers because of prejudice towards monsters. Long ago, he told them never to belittle other races, making them too trusting of bigots. What is the message? Racism is inevitable even if you attempt to be amicable. The problem with portraying racism in a fantasy setting is, creatures like goblins and orcs are fundamentally different beings (and predisposed to violence). There\'s no comparison to the real world.On the production side, there\'s a noticeable decline in quality: animation shortcuts, dull fight scenes, simplified character designs. There were times it looked like they used background art assets from roadblocks. Stiff CGI character models were placed right in front of the camera—it\'s like they didn\'t even care if we noticed it. The excessive still-images extended dialogue scenes, which likely caused some of the \'tell-don\'t-show\' problems. Montages, telling, not showing. Too many recaps every episode—there was a maximum of three minutes of recap in episode nine. Even if you were a fan of the first season, you would have trouble not noticing the blatant production problems in this one. At the very least, the opening and ending tracks are unmatched as usual.Part 1 of season 2 was a waste. Rimuru gained yet another powerup with little to no effort, turning himself into a God. In Part 2, he will embark on a quest to defeat this antagonist—a comically evil demon lord. He is wholly devoted to saving his friends from imminent danger, and to do that, he must become the new demon lord. It won’t raise the scale of Rimuru\'s powers to new heights, and the demon lord will likely be easily defeated. If it miraculously becomes good, I will eat my words.That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime plays it safe by never letting anyone ever be in danger. There are no stakes, no real threats, and as a comedy it\'s worthless. This is a show that treats its viewers like children who are incapable of losing their favorites toys. It had one major opportunity to prove it could kill off side characters and become a fantasy series worth taking seriously, but it isn\'t. It wasted its last chance. the first season of That Time I got Reincarnated as a Slime but wished it had been edgier, you might enjoy this.Despite the copious amount of dialogue, Slime is incapable of intelligently resolving conflicts without having characters fight.

It had one major opportunity to prove it could kill off side characters and become a fantasy series worth taking seriously, but it isn\'t. It wasted its last chance.', 'It’s hard not to feel at least somewhat conflicted with this first part of the Slime’s 2nd season. Part of it comes down to how inconsistent and middling the show is, but there’s another reason for this. That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime is a series built around its novelty value.The gimmick of a slime building and ruling a nation from scratch was a refreshing one, as it allowed for straight-forward fun and more vibrant animation than what one would expect from most isekai. Of course, when the charm of its premise wore off, the latter half of the first season petered...out with less interesting arcs. However, the presentation still had some fun tricks up its sleeve to keep the experience less dry than some of its contemporaries.With Slime 2, there’s novelty in watching a seemingly benevolent leader witness everything crumbling down before he administers karmic, cataclysmic retribution. Despite the show’s reputation as a charming, vibrant isekai that’s more palatable than most of its brethren, it’s never been a stranger to darker storylines and plot points. Rimuru himself was never averse to combatting enemy armies in order to protect his kingdom and forcefully expand relations. It’s just that this time, things are personal and as such, this first cour is the story of how Rimuru becomes a triumphant and mildly tragic war criminal who has to rethink his approach to inter-kingdom relations. It makes for a fun experience on the surface once those moments hit, but that’s more so because RImuru and the show extent actually have the balls to get this bloodthirsty, rather than due to good writing.In spite of the main gimmick being warped into something far darker and more dramatic than usual, the show never quite lives up to the heights of S1’s first arc. Where that arc was well-paced and laid down its more dramatic moments with tact and not a lot of redundant exposition, Slime 2 does the opposite. This is most apparent with Youm’s subplot with newcomer Myulan, as she constantly monologues about how in spite of denying her own feelings for him, Youm is such a fool for trusting and loving her considering she’s being sent by Clayman to assist in Tempest’s destruction. The entire middle portion, once the show transitions into its big arc, is a slog where the fights become more about the inner monologues and explaining each other’s powers and positions than the actual fights, which aren’t that well-animated outside of a few solid cuts, anyway. The pacing also feels really weird, as in we get moments like the aforementioned that linger on extraneous nonsense or how episode 9’s conversations and pity party could have been truncated if not for how it inserts a recap at the very start with S1 footage. At the same time, some scenes don’t get enough time to breathe in the middle episodes, like with Youm’s romantic subplot developing way too fast.Perhaps the most distasteful moments in the mid-section involve the otherworlders, a pair of humans from our world who act as repulsive brats that try to purposefully and falsely accuse some of the Tempest goblins of sexual harassment in the case of Kiara, and comment on how they want to makie Shion and Shuna into his sex slaves in the case of Shougo. Disregarding how the latter feels even more discomforting given the existence of a certain Healer show this season,  this is just a really gaudy attempt at getting us to further hate characters the show already convinced us were pieces of shit. Clayman, the main antagonist of both cours of S2, has far more restraint with how he’s presented, allowing him to maintain a level of presence and villainy without the show having to go overboard on him being a manipulative scumbag. Even the king of Farmus, the antagonistic force of this cour, doesn’t feel this gratuitous, considering how the otherworlders reek of more rancid LN titles like Akashic Records. It’s fun watching them get their comeuppance thanks to the final ⅓ of this cour having some solid cuts as the baddies get squashed. However, it’s not the easiest to get invested in.Part of the problem is also the show’s cast. Slime has never had a particularly memorable cast, as most were just Rimuru’s lackeys with a few personality differences that get exploited for some decent gags and explosive moments. However, they certainly don’t get a chance to be more interesting this season. Even in the set-up phase of the first 4 episodes, we still have particularly embarrassing moments like Shion wailing cuz Rimuru wouldn’t take her with him. A lot of this was easier to deal with in the less dramatic arcs of S1, but since this season becomes more focused on serious storytelling, it’s hard not to feel at least a little empty when the show doesn’t tighten up its characterization or even feel particularly brutal when shit hits the fan.Rimuru himself has some cool shots to express his sorrow and silent wrath in the final few episodes, and those imposing moments land quite nicely. However, the novelty of his charm has worn off now and he’s kind of a boring protagonist without too much to make him particularly compelling or memorable when the show switches from cutesy hijinks to serious warfare. The finale does bring back the charm of him being very reactive and willing to use his previous world’s knowledge in quirky ways like with the naming of Diablo. However, moments like this and him being a bitter, sore loser in ep 6 are a bit too rare.When he crosses that line to get revenge on Farmus by mowing down hoards of soldiers that weren’t even part of the initial invasion that burnt his kingdom, even though there are more benevolent reasons attached to this, it’s not as easy to get on-board with as the show wants it to be. In fact, no one objects to or feels reservations about this, not even Youm, who hails from Farmus. Actually exploring the morally gray nature of his actions this season considering he’s forced to rethink his stance on humans, would go a long way to add weight, drama, and humanity to this conflict. However, tension is only allowed in the shortest of bursts, and it favors an explosive ass kicking gauntlet with a tinge of vague tragedy, as opposed to doing anything that would prevent it from both having its cake and eating it too. The least it could do is be more ruthless in some of the violence on display in the final few episodes, but alas, that’s not the case. Slime 2 is a bit too toothless for what it shows outside of some cool finishers.The presentation in S2 is passable on its own merits, but pales in comparison to the vibrance of S1, even if both entries are rather inconsistent in terms of artwork and sometimes animation quality. While there are some sick moments like Hakuro’s final move against Kyouka or the explosive final move Hinata lands on Rimuru before the latter escapes, there are also several jank moments throughout even the better episodes. Atsushi Nakayama went from assistant director of S1 to the primary director here, and the vibrant animation and fun, playful multimedia menu explanations for Rimuru’s powers have decreased. Both that and Rimuru’s playful visual interactions with “the great sage” are dramatically doned down outside of the finale and maybe one other moment this season. Additionally, some of the fights this season, particularly in the middle, look downright terrible compared to most of S1. Moreover, there is a surprising amount of lackluster CGI, particularly for the invading army of Farmus. There’s also just generally less visual flair here, which is best evidenced in the character of Diablo. In S1 ep 24 and the OVA episodes, his introductions had a sinister, grand presentation with some of the most striking visuals in each of these entries. He commanded a serious, sinister presence, even when the visuals of S1 sometimes failed to match that in his big fight scene. His summon in S2 had some shades on that, but he feels far more subdued compared to before since the visuals barely capture how imposing he is. There are some fun moments with how flamboyant and eccentric he can be, but the point still stands.Even the audiovisuals of S2 are at least a little weaker, but that’s mainly thanks to “Storyteller” being one of the weaker TRUE anisongs, and “STORYSEEKER” from STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION being a far cry from S1’s EDs. It’s a shame that neither Azusa Tadokoro nor Takuma Terushima had songs this season, but eh, maybe in the next cour we’ll get something from them. The actual OST done by Elements Garden  is still fine, with some suitably somber or epic-sounding tracks that feel more notable in the last 5 episodes. The series doesn’t even reuse as many tracks from S1 as expected, which is nice, and the sound effects are as crunchy and bass-boosted as ever.To move onto another positive note of Slime 2, the first 3 episodes do still retain the magic of S1’s early episodes, barring the aforementioned scene of Shion crying. Revisiting the Drawf kingdom and the Elf tavern was pretty entertaining. Jokes such as dwarf king Dwargo lecturing Rimuru for his apparently weak speech towards the former’s kingdom, and having that echo in the back of Rimuru’s mind when his apology towards Shion and Shuna for sneaking out with the boys to the Elf tavern result in him eating Shion’s food for a weak are pretty fun. Watching Rimuru navigate politics with the Eurazania kingdom with liquor and some 1 v 1 battles with Shion and Youm against some of Eurazania’s best was cool. There are other fun gags and moments here, and even a few glorious bits later on like with what Rimuru decides to do with Youm, Myulan, and other newcomer Grucius in episode 8. However, the show can’t exactly go back to all of this without cheapening some of the drama presented here, even if the end game of the season inherently does that to some extent despite how brutal a lot of moments in the penultimate episode were. Well, the show does go back, and that’s part of why the show being somewhat toothless and completely unnuanced in the handling of its more serious and grim moments stings so much.This is actually where the structure of the series comes in. On some level, this is the fault of the original material, but it’s taken to a whole new level with this adaptation. With S1, the creative team and producers had a hard time settling on how long they wanted the adaptation to be, which led to a very jittery 2nd half that had to skip the first half of arc 4 just so it could get to the part with the kids to end the season on something resembling a climax. This left the Eurazania and Farmus set-up for this season. Given that S1 ended right before the arc everyone had been waiting for, a lot of people were frustrated when S2 had to come back to what was left behind just to provide context for what the rest of the season was poised to adapt.A problem that was averted by the finale was the seeming lack of presence Millim had this time around. In episode 8, Eren details a fairy tale to Rimuru after explaining the truth about her and the party she traveled with back in the first arc. This fairy tale meant to give Rimuru some hope, just so happened to be Millim’s tragic backstory presented in a form reminiscent of a hybrid of motion comics and stained-glass windows, and adds a lot to the show’s worldbuilding. In spite of what the entire scene means for the narrative, it was one of the best moments in the show for the sheer level of context it provides that add to some of the more likable side characters (who kinda just show up here) and to elements that could be exploited in the future. Up until this point, Millim herself only appeared once this season...in a 2 second scene with no dialogue because the anime wanted to show that Clayman is sending her to wage war on Eurazania that way Rimuru has his hands full with two war conflicts to resolve. However, the finale brought her back to fight Eurazania’s lord, Carrion, in a big way with one of the coolest battles in the series. Her finisher was particularly glorious to witness, more than rectifying what was initially a strange issue with this cour that could have been indicative of the structuring of the adaptation.The finale itself is probably the best episode of the season, with how it sets up the future conflict in an exciting fashion while showcasing some of the vibrance and charm the series strove to have with RImuru’s and Benimaru’s “password” fiasco as well as the last two scenes of the show. In spite of the myriad of issues the arc itself had, it at least ended on a high note.The 2nd Season of That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime is a rather conflicting experience. Before and at the end of the big arc the season adapts, there’s still some of that charm that made early S1 so refreshing. However, the arc itself, and even some of the build-up to it, are rather laborious at times and laden with obnoxious issues reminiscent of the worst LN anime. It’s not even as boring as some of latter-day S1, let alone as unenjoyable as the frustrations mentioned above could make it seem. There’s still some enjoyment to be had with Slime 2, just like before. While S1 definitely petered out after a while, it was perhaps the most charming isekai anime out there prior to Bookworm. However, now we have better options, and the show really does begin to stumble under the weight of a more serious direction and the structuring problems it dealt with as an adaptation since S1. There is some mild satisfaction and surprise in watching a show like this get as dark as it does by the end, but it doesn’t entirely stick thanks to certain plot points, the suboptimal writing of the show’s villains and drama, and how the show never goes hard on its morally gray ideas and sheer brutality.There are several hilarious moments, especially early on, and some of the fights are relatively entertaining. Unfortunately, the show’s foundation really needed to be better if it wanted to execute a more expansive and dramatic arc with the finesse it once had in simpler times. Slime 2 part 1 isn’t a complete waste, but it’s about on par with S1’s weaker arcs and it doesn’t even look as good as before. There are several fun and amusing moments, but once the straightforward fun and novelty wear off and it’s time to be more critical, it’s hard not to acknowledge that we’re left with a bit of a mess. Hopefully the second cour picks up and the Shizue arc can finally have some real competition for ""the best arc of Slime"". out with less interesting arcs. However, the presentation still had some fun tricks up its sleeve to keep the experience less dry than some of its contemporaries.With Slime 2, there’s novelty in watching a seemingly benevolent leader witness everything crumbling down before he administers karmic, cataclysmic retribution. Despite the show’s reputation as a charming, vibrant isekai that’s more palatable than most of its brethren, it’s never been a stranger to darker storylines and plot points. Rimuru himself was never averse to combatting enemy armies in order to protect his kingdom and forcefully expand relations. It’s just that this time, things are personal and as such, this first cour is the story of how Rimuru becomes a triumphant and mildly tragic war criminal who has to rethink his approach to inter-kingdom relations. It makes for a fun experience on the surface once those moments hit, but that’s more so because RImuru and the show extent actually have the balls to get this bloodthirsty, rather than due to good writing.In spite of the main gimmick being warped into something far darker and more dramatic than usual, the show never quite lives up to the heights of S1’s first arc. Where that arc was well-paced and laid down its more dramatic moments with tact and not a lot of redundant exposition, Slime 2 does the opposite. This is most apparent with Youm’s subplot with newcomer Myulan, as she constantly monologues about how in spite of denying her own feelings for him, Youm is such a fool for trusting and loving her considering she’s being sent by Clayman to assist in Tempest’s destruction. The entire middle portion, once the show transitions into its big arc, is a slog where the fights become more about the inner monologues and explaining each other’s powers and positions than the actual fights, which aren’t that well-animated outside of a few solid cuts, anyway. The pacing also feels really weird, as in we get moments like the aforementioned that linger on extraneous nonsense or how episode 9’s conversations and pity party could have been truncated if not for how it inserts a recap at the very start with S1 footage. At the same time, some scenes don’t get enough time to breathe in the middle episodes, like with Youm’s romantic subplot developing way too fast.Perhaps the most distasteful moments in the mid-section involve the otherworlders, a pair of humans from our world who act as repulsive brats that try to purposefully and falsely accuse some of the Tempest goblins of sexual harassment in the case of Kiara, and comment on how they want to makie Shion and Shuna into his sex slaves in the case of Shougo. Disregarding how the latter feels even more discomforting given the existence of a certain Healer show this season,  this is just a really gaudy attempt at getting us to further hate characters the show already convinced us were pieces of shit. Clayman, the main antagonist of both cours of S2, has far more restraint with how he’s presented, allowing him to maintain a level of presence and villainy without the show having to go overboard on him being a manipulative scumbag. Even the king of Farmus, the antagonistic force of this cour, doesn’t feel this gratuitous, considering how the otherworlders reek of more rancid LN titles like Akashic Records. It’s fun watching them get their comeuppance thanks to the final ⅓ of this cour having some solid cuts as the baddies get squashed. However, it’s not the easiest to get invested in.Part of the problem is also the show’s cast. Slime has never had a particularly memorable cast, as most were just Rimuru’s lackeys with a few personality differences that get exploited for some decent gags and explosive moments. However, they certainly don’t get a chance to be more interesting this season. Even in the set-up phase of the first 4 episodes, we still have particularly embarrassing moments like Shion wailing cuz Rimuru wouldn’t take her with him. A lot of this was easier to deal with in the less dramatic arcs of S1, but since this season becomes more focused on serious storytelling, it’s hard not to feel at least a little empty when the show doesn’t tighten up its characterization or even feel particularly brutal when shit hits the fan.Rimuru himself has some cool shots to express his sorrow and silent wrath in the final few episodes, and those imposing moments land quite nicely. However, the novelty of his charm has worn off now and he’s kind of a boring protagonist without too much to make him particularly compelling or memorable when the show switches from cutesy hijinks to serious warfare. The finale does bring back the charm of him being very reactive and willing to use his previous world’s knowledge in quirky ways like with the naming of Diablo. However, moments like this and him being a bitter, sore loser in ep 6 are a bit too rare.When he crosses that line to get revenge on Farmus by mowing down hoards of soldiers that weren’t even part of the initial invasion that burnt his kingdom, even though there are more benevolent reasons attached to this, it’s not as easy to get on-board with as the show wants it to be. In fact, no one objects to or feels reservations about this, not even Youm, who hails from Farmus. Actually exploring the morally gray nature of his actions this season considering he’s forced to rethink his stance on humans, would go a long way to add weight, drama, and humanity to this conflict. However, tension is only allowed in the shortest of bursts, and it favors an explosive ass kicking gauntlet with a tinge of vague tragedy, as opposed to doing anything that would prevent it from both having its cake and eating it too. The least it could do is be more ruthless in some of the violence on display in the final few episodes, but alas, that’s not the case. Slime 2 is a bit too toothless for what it shows outside of some cool finishers.The presentation in S2 is passable on its own merits, but pales in comparison to the vibrance of S1, even if both entries are rather inconsistent in terms of artwork and sometimes animation quality. While there are some sick moments like Hakuro’s final move against Kyouka or the explosive final move Hinata lands on Rimuru before the latter escapes, there are also several jank moments throughout even the better episodes. Atsushi Nakayama went from assistant director of S1 to the primary director here, and the vibrant animation and fun, playful multimedia menu explanations for Rimuru’s powers have decreased. Both that and Rimuru’s playful visual interactions with “the great sage” are dramatically doned down outside of the finale and maybe one other moment this season. Additionally, some of the fights this season, particularly in the middle, look downright terrible compared to most of S1. Moreover, there is a surprising amount of lackluster CGI, particularly for the invading army of Farmus. There’s also just generally less visual flair here, which is best evidenced in the character of Diablo. In S1 ep 24 and the OVA episodes, his introductions had a sinister, grand presentation with some of the most striking visuals in each of these entries. He commanded a serious, sinister presence, even when the visuals of S1 sometimes failed to match that in his big fight scene. His summon in S2 had some shades on that, but he feels far more subdued compared to before since the visuals barely capture how imposing he is. There are some fun moments with how flamboyant and eccentric he can be, but the point still stands.Even the audiovisuals of S2 are at least a little weaker, but that’s mainly thanks to “Storyteller” being one of the weaker TRUE anisongs, and “STORYSEEKER” from STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION being a far cry from S1’s EDs. It’s a shame that neither Azusa Tadokoro nor Takuma Terushima had songs this season, but eh, maybe in the next cour we’ll get something from them. The actual OST done by Elements Garden  is still fine, with some suitably somber or epic-sounding tracks that feel more notable in the last 5 episodes. The series doesn’t even reuse as many tracks from S1 as expected, which is nice, and the sound effects are as crunchy and bass-boosted as ever.To move onto another positive note of Slime 2, the first 3 episodes do still retain the magic of S1’s early episodes, barring the aforementioned scene of Shion crying. Revisiting the Drawf kingdom and the Elf tavern was pretty entertaining. Jokes such as dwarf king Dwargo lecturing Rimuru for his apparently weak speech towards the former’s kingdom, and having that echo in the back of Rimuru’s mind when his apology towards Shion and Shuna for sneaking out with the boys to the Elf tavern result in him eating Shion’s food for a weak are pretty fun. Watching Rimuru navigate politics with the Eurazania kingdom with liquor and some 1 v 1 battles with Shion and Youm against some of Eurazania’s best was cool. There are other fun gags and moments here, and even a few glorious bits later on like with what Rimuru decides to do with Youm, Myulan, and other newcomer Grucius in episode 8.

Not only did we have ~3 filler episodes at the start of the series, but the overall pacing has been sub-par, especially when compared to the 1st season. Guess that's what happens when you're dangerously close to where the manga currently is and you're not planning on taking a long-ass break like Black Clover.What the 1st season excelled at, including pacing and the blending of action and worldbuilding, has been performed very mediocrely this season. However, I will say a lot of these...issues can be chalked up to the horrible production Slime has gone through overall: for those that don't know, we were never supposed to get a season 2, but the higher-ups relented after seeing the success and popularity of season 1.Story: 4/10I still enjoy the premise of the story: typical isekai setting, but our reincarnated protagonist is very pure and wholesome instead. The 1st season was very clearly a wholesome take on the generic isekai genre, and this season was very clearly meant to start flipping that on its head. While that the tone did start to change this season, I can't say I was a fan of how it was done.As I mentioned before, season 1 was meant to be the only anime adaptation of the manga/light novel. As a result, it ended up skipping the content we see in the first 3-ish episodes. Why they decided to include this I have no fucking clue, since it didn't add enough development to the story to justify taking up ~3 episodes worth of time, especially when you consider the other content they chose to skip in later episodes that actually would've provided more insight into the world, story, or other facets. If you consider how horrible the higher-ups behind Slime are, it's pretty clear that this shit was added to stall and milk more money.Aside from the filler episodes we got, the overall pacing this season has been subpar. Hinata vs Rimuru took much longer than it needed to, and I literally spat out my lunch laughing when I saw Myulan posing for like 3 minutes straight or so, just spitting out a very empty monologue. Like what am I watching right now? As I brought up earlier, moments from the manga were skipped for god knows why that could've added much more depth. Myulan's romance with Youm was better developed: it feels very random in the anime. After the attack on Tempest and Rimuru's return, we had more interactions between Rimuru and humans willing to help like the merchant from Blumund: this provided way more character development for Rimuru that we never got to see in the anime. We also completely skipped Ranga and Gruciu's conversation about demon lords, which adds a LOT to worldbuilding.Most importantly, I absolutely hated how they handled Rimuru's interaction with the Falmuth army and king. The manga portrayed everything in a much more sinister, horrific tone befitting of Rimuru's rage at the time, while the anime went with a very light-hearted, and comedic even approach. In the anime, Rimuru has a long-ass civil conversation with the king before chopping his arm off. In the manga, Rimuru exudes a demon lord aura, before immediately cutting off the fat fuck's arm the second he starts talking big. The difference in directional choice here is staggering and baffling, with the overall direction for episodes 10 and 11 was decent at best, just like the pacing for the whole season.Art: 6/10While the animation has been mostly nice, I was really 50/50 on the animation of Rimuru's attack on the Falmuth army. The animation for merciless and meggido was sick. But the animation (or lack thereof) afterwards was quite sad.I could list so many ways they could've gone about making the episode much darker, making Rimuru more evil and scary, etc. etc. but I won't bother. I just implore you to check out chapters 65 and 66 if you're really interested. It'll give you a sense of how much violence/horror was censored and fluffed up in the anime (Geld vs. Shogo was significantly more bloody and gruesome than the animation made it out to be) as well as how much better content later on (compared to the first 3 episodes) that added to worldbuilding was skipped.Sound: 6/10Just like the animation, the sound and use of OSTs were good at most points, but there were some that really stuck out as being poor taste. Specifically, the music being played over Rimuru's slaughter using Megiddo. Why are we getting cheerful music here? This is supposed to be a very dark moment and a crucial turning point for Rimuru. Playing optimistic, happy music doesn't really fit in thematically at all.That being said, I will applaud Gobta's voice actor for killing it during the death reveal scene, and the use of OST in the background. Very fitting, and one of few actually dark scenes executed properly this season.Character: 4/10A lot of crucial character moments were not done right or just outright skipped, especially for Rimuru the fucking protagonist of all people.Just look at chapter 66, and tell me Rimuru isn't an absolute chad or badass. He not only has to hold himself back from killing the king outright the moment they meet, but he constantly intimidates and pressures him, making it very clear who's boss and who isn't. Rimuru in the anime? Has some tea with the king, remains collected even when the king is spewing bullshit, etc. etc. We never see Rimuru close to snapping or starting to live up to his name as a demon lord.I get that Rimuru is normally supposed to be like this: calm, collected, willing to try peaceful options first, but the whole point of this arc was to show that even he could snap when pushed to his absolute limits. This is also a big turning point since he's gotta realize that peace won't be as applicable to everyone as he would like it to be, and also since he actually has to kill humans now. We just don't get this same character development in the anime. If I never read the manga, I wouldn't even assume Rimuru has undergone some sort of change: he looks and acts almost exactly the same as before.Even the crucial introduction of Noir/Diablo is rather subpar: we skip over a lot of his initial interactions with Rimuru after being summoned, which leads to rather mediocre character development for him. Likewise, a lot of small character interactions amongst each other or with Rimuru were skipped, which makes Rimuru's primary group seem significantly more one-dimensional than they actually are.Enjoyment: 5/10This season of Slime is nowhere as good as the 1st season, especially when you consider how much better of a job they could've done. If you truly want to enlighten yourself, I suggest you read chapters 63-68 of the manga: it'll really make you realize how many amazing moments were delivered in a sub-par moment or skipped entirely. Moments that I was really looking forward to seeing animated, like Rimuru's demonic aura and slaughtering of the army, were completely flipped around and ignored/replaced with much more light-hearted fantasy shit. Disgusting. Interesting and meaningful character interactions were forgone for 3 filler episodes. Again, disgusting. All that being said though, this season is a serviceable adaptation of the manga content. But that's about it: mediocre when it could've been so much more, and that's more depressing than it is disgusting. issues can be chalked up to the horrible production Slime has gone through overall: for those that don't know, we were never supposed to get a season 2, but the higher-ups relented after seeing the success and popularity of season 1.Story: 4/10I still enjoy the premise of the story: typical isekai setting, but our reincarnated protagonist is very pure and wholesome instead.

If I never read the manga, I wouldn't even assume Rimuru has undergone some sort of change: he looks and acts almost exactly the same as before.Even the crucial introduction of Noir/Diablo is rather subpar: we skip over a lot of his initial interactions with Rimuru after being summoned, which leads to rather mediocre character development for him. Likewise, a lot of small character interactions amongst each other or with Rimuru were skipped, which makes Rimuru's primary group seem significantly more one-dimensional than they actually are.Enjoyment: 5/10This season of Slime is nowhere as good as the 1st season, especially when you consider how much better of a job they could've done. If you truly want to enlighten yourself, I suggest you read chapters 63-68 of the manga: it'll really make you realize how many amazing moments were delivered in a sub-par moment or skipped entirely. Moments that I was really looking forward to seeing animated, like Rimuru's demonic aura and slaughtering of the army, were completely flipped around and ignored/replaced with much more light-hearted fantasy shit. Disgusting. Interesting and meaningful character interactions were forgone for 3 filler episodes. Again, disgusting. All that being said though, this season is a serviceable adaptation of the manga content. But that's about it: mediocre when it could've been so much more, and that's more depressing than it is disgusting."", ""Tensura has been one of the shows I've enjoyed the most in recent times. Season 1 felt like a non stop fun ride, the development of Rimuru's village and his allies made the backbone of it for me. They followed the rules of isekai to a tea, making it super wholesome and entertaining.Now, season 2 differs a little bit with its approach. While season 1 felt like a very fast-developing, wholesome monster society, with a big focus on the village's growth, one could argue that there was no real sense of danger through its runtime. The show lacked a main villain, as most encounters felt...like they were there mostly to advance the village, either its army or economy. This isn't a bad thing, season 1 is still fantastic, but I feel like it could get boring, especially if season 2 had the same formula. Thankfully that wasn't the case.Season 2 of slime took a step back. There is very little growth to be had here, instead we are met very early with conflicts involving the other nations. This feels refreshing, as now it becomes a matter of managing the village and not expanding. Strengthening political relationships, worrying about the economy and external attacks. There is an actual sense of danger in later episodes. Some characters are developed further, others are revealed their true identity. Rimuru himself feels like a completely different character at the end.Now, there are still a few problems I had. Animation and OST feel very underwelming, specially as it aired the same season as masterpieces of the department like Jujutsu Kaisen and Mushoku Tensei. This still has mid-2000s animation, devoid of inspiration when it comes to choreography. Character designs are dull, as are the OP and ED. Though overall thats all minor, and can be overlooked.Overall, I had a lot of fun watching the Slime Isekai. I'd be lying if I said I expected anything else other than easy entertainment. The show is great and a must watch for fans of isekai.8/10 like they were there mostly to advance the village, either its army or economy.

No words can describe the thrill I felt while watching this seasons episode 11.The new archdemons introduced and the unrivaled power of resurrection is freaking awesome.The only thing that concerns me is the failed notification during harvest festival and I think that would be used as a tool to destroy Rimuru in end.But lest wait and watch as thinking too much would only ruin the fun of this awesome anime.The introduction of outworlders and the way they are manipulated and the hero that almost defeated Rimuru...and the students of Rimuru and the power of people to possess the bodies of outworlders and many more small things I noticed are making this story awesome one by one.Episode 12 didn't had much to offer but the birth of storm dragon Veldora Tempest was enough to satisfy me.Really am waiting for 2nd part of season 2 now. and the students of Rimuru and the power of people to possess the bodies of outworlders and many more small things I noticed are making this story awesome one by one.Episode 12 didn't had much to offer but the birth of storm dragon Veldora Tempest was enough to satisfy me.Really am waiting for 2nd part of season 2 now."", '""Everyone\'s got different taste, don\'t judge others based on what you liked""Warning: this review is 100% subjective.

The story keeps developing at a normal, suitable pace. From the start, I like this concept very much, creatures from different race work together to build a city (or town?), no too-heavy plot, no dramatical death (it\'s just my opinion please), an MMORPG-fantasy-comedy based concept where there\'s many exciting skills and magics, creatures, and not just colorful but also wonderful setting. And I think the story executes the concept perfectly.For art, sound, and enjoyment, I can\'t say much as it\'s felt by heart, and my opinion is 10/10.For character, I think it can\'t be specified, as the character plays a major role to build the story from a mere concept. Different concept, different character. Some naive, cruel, too-good, too-bad, or even no-character-development characters are there to support the story. And I think it\'s better to rate it based on how it fits the concept, and my opinion is also 10/10. I can understand that some people don\'t like how Rimuru\'s troops can be so loyal to him/her without a good reason, but please remember that they\'re monsters who follow the law of the jungle, and of course, they would follow a leader who\'s not just strong but also kind, smart (experienced in the economy, politic, social), and humble who protects and introduces them to a whole different, exciting and joyful lifestyle (plus Rimuru gave them a name which let them evolve to higher-level creatures, ""giving name"" means everything to them).This series is one of my favorites.

You may see the entire set up as a field to let Rimuru grow. The very purpose of it is solely the development of it\'s might which is, with his possessed skill, quite the obvious outcome.

In other words, here we see the protagonist stop being a fagot and go into boss mode. I love the last chapters, that is, he took a more mature step, everything was always very rosy and here they cut their breast. I loved the evolution of the rimuro character. I look forward to seeing how the story continues to evolve. It is a very enjoyable anime, if you are thinking of watching it, watch it. You will not regret it.En español:Muy buena segunda temporada, creo que...uno de esos anime donde su segunda temporada es mejor que la primera. O sea acá vemos al protagonista dejar de ser un maricón y se pone en modo jefe. Me encanta los últimos capítulos o sea dio un paso mas maduro, todo siempre era muy color de rosas y acá les cortan el mamo. Me encanto la evolución que tuvo el personaje de rimuro.

All struggles and sacrifices are not in vain, there are better results than sacrifice. And thanks to the new additional power, it can be said that Rimuru is a very overpowered character now, let alone add a lot of his friends.

Cant wait for part 2 on July :)"", 'I want to preface this review with the fact that I REALLY liked season 1 of Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken. Unfortunately, season 2 was quite the letdown in comparison.The first season of Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken focused on Rimuru getting used to his new world, making friends with various other monsters, and building up his new kingdom. So now that Rimuru is well established in his new world, season 2 shows us what happens to our adorable slime buddy after he has gotten situated. Well, kind of. Rimuru isn\'t around too much for the beginning of the season, which wouldn\'t necessarily be a...negative if the supporting cast could carry the show on their own for a bit. The large cast of characters, while diverse, do not hold a candle to Rimuru himself. They are quite shallow as characters go, and thus give the season a more slow/boring start.In addition to the lack-luster supporting cast, the ""threat"" in the current season is basically a joke as there are absolutely no lasting consequences & the bad guys are portrayed as comically evil. A well written enemy is one that you can somewhat emphasize with or at least understand where they are coming from. The enemies in this season are the most blatantly evil people I ever seen in an anime. There are absolutely no personality traits that these guys possess that isn\'t something a stereotypical mustache-twirling baddie wouldn\'t also have. & as I mentioned earlier, there are no lasting consequences to the interactions with this new enemy. Basically all the damage that was done at the beginning of the season was made obsolete at the end. There is nothing wrong with the good guys coming back in the end, but it\'s hard to get invested in the obstacles Rimuru faces if you know there\'s really nothing at stake.Lastly, Rimuru\'s power scaling is a bit too much for me. I suppose I may not be the target audience for shows like this, but I prefer some good ole fashioned character growth with some time spent training for my anime protagonists to actually grow in strength. Rimuru, however, just seems to wake up and become 100x stronger than he was the day before. Again, it\'s harder to become invested in the plot and challenges that the characters face if there is seemingly not much effort going on to meet their goals. I will say it was very entertaining to watch Rimuru fight at the end of this season, but I think the quality of the story really suffered from how these fights went down.Overall, this season was...not that good. The side characters still need more fleshing out, there are no meaningful threats or challenges to Rimuru and company, and Rimuru is just too OP for someone who did absolutely no training this season.  Plus, with the seemingly serious tone of this season, I didn\'t get nearly as many cutesy scenes with my favorite little slime as I did in the first one. Thankfully, the end of the season does introduce a new interesting character and Rimuru does gain some new abilities, both of which did peak my interest. So, hopefully part 2 of season 2 can step it up plot-wise seeing as this one definitely left something to be desired. negative if the supporting cast could carry the show on their own for a bit.

The plot was wonderful, amazing, or all the positive adjectives that I could describe it to be. To dig deeper into it (SPOILER ALERT)I see all the frustrations that we all had starting from season 1, how Rimuru suppresses everything and how he could be beaten by so many characters. But this turn of event making him the strongest among them all really really is surprisingly good. Most of...all the anime finally took a dark turn, not the bad kind but a good one, there is finally blood shed, there is finally the let go of ones anger, there is finally action taken and not suppressed.

And the Tensura anime for season 2 is indeed very good and I hope for part 2 to be released sooner and even better.For the story, I really like it but I'm a...little annoyed because I have to wait for part 2 and also the exciting scene is cut for next week.

The episodes are being dragged on way too long. 1 whole conversation literally takes an episode and a half. If they just sped it up and wouldn't end with cliffhangers for nearly all the episodes, this anime would at most be a 7.5, instead, they drag the episodes for way too long. Don't get me wrong, the show isn't half bad. It's just the pacing that's a problem. After 9 episodes, the anime hasn't even gotten to the good parts and if it was paced correctly, the show would've covered everything...important. important."", ""The second season of Tensei  Shitara Slime Datta ken has a slightly different start from the previous season, the first episodes were action packed in the first one while  the first 2-5 on the second season was mainly progress via talk.The story always progressed and all conversations had a purpose, what I prefer is always action packed making the first 2-5 of talking little harder but the second the fighting begun the watching experience bloomed.It's a wholesome story that mixes in overpowered characters, progress, teamwork and humour. Putting plots and twists along the way making the user unable to predict the outcome of...the series, the series,"", 'I’ve been a big fan of Slime for half a decade already, and seeing it finally animated makes me really happy. The world building in this anime is great, it is very gradual and complex. This is because the studio really has a lot of content to work with and I guess the main challenge is really tying up the written down content to a visually impressive manner which this anime manages to fulfill.In terms of story, the general feel of the overall plot is sort-off different from the previous season, I won’t spoil so I’ll just say that the sequence of the plot is...very polished and smooth. The world building is still strong this season, a lot of factions would be introduced along with small hints on motives and drivers of these factions. What’s really impressive with slime however is how it goes back to previously introduced characters, factions or concepts, there is very little wasted characters in this series even though the amount of characters here is so vast you’ll still find every character memorable. My previously disliked characters has managed to grow on me, another one of those slime magic (this series really likes making friends of previous enemies for some reason, but not all).  On the Finale, I’ll give a guarantee to everyone who has immersed themselves in the anime would have a very satisfying experience in terms of plot (also you guys should pay attention to any foreshadowing hehehe).In terms of Art, it is very stunning but not really the strong point of this anime. I usually watch stuff in 1440p (a limitation of this one is that you can only watch it a 1080 max…) where the bigger screen and more intense colors makes you notice some poorly drawn details. My standard of a good art is where I can pause at any frames and screenshot that frame into a decent wallpaper, this is not true for this anime sadly. But on the good side, the balance of CGI and drawings is excellent, I’ve also noticed that there are some variations in the art style especially during the action scenes. It is kinda hard to rate art alone since the sound and art for me works in hand in hand but overall, I think the animators just have to revisit some frames and maybe release a UHD version of this series (I can dream right?).Similar point in Art, I wished the audio design is more complex to utilize surround systems, the sound is limited to stereo which might be due to the format I watched it in, hopefully the studio can re-visit (this is just me nitpicking). On the good side, the sound effects really good, I really enjoyed the sounds produced in this series since it has a lot bass in it but there’s really little improvements from season 1 (it’s top notched on its own). In term’s of voice acting, I can’t hear any repeat VAs, either the VAs for this anime is so diverse or they are just top-notch (from what I hear they are since I can just feel the emotions thru their voice, as expected of Japanese VAs). For Music, it is quite well-composed and there are pieces that are very memorable, I am so glad that the studio invested in a song for the *certain amazing bad ass event*, it made the emotions very real.For Enjoyment, this anime is very addicting. It is like playing a bioware game really, the anime is explorable and there are so many things that you can experience when watching this, there are always new things the you’ll find and enjoy. plus this anime is so interactive that it is almost like you are playing an RPG game where the main point is to explore the world. This anime is built for enjoyment, I don’t think you can see this as some kind of snobbish work of art really where they force you on some concept, the formula here is really just a matter of taking things already existing in the anime pool and just putting it together in one amazing piece (well done Fuze and Prod team!).Overall, this season just made me have really high expectations of the next season. I hope the studio or production team would not disappoint. 10/10 very polished and smooth.

The first season was enjoyable, but not anything too out of the ordinary in terms of generic isekai.  Whilst this season's concept may also seem overused, it is executed to a point where I found myself completely forgetting about my surroundings.They seemed to up the budget on this one because the animators really seemed to enjoy themselves bringing these attacks to life.  It was the perfect amount to not be over the top, but still leave you with you slackjawed as to how cool it...looked.Now, this is just ridiculous.  The first season had sound effects that fit, but that was about all there was to it.  Here, however, at least with wearing headphones, it felt like I was actually in that scene.  The subtle background noise (birds chirping, wind blowing) actually made me pause the anime a few times to check that it was actually coming from my computer, rather than outside.

The pacing is awful and pretty much kills it.Essentially they\'re stretching 6 or 8 episodes worth of information into 12. Something *important* happens in this season, and if you read the LN or manga, you know what that something is. At the speed the anime moves initially, it should\'ve happened in the middle of the season, but that is a no, and so they start stalling it, pushing it back and so on.What does it mean? It...means they\'ll start using every stalling shounen trick in the book. Artificially lengthened fight scenes, artificially lengthened dialogues, dozens of scenes where everybody is heroically preparing for something important, but nothing actually happens and in essence we have a talking head scene that lasts 15 minutes and adds nothing to the story.Maybe it feels better if you haven\'t read the source material, but if you did read it, it is awful. You want that ""great thing"" to happen, and they delay it. Then they delay it again. Then again, and again and again, and when it happens it is sorta underwhelming because the stuff you imagined was cooler than that.It is awful, it feels bad and gives bad impression.At this rate, ""part 2"" is probably mostly going to be Rimuru slapping the antagonist for 6 episodes, where the same scene is shown from different angles.Obviously, I\'m quite disappointed.

We get some new and rid of the old in places by moving the story past them. You learn of others similar to the protagonist and meet the truth of the cruelty of the world. Rimuru seems to be in a paradise but really most of the world is against him and his kind it seems. They protect Shuna which is extremely important though.The show is fun from start to finish if you excuse episode 9. It does foreshadow what is to come but just so awful. I look forward to the second part of the season when it comes. Also, despite Shuna being amazing, Milim is best girl still. You really learn about Milim's past.9/10. Some great new characters and girls in this one. Suphia was a close contender this time too. average but once again we have the absolutely spectacular sounds of conflict and magic here that more than make up for any issues with sound.The characters develop hard and fast and it keeps you entertained.

I was pleasantly surprised by the evolution of this anime. Most series become boring after season 1 but not in this case.I don't have the words to describe how surprised I was by this season. I've seen a lot of Isekai but this might be my favorite.This anime made me have a wave of emotions throughout the episodes.I would definitely recommend this anime to people who are new to this kind of anime genre. "", ""I really enjoyed Season one of this series, but oh my God!Season two of Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken in which all the heroes that were built up in season one are turned into a bunch of weak fucking morons who can't do shit against absurdly overpowered Deus Ex-Machina enemies appearing out of nowhere.Who greenlit this atrocious claptrap? There's no humor left. No reason to root for the main characters who seem to have lost their brains and their reason for existing. Especially the main character seems to have dropped at least 80% of his IQ.Christ!I can't find the words to...explain what a load of garbage this turned out to be!Season two is what happens when people without talent cosplay as writers.It's truly not worth watching.DROPPED! explain what a load of garbage this turned out to be!Season two is what happens when people without talent cosplay as writers.It's truly not worth watching.DROPPED!"", ""(Spoilers)Tensura season 2 was as great as last season and I was not disappointed to see this season as I was happy to watch it for every episodeStory 9/10- We continue to see how Rimuru Tempest who has been reincarnated as a slime has grown his city or town with different races of a monster which goes well for him and his place but since he recognized as a monster, humans aren't likely to care about them and already guess what might happen but the anime does a great job to build that tension since the first few episodes are happy and funny episodes which...build that tension until it slowly goes wrong which really builds that unease in you and what happens after was amazing.Art 9/10- The art was really good as each scene, characters, and things were drawn really good and it like the previous season's art which was the same.Sound 8/10- Voices, Ost, opening, and ending were ok and I would say how sound effects for attacks or powers were satisfying to hear for some reason as it goes with how the art for the attacks look with it looking good.Character 8/10- Not that many characters were introduced that were important except for the character in the last episode but for villains which were the humans was a good idea as most anime would portray monsters as the enemies but here we see how some humans don't show that much care in monsters and that there the enemy. I really like Rimuru as he really is a good character which well thought out, he cares for everyone and wants to protect them in any way possible and wants to continue growing his town for the different races to be with each other.Enjoyment 9/10- As I said about the story on how it builds that tension which really entices me to watch more episodes. Fight scenes were enjoyable to watch as they were amazing to see, there were many funny moments in it that made me laugh or smile.Overall 9/10- This season and anime as a whole is an amazing anime and I wish it counties on being really good in the upcoming episode build that tension until it slowly goes wrong which really builds that unease in you and what happens after was amazing.Art 9/10- The art was really good as each scene, characters, and things were drawn really good and it like the previous season's art which was the same.Sound 8/10- Voices, Ost, opening, and ending were ok and I would say how sound effects for attacks or powers were satisfying to hear for some reason as it goes with how the art for the attacks look with it looking good.Character 8/10- Not that many characters were introduced that were important except for the character in the last episode but for villains which were the humans was a good idea as most anime would portray monsters as the enemies but here we see how some humans don't show that much care in monsters and that there the enemy.

I somehow made it through this anime, but almost every episode made me almost fall asleep. And I am serious about this. If you have insomnia just watch this; it is a great cure.I thought the first season was good, but this one is filled with endless talking about some of the most boring subjects imaginable. They just talk for ages explaining very simple concepts, but it takes them almost a full episode to explain something that isn't complicated.The main character is dumb. In, I think episode 3, he is warned that Falmour (or something like that) will wage war because they want...power. This person tells him the reason why they will attack. About 2 episodes later, the protagonist has forgotten and says something like 'I cannot figure out why they would attack.' You were just told an episode ago! Does he have short-term memory loss?In the midst of these troubles and threats, the main character decides to take a trip to meet his students in another city. Great timing! He teleports there for pretty much no reason but to put the main character in that place. There is no other reason for him to be there.And I bet you can guess what happens next! Yes, a great surprise happens when Falmour attacks his territory whilst he is away. But the reason he can't back is even more stupid than him leaving.The main character has the ability to teleport directly from the city back to his territory, but he decides not to do that. He decides to ride out of the front gate and teleport from outside the city where he gets trapped by a spell. This spell stops him from teleporting and he gets attacked. If he just teleported from the city (the sensible thing), he would never have that issue.The most annoying thing, though, is when one of his allies dies. There is a lot of boohoo and upset for about 10 minutes, but this turns out to be pointless because the main character revives the person about 5 minutes later. A completely pointless storyline. It would be better if they stayed dead or, at least, left them dead for far longer. power. This person tells him the reason why they will attack.

If you watch season one and liked it then yeah though this season isn't about world building anymore. It's story time.But without spoiling too much.Story: This first part I really liked. It deals with Rimuru's growth as a character mainly. He realizes as a leader of the nation he can't just talk-no-jutsu have a wholesome conversation, his way into making everyone happy. He realizes there are just some crazy people in the world out for blood, and that could cost him the lives of his loved ones. So he has to make a hard decision on whether or not to...kill humans, like he once was. There were even some tough situations for the side characters to face themselves.Art: Great.

They're great in their own rightOverall: I enjoyed the first Part! Should definitely watch it you liked season 1 kill humans, like he once was.

Expect a little bit of spoilers since it's hard for me to write a review otherwise.The story: 9/10The season 2 starts off right where season 1 finished. I was very glad about this due to the fact that at times other animes can really mess up sequels. Thankfully they didn't. Season 2 was absolutely amazing and it was so hype seeing Rimuru become the demon lord. And the way he became it was just absolutely amazing.The art: 10/10This anime just looks absolutely amazing. The animation is smooth and the visuals are really well done....I don't think there was a moment where I genuinely thought it looked bad.The sound: 9/10The voice acting, the musing, the sound effects, everything was just absolutely amazing. A lot of the times bad sound design can really make or break a show/anime/movie and etc. so I'm really happy to say it was well done.The characters: 10/10Honestly the characters are were the shows truly shines the most. Rimuru is just so funny and badass when he needs to be. And hell, the side characters aren't even left out. We got action from literally everyone to some extent.If we talk about just fights in this season then hands down the best one goes to the old man Hakurou. Seeing him get his revenge was so satisfying and you could even feel terrified. So yeah, the characters are funny, badass and just well written.Enjoyment: 9/10A huge part of why I loved season 1 was the humor, and glad to see it carried over so well. Almost every episode had just amazing comedic moments and episode 3 itself almost made me lose it. And not just humor, but the action, suspense and everything else makes me want to watch it again and I really do hope this gets a continuation.Overall: 9/10Almost everything in this anime is perfect, so I truly believe it deserves a high overall rating. If I had to truly nitpick then I will say the stakes at times could have been higher and more gut wrenching. For example after one of the main cast died, either it should have been harder to bring them back or completely helpless. But besides that, everything else as previously mentioned was amazing.

More often than not, they usually just feel too long and lack story (or romance, drama, etc.). Slime, however, is a unique series of the genre that surprises the viewer in a variety of ways and sets the bar for what the new age of Shonen should be. If that was confusing, just think about the genre it sits and conceptualize the elements you think it should have. Now, with that in mind, think about the ways...it could broaden it\'s elements to fit easily into other genre\'s and suddenly you\'re watching Slime. It has such a wide variety of elements that I don\' even dare listing them all, but trust when I say, it\'s got something for everyone.Where I envisioned another lame isekai, I got an intriguing backstory in a unique setting. Where I envisioned fighting elements... comedy and romance came to the forefront. Slime had me hooked from the first episode. It wasn\'t necessarily any one thing, but it\'s hard to be bored when every scene is a blast to take part in. It\'s a show that surpasses many others, just in it\'s execution. Some series will rely solely on their story or characters for good will from the viewer, but can fall short elsewhere like art style. Slime veers from the norm to bring a fully fleshed out series of loveable character, superb sound, fun settings, interesting plot, and deep lore.The story of a Slime becoming an all powerful demon lord that ends up leading a nation, is not a synopsis most would expect. However, to me, Slime is one of the most unique original series I\'ve ever seen. Personally, growing up in the US, I\'m unfamiliar with what a slime even is, and had it not been for anime, I still wouldn\'t know. Basically, I didn\'t have any particular expectations other than...another Isekai. Luckily each episode was new and fresh feeling, with every new character as interesting as the last. The friendships and locations are what make Slime the series that it is, and I haven\'t come across many that didn\'t appreciate the variety it has to offer.I decided to review season 2 for a few reasons. While season 1 was great, season 2 outclasses it by just a little, in both substance and design. I know I said the fighting elements weren\'t the only good parts to the series, but they do play a heavy role. The visuals from certain characters skills were so epic that I\'d be daring enough to compare it shows like Fate (although in my eyes, Fate still wins). Slime takes those fights to a new level and adds unique abilities as well. The skills aren\'t necessarily a new or original concept, but I love the way they\'re presented. In one moment, a skill known as "" Megiddo"" is used, and because of all the elements, you feel the weight of it\'s power. I\'ve rewatched the last few episodes of part 1 and shown it to my friends on many occasions...the fight scenes are just that worth it. Fighting isn\'t the whole show however.One of my particularly favorite elements is the sound design. I can\'t boast about this show\'s sound effects anymore than I already have. Doors opening, footsteps, slime sounds, getting stabbed...all sound great and come through crystal clear (so much so, it feels genuinely real). But it\'s not just sounding real that enthralls the viewers. Sound effects can even feel unique, as certain abilities emit sounds the audience have most likely never heard before. In one scene, the orc lord uses a ""stepping"" skill, where he slams his foot down as an AOE attack. During this attack, the visuals of purple waves come pouring out with a low bass techno tone right behind. Whoever\'s idea to include dub step as fight sounds, was a genius to say the least. This isn\'t unique to just the Orc\'s skills though, because without the similar sound effects peppered throughout the entire series, I wouldn\'t have felt nearly as impacted by the fight scenes as a whole. Weighted bass tones, or other unique sfx, carry you into the fight, while other elements help keep your attention, such as the visuals. It\'s difficult to fully comprehend what makes sound so impactful for a show, but if you\'ve experienced it, then you should know what I mean.I don\'t like just referencing the fight scenes when doing a review, but one in particular is still my favorite of any series. I won\'t spoil it, but there is a sword fight that occurs where time altering skills are used, leading to a wild battle sequence. The color scheme, sound effects, and dialogue all make it worthwhile. If you just skipped to this scene, I\'d dare to say it alone could make you want to watch the rest. It, in total, lasts about 3-5 minutes, but surprised me every step of the way. There are also plenty of other sequences I haven\'t mentioned that carry a similar vibe. So much so, I\'d rather you experience them for yourself.The characters and their motivations are so clear, and I couldn\'t help but empathize fully with the ""good guys"", considering the opponents are as vile as vile can get this season. Because of the events of this series, it\'s clear there are consequences to be had, making each sequence that much more tense. On top of this, there is such a large variety of abilities that not one character seems unoriginal. It\'s not all death and destruction though. Plenty of other characters are there solely for drama or comedic purposes and they fulfill there roles flawlessly. The emotional moments hit deep and the somber moments still bring you along. I rarely found myself drifting.I\'ll close out by saying it\'s not easy conveying what makes Slime a show worth watching. I can tell you the story was exciting and the characters unique, as well as emphasize the quality of sound and visuals. However, you should witness these qualities for yourself, I can\'t do it true justice. Yes, reviews where the story is the main catalyst are easier for me to write, but shows where each role is done so well should also be made known. I will say other shows have done specific things better and Slime is most certainly not a perfect anime, but it\'s certainly worth the time to watch...no matter your preference in genres. it could broaden it\'s elements to fit easily into other genre\'s and suddenly you\'re watching Slime.

I expected yet another garbage isekai but it was fun, interesting and kinda deep in storytelling.Second season is a complete disaster. Sloppy storytelling, unnecessary filler scenes, almost non-existent plot. If it was a 24-episode anime it would be totally fine but it`s not. As a 12-episode anime this season is the worst isekai of this anime season.The only good part of it is a Myulan arc. I don`t really enjoy romantic storylines in adventure\\action anime but this was a solid and almost mature story and Myulan is a very likeable character.I still have high hopes for summer season of...our fiendish\\friendly slime-kun though. our fiendish\\friendly slime-kun though.', 'I really liked the previous season. It was decent, especially compared to waves of isekai crap that were so popular at that time. But this?It\'s horrendous.Otherworlders are useless shits with a character of a 3rd rate grunt A.Power levels lost their sense.Music sounded like something remixed from free samples. It kind of sounds like old school 8bit music if you increase speed enough, but normally it\'s unbearable.The worst thing is that the whole story seems to be written by edgy 13 y.o. Not going to spoil it, but everything seems to be forced to explain the MC decision which was basically: ""Oh hey, the literal...wiki of the world doesn\'t know that, but some random, deus ex machina gal heard that there is that thing you can do to reverse everything bad that has just happened.""I\'m not going to ask if the author thought that readers are retarded, it\'s too obvious.Well, at least the art was decent enough to not hurt your eyes.Don\'t expect much from it, at least from the later episodes. My only hope is that next season won\'t be THIS bad. wiki of the world doesn\'t know that, but some random, deus ex machina gal heard that there is that thing you can do to reverse everything bad that has just happened.""I\'m not going to ask if the author thought that readers are retarded, it\'s too obvious.Well, at least the art was decent enough to not hurt your eyes.Don\'t expect much from it, at least from the later episodes. My only hope is that next season won\'t be THIS bad.', ""Slime's biggest attraction for some is its biggest weakness for others.Right from the start of the show and until the end of this second season, there is no danger. There is none, because the goal of this show is to let our main character show how big his slimeyhood is. The more he's able to do so, the more fun the show gets. Seriously, my least favorite part of this season is when *SPOILERS* Rimuru isn't able to beat Hinata, it felt like the party was over. In principle this really shouldn't work, but for some reason it does for me and many others.This anime...is just so wholesome and FUN! It is shallow, repetitive and beyond predictable, but it's still fun. I think this show hits the spot in terms of the appeal of Isekai. No Isekai lets you project onto the protagonist and feel powerful better. I honestly thought it would get boring at some point, but when *SPOILERS* Rimuru turns into a demon lord it just feels so satisfying, like I just unlocked a super rare ability in a video game. This show is like a dopamine supplier.If you don't enjoy the vibe of trashy op hero fantasy shows, this show has absolutely nothing to offer for you. Yet, if you're like me and you do like the concept but you feel as if most shows execute it badly, slime isekai is seriously going to fill that now slime shaped hole perfectly for you. is just so wholesome and FUN! It is shallow, repetitive and beyond predictable, but it's still fun. I think this show hits the spot in terms of the appeal of Isekai. No Isekai lets you project onto the protagonist and feel powerful better. I honestly thought it would get boring at some point, but when *SPOILERS* Rimuru turns into a demon lord it just feels so satisfying, like I just unlocked a super rare ability in a video game.

It definitely started a bit slow, but it ended very strong. The adaptation failed to capture some of brilliant scenes from the manga or even the light novel. But its certainly isn't a bad adaptation. Animation are fluid and very good. I'd be surprised if it weren't, since its like the only project 8bit worked on for like 2 years. I really like the character designs for newer chracters. Rimuru's stature change after each power up is an appreciated detail.  Opening are very great, not as great...as previous but nonetheless still very sweet. Rimuru's voice actor achieved some pretty great scenes and Diablo is plain cool. Rimuru has once again become more mature and less naive. Will wait how they decide to adapt Diablo in the second cour.

It was overral pretty enjoyable, but I was still surprised when a second season was announced relatively early.Then, going into the second season, the world is expanded some more, and with the growth of Tempest, new villains are quick to show up.Story: 6/10There is nothing in the story that stands out as \'great writing\', the fundamentals are well put and exploited properly.The first few episodes of the second season go by in the most casual way possible, nothing major happens, everything is absolutely fine. The problem with the story is the direction it takes after the arrival of the villains, those being the Demon Lord Clayman, who uses the Majin Mjurran as his puppet, as well as the kingdom of Falmuth, which has the support of the church.Clayman shows up again using with Mjurran to infiltrate Tempest. The Majin gains the confidence of the people of Tempest and acts as a spy for Clayman. Clayman plots to bring war upon Tempest, apparently planning on gaining power from the deaths caused by it, as stated by Rimuru.Now let me ask you a question: do you care at all about Mjurran?If you do I can only assume that either you get attached to characters way too easily or that I am heartless (I did care about how Rimuru would take care of her, and as expected, he did so as if it was the most trivial thing possible). Mjurran does have a fair bit of screentime but nothing too major happens to have the audience fall for her, aside from her good looks and an apparently sad backstory.Tempest\'s growth starts to harm Falmuth\'s economy. Falmuth then plots, alongside the church, to destroy Tempest as soon as possible, beggining a surprise attack on the main city of Rimuru.A few special individuals from Falmuth are moved first to try and cause chaos inside the city. These three characters are introduced as Japanese people summoned into this world to serve as pawns for Falmuth.They are villains just for the sake of it. They act as a catalyst for the viewer to despise and wish for the main cast\'s victory, nothing more than that.After a scene showing how these three villains are unable to cause much trouble, the church and Mjurran come into action; the church sets up a barrier all around the city, weakening monsters, while Mjurran sets up an anti-magic barrier, compromising the communication between the city and Rimuru.While the events unfold, Rimuru tries to go back to Tempest but is attacked right away, the enemy sets up a barrier, weakening Rimuru and bringing him close to death.What follows is the defeat of the city of Rimuru by the three japanese villains and Falmuth\'s army, bringing a lot of casualties to Tempest.The episodes in which these events unfold do have a decent pacing and are treated seriously, that is, until Rimuru comes back to Tempest. The supporting characters constantly try to keep the tragedy a secret from Rimuru for little reason. Rimuru heals a few of the survivors and deals with Mjurran. These scenes mostly have a bad pacing, being annoying at times, the dialoges are generic and what follows the seriousness of the tragedy is an even worse comic relief, the characters are almost back to being happy after generic scene N.133092. Apologies made, everything is fine again, some characters provide Rimuru with a plot-driving information, Rimuru sets up a plan to deal with everything.The seriousness of the previous episodes is all but back, as if it never existed, and I find myself bored and angry at the way the plot developed.If there is any satisfaction in seen how Rimuru turns everything around, which is already pretty much disclosed on episode 10, it does not make up for the lack of depth the story was developed with.Art: 8/10Nothing much to be discussed about the art/animation, it is solid and can be flashy when needed, just like the first season.Character: 7/10The main and support cast are decent at best, there are too many characters and too little time to have even the main cast grow at all, since there is no focus even in the drama between the Majin, the hero(s) and Grucius. That said, the design is fine and the characters are likeable and have at least some charisma.Villains are just that and add little to the story as a whole, no background is shown and there is nothing likeable about them.

It leaves off after the Slime Side Story about Rimuru's teaching experiences, which is nice.The show has a strong usage of suspense, which makes each episode thrilling and an addicting watch.The first couple episodes start a bit slow, but it soon ramps up very quickly. There is a strong point of climax, and multiple arcs present. Before each large arc begins, it feels like a...couple episodes are used to introduce a bunch of information. That part is a little uninteresting, but with the compelling nature of the show, it is by no means a bummer.The plot is unique and interesting and a good watch if you enjoyed season 1. Slime Diaries is not required for Season 2. If you liked Season 1, but did not like Slime Diaries, you will still most likely like Season 2.Art - 9=====As a disclaimer, I'm not too keen on art anyway, so this is not my area of expertise. I will note when the art is beautiful, but generally, it's good and follows some relative convention. The art follows the standard that most isekai in 2021 follow, but the animations for magic were well done. The art was very pretty and flowed well with the moves. I liked that CG was not used that often (I'm not a huge fan), and the animators relied more on 2D animation.Sound - 9=====Nothing incredibly spectacular about the music. It was fitting, but nothing really eye-catching.The OP and END songs also didn't really catch my eye as songs to listen to outside of the show.As for the voice actors, as usual, I have no complaints- I think they all did excellent. I think my score here comes mostly from my love for the voice actor Takehito Koyasu, who plays the role of 'evil royalty' brilliantly. He also plays Roswaal L. Mathers in Re:Zero, so you might have heard him then.Character - 10=====Each new character introduced felt fresh and interesting. I was surprised to see how aesthetically well each character was, and how consistent the character's actions were in lines with their background, experiences, and abilities.I don't want to spoil who is introduced, so I will not mention specific names.Each character has their unique personality and watching them relate with other ones gives each one depth.Character growth can be seen across the season from both Rimuru and others around him- this is quite enjoyable to watch.Enjoyment - 9=====I think I came into this season not expecting too much. I saw some of Slime Diaries but the slice of life aspect did not really appeal to me.But as new characters were introduced, suspense was built, and plot points were advanced, I got roped very into the core of the show, and kept watching and watching. It was fun; I lost track of time when I watched.Finding an absolute joy in this show was a pleasant surprise and I'm looking forward to what is next for this show.Overall - 10=====Slime S2 was on-point; it delivered an experience stronger than Slime Season 1, and proved an incredibly enjoyable watch. For anybody who is looking for a continuation of Season 1, I would definitely recommend this. If you think about quitting, just know that I would endure through the slower episodes, because the plot that follows that is absolutely worth it.This is a great watch for sure. couple episodes are used to introduce a bunch of information.

I personally hated the entire pacing, writing, and characters of the show.

Well, it's only 12 episodes If it's 20+ like ss1 It can go deeper than this. some of the scenes that are too fast make me feel not immersed in it and immersion to the anime is the thing that makes me felt addicted to it.I like the slime soundtrack it makes me more emotional to the scenes.Some characters in this season's background are too soft for me to understand why anyone does something like that.Overall....great season 2 despite me having high expectations for this series to get deeper than now.Waiting for ss3P.S.

The isekai genre kind off make me to not continue watch this series. A lot of stuffs happened and I have been told that the S1's pacing was too fast and rushed.On the second season, the pacing was a bit slower and nicely done. Also, I always enjoy listening to the opening and ending song. Second season gave us a better look and glimpse of the other Demon Lords and also an origin story of Milim. Rimuru always...been a chilled guy but this time, he has to face a bit of difficulties as the other nations and influenced people became wary of his new and fast-growing country.The animation has been good. New characters also been a great 'spice and salt' to the plot. I always look forward to see more of Rimuru and his people adventures.Now on to the bad side, one thing that kind of annoyed me a bit is the villains. Which is in this season was Demon Lord Clayman. But i guess his interactions with out slime boy will have to wait until Season 2 Part 2. Solid 8/10 from me!!! been a chilled guy but this time, he has to face a bit of difficulties as the other nations and influenced people became wary of his new and fast-growing country.The animation has been good.

It felt so good to finally see the characters I got to know last season doing new stuff. I must say I agree with MALs scores on the seasons. The second one is better.I haven't wathced any other isekais, but I do know a lot about some others, and the story on this one just feels way more unique. I talked about this in my review of the first season. Perhaps you should maybe still take my opinions with a grain of salt, since I still haven't seen any other...isekais.

By episode 6, I was debating giving this 7/10.After the half-way mark though, I feel like this season really improved, bringing some fantastic tertiary characters and how rimuru dealt with them.What I dislike about Tensura is that it is mostly based on rimuru winning consecutively, but this season halted that trend with some important plot points. I feel like this has built to the character of rimuru. I do think the plot still feels a bit deus ex machina because the plot is based around how rimuru will WIN, rather than...how he effectively RESPONDS to said problem. This creates a disconnect between the protagonist and the viewer because there is a small sense of risk in rimuru's life, even with everything against him because rimuru has a seemingly perfect mentality, preventing him from being too psychologically damaged to make any rash mistakes, hence being too unrealistic.The art in some scenes is absolutely fantastic. Episode 10-11 is pure eye candy. The sound is pretty cool but the score is a bit corny for my liking.The plot progresses slowly, yet a lot of information is given in this time so it does feel like my boots are filled when it comes to lore in this anime. This is a typical tactic used by fantasy authors, where backstory becomes so integral that it is the sole driving force (e.g.b. attack on titan, code geass and this.)The biggest gripe I have with this season is the ridiculous amounts of filler. It's far too much. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it. Great proceeding season for an interesting take on the isekai genre. Will come back for later seasons how he effectively RESPONDS to said problem.

But there's still so much that has to be fixed.Firstly, the character development. I mean, the only character properly developed is Rimuru and Shizu (because there's the whole backstory). But of course, Shizu just gets eaten up by Rimuru right after their first meeting. So, Rimuru is basically the only character to have character development. The other characters like Benimaru, Souei and others barely get any character development.Secondly, the story itself. This story is kinda weird. Basically the whole story is:1. Rimuru meets bad guy2. Rimuru BEATS the bad guy3. Bad guy suddenly respects Rimuru...and follows him FOREVER.I mean, if the story is meant for young children, I get it, but there's kinda too much killing and fan service for it to be a children show. So the story is average isekai plot at most.Overall, I think the art was great and it was pretty ok for an isekai.

There is so much that has improved from the first season. Even though this is just the first part of the second season, I'm still excited nonetheless.The story has improved quite well, to a degree. This time around, the main focus of this season is a bit one-sided and forced. From the beginning of the second season, you end up assuming about the story. However, that assumption of yours is immediately kicked down. It's not bad, but it was more different than I imagined it was going to be. The entire first season and the...first few episodes make you assume that the plot would go one way, but it ends up going the other. Think of this season as an edgier upgrade to the first, while carrying the same torch.The characters are all the same quality as the first season, but the plot kinda dulls them down in one form or another. The newly introduced characters in this season are more in focus, while the reoccurring characters feel a bit washed out due to the story and how it's presented.

This review will have no explicit spoilers as it concerns the structure and craftsmanship on display, but may make some comments concerning the structure that can be read-into.In this review I will not break down each individual subclassification. In general the sound assets were mostly reused from season 1.  The art is a slightly less detailed at least in part, (S1 had it\'s fair share of dodgy art too) but not offensively or concerning so.The aspect I found most agitating watching this was the...pacing, honestly giving the story a 5 was rather generous.  The entering episodes were somewhat languid but pleasant, although didn\'t feel like much beyond a ""B"" story.  I felt a little let down at the time, little did I know that these would be the highlight of the season for me.  The primary issue being the following Arc. The actual development felt a mix of painfully slow at times, then (infuriatingly) rushed though the main story of the Arc without paying it the respect it deserved.  Compared to the first season which moved so fluidly from one Arc to the next, giving appropriate attention to each; it was obvious where improvements could be made.  To top this all off, the loveable characters from the first season had very few meaningful developments in S2. If anything giving them screen time only further contributed to the pacing issues, as they appeared simplified for the purpose of trudging though obligatory interactions.   There were new characters introduced, but they did very little to make an impact emotionally, serving mostly to grind the story onto the next act.  With the exception of the last two episodes, very little or merit happened in terms of head cannon development.Perhaps I\'m overly critical due to the impact and longer run time of S1, but honestly believe that the necessity from production to split the season into a ""part 1"" and ""part 2"" caused crippling pacing issues which sapped the show of its charm.Unless the reader is a dedicated slime fan, I wouldn\'t recommend this show unless the aforementioned issues are resolved in season 2 part 2. pacing, honestly giving the story a 5 was rather generous.

At first when I began watching, it took me a while to remember what happened at the end of the previous one, because it was a few years ago, but things quickly fell into place.The story continues where it was left out, at first everything seems to be going well for the main characters, but trouble strikes and at that point, I must say I was immediately hooked.The way events were portrayed really provoked emotions into me. When the bad guys started wreaking havoc, I was really overcome with negative emotions like frustration, anger, anxiety.It was...like 02:00 in the morning when I was watching it and the event got me so invested that I ended up watching it until 04:00 in the morning and after that could not fall asleep for another hour due to excitement.All the baddies were then punished in a very satisfying way.Of course, it wasn\'t all amazing, there was a lot of plot armor, so stuff were kind of predictable in a way that you can always tell who will win a fight, but also there were some shocking twists that really added to the overall tension.It\'s a shame it was only 12 episodes when the 1st season was 24 episodes. I\'m conflicted whether I should start reading the manga or wait for a new season to appear. In away I can relate this anime to Overlord with ""The Good Bad Guys"" trope where the protagonists appear evil or are regarded as such in the world, but they are actually good at least to the point of making sure their interests come into fruition without intentionally trying to harm any other party in the process and if provoked will respond not just in kind, but thrice as hard.Overall, I recommend it to people who watched the 1st season and are wondering whether they should watch this one as well, if you haven\'t seen the first one, know that the 1st season was really great and this 2nd season was even better, totally worth the watch if you\'re into this kind of anime. like 02:00 in the morning when I was watching it and the event got me so invested that I ended up watching it until 04:00 in the morning and after that could not fall asleep for another hour due to excitement.All the baddies were then punished in a very satisfying way.Of course, it wasn\'t all amazing, there was a lot of plot armor, so stuff were kind of predictable in a way that you can always tell who will win a fight, but also there were some shocking twists that really added to the overall tension.It\'s a shame it was only 12 episodes when the 1st season was 24 episodes.

"", ""Actually I am not here to review the anime only, but rather the entire franchise (novels, manga, anime, etc.), so who I am addressing here is none other than the creator, Fuse-sensei. Why am I writing this here is because this page is the most popular, sorry about that (Tee-hee ;p).I really love stories from the Tensei Slime universe, and well deserved a variety of spin-offs, I followed almost all of them. Thanks to Fuse-sensei and all the artists who illustrated and even animated this story.So this is what I'm going to say. At first, any form of loyalty from each character to their master...Rimuru did manage to spoil my heart, but it was so exaggerated that so I think it had flaws in it. I was wondering, what would happen to Rimuru's subordinates if their master died? And all I can imagine is chaos, because anyone knows that all the important characters in this story only give their love and loyalty to Rimuru, they all rely on him, respect him, and adore him, even worship him. If he dies then his subordinates will certainly lose their purpose in life, become empty, and whoever takes his place as leader, then what will arise is only strife, not because of jealousy, but more on the worthiness. I mean, we have mental illness characters like Shion and Diablo, what would happen if their master wasn't Rimuru? Those two wasn't the type who wanted to be a substitute leader if that happened, but the type who only wanted to serve Rimuru. So this is the kind of flaws that I mean. Maybe it would be a different story if only Rimuru could have children, I don't really know. Rimuru did manage to spoil my heart, but it was so exaggerated that so I think it had flaws in it.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love slime, It's been my #1 anime since I finished the first season, and that hasn't changed. But the second season has just been a large let down in my opinion.When the first season ended, I was just extremely hyped for the next season. So much so I decided to read ahead in the light novel. I started where the last arc in the anime ended and read past where the anime is currently, and a little bit...past where the first part of this season seems like it's going to end. My opinion on that? Amazing. I loved every bit of it. But I didn't want to read too far ahead as I didn't want to burn out on the story and honestly I was contempt with waiting for the anime adaptation of the arc, which is my favourite arc in slime so far. I even caught up with the manga when it got to the current arc too.The anime on the other hand? Well, firstly the second season had to cover the content from the light novel that was skipped in the first season, so I wasn't as mad about that, because obviously they shouldn't of skipped the content to begin with but anyway, it wasn't just random filler content and it actually is important. It also was decent but it has the same issue with it as the rest of the season, which is its animation. Dear god the animation is just, bad. It's somehow a downgrade even though it's being made by the same studio that made the first season. If I was to put the animation for the season on a scale, 1 being Seven Deadly Sins season 3, and 10 being Jujutsu Kaisen, the first season would be around a 7 and this season would be a 3.While I plan on finishing this season, I'm really not sure if I will watch the second half, especially if the animation stays as bad as it currently is. If that is the case, I cannot recommend more to read the light novel or even the manga instead. Especially considering it honestly ruined what is my favourite arc so far. Honestly I'm not even sure what I would rate this season of the show. If I'm going to mention each of the ratings, I'd give Story a 10, Art a 3, Sound a 8 or a 9, Character a 10 and Enjoyment a 6 (It would be lower if some of the horrid animation wasn't hilariously bad). which would lead my overall to be around 7 or an 8, but honestly I don't know if it even deserves that, let alone a higher average rating than the first season. past where the first part of this season seems like it's going to end.

Isekai OP MC with cheat ability check. This is as generic it can get for isekai stories. As a slime he got predator AND great sage. That\'s a cheat ability on top of a cheat ability. Then with both cheats, he became pretty much overpowered in just a few weeks along with the name blessing with Veldora. Was there a struggle? Somewhat, but the blessing and his cheat pretty much makes those struggle pretty much a given now. There\'s no difficulty at all.Second, the...territory progression. Imagine creating the one of most technically advanced nation in just about 2 years. All the other nations existed way longer before Tempest was born, but lo-and-behold Tempest has become more technologically advanced than most nations in just about 2 years.The city-building itself is unrealistic. The city was like built in a year and it\'s design was already better than other nations. The presence of advanced technology is understandable but the rate of it appearing is unrealistic, considering that there\'s practically only 4 skilled dwarves in Tempest. Sure, magic exists, but chalking it up to ""magic"" and just whip out a very advanced civilization is a very lazy approach to world building.But wait a moment, we have a justifiable reason for the stunted technological advancement, right? Yes, Tensura has. That is the Great Tenma War. It is a time where angels descend from the heavens and pretty much targets the most technologically advanced nation. It\'s an understandable reason, but despite that, nations which experienced that a few times already never devised a countermeasure and just supposedly decided that stunting the growth of technology is best answer. That\'s pretty much the decision for almost all nations in Tensura. And in all honesty, with all those prideful rulers and in Tensura, none of them rose to the task and tried. With such an event happening every 500 years, somewhere around 100-200 years after each war should be enough to for the next generation of prideful rulers to not care about it and develop a countermeasure. But no, most nations just sat there without preparing countermeasures and let their nation sink every 500 years.Rimuru is dumb as shit. This is literally one of the main reason Tensura has a plot. Rimuru was an adult before reincarnation. He is a working adult, remind you. That means, he had experienced and met so many different individuals, good and bad. Despite that, Rimuru has practically almost no sense of caution when confronting others. He comes out as a person that almost literally trust anyone he meets on the get-go A very generic personality which can be seen in a lot isekai protags. In addition, there are a lot of cases and problems which would have been easily resolved if Rimuru just stopped and listened to his very OP skill Great Sage. Majority of the time, Rimuru just chalks it up as a joke and shelf it.You can even say that Great Sage is the brain, and Rimuru is the heart. Since, for the most part, he just stopped thinking and did whatever. This is despite him becoming a ruler of a nation. He wanted notes from Gazel on how to rule a nation but he barely uses or improves upon those knowledge. A huge waste for character development, honestly. This is also despite that he was an adult and should have at least the bare minimum idea or knowledge of management. But his experience as an adult was also thrown in the trash as well like it did not exist at all.Last is the rest of the cast. Every single one of them is basically a Rimuru fanatic. If Rimuru says to take their own life, they most likely will. Them not retaliating when the humans swooped in to burn the city was the most frustrating part of the story. Every single one of them is so focused on making that be ""good to humans"" true that they rather die than not follow it. At that point, everyone was just an unthinking puppet. Rimur just started fixing this after they died.Overall, Tensura is generally fun, but falls into a lot of problems people tend to ignore. territory progression.

But because of the character's actions, I was disgusted half of the time. I like to binge animes, and couldn't concentrate half of the time because some of the gestures were so repulsive, that I felt disgusted even 2 episodes after. I don't know why, it usually doesn't bother me, but these gestures repeatedly appear in almost every episode, rendering them unenjoyable for me. For example lip licking. One of the most disgusting act in an anime. It is ok once, but not 10 times. It all started with that Kirara girl. She was very revolting, along...with her gang. I understand that they tried to make them as unlikable as possible, but there is a limit. The contrast is too big compared to the rest of the show. It is just my personal opinion, but because of these things I think I will only remember this part of the anime as disgusting, and I won't watch it again. Nothing was wrong with season 1, let's hope for the best in the next installment. with her gang. I understand that they tried to make them as unlikable as possible, but there is a limit.

This second season all I heard was good stuff so I was super excited. Even re-watched S1 to refresh my memory. And then season 2 started...I tapped out by episode 4. Don't get me wrong. It's not bad. But it's not good. It's just boring. The visual and VA is amazing for sure. But nothing really happens. You're introduced to a billion side characters and none of them gets any development. Rimura is ok as a lead, but he sways between passive and aggression that sometimes is confusing. For example, he says...no violence in other nations, but when he had visitors- the first thing he wants to do is get physical...I'm pretty sure they're trying to build this anime towards a certain plot, but I have no idea what it can be (nor do I care because I've lost interest, it's been 4 fucking episode and nothing has happened). It's like the show has ADHD. It can't focus on one story line at a time.I might pick up this anime again in the future if I'm bored.Anyways, if you like pretty animation and good VA you might like this one.

I remember how hyped everyone was after the absolutely amazing first season, but after it came out, I havent heard a single person mention it. Well there is a good reason for that. This review will have some spoilers.Episodes 1 - 5:The second season is shorter then the first one was and tries to tackle a pretty big chunk of the story. With that in mind, I seriously dont get why are these episodes here. Literally nothing happenes in these episodes so they feel really pointles. You could probably cut them out and it wouldnt really hurt the story in...any way. The only thing that is sort of set up here is the romance between Mjuraan and Youm and let me tell you, this is one of the worst romance subplots I have ever seen.Episodes 6 - 9The plot finally kicks in and its absolutely retarded. Rimuru gets attacked by some random chick, they fight for a bit and then she fucks of. Tempest gets attacked and several characters are killed. And to top it all of Mjurran betrays them and Youm defends her because his entire character is he loves Mjurran. There are several problems I want to talk a bit in depth here.1. The random attackNot much to say here. The whole scene was so random I dont really get why is it in the anime. They fight for a while and then she tries to use the nuclear option and fucks off. My guess is that she will be an important character in the future, but this encouter sucked balls.2. MjullanAs it turns out she was a secret agent of the demon lord Clayman and casts a massive barrier around Tempest. So how does Rimuru deal with her? He forgives her and the anime tries to show you that she is actually a really good person. You can turn an antagonist into a part of the main cast, both dr Stone and Re zero did exactly that and those are shows that came out in the same season as this. Sadly Mjullan is an example of how not to do this. I wouldnt really mind it if the show tried to stay lighthearted and simply didnt want to go into executing someone. This isnt the case since after this, Rimuru shows absolutely no mercy to the army and slaughters them all to the last men. Youm also betrayed Rimuru and again nothing happens to him for it. This whole subplot was just so stupid.3. Tempest gets attacked and characters dieThis part was ok at first and actually set up some scenes in the later episodes. The problem is that everyone gets revived so it made the whole thing kinda pointless. Not only that, but any death in this show will from now on have absolutely no impact since we know that Rimuru can just revive everyone. Again what a stupid thing to do.Episodes 10 - 12These 3 episodes absolutelly rescue this season. Before them I wanted to give slime something like 4/10 and be done with it, but these episodes clearly shoved us a much better anime then what we actually got. Its really sad that the enitre season couldnt be like them.So this is it. This season was a massive flop that got saved by the last few episodes. I hope that the creators learned their lesson and that the next season will be much better then this. If there is no 3rd season or it isnt good, I wouldnt reccomend watching this even if you liked the first one because you will probably be really disapointed. any way.

I\'ll also give credit for the fact that it tried, that it tried to be deeper, more realistic than the first season. Yet in the end, ""Tensei Shitara Slime"" is still a shounen show. The viewer knows that the MC will avoid defeat in every fight, and that the main side characters are nearly immortal. At least the fights are interesting and the interactions funny enough.This season is confusing For a moment I thought the good guys that died...would stay dead, that OP slime MC would finally be faced with an issue he couldn\'t overcome. Of course I was wrong. Yet while the viewer is asked to care about the lives of the main characters in an almost poignant mourning scene, not 10 minutes later we\'re expected to accept the deaths of twenty thousand humans (granted they were shown to be not good people, but still twenty thousand!) as a matter of fact and a equal sacrifice to bring back the MC\'s friends. To quote from the anime, ""this kind of idealistic world can only be created by [the MC].""So I guess the issue is that we have a heavy, bloody half coexisting with a light slice-of-life and it just feels... wrong. Don\'t misunderstand, it was entertaining for the most part. But it wasn\'t quality. would stay dead, that OP slime MC would finally be faced with an issue he couldn\'t overcome.

The last 3 episodes redeemed the show but goddamn was it a drag.The animation was very nice and colourful at the fight scenes such as Hinata vs Rimuru and the voice acting saves the show. Still, it would've been nice to see a sneak peek of black cloak Rimuru or something that hypes Part 2 up.Overall, a 7/10 anime. I never watched the first season but i got into the second season as i...heard it was where things got good and intense. heard it was where things got good and intense."", ""Continuing from the last season, the same main issue I find with this anime is the sheer amount of characters. It's similar to MHA with its main problem being too many characters that can't get enough screen time for development. Fan service is another thing I personally don't like, other people might but it's not my preference. I have not read the manga, but with how the anime is going, it seems like a huge pile of plot armor for the main side characters. I loved the first season, despite the same issues, but the second feels different imo. Still, it's very enjoyable. I would...recommend it as a watch, but don't expect something perfect from it. recommend it as a watch, but don't expect something perfect from it."", 'The first season is really good and it make on my fav top 10 isekai anime/manga and make we waiting for the 2nd season.I still followup the manga so this 2nd season is really make me excited to wonder how they gonna animated it but the excitement is fell short after few episode.There is 3 highlight for this first cour of 2nd season which is i aspected:-Tempest got raid that cost Shion life-Rimuru wrath and obliterate Falmuth kingdom-Diablo join team & DL Rimuru .The studio manage to waste 1-6 episode on the non-highlight mundane episodes and only cramp all those remain chapter of manga...of the highlight for only ONE episode each. That a waste of a lot potential good sources & chapters for anime. It feel like they rush the manga chapter and cramp it on one episode just so they can meet the requirement to end this one at ep12.Because of that this season fell short to me and i give this one 7/10 rating.Wonder why the studio tend to shiet over the fans on season2 after deliver a really good first season ie: OPM & Promise Neverland...They really put down a low expectation for the anime sequel this year for me. of the highlight for only ONE episode each.

Those part are pretty boring or mediocre at best.Afterwards, there are episode where major focus on other side characters, and other story happens without the presence of the main character. I personally felt uninterested.Then as of the most-recent episode available, it wasted half of the episode taking...about the past, and the other half just to make some strategy arrangement.

Such a waste of time.I was expecting this season to be decent since season 1 and the manga is pretty good. But Season 2 is a complete disappointment. With so many fillers, We can easily feel how the producer is trying to milk this series.Usually, when I watched an anime releasing by season, I don't expect any filler but this is a new kind of low from the producer and whoever decides this was a good idea.The fillers were soo cheesy and annoying, I feel like most hentai has a better plot and...much more entertaining than this. much more entertaining than this."", 'Note: This is a review for part 1 and part 2 of season 2.tl;dr: A more intense sequel that stays true to the spirit of the original but that very much feels like the series is really hitting it’s stride.The second season of Tensura is a continuation of the first, though the bridge between the first and second season is kind of messy. The last episode of the first season was a completely disconnected flashback centered around establishing a character that becomes more important in season 2. The episode before that ends with Rimuru on his way back to Tempest, but here’s a good amount...of overlap between the first season and second season, with the second season catching up to this scene of Rimiru returning to Tempest six episodes in. Furthermore, the OVAs released after season 1 also take place before Rimiru begins his journey back to Tempest. While it will be somewhat messy it’s best to not over complicate things and just watch all of this in release order.What’s more interesting is that the comedy focused spin off, Tensura Nikki also takes place before the finale of season 1, but was released in the gap between the first and seconds cours of season 2. As such, if watching in release order one would similarly watch Tesnura Nikki in the middle of the season 2, however I would strongly advise watching Tensura Nikki before starting season 2. The first cour of season 2 relies heavily on investment that the viewer has built up in Tempest and it’s inhabitants. I feel that season 1 doesn’t do as good of a job as it needed to in building up that sort of investment, but Tensura Nikki does an decent job of filling that hole which allows the writing in season 2 to hit some really amazing emotional beats.On that note, I found that this season overall was much better written than the first. The first season did a lot of world building, but it largely felt like it was focusing on the parts that were too smooth and simple. The second adds a lot more complexity and more importantly uses that complexity for things that were at a higher level and much more interesting than what was happening in season 1. As a result things feel like they’re progressing much faster which overall makes things much more interesting. It’s also much more liberal in providing hints and foreshadowing about what it’s leaving mysterious in regards to the large overarching plot lines which creates a better persistent sense of suspense. In order to allow for such writing, I feel the storyline this time overall was much more serious than in the first season with less comedy. And while comedy was the best part of the first season, I feel this exchange was very much still worth it. After all, there still is a good amount of comedy and what there is is still as excellent as the first season.In terms of characters in and of themselves, the writing isn’t all that improved. I wouldn’t really consider it as there being character arcs or characters being given much depth. Still, characters did grow in terms of power levels and abilities, and the anime did a really good job of showcasing this. Certain moments of evolving were handled incredibly well with what I can best describe as amazing UI work. And showcasing characters now being overpowered was also handled incredibly well. Unlike the first season, I feel it properly handled building up to the epic overpowered moments, as well as in dwelling on the aftermath an appropriate amount to really let it sink in. All of this tied into the previously mentioned investment in the cast and the town for some really amazing moments that really resonated. This season also did a great job in developing villains that were easy to hate and did a good job of making them getting crushed as satisfying as possible.The art and animation are as solid as the first season, which is pretty solid. Character design wise it’s pretty similar to the first season. There are some designs that stand out as especially great, but overall most designs aren’t all that remarkable. Due to the expanded cast there are more great designs, but the overall percentage I would say is about the same. The first ED and second OP were great in terms of songs and visuals. The first OP had good visuals as well, though the song I only found okay. The second ED was only okay in terms of songs and visuals.

The first four episodes are dedicated to side stories that are arranged in a timeline that is confusing. Rimuru leaves the kids from last season in the first episode to do some leader stuff, but then three episodes later he leaves the kids again? I didn\'t really understand that. Other than the confusing timeline, this did bring some fun, if quick, world-building with Eurazania and Dwargon, but also some...quality comedy with Shion and Shuna regarding a certain elf establishment.When the plot really kicks into gear with the introduction to Hinata and the siege that followed her actions, the anime felt like it was trying to tackle some heavy material while also not making it too heavy. This is the season that has truly tested Rimuru and pushed him beyond his boundaries. And yet, the anime does everything in its power to lighten every scene that is supposed to be conveyed as heavy and important which underhands several key scenes.Even though the anime fumbles the atmosphere and direness of the story, it does present everything in a way that makes sense for the plot to keep rolling. Overall, it\'s not as focused as the first season.Part 2 (Adaptation):Before this season started I had begun binging the light novels. This season adapts a few chapters from Vol 4 that season 1 had skipped over and then Vol 5. The 5th volume is one of my favorites in the series because it pushes Rimuru to the brink and you can feel his pain oozing off of each page. This season had so much potential~And they squandered it.The anime glosses over so many details about Rimuru\'s angst and tones-down so much of his feelings and state of mind to keep the anime as light as it has been over the last 25 episodes or so. The bright happy music and heroic theme music when Rimuru talks about revising his policy on humans is downright tone-deaf, and I audibly laughed at their (animators) decisions on how to portray those scenes. Holy shit was that poorly adapted.I can go on and list the small details that the anime ignored that actually set up the tone of the story, but then I\'d be here all night trying to list them all. Overall, this volume was adapted in a way to streamline and understand the plot. Everything that is important to know right now has been touched on, but the way they went about adapting this emotional arc was hardly satisfactory.In conclusion:I compromised. This isn\'t a terrible season, and even for an anime-only it still delivers more than other isekais. So, it\'s above average, but not great.

Good thing there are recap shows on the previous half.I want to give this season a better rating because in many aspects it deserves it: the concept is still original and approachable, the stakes are kinda real with the world evolving on it\'s own (but knda weird) pace but the animation side and...low impact on the most intense parts of the series keep them from it. I found myself waiting for more, expecting an epic conclusion to a bloody conflict since death is looming on this season.In every story, monsters are the enemy of humankind and in Slime that rule still applies, despite Rimuru\'s efforts to be a good guy. The expected human behaviour towards monster happens, and is a nice touch of drama in an otherwise light-hearted isekai: it made me care for the conflict at hand. So when the solution was for Rimuru to become a demon lord by commiting full genocide I expected some gory angles, an emotional vengeance, revenge served in the coldest of ways... yet the color palette on the show wont allow for that.Not only that but with that part being the ""peak"" of the season, returning to convoluted worldbuilding politics that keep adding more power levels to the show kinda ruined the experience. That being said, props to the sound team. I can\'t remember an isekai with so many amazing sound effects during battles.TLDR; The second season of Tensei shitara Slime Datta Ken is like its protagonist: a slime full of elements that slightly makes up for a decent story without peaking in any aspect of it. low impact on the most intense parts of the series keep them from it.

Really high highs and pretty low lows, the middle of the show was essentially one single episode stretched out into three different ones, padded by silent still images and recap flashbacks. It did mostly make up for it at the end, but still, feeling like a quarter of the show is just dead weight isn't exactly excusable... I feel like this is caused by a low budget and them wanting to center it around the end of the season, which was an ok move I guess?

Unfortunately, the development of the storyline isn\'t enough to really create tension, it\'s mostly average. However, from the structure, it can be concluded that the second part of Season 2 could be quite interesting.I would love to give as much to this season as I did to the first. But the implementation of this season was mostly sloppy. And...that really sloppy, the pacing of the episodes was almost bad, although it worked so well for the first 12 episodes of season 1.The finale in season 2 had some ""satisfying"" properties, but the implementation managed to weaken it.Especially how often one tried compulsively to shove the events into a fleeting recap. In this season alone you could count 3-4 recap attempts that stretched out over several minutes. Then most of the ""serious"" episodes failed to build any tension at all. I think episode 7 or 8 somehow made it, the rest of them had a lot more problems.In terms of the characters, practically everything stayed the same, they were still likable. The problem is that this was also pulled down again by the poor pacing.Musically, this season was the same as the previous one, only a few new Osts were added. The East in episode 11 gave the whole thing a little more charisma.I like anime and don\'t know the novel or manga. However, a lot feels completely wrong about the implementation of this season.

Only slight references to the first season will be mentioned.The first season was splendid, truly; 24 episodes with a fine story pacing, good animation, vast character cast, and enjoyable most of all. This second season however, was a lot more lacking.[!] Story: 5Having 12 episodes to fit the show\'s story for this season is not a problem at all especially since the series is still incomplete; The problem lies mostly in how the story was told. You have likely already heard from many others say...that the pacing was bad; I agree with them. There was too much time being spent on slow dialogue and flashbacks. The most prime example was during Rimuru\'s battle against Hinata. The fight could have been fit into one episode while remaining entertaining, but no, it had to take the second half of one episode - where a pointlessly long dialogue was present, and the first half of the next episode - where several minutes were spent on flashbacks to the previous episode... why would we need several minutes for a flashback of last episode? You may think that this is simple to fix, and you would likely be correct.Art: 9No qualms about the art, though. It thankfully was beautiful, smooth, thematic, and consistent. Clear signs that they added more flavor on the already good style from season 1.Sound: 10BOOM! What do you hear after a large explosion in this anime? LOUD hot air expanding, vibrating, and echoing across distances. It sure is not music, but it sure is realistically damn good to hear. You likely will not hear anything like it in many other shows. Personally the most enjoyable factor in this anime; it\'s the one grace that carried this season.Character: 6Anyways, yes, 6. The old set of characters from last season are fine, I find little issues with most of them. However, the newly introduced characters, mainly the antagonists, are the most problematic. The most accurate description I can give them is ""incomplete"". They simultaneously seem smart and dumb. Falmuth, the so-called trading center in the region, is ruled by a king. For such a prestigious nation, it must have good set of resources to stay alive, and a wise leader to handle the country. Not to say that kings necessarily have to be all-knowing, advisors exist for that reason, but the king of Falmuth... is there even anything he\'s good at, that he became a king of such a country?Enjoyment: 7Enjoyment comes in various forms. Discovery, theorizing, comedy, revelation, satisfaction, etc.. The show hits a check on many aspects. However, a single bad apple has the capability ruin a set of good apples. The worst bad apple here, was evidently the bad pacing. Fortunately for me, it does not affect me as much since like I said before, the story is not yet done. Fortunately as well, episode 11 in this season is very high in quality and really took out the bad apple. It truly speaks for its quality by making up for the previous episodes. Episode 12 meanwhile sets a good foundation for future events.Overall: 7Assuming of course that you have watched the first season, if you are going to watch this, just do take note that the pacing in most of the season is bad compared to last season, but that should NOT deter you from continuing to watch the series. There is still a lot more to tell, and Veldora is still inside Rimuru...That concludes my review. Hopefully, the next cour has a more workable pacing. that the pacing was bad; I agree with them. There was too much time being spent on slow dialogue and flashbacks. The most prime example was during Rimuru\'s battle against Hinata. The fight could have been fit into one episode while remaining entertaining, but no, it had to take the second half of one episode - where a pointlessly long dialogue was present, and the first half of the next episode - where several minutes were spent on flashbacks to the previous episode... why would we need several minutes for a flashback of last episode? You may think that this is simple to fix, and you would likely be correct.Art: 9No qualms about the art, though. It thankfully was beautiful, smooth, thematic, and consistent. Clear signs that they added more flavor on the already good style from season 1.Sound: 10BOOM! What do you hear after a large explosion in this anime? LOUD hot air expanding, vibrating, and echoing across distances. It sure is not music, but it sure is realistically damn good to hear. You likely will not hear anything like it in many other shows. Personally the most enjoyable factor in this anime; it\'s the one grace that carried this season.Character: 6Anyways, yes, 6. The old set of characters from last season are fine, I find little issues with most of them. However, the newly introduced characters, mainly the antagonists, are the most problematic. The most accurate description I can give them is ""incomplete"". They simultaneously seem smart and dumb. Falmuth, the so-called trading center in the region, is ruled by a king. For such a prestigious nation, it must have good set of resources to stay alive, and a wise leader to handle the country. Not to say that kings necessarily have to be all-knowing, advisors exist for that reason, but the king of Falmuth... is there even anything he\'s good at, that he became a king of such a country?Enjoyment: 7Enjoyment comes in various forms. Discovery, theorizing, comedy, revelation, satisfaction, etc.. The show hits a check on many aspects. However, a single bad apple has the capability ruin a set of good apples. The worst bad apple here, was evidently the bad pacing. Fortunately for me, it does not affect me as much since like I said before, the story is not yet done.

If a sequel doesn\'t have the same vibe/feeling I\'ve felt seeing in first season, then no matter how many times it had been delay due to the desire of wanting to animate properly, I\'ll be feeling lackluster.In fact, Slime\'s first season was and will still be a great prologue to me, especially with making me giving its rewatch value a 10/10.This season, however....the rewatch value is a 6.5/10 because I\'m aware of the recaps being disguised as internal monologue or dialogue involving the development from the first season\'s content.But it\'s not the recaps...that made me rate lower than first season. A lot of the new characters seem to be underdeveloped & have their portrayal being compressed too much, especially of a human\'s lover where she seems to fall on love with him at first sight when in actuality, it\'s been a month or two according to LN readers. Then, there\'s the Arch Demon (from that final episode that manages to leave a lasting impact in my memory) just showing up in the final two episodes of this first part. I get why he was there, but it didn\'t explained how Slime MC is aware of the Summoning Ritual of Demons unless the internal monologue of his Great Sage Skill goes off-screen, telling him he should summon the Arch Demon.I appreciate this season going on a darker route that there\'s an episode saying ""Sensitive Scenes that young viewers must exercise caution before watching this episode."" and that episode manages to be a satisfying episode. Nevertheless, it\'s not enough for me to give a high rating due to many scenes in these few final episodes going too fast due to ""compression"".There are so many stuff happening in this part\'s second half that I had to agree with the people saying about the first season going too fast. And it did for I noticed the pacing is unbalanced with the first few episodes going too slow, then in the middle section, it\'s even, finally the final few episodes going too fast.One thing that prevented me from giving a lower rating is the animation quality being consistent but maybe not as great as the first season.I suspect/speculate there\'s production issues and the production committees giving the animators a hard choice and time to write scenes being compressed to this season\'s duration time limit. Nevertheless, they, along with other studios helping the 8bit team, did well on the artwork, character designs & animation movements under a harsh, tight schedule (which I really hope there\'s a proposed Bill of eliminating the unnecessary tight schedule made by the PCs in light of Cloverworks\' notorious work schedule).I only recommend this season \'s first part if you still love the first season with all your heart, mind & soul because if you don\'t, you\'re gonna be disappointed with how the storytelling\'s pacing turns out.I suggest you should purchase the LN source material for a better understanding and satisfying pacing when you feel like this season\'s first part is underwhelming and have a lackluster closure. that made me rate lower than first season.

It seems like the story keeps building for this epic battle, but the outcome is not worth it. I do reckon that on episode 10 we do have an amazing action show, on the other hand the sacrifice for the battle scenes was the story sinking.It is a boring show, they propose something at first, but then it seems they forgot what was proposed. Not only,...some decisions that would bring weight to the story are completely scrapped by plot armour, so they feel pointless. For instance, at some point we are told there a small chance of success for something related to a number of people, statistically I would be more interested if they kept that number say on a scale of 100, only 3 managed to reach the statistic would feel more real.""It is an isekai show and you expect real?"" No, I expect that what was proposed within the show kept being applied, such as the full potion that ""heal everything"" except when they don\'t, or the the slime\'s diplomatic stance that go backwards when his own nation forgot what scouts are supposed to do. some decisions that would bring weight to the story are completely scrapped by plot armour, so they feel pointless.

This may be a small reason for dropping a series, but the anime turned one of my favorite scenes from the manga, which was dark and terrifying and overall a very chilling characterization of Rimuru, into a joke scene that lasted only a few seconds at best. I was looking forward to it so much and it disappointed me so badly that...I stopped watching the season. This is a late review and I honestly don't even remember which episode it happened in since I watched them as they released. That episode count is honestly just a guess since I remember there being a few more episodes left that had yet to air. Maybe I'll finish watching the season eventually.Other than that, I remember the pacing feeling fast. I also may have enjoyed it up to when I dropped it, but it's not like it's the best anime I've ever seen either. Even if I pick the series back up in the future I don't think it'll be worth a rewatch. I hate being that person, but the manga really is better in this case. I stopped watching the season.

All while acting cool-like, thinking she\'s doing the right thing by avenging her master.Also, Rimuru could\'ve talked to her about what happen while they\'re crossing swords, instead of practically keep repeating ""please stop and listen to me.""Ep. 6 bothers me so much because its a massive plotholes. If Hinata couldve used the 2 brain cells she got left, this...war would\'ve ended so quick, Rimuru would\'ve arrived at Tempest much quicker and counter attack much quicker, without suffering so many damage to the city and so many people dying. (which leads to the typical bullshit of reviving everyone because its rimuru and he can do anything)Edit:Also, if Myulan was ready to die and take all the blame from the start, then why did she create that barrier??? just say no to Clayman and get your heart crushed or smth, i dont understand... Honestly fuck Myulan and those 2 simps. She clearly caused the deaths of many citizens and they still defend her just because it\'s a women. The plot triggers in this season is just so stupid. war would\'ve ended so quick, Rimuru would\'ve arrived at Tempest much quicker and counter attack much quicker, without suffering so many damage to the city and so many people dying.

The plot triggers in this season is just so stupid.', ""I made an account just so I can vent my frustrations, this anime was a huge letdown and considering how poular it is it makes me wonder if fans of iskeai (or anime in general) ever think of the stuff they watch but anyway let's get started with some context.Ever since I watched Mushoku Tensei I wanted to get more knowledge when it comes to the Isekai genre so little by little I've been watching anime that are considered the best, started with Re: Zero, then overlord, you get the point. I enjoyed Re: Zero more than i expected and now I consider it 2nd...best Isekai behind Mushoku and then... Overlord happened and man that was not good. You might be thinking why i'm saying all of this well it's because Overlord very similar mistakes that slime does the difference is I have more personal hate for Overlord but i digress.Anyway what do you think it's important in a story? I find something that should be at least a minimum is that the story matters. What do i mean by that? It's simple a story shouldn't have a conflict that is always solved in a very easy and effortless way, why?because if the main character always wins with little to no problems at all then what's the point? what's the point of seeing a character just win every battle and have no consecuences for their actions? nothing will ever meaningful, nothing will ever be compelling and every conflict that arises will never have any tension, that is what happened to Slime season 2, it became a pointless series with no real story to tell.Slime had it's issues even back in S1, Rimuru seemed way to naive about the world and incredibly forgiving to the point that it almost hurts, everyone loves him (mind you everyone that isn't a bad guy) and he's nothing but helpful, always finds a solution and every problem that arises only serves to help him more and more (keep this one in mind with my previous paragraph).Let's actually talk about the anime on episode 8 Rimuru gets some pretty sad news, the village he looks after has been partially destroyed, some people (goblins but whatever) died including his secretary (someone who he definitely feels very atached) and overall things are looking bad, it's not the worst mind you but it is a loss. Now when all of this happened I was very happy (i'm not a psycopath i swear) mind you not becuase of the characters that died but because Slime Jesus was finally having some karma, the consequences of his actions, and because of said consequences he has lost people dear to him, because he's naive and doesn't quite understand how the world works where there are goinf to be people that wanna take him down, that wanna destroy him even if it is for money or less, reality is not fun but then... then the scene happens.A few minutes later another character shows up, her name is Eren (had to look the episode up because i forget about every character's name) and in a twist she's actually an elf princess or whatever (man for such an important girl she sure has the worst bodyguards ever, great twist anime sigh) and turns out there's a chance to save everyone but mind you this whole chance thing it's just here to make it seem like it might not work or even save everyone but as you might guess everyone gets save without any problems. Then after the very convienent princess with the very convienent information with the very convienent sircumstances that is keeping everyone's souls trapped Rimuru very convienently gets the perfect amount of people to kill and absorb (the whoile army is attacking them after all) all the people so that he can convieniently become a demon lord and save everyone, making the consequences of his actions completely null, you get the point.So yeah this is the season that broke the camels back, after finsihing season 2 (part 1 & 2) I will not be watching the 3rd, same with overlors S5 or whatever they do with it, they both have about the same problems, they seem to really have no conflcit or lasting consecuences, they main characters are always amazing and smart and have no flaws (that the other characters are aware mind you) they have incredible power early on and in the case of slime he only gets stronger and stronger because of the amazing gifts he was given very early on. To wich i have to ask again to everyone, what's the point? what's the point of caring? what's the point of the show if they can't even suffer any consecuences of challenges?Overall slime is just a wast of time, it's no different than any isekai power fantasy with no real depth or story to tell, it is a shallow at times boring and pointless show, just like any other Isekai that is not the exception (Mushoku, Zero)it doesn't have any interesting or good characters, none of them grow, to say that Rumuri gets develpment would be infactual as the only thing that changed was his rule against killing humans, besides that he is the same (on that note he sure gives the benefit and forgiveness to monsters but god forgive you give them to those soldiers Rumuri, you hypocrite).So yeah just ot finsih things up this anime is not good, it's quite flawed and while i would like to talk more about it the reality is that I don't care enough to do so, it already stole enough time from me, the only positive thing I can say bout it it's that i hate it less than Overlord, that's it goodbye to however reads this. best Isekai behind Mushoku and then...

194,"[""Let's start with the obvious: Yes I did give this movie a bold 10/10.I wasn't sure how to feel about it so I watched it twice in cinemas in Japan with a one week cool-off period in between both viewing.Honestly, the first time it simply blew me away and stayed in my head non stop for like 3-4 days. This is a heavy statement but it is indeed one of the best animated movies I've ever watched. The second watching was in order to try to find flaws and to focus a bit more on small details of the plot and the music.Let's structure...a bit the mess in my head, here goes:Story:Well, Mari Okada all right. She is known for her emotional stories and this one indeed enters the category just fiiiine!The movie feels very long in a good way: The story, the world and places, the character development, the sub plots... All these elements adds up and fill the ensemble to the brim giving the impression to have lived and discovered a lot with the characters ; and that is one of the main strenghts here. Everything is well rounded and the difference of pace in the various plot elements do not leave any space to get bored. There is a well-balanced mix of emotional moments, intense action and everyday life organized in a non generic narrative structure, which I find very refreshing.The theme developped is that of the relationship between mother and child. It is not a very common subject developped in detail and I really enjoyed the depth and various angles the movie takes to treat the subject.Art:Here, we have a very prestigious staff making characters and backgrounds.For the characters, Akihiko Yoshida character designer on Final Fantasy and Granblue Fantasy did a great job in creating the various types of characters. Even with the adaptation done for animation, you still see his strong influence, especially on the astounding work done on the clothes that are very stylish, diverse and inspired. The resulting chara design is very simple and round on the faces which can be a bit unsettling at the beggining but very cute nonetheless.About the background: the most prestigious animators of PA Works created incredible places helping to create a very rich world to discover. It is without a doubt the most impressive visual aspect on my end.To conclude this section, the CGI: globally well done and integrated, some rare sequences stand out too much but it isn't much of a problem in my opinion.Sound:Kenji Kawai is quite recognizable as a composer and you get that very easily here with the usual sound and instruments used. Nonetheless it is a very inspired soundtrack that come and goes with some very insistant themes that really shape the movie and the emotions. Also very well paced and used.Character:I am not gonna go in too much detail here because I don't wanna spoil the story but once again the characters are very well made, the vast majority of them are very logical in their motives, development and thought processes. The whole focus of the movie is obviously Maquia and Erial (or Ariel whatever) and their relashionship. So much so that you may feel that some secondary characters / subplots are not developped enough... Well it is indeed an argument but remember: It is the story of Maquia and Erial, so it is good the movie doesn't dwelve too much in various directions.Enjoyment + conclusion:Well I suppose this is clear enough already!I very deeply enjoyed this movie that awed me and obsessed me for days on end. It has a compelling story with a not so common theme in a fantasy setting including memorable scenes and very well developped characters with whom you grow fond of very quickly. It gets very emotional towards the end, all thanks to that very well paced development and evolution throughout the film.Beware, it is indeed a tear jerker and both times the whole room was crying at the end.Also, in case it isn't clear enough already, this is not a family oriented movie, it is geared towards adults and some themes and element are quite dark and mature.I've been trying to find flaws but putting aside very minor stuff, I don't see any major problems. Add to that the overwhelming impact of all the goodness I developed above and you get a masterpiece to be remembered. Hence the 10/10.Not everybody is gonna like it the way I did but if you are okay with emotional stories and fantasy, please give Sayoasa a go without hesitation and you won't be disappointed.Thank you for reading! a bit the mess in my head, here goes:Story:Well, Mari Okada all right.

I wondered if we had even seen the same movie. I, and seemly many who left the theatre did not leave angry; but we certainly were not raving about it being a masterpiece either. And in the whole theatre, only a single person cried. I overheard many conversations after the movie of it being ""okay"" and ""a lot of stuff didn\'t make sense"" and a few more criticisms. And I agree with them, this movie is no masterpiece. However, it is not bad either. So, here is my reviewStory:5/10Firstly, I find the...plot to be all over the place, and it never seems to have enough time to focus on each \'arc\' of the story. Due to this, we see a few time jumps that aren\'t explained and many many many coincidences throughout this animation. So many coincidences it\'s actually ridiculous. So many unexplainable coincidences made it seem pretty silly many times throughout the film. The best example would be when Maquia one night disappears, and then the next thing we know she\'s getting her hair cut in some random room and then next thing we know she\'s heading an invasion of some sort. Like, wtf just happened? I have a general idea, but wow. There is literally no explanation other than she vanishes and then bam shes back again so you\'re left to put together the pieces. And, of course, the fact that in a massive metropolis city she manages to \'stumble across\' every main character multiple times across the entire movie. ""The Clan of the Separated""? Yeah right... This for me dampered many scenes that would have otherwise been fairly heartwarming or sad. The overall plot isn\'t a bad one. It\'s actually a very interesting concept that I feel was just simply not done right. Or, maybe needed 2 parts and more time to do it correctly.Art: 7/10Animation wise it wasn\'t bad. Certainly wasn\'t great either. A few scenes looked quite silly but those were few and far apart. Was up and down throughout the film and sometimes is quite plain and boring but decided on a 7. Overall, not many complaints here.Sound 7/10:Here I had no complaints. No song really stuck out and made me really think about it deeper but all the songs seemed to match their scenes and OST was well done. No issues hereCharacters: 6/10Characters were pretty good. Clear development was seen in our two main characters which was nice to see. However, many other characters who seemed like they had importance, or could have had importance were simply forgotten about which was very disappointing. The biggest of which is the Army General Izol who swore to atone for his sins to Leila who was seen after that for maybe less than 5 seconds. In addition, the drunk man whom we never learn much of anything about whi randomly appears to save the day or just simply out of nowhere could have been done a lot better too.In conclusion, it was a Weak 7. The movie was decently enjoyable but was literally coincidences the animation. Had a good concept with potential but didn\'t live up to it. However, still created a movie that was appealing and a decently enjoyable watch if you don\'t think too much about it. plot to be all over the place, and it never seems to have enough time to focus on each \'arc\' of the story.

No matter how highly praised the series and movies I watch are, they always end up disappointing me. Shallow teenagers cry in them for no reason whatsoever. Emotional depth is at near 0% if...achieved at all. Story telling and characterization rely too much on spoon-feeding the feelings. The world building is miniscule since the sole point of the series is always just to offer some cheap tearjerking for those who never ask for more. Execution-wise, silence; situations where nothing needs to be said are the heaviest possible way to convey drama, but the audience is almost never respected or trusted in this way. So instead, the drama is directed at viewers via over-exaggerated voice acting, crying scenes and downright pathetic yelling sequences which only purpose is to show how much emotions the characters are feeling, but the viewer is always forgotten. What \'When the Promised Flower Blooms\' does is different because the feels are not hitting the characters: they hit the viewer instead. For the first time in 7 years, the anime industry has managed to create something that made me cry.I will keep this as simple and honest as I can.Story:-Takes place in a world that is a mixture of high-tier utopia fantasy where peaceful beings similar to elves are coexisting with nature and medieval human race in where kings and knights rule their part of the land in highly immoral and not-so-peaceful manner.-Mixes together political thriller, war, drama and daily life of both races.-Focuses on interracial willing and unwilling relationships. The main plot line being about elf-woman and a human child starting a family together where she takes the role of a (foster) mother. Another heavy motherhood-related concept is related to another elf-woman who is raped by the human king and becomes a (biological) parent to her child, but never sees her.-Deals with heavy questions about family, love, living, finding your own place in the world. As well as regret, adapting and one\'s purpose in life.-Several different themes are presented via different characters and their circumstances to a point that it is hard to see how at least one of these POV\'s wouldn\'t resonate with its viewer.-All of this is build around a solid story and inside a world so masterfully crafted that despite its drama-heavy content, it could as well be called just a fantasy movie.-Build together in such an impressive manner that after finishing the 2 hour movie, I felt like I had seen a 24 episodes long tv anime. So much content, hardly any filler, smooth and impressive from writing to directing.Characters:-Simply put: they are genuine, often very lost, trying their best, miserable beings at times, yet developed into something beautiful.-Most of them struggle to face reality, some simply can\'t. Ideas such as suicide are brought on the table. In generally, great many characters are put in places that are against everything they would prefer. The best part is how much sense the drama makes in the series and how honest the character reactions to every situation are.-Elf-people are have close-to-immortal lifespan which creates confusion especially in the main plotline where our mother realizes she is cursed to outlive her adopted son. The son simultaneously has to deal with his own confused feelings where he starts maturing and surpassing this person who no longer starts to seem like a mother to him, but a litle sister.Art:-Fucking amazing.-Very familiar feel to it. Fantasy world similar to video games such as ICO, Shadow of the Colossus, The Last Guardian + also the Disney Movie Atlantis.-Character movements can look occasionally weird for they can never truly match the backgrounds that are so insanely beautiful.-No money was saved in the making of this piece of art. It looks cold and brutal at times, yet so often incredibly beautiful. Water surfaces work like mirrors, the lighting and color pallet make details come alive.-In generally, the art serves the immersive nature of the series so well that it can\'t really be said to be none less than its very own thing. Something that can\'t quite be found anywhere else.Sounds:-Some of the cast are voiced by annoying ""shonen-like"" seiyuu\'s which is a minus.-The important roles are highly fitting to the characters. They offer personality and practically never go over board with the seiyuu work. Even the rare emotional voice acting feel real and genuine.-Music is used in the smartest possible way. Otherwise this doesn\'t have an OST I would listen separately, but it really feels like it was made just for this movie.Enjoyment:-The first 15 minutes made me think this is going to be highly mediocre drama like all the other recent drama.-Rest of the movie quite literally flew by.-It left me with a long lasting impact, highly memorable piece.-My eyes got wet in total of 3 times, and I legit cried during climax of the story where everything went down.Conclusion:-Highly recommended. achieved at all.

Backgrounds, buildings, and landscapes are all works of art. The characters, on the other hand, are not so great. I hope they improve them for the Blu-ray release.The voice acting was pretty good, but there were a couple places that had me wondering how it passed pre-screening.The story starts out kinda slow, kinda jumps to a bit of action, then slows again. There is a lot of character growth, and you do get attached to them.Finally, this movie is an emotional rollercoaster. I usually don’t cry in movies, but this...one had the whole theater (including me) crying at the end.Overall, I would say it is worth seeing at least once, maybe even worth buying. But I can’t see myself going to watch it a second time in theaters, mainly because I don’t think my heart can take it. one had the whole theater (including me) crying at the end.Overall, I would say it is worth seeing at least once, maybe even worth buying. But I can’t see myself going to watch it a second time in theaters, mainly because I don’t think my heart can take it.', ""[Spoiler Warning]So far I have only seen positive reviews about this movie and everyone is liking it, but it seems everyone have overlooked its bad character writing and not so good character development and character interaction. The only good thing about this movie is that P.A works has done a fantastic job on the animation but unfortunately there is not much good in this movie beside that animation. One would expect a story to develop its characters in a way that it makes sense and feel like real people would behave in story like this one but our two main characters here are not given...time to develop the mother and son story. The development of mother and son should have come from the raising the child and spending the time in childhood of that child but ( spoiler alert ) time skips do not make sense here and are random. Time skips are so random that mess up the mother and son relationship in a big way because we never get the ample time to develop the relationship of our main caste (mother and son) here. The story should have focused more on the childhood of Areil, so later in the story we feel motherly love strongly here but thats not the case here. Some plot holes really take story into weird turn, like those (spoilers) guns and fire arms jump into the story out of nowhere and how location of maquia is found by the king's army is never explained. Its like you are suppose to expect that and make your assumptions about those plot holes, speaking of plot holes its never revealed or explained how much children of immortal Iorph and normal human will live, I mean was that not key point of some part of the story but hey its a Mari Okada's movie not everything will make sense here.Except the animation everything else fails here. time to develop the mother and son story.

More objectively speaking, based purely on critical reasoning, there is much to discuss, but the beauty of this movie trumped all of that. I will begin a more critical review of all of its strengths and flaws, but first, let me give my experience.I watched this movie alone, without anyone around me, without a worry for the time. Without this, I imagine my experience could have been different, as it\'s difficult for me and many to make themselves vulnerable outside of the safety and comfort of privacy. I cried. I,...who haven\'t cried to any sort of media in a few years, cried in a way that I might have cried only a few times in my life. I cried until I literally ran out of tears. It was so beautiful a movie that I\'ve never cried so happily in my life. It was, for me, a catalyst of release that I didn\'t know I needed, a story so beautiful as to imprint itself into my mind in a way that I will absolutely never forget.Even then, I was experiencing and attempting to analyze the movie as I watched it. I was trying to see all the imagery and symbolism, follow the themes of the movie, and see what the movie was trying to tell me. I held back tears until the very end of the movie, but when it all began to end, I just couldn\'t hold it back. Without exaggeration, everyone needs to see this movie. If even one person is inspired by this review to willfully experience it in the way that I did, I will be thankful. It may not touch them in the same way that it broke me apart, but if even one person comes to see the beauty of this movie, I will be endlessly joyed.This movie touches on a common theme in a way more holistically than most are willing to. It\'s a difficult task to challenge the theme of family, of relationships, and of building oneself in the way that this movie accomplishes. After all, these are all extremely familiar themes to everyone, yet the unique format of the movie manages to expand on that theme in a way that I\'ve never seen or experiences. In addition to these are minor themes of freedom, release, and ambition. With this said, let me get into a more critical review of how they accomplished this well, and how it wasn\'t totally perfect. In my ratings, please note that a rating of 9 is great and a rating of 10 is outstanding. Though not perfect, I find all of the story, art, and character creation to be done absolutely outstandingly.--------------------------Story 10/10: The story takes on the format of an epic, with events happening in an inconsistent chronological scale. The events of the movie happen during different times, and one of the weaknesses in the storytelling of the movie is the lack of effective transitioning between the times. By all rights, this a holistic story that has the plot arc of rising action into climax, but with this format, it can blur the lines of consistent rising action. The misinterpretation of such, especially in a long two-hour time frame, will inevitably weaken the climax and the overall storytelling of the movie. It is potentially overly ambitious for the story it is telling.That said, I also believe its format to be a unique strength. Beyond the lack of perfect transitions and beyond the possibility of misinterpretation, the story is written in a way that through every time skip, we will see the progression of the characters and world in a way that fills in the periods of time in between. The movie dares to spread itself throughout what seems to be around 20 years, and it doesn\'t address some of the minor slices of life in between. Every scene is thus impactful and feels useful in creating the grand story.Used in tandem with the art and the sound, the worldbuilding, which is important in setting the stage for the events in the movie, is done to an outstanding degree. The sound design will follow the periods of time and the development of the world around our characters, and the art will reflect a dynamic and immersive environment. It strikes a balance between what is relatable and what is fantastical to enrapture the viewer while simultaneously giving an ethereal feel. It may seem somewhat contradictory to say so, but that is exactly the setting I saw the movie trying to create, and exactly what the movie did accomplish creating in the case of me. The incredibly realistic, vivid, smart, and dynamic character design only serves to drive all of these factors forwards. It accomplishes on all fronts what almost all other movies and shows will fail to accomplish. This is why I believe the story to be definitively outstanding amongst all others.--------------------------Art 10/10: It goes without saying that this movie is beautiful. One look at literally any scene in the movie will go to show the polish put into it. The way that the sun and lighting are portrayed, the ethereal landscapes, the imaginative yet fully developed world, and even the tiny details such as the look of bricks were clearly polished and given thought. This is one of the greatest aspects of the movie.In much of what the storytelling lacks in time of narration, it makes up for in sound and art design. For example, the world\'s continual push towards industrialism is seen and reflected in world design. Scenes of similar areas in different time periods will have the nuances of the time period worked out. The introduction of steelworking is reflected in the lighter nights, the sight of smokestacks throughout regions of the city, and even more specifically reflected in the lives of the world. As the introduction of more industrial applications is continued, some jobs, for example, weaving on the loom, are accurately presented as slightly less common for it can be expected that such developments are becoming more centralized in factories. These are the sorts of nuances that will draw a viewer in without them fully realizing, and the degree to which the imaginative world reflects realism in such an intricate manner is what drives me to say that the story is outstanding; it is because the art and sound are outstanding to a degree that it greatly strengthens the story.One of my first worries about the art in specific was the usage of CGI in the animation of the movie. Yes, there are perhaps two scenes where the usage is notable in a way that could affect immersion. Despite that, the usage of CGI was so well accomplished that I was instead pleased with the fluid animation and vividness that it allowed. Thankfully also, the fluidity never subtracted from the style of the movie, and only added. It was a surprise to me seeing the two layered on top of each other to such great effect. That said, every facial animation and every camera angle was given much care as well. Even without extensive film training, I could see the desired effect of such framing in a way that was incredibly natural; that\'s just one more thing I was impressed by.--------------------------Sound 9/10: Before anything else, the voice acting is on point. Not once throughout the movie did I feel as though it subtracted from the experience. In addition, when it really mattered, the level of emotion put into the voices really pushed through the message in a way that was outstanding, even among modern standards. The voice acting really helped as a liaison into the world. With such vivid voices and sound, the immensity of this imaginary world is really tightened into a form that is approachable and incredibly impactful.The soundtrack and the background sound design are also done very well. In specific, I found that the soundtrack wasn\'t as effective as it could have been. Yes, it was a great soundtrack and never once subtracted from the atmosphere, but the volume balancing at times wasn\'t very dynamic. In a climactic or tense situation, a crescendo of noise is present but not defining. None of the soundtracks and character themes are incredibly useful in illustrating a scene such that a character would be associated with any soundtrack. That is, though perhaps intentionally done, one of the ways that its soundtrack failed to live up to some of the roles it could have filled.In contrast to some of the soundtrack work, that which pushes the sound design into a 9, a great rating, is the atmospheric sound. Whether it be the steps, the banter, the steam, or even the wind accompanying the movement, it was all incredibly immersive and effective in worldbuilding. Without the sound, the beautiful art would have been lacking in some of the colors that fill in the setting. This movie, however, doesn\'t lack in either, which is what lays such a solid foundation for the story to be told.--------------------------Character 10/10: It\'s not as though there was never a character struggling to grow into a motherly role. It\'s not as though there was never a character growing through the young ages of his life into becoming a great person. There has never been, however, so centric a pair of characters that reflect so many of the intricacies and complications of relationships as well as the two main characters of this movie.Without spoiling too much, the development of the characters is one of the hardest tasks to accomplish with the chronological format of the movie. The movie chooses to forego some of the common character development tropes that exist, such as contrived reasons for the main character to be kind to someone. It instead shows a real and vivid character. Each character is relatable and understandable in a way that fits into common perception, yet each character is uniquely individualistic. The movie portrays this not in any sorts random quirks, but in the development of the character through their slightest movements, their facial expressions, their initial and later reactions to events. All of it adds up into a character the viewer relates to, cares for, and understands in a way beyond just fitting them into a stereotype.The movie accomplishes through its storytelling format a way to play on both existing understandings of people and on each character\'s dynamic individuality. The perfect balance creates perfect vessels for the story they desired to tell. Again, however, there exists the valid argument that the two-hour frame of the movie is simply not enough to build an incredibly deep connection to the character. The movie\'s response to this is that it focuses primarily not on every single aspect of the characters, but instead on building them in a way that pushes forward their desired messages in the themes they wish to explore. Such a method is perfectly effective in the story. Characters and story are balanced in this movie such that they seem perfectly intertwined. Characters don\'t seem contrived for the sake of storytelling, and the storytelling doesn\'t seem to be forced around the relationship of two characters. This balance is one of great importance and something accomplished remarkably well in this movie.--------------------------Enjoyment 10/10: This is my favorite movie of all time. Period. I believe the best way to enjoy it is to fully make yourself vulnerable to the messages it wishes to convey. While this argument is true of any dramatic work, much of the messages touch close to home in a way that requires vulnerability. Through one\'s formation in life, they naturally build themselves in a way that masks some ""childish"" emotions. Whether it be the love of their mothers, blissful ignorance, or even the desire to be able to depend on someone, all these emotions are gradually hidden, and the experience of the movie is greatly enhanced in letting these emotions out. This is the sort of emotional release that made the movie such an outstanding work of art, and I hope that others will also be able to appreciate in a similar way. who haven\'t cried to any sort of media in a few years, cried in a way that I might have cried only a few times in my life. I cried until I literally ran out of tears. It was so beautiful a movie that I\'ve never cried so happily in my life.

These are the sorts of nuances that will draw a viewer in without them fully realizing, and the degree to which the imaginative world reflects realism in such an intricate manner is what drives me to say that the story is outstanding; it is because the art and sound are outstanding to a degree that it greatly strengthens the story.One of my first worries about the art in specific was the usage of CGI in the animation of the movie. Yes, there are perhaps two scenes where the usage is notable in a way that could affect immersion. Despite that, the usage of CGI was so well accomplished that I was instead pleased with the fluid animation and vividness that it allowed. Thankfully also, the fluidity never subtracted from the style of the movie, and only added. It was a surprise to me seeing the two layered on top of each other to such great effect. That said, every facial animation and every camera angle was given much care as well. Even without extensive film training, I could see the desired effect of such framing in a way that was incredibly natural; that\'s just one more thing I was impressed by.--------------------------Sound 9/10: Before anything else, the voice acting is on point. Not once throughout the movie did I feel as though it subtracted from the experience. In addition, when it really mattered, the level of emotion put into the voices really pushed through the message in a way that was outstanding, even among modern standards. The voice acting really helped as a liaison into the world. With such vivid voices and sound, the immensity of this imaginary world is really tightened into a form that is approachable and incredibly impactful.The soundtrack and the background sound design are also done very well. In specific, I found that the soundtrack wasn\'t as effective as it could have been. Yes, it was a great soundtrack and never once subtracted from the atmosphere, but the volume balancing at times wasn\'t very dynamic. In a climactic or tense situation, a crescendo of noise is present but not defining. None of the soundtracks and character themes are incredibly useful in illustrating a scene such that a character would be associated with any soundtrack. That is, though perhaps intentionally done, one of the ways that its soundtrack failed to live up to some of the roles it could have filled.In contrast to some of the soundtrack work, that which pushes the sound design into a 9, a great rating, is the atmospheric sound. Whether it be the steps, the banter, the steam, or even the wind accompanying the movement, it was all incredibly immersive and effective in worldbuilding. Without the sound, the beautiful art would have been lacking in some of the colors that fill in the setting. This movie, however, doesn\'t lack in either, which is what lays such a solid foundation for the story to be told.--------------------------Character 10/10: It\'s not as though there was never a character struggling to grow into a motherly role. It\'s not as though there was never a character growing through the young ages of his life into becoming a great person. There has never been, however, so centric a pair of characters that reflect so many of the intricacies and complications of relationships as well as the two main characters of this movie.Without spoiling too much, the development of the characters is one of the hardest tasks to accomplish with the chronological format of the movie. The movie chooses to forego some of the common character development tropes that exist, such as contrived reasons for the main character to be kind to someone. It instead shows a real and vivid character. Each character is relatable and understandable in a way that fits into common perception, yet each character is uniquely individualistic. The movie portrays this not in any sorts random quirks, but in the development of the character through their slightest movements, their facial expressions, their initial and later reactions to events. All of it adds up into a character the viewer relates to, cares for, and understands in a way beyond just fitting them into a stereotype.The movie accomplishes through its storytelling format a way to play on both existing understandings of people and on each character\'s dynamic individuality. The perfect balance creates perfect vessels for the story they desired to tell. Again, however, there exists the valid argument that the two-hour frame of the movie is simply not enough to build an incredibly deep connection to the character. The movie\'s response to this is that it focuses primarily not on every single aspect of the characters, but instead on building them in a way that pushes forward their desired messages in the themes they wish to explore. Such a method is perfectly effective in the story. Characters and story are balanced in this movie such that they seem perfectly intertwined. Characters don\'t seem contrived for the sake of storytelling, and the storytelling doesn\'t seem to be forced around the relationship of two characters. This balance is one of great importance and something accomplished remarkably well in this movie.--------------------------Enjoyment 10/10: This is my favorite movie of all time. Period. I believe the best way to enjoy it is to fully make yourself vulnerable to the messages it wishes to convey. While this argument is true of any dramatic work, much of the messages touch close to home in a way that requires vulnerability. Through one\'s formation in life, they naturally build themselves in a way that masks some ""childish"" emotions. Whether it be the love of their mothers, blissful ignorance, or even the desire to be able to depend on someone, all these emotions are gradually hidden, and the experience of the movie is greatly enhanced in letting these emotions out. This is the sort of emotional release that made the movie such an outstanding work of art, and I hope that others will also be able to appreciate in a similar way.', 'Review 22.11.2018: Sayonara no Asa ni Yakusoku no Hana wo KazarouWritten by SMGJohn""Every review is subjective, art is subjective your opinion may differ, never trust reviews to make the opinion for you, use them as a guide and make your own journey.""Maquia was one of the movies I wanted to watch after it was announced in 2017 because from the few PV’s and promotional videos we got it looked promising being an original work of P.A Works that have done many great works in the past.However P.A Works are very often hit and miss, they either make something brilliant, or something very mediocre and...after finally having the Blu-ray release of Maquia I was astonished how overrated it was by everyone and critiques alike.Your opinion may vary but for me there serious issues within this movie that made it completely lacklustre and I will go into depth why this is was so.The first issue is the presentation in how time flows for an Iorph, while they live long lives the movie decides to present this as a broken VCR that skips over frankly essential parts, in many sense it be ignorant to claim this is a fluid experience, the movie is presented in parts, which have loose connections with each other, it is the Jarlsberg cheese experience of plot holes.In many ways I could describe it as trying to cram 12 episodes into a movie but you cut out the odd numbered episodes and only keep the even ones, why this choice was made is illogical.Because of this we have large plot holes that would otherwise explained much more, it is difficult to explain without spoilers but to put it simple, the relationships with the characters develop unevenly and you are constantly thrown into situations you cannot remember why it happens because you are never given a reason why in the first place.Another issue with P.A Works is how they write stories in general, the characters do not write the story, the story writes the characters, this works and may not work and in Maquia it just makes it stupid. At the beginning of the movie the Iorph’s are invaded by a small mercenary sized company who captures ONE Iorph who happens to be very close friends with Maquia, of course. We are however never shown this take place only that it had happened.Why is this a stupid scenario? Firstly, there few of the attacking forces, and there more Iorph’s, why are they not fighting back? If the Iorph’s are hunted in the first place why was it so there no standing army or militia? Why did they even need dragons to capture ONE Iorph’s from them to begin with if they have no army? It is not as if the men of the Iorph’s do not exist because they do we get to see them a few times.This movie is mostly about Maquia which is the main character and her son, she is clearly the main character in development throughout the movie however the movies extremely poorly executed writing wants to make it about her friend who was kidnapped, Maquia and multiple other subplots, but sadly her friend is given so little screen time it becomes nothing but an afterthought its even hard to categorise her as a side character.This is another issue with Maquia, its trying to cram too many subplots in such a lacklustre short period of time, there scenes that makes no sense and has no connection to the main cast at all, it just really makes it extremely difficult to understand why these decisions were made to present it this way.The story of Maquia herself is beautiful while she still is the typical P.A Works damsel in distress and absolutely zero self-confidence a typical trait of almost all characters that P.A Works construct regardless of gender, the story was still good but all these extra bits added onto it drags the entire movie down the drain which is a lost opportunity it is as if they were incapable of writing a proper story surrounding Maquia herself and her experience outside her homeland.Another issue I had trouble with comprehending is why rape was normalised in Maquia, while the presentation of rape was never shown, it was symbolised constantly throughout the movie, Maquia friend who was kidnapped was done so in order to bear “fruit” to a new prince, as suggested by the movie she was raped multiple times by the prince himself to bear a new son but the movie tries to portray it as a “not a big deal” type of situation.And you may ask me why I bring this up, the reason is to show why the story is such a mess at one point towards the end of the movie, Maquia herself is suggested to be pregnant suggesting she was raped against her own will because she is literally locked up in a cage, the hair of a Iorph grows long when they are pregnant as explained in the movie but the matter is never pursued, the movie goes on as if nothing has happened, we never get to learn if Maquia was pregnant or not.The production quality is classical P.A Works, there nothing memorable about its quality but it is not bad either, it is good to put it simple, the art direction is of a typical fantasy setting with unrealistic fantasy architectures and illogical mechanisms but that is the charm of fantasy it does not have to make sense it only has to look impressive and the movie did it well in this regard.Sound wise P.A Works are being more generous and using better sound design this time around, choosing more original audio to work with, less repetition and other annoyances we have heard of their previous works, it is pretty clear that P.A Works has put effort into the production quality of Maquia as a whole with good fluidity in animation that contains very few animation mistakes that was hard to spot even for myself.The score of Maquia helps in many ways to lift scenes out of their rather dull settings to a more emotional standing, Kenji Kawai proves just one more time how outstanding his variation in music can be if let free to do so.To describe it perfect, the music of Maquia is contemporary orchestral score that fits the depiction of fantasy very well.Summary wise, Maquia as a movie is frankly a poor attempt by P.A Works to create an original work that feels rushed, poorly planned, very poorly utilised writing that would fit better as a 24 episode television animation depicting a beautiful story of Maquia and her son growing up but instead we are only given bits and pieces, towards the end of the movie I genuinely got emotional seeing Maquia and her son being reunited again, but it is wrong to judge movies for their ending, you must judge them whole.With too many subplots, too many holes in the story, chaotic presentation it is best to perhaps avoid Maquia as a movie if you feel that you are too logical in taste, perhaps it would be wiser for P.A Works to adopt this into a television anime series instead as there would be more time to truly explore all subplots in vastly more details and create a much closer relationship with the viewer and the characters portrayed. after finally having the Blu-ray release of Maquia I was astonished how overrated it was by everyone and critiques alike.Your opinion may vary but for me there serious issues within this movie that made it completely lacklustre and I will go into depth why this is was so.The first issue is the presentation in how time flows for an Iorph, while they live long lives the movie decides to present this as a broken VCR that skips over frankly essential parts, in many sense it be ignorant to claim this is a fluid experience, the movie is presented in parts, which have loose connections with each other, it is the Jarlsberg cheese

While others seem to think this movie was incredible I for one was unable to be moved. I want to focus this review on the three main parts of the movie I found to be its downfall; characters, story, and pacing.Characters:This movie is at its heart a character drama dealing with the feelings of love and loss. Because of this it is incredibly important to write your characters in a way that makes them worthy of...the audiences attention. This movie fails to do that. The main reason behind this in my opinion is lack of character development. Our main cast is never properly developed throughout this movies 115 minute run time. The only decent piece of character development we get happens in the first scene of the movie where Leilia jumps off a cliff into the water and Maquia refuses to follow, while Krim lectures Leilia for slacking off. This scene shows us that Leilia is an easy going carefree girl while Maquia is scared and timid and Krim hard working and disciplined. Yet these personality traits are never again exemplified in any of these characters. Through the rest of the movie these characters dont seem to show any unique traits to themselves nor any reason for us as an audience to be invested in them.Story:For me story was by far the part of this movie which dragged me out of it the most. The overall plot is not my issue but rather the writing and characters motivations for their actions. Throughout this movie many changes in the story are brought upon by a characters decision to do something. Yet, nearly none of these actions seem to make any sense in relation to the characters interests nor do they show any semblance of rational thought. Below are a few examples of awful writing that took me out of the movie.- Leilia refusing to escape after being rescued by Maquia. She decides this under the guise that Krim wouldnt be able to look at her again, but for her to think this about being pregnant with a child that was forced upon her (and conceived through rape) is nothing but thick plot armor.- Maquia deciding not to return home to Mido after failing to capture back Leilia. This would have been the objectivly best decision for the welfare of her child and would have avoided the hard grueling life her and Ariel led thereafter.- Ariel leaving his wife to fight in the battle. This mans wife is nearly expecting to have a child which he himself calls his future, yet he is more than ready to give that all up to risk his life as a foot soldier for a regime which is made clear to be the wrong side of the fight throughout the movie. Usually in a movie if your main character is going to risk their life in battle it should be for something, not at its behest.Speaking of Ariel leaving, Ariel's ability to leave right before something horrible happens to those he loves most is so timely that it borders on comedic. Whether its leaving Maquia to join the army only for her to be kidnapped minutes later or leaving his wife to fight in the army right before she goes into labor Ariel has a knack for leaving his loved ones when they need it most. For a character whose desires are to be there to protect the ones he loves, he fails at it in the worst ways possible every time.Pacing:The last major issue I had with this movie was the pacing. For a movie that covers such a long period of time with a large cast of characters spanning many locations to work the pacing must be effective. This movie fails to do so. Often times I found myself wondering where or when I was at in this stories large world due to the seemingly random cuts in it. These cuts prevent us as an audience from knowing much if anything at all about characters feelings or motivations behind the actions we see them participating in. This is a major error which took greatly away from the flow of the film.In the end I feel there was lots of room for potential in this story. The world building and animation were incredible and the narrative was quite touching. If PA Works had instead decided to make this story into a TV show with more time to develop their characters and fill in the story I am sure we would have been left with a far greater final product. the audiences attention.

The artwork looked so stunning, the premise felt original and full of potential. After waiting for half a year until it finally became available to watch, I have to say it didn’t live up to my hopes.This review will contain marked sections with minor spoilers, mainly to illustrate certain points that contributed to the overall stale taste that the movie left in my mouth.The story itself is pretty interesting. A clan of near immortal beings, weaving history into pieces of cloth. A neighboring empire that, when their power fades, tries to obtain...that longevity to regain its foothold. A young girl, that gets caught up in that conflict, is driven from her home and has to find a new place to belong in an everchanging world.The world design is fantastic. It feels like an actual place, not a set piece. It is well thought out, colorful and an overall joy to see unfold. I found the character design beautiful, though I know that is up to individual taste. The occasional CG used for the dragons is forgivable.It’s a real shame that despite its stunning visuals and sweeping orchestral music, the movie is lacking relatable characters and a cohesive script.Maquia is kind of meek, cries a lot and is shown to be burdened by her loneliness. This doesn’t fundamentally change throughout the movie.Ariel, her adoptive son, is aged up through time jumps so sudden and inconsistent, that it is incredibly hard to grasp his personality or motivation. Some of his actions really came out of nowhere for me and were hardly ever explained.The bond between mother and son is the main focus of the movie, but with the few glimpses of their relationship shown between the time jumps, it doesn’t feel like they have actually gone through anything together. It’s more of a laundry list of events that gets checked off as the story rushes on.Mild spoilers in the next paragraph: Neither of the two main characters felt relatable, mainly because their actions often didn’t make sense in the context of the story. Maquia never once tries to go back and find out what exactly happened to her home and her people, which bothered me immensely. Important parts that could have defined their relationship and help the viewer understand Ariels feelings and motivations, like him finding out he is adopted and what Maquia really is, are glossed over quickly. Also, his behavior changes dramatically after the time jump into early adulthood, with his reasoning for lashing out towards his adoptive mother being questionable at best.The backdrop of the story, more precisely the conflict between multiple nations (which were non-descriptive at best and cartoonishly evil at worst), should have been more important. With all the focus on Maquia and Ariel, the surrounding events that had a lot of potential just got used as a facilitator for an underwhelming finale.Also, beautiful as the world and the multiple locations shown in the movie are, there is a definitive lack of explanation as to where everything is in relation to each other. People are transported from place to place without establishing from where to where the journey leads, sometimes in between time jumps, so the viewer just gets utterly confused as to how they ended up there – or where “there” is. This becomes worse leading up to the final conflict.A lot of lore is touched on, but never properly explained or given context. The plot is rushed so much that the whole thing falls flat in the end, since it was – at least for me – hard to become attached to any of the characters.I think the story would have made a great series instead, with 12 or more episodes to flesh out the characters and their relationships, establish the geography of the world and to give equal importance to the overarching plot of the conflict between the warring nations.It’s not an awful movie by any means, but it is one with a lot of wasted potential, which sadly leaves it at an average level. that longevity to regain its foothold.

It's done in a way that's very show and don't tell which makes it so easy to fall into. It's a light fantasy setting, which is neat since you don't see that in anime very often. The CG is sparse but does kind of stand out, but still isn't the worst I've seen. There's some very nice animation on display here at times. The premise and some of the ideas I think that hey were going for are interesting, but the way it's presented is disjointed and some...of the character actions confused me, which both hurt some of the intended dramatic emotional beats.

There was a lot of social media buzz surrounding this movie. People on this site were giving it 9’s and 10’s and even one of my favorite musicians, Porter Robinson, tweeted about this movie and how good it was. And so, I selected this movie on a cozy Friday night with a bowl of soup and high expectations.Wow. It is disappointing in countless aspects over the course of its two hour runtime. I am writing this review so that you can save yourself the...time I wasted!To say the least, disappointment started to creep in before the halfway mark had even hit. If you’re looking for a film that dives head-first into a deep, emotional, and realistic exploration of paternal ties, then forget this movie. This introduction starts off with a good premise. The story revolves around an ancient clan isolated from the other factions of the world due to their immortality. This sets up a good framework for the exploration of isolation, segregation, and xenophobia but its actually never explored to its fullest extent. The movie is riddled with ridiculous plot holes, nonsensical character development, and layered with incestual undertones between a mother-son relationship. Often times, many of the side characters introduced are one-dimensional and completely stray from their motives in later sequences to elicit a cheap, emotional response from the audience. Their arcs make no sense in regards to the plot and indicate a lack of respect for coherent storytelling. The only saving grace of this movie is the animation, which is detailed and breathtaking in some sequences.You’re better off watching Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki than this garbled mess. time I wasted!To say the least, disappointment started to creep in before the halfway mark had even hit.

Often times, many of the side characters introduced are one-dimensional and completely stray from their motives in later sequences to elicit a cheap, emotional response from the audience. Their arcs make no sense in regards to the plot and indicate a lack of respect for coherent storytelling. The only saving grace of this movie is the animation, which is detailed and breathtaking in some sequences.You’re better off watching Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki than this garbled mess.', ""(Full disclosure: I did watch Maquia on an in-flight entertainment system. I strongly believe it had no impact on my overall impression of the movie, but who knows, maybe if I had gotten to see it in theaters I would feel differently about it than I do.)Maquia is a disappointment. If you enjoyed the movie, by all means go ahead and enjoy it - but to me it lacks the space to really drive its narrative and themes home, and as a result characters who should be interesting and compelling come off one dimensional and occasionally annoying as the thematic resolution falls flat. First things...foremost, though: I have absolutely nothing against Mari Okada or her work on this project. She has her fair share of haters and her style is not always my thing, but she does a fantastic job with what she is given here. Thanks to P.A. Works, Maquia sports a visual flavor and pace that the shows she wrote just never had, and it allows Okada to try her hand at a larger scope than she's ever dealt with.My first, second, and third problems with this movie can be boiled down to a single word: time. There's just not enough. I'm sorry, you cannot spin this huge generation-spanning epic starring an ageless lead, dissecting her relationship with the humans around her who age and die before her eyes, and then cram it into barely 100 minutes. When Maquia visits Ariel in the film's epilogue, a moment that should feel poignant and heavy with the weight of almost a century of events leaves little to no impact. This needed likely a full cour to really get the meat out of the story - and get this! If this had been in the form of a 1 or 2-cour TV anime, I probably would have loved it. Drum up the art and animation quality a bit more, sink your teeth in more to Maquia's narrative, and tell the whole story so you can actually feel the time pass. That way the audience can actually invest in the characters, most of all Maquia herself, and you can pursue some semblance of a resolution. Without time, you have nothing with which to hammer home your main themes, and everything you've built falls apart. If you can use your imagination to fill the years-long gaps in the narrative, power to ya, but the film simply does not do enough on its own to convince me of its thematic or character resolutions.Again: there are legitimate moments of pure inspiration here. 15 year old Maquia sobbing trying to figure out breastfeeding was probably the most moving moment of the whole film, and the final scene was something else (though should the climax of a movie this big have been better? who knows). Okada plays with her motifs in a refreshingly powerful way, and there is clearly thought behind the development of theme ideas as the movie progresses. Maquia just doesn’t have the space to take them all the way.P.A. Works, or Mari Okada herself, or whoever, made the (wrong) decision that this story was best told in movie format and attempted to recount over ninety years in under two hours. Yes, a large chunk of that time is tacked on in the epilogue, but the main plot covers over two decades of time - still not enough in my opinion, but way too much to be squished into the total runtime of an eight minute short. foremost, though: I have absolutely nothing against Mari Okada or her work on this project.

The first quarter/half or so was at least fairly interesting and quickly took a downturn in the second act. If you want, you can stop reading here.The characters pretty much all sucked, with motivations/thought processes that remained as uncompelling as they were transient -- meaning that not only did they not make sense, but they weren't consistent either.The only truly interesting character was Krim, a side character who functions only as a punching bag for the story to push it's weird theme. Which is namely that...The story seems to have no other theme...than shoving in our face that motherhood is next to sainthood and that all we should care about is pumping out children.The animation was really good, but the story didn't live up to it in the slightest. Characters kind of all sucked or were boring, with the exception of Krim, who was barely shown or explored, and who got screwed anyways. Not only was the theme weird and shoved in our faces, but it wasn't interesting explored in the least, making it not only a weird/bad theme, but a poorly executed one as well.I can see why people cried during the showings -- probably because they lost two hours of their life to this. than shoving in our face that motherhood is next to sainthood and that all we should care about is pumping out children.The animation was really good, but the story didn't live up to it in the slightest.

Yoshida's art was as gorgeous as ever, so was Kazuhiro's music direction. These two could turn even the worst story into a marvel to behold.However, when you get used to the great animation, you start noticing the problems with this movie.It started off decently, the setting was interesting, I was excited to learn more about the world. The coming-of-age and motherhood aspect of it all was compelling and well written. But at about midway through the movie, the actions of the characters stop making any sense and are basically written/taken to get the story going...to lead to the grand finale.The characters just give up on their ideals multiple time throughout the story.But really, I am writing this review mainly to get to this one complaint: Leilia refuses to go with Krim BECAUSE she says she loves her daughter and can't give up on her, Krim being supposedly the love of her life and her dilemma was longing for her home and people while also giving birth to her child. After telling him why she can't escape with him she proceeds to let him die in front of her eyes, deciding she is willing to do so to stay with her daughter. All this happens so that later, when Maquia appears, after a very short exchange she realizes she actually DOES want to go back to her people and can't stay with mortal humans and make her daughter happy, so when her daughter sees her mom for the first time, she just tells her to forget about her and proceeds to jump off a clif on the back of a dragon to fly away.I think I don't even need to go into the details of how the story got there, because really, there isn't much to back up such a ridiculous conclusion. Up to this point, the movie still could be redeemed because it had multiple compelling and good stories and characters being explored. But honestly, this conclusion just cannot be overlooked and was the driving motivation for Maquia all along (saving Leilia) and absolutely ruined the experience for me. I am still very sad such amazing diorection was wasted on this conclusion. to lead to the grand finale.The characters just give up on their ideals multiple time throughout the story.But really, I am writing this review mainly to get to this one complaint: Leilia refuses to go with Krim BECAUSE she says she loves her daughter and can't give up on her, Krim being supposedly the love of her life and her dilemma was longing for her home and people while also giving birth to her child.

If I'm being honest, i think this is better than Violet Evergarden. Even though both are masterpieces, this one stands on top. I wish i could rate this even higher. Its been 2 days since i finished it and i still find myself thinking over and over about the story, the motherhood, the love I could feel from it. I felt so warm and loved just from this movie. This inst a recommendation, this is a must watch and there are no exceptions. "", 'So before anything, I did put a 10/10 for this movie, which apparently seems to tick off a lot of people, and I exactly understand why, but I\'ll get to that later. Also, this is my first review on MAL, but please do not let that affect the way you feel about this review. So for those of you who just skim reviews, here is my overall opinion:Maquia is a masterpiece and you should all watch it....Now for the detailed review:-Story 10/10 : Given there is no cinematic composition, or even a script section in the review noting I assume this all falls under the story section. See, a lot of people I think have been put off by the way this anime was set up. By that, I mean the anime felt disconnected, like mere parts of Maquia\'s life put together, and due to the maturing of the characters, didn\'t feel like the previous section. While it may have disturbed a lot of people, it felt purely normal to me, it actually felt impressing. I mean, this is a story told through Maquia, and given how much longer she can live, time must go by in a blink for her, so the ""unconnected"" parts of her life felt to me as an actual amazing addition from whoever thought of it (I know Mari Okada directed the movie but maybe it was someone else\'s idea). So that was for overall script direction, as for the story, it\'s gorgeous. You dive into a world whose fantasy is slowly fading away into legends, add to this the use of those fading fantasy species, which includes Mquia\'s species as political and military weapons and you have the whole base of this anime\'s story and of Maquia\'s reason for being in the world of humans. It\'s happy, it\'s sad, it\'s funny, you just go through such a huge amount of emotions in under a simple 2 hours that it\'s close to unbelievable. I would go into more details as for the plot, but I went into this movie close to fully blind and I loved the hell out of it, so I recommend you do the same.-Art 8/10 : Would I have not seen Your Name and its beautiful and deatiled background art, The Shape of Voice with its amazingly expressive animation, or Violet Evergarden and its way of making everything constantly pretty, I would have put a 10/10 on the art and animation. The backgrounds are as defined as Makoto Shinkai\'s maybe sometimes even more, the animation expresses so much warmth and happiness when needed, while also being able to express sadness without going over the top, and still managing to do some sick action shots. The characters are pretty simple and do not require much lineart, which I would usually say is a bad thing, but hell is it well used here. They probably have the same amount of lineart as your usual seasonal anime, but it allows for the colors to show more, for us to notice that slight shine on the hair we would have usually completely ignored, a change in the eye even from a considerable distance, but also allows for the backgrounds to shine while completely fitting in, a close to perfect blend that even Your Name, at least to my tastes, didn\'t achieve. It makes it seem as if the characters are part of the background, without making us lose focus of them whatsoever, probably being closer to Violet Evergarden on that stage. The one thing I would say is ""badly"" done is the CG. Crowds are fine by me when using CG, and even then the anime sometimes fully draws full crowds, which made me quite happy. However, there\'s a few shots where its obvious CG was used, wether on the dragons or even sometimes on important characters, and that sort of stuff sort of pulls me out from the experience, the characters and the world setting being a major part of the movie-Sound 7/10 : Maquia is quite special when it comes to music. Maquia is a character-driven anime, and one of the main features of this type of anime is the close to constant(or at least it feels like it) usage of music, in order to express the emotions of the character, and emphasize them whenever they\'re clearly exposed. But Maquia went about this differently. When I figured out it was a character-driven story, the anime directly felt weird. There was not too much usage of music. Actually, I\'ll be honest, it felt like there was none in the first half (I mean there was at a few moments, but most of the time it was extremely basic and could barely be noticed). However, I feel like it worked out for the best. The lack of music made it so that when the music went all-out towards the ending of the anime, it literally blew you away, more than any anime I\'ve seen before. Because not only does it blow you away significantly more, but the OST on their own were already amazing, like, really really really amazing. They don\'t use nay special instruments, the chords are not innovative either, it\'s just orchestral music, taken to its roots, and done perfectly. And as an orchestral music fan, that just left me in pure awe (and tears).- Characters: 10/10. I have seen many dramas, slice of life, romance and all other genres that tend to be thoroughly driven by the characters for the simple reason that they tend to be my favorite animes. And, well, in terms of characters, Maquia holds quite a high spot. And it seems only logic given how the anime works. You see the characters growing, so the character development that is usually done through flashbacks or other means of going back to the past are not necessary here as you are literally seeing all characters grow from children to adult. That means that the character development is close to complete, as you see all the important moments of their lives but get to live it at the same time as them and really gets you to like the characters a whole lot more. Along with that, although I\'m not really sure whether what I\'m about to say falls under Story or Character, the fact that you see the characters grow along the whole movie means you see their departures and deaths making it sad or at least gloomy, but it also makes you feel incredibly happy when friends that you had left at the beginning of the story reappear as adults, even if you saw them for only a minute or two before. For that simple reason, I consider this worth a 10/10 as i have just not seen anything better than that done before in terms of characters.-Enjoyment and Overall: 10/10 I put those two sections together because, in my opinion, the only thing that genuinely matters in the end is whether you enjoyed it or not. As for me, this became my favorite anime of all times. What I seek from anime is a beautiful world that is close to ours while having its own uniqueness that will get me to either like or dislike the place depending on the director\'s wish. I seek to feel emotions that I would never get to experience in real life because it is too dull (at least mine is). I seek to cry my heart out, to laugh, to love; I seek from anime to make me experience ""something else"" without having to resort to an empty character like a lot of animes do. And Maquia fits perfectly in everything I seek. It allows you to experience the joys of the countryside, what life in the city feels like, what losing someone feels like, the anxiety and pain of a full-on war, the madness that is brought about through loneliness and the pain brought about by the loss of all you have.Final thoughts, I am telling you if not obligating you to watch this anime. This is definitely a one of a kind movie that will probably not have something come even close to it anytime soon. If you don\'t like it, then don\'t like it. If you do like it, you\'re in for one of the most amazing journeys you\'ever had through anime. Which is why, if you\'re not sure whether to watch this not, for my sake, and the sake of the huge quantity of tears i let run down my cheeks while watching this, give this anime a try. Go entirely through with it, because maybe you\'ll prefer the older characters to the younger ones, or maybe you\'ll prefer war to a calm and happy countryside story, So please, with all my heart, I beg you to watch this.This ends this review, thank you for your time.

It's truly a challenge to be able to step out of our shoes and view the world from a different perspective because, quite frankly, our perspective is the one we are most familiar with and the one we own. Our relationship with others are oftentimes influenced by this limited perspective as well. As a child, oftentimes you may be blind to the world at large, to the troubles and responsibilities of adulthood. Growing up, you may be blinded by your personal problems and challenges to see the efforts of and problems faced by...those around you.Similarly, in anime and manga we are often bound by a limited perspective. We oftentimes follow the protagonist through selective interesting snippets of their life story, we see perhaps the most exciting moments and see them overcome a challenge they come across in the period of the character's lives. Flashbacks are usually brief and in passing, future depictions limited to an episodic epilogue. Similar to our perspective in life, anime or manga presents to us life in a small moment.In Maquia, Director Okada, I think, accomplishes something that is very unique in this medium. Through this movie she gives us a full and wholistic perspective of life in passing. Okada is able to weave together a beautiful story where you follow the characters and their growth as they age, change, grow from their mistakes, and face truly relatable and human challenges throughout the span of the movie and their lives. You are able to watch and experience as their present slowly turns into their past and ongoing events in their lives slowly turn into their instrinsic motivations.For me, those entering young adulthood or parenthood may get a little more out of this movie, having more experiences to reflect on and more time to see the gradual change that they have undergone. Being able to see conflicts they had when they were younger and perhaps reconciliations that they were able to make as they grew older and gained life experience allows them to really empathize with the characters featured in this movie as they too go through stages of their life, blindly struggling with the concept of parenthood, age, life and death, and love.Furthermore, not only does this movie feature lovely art, Director Okada does a striking job of integrating subtle imagery and symbolism in the construction of the scenes and the background. It was as if Okada brought storytelling to life, mixing in metaphors into the flow of the story to the point where it doesn't detract at all from the viewing experience but gives a small enjoyment to those who notice them. It makes you have a greater appreciation for how beautiful anime can be as a medium for artistic expression.Finally, in the first film Okada directed entirely on her own, she selects an array of truly relatable topics as the underlying themes. The idea of family, the bond between mother and child, what it means to be a parent, what it means to be human, and the oftentimes sensitive topic of life and death are all struggles that we face as we age and are also questions that we may have changing answers for as we reach different stages of life. Going back to the first point, it is precisely that we ourselves may be able to reflect on our changing views towards these topics that makes this movie which features growth and change more relatable. In particular, for me these themes hit very close to home to the point where even as I'm sitting here hours later typing this review, I still think back to scenes and moments from the movie in contemplation and thought.To me, Marquia is a classic and an experience that I hope I will revisit time and again to relive. It that struck a deep chord and made me so emotional throughout the film, that I found myself full-on crying at three or four separate moments, bottom lip quivering uncontrollably, trying my hardest avoid disturbing other moviegoers with sniffling and tears. It was the hardest and most I've cried in the many years now.To me, Marquia was nothing short of a masterpiece and I have nothing but praise for this beautiful work that Director Okada has weaved together. It is my hope that, if the director's participation in other titles such as Anohana, Nagi no Asukara, Sakurasou, and Wixoss, or the beautiful cover art and promotional video art, or the reputation that P.A Works has as a quality studio had not already done so, this review and these thoughts will convince you to give this movie a try. And I sincerely hope that you are able to get as much out of this film as I did.Thank you Mari Okada for directing such a wonderful movie and giving me a chance to add this beautiful experience to my own personal Hibiol. those around you.Similarly, in anime and manga we are often bound by a limited perspective. We oftentimes follow the protagonist through selective interesting snippets of their life story, we see perhaps the most exciting moments and see them overcome a challenge they come across in the period of the character's lives. Flashbacks are usually brief and in passing, future depictions limited to an episodic epilogue. Similar to our perspective in life, anime or manga presents to us life in a small moment.In Maquia, Director Okada, I think, accomplishes something that is very unique in this medium. Through this movie she gives us a full and wholistic perspective of life in passing. Okada is able to weave together a beautiful story where you follow the characters and their growth as they age, change, grow from their mistakes, and face truly relatable and human challenges throughout the span of the movie and their lives. You are able to watch and experience as their present slowly turns into their past and ongoing events in their lives slowly turn into their instrinsic motivations.For me, those entering young adulthood or parenthood may get a little more out of this movie, having more experiences to reflect on and more time to see the gradual change that they have undergone. Being able to see conflicts they had when they were younger and perhaps reconciliations that they were able to make as they grew older and gained life experience allows them to really empathize with the characters featured in this movie as they too go through stages of their life, blindly struggling with the concept of parenthood, age, life and death, and love.Furthermore, not only does this movie feature lovely art, Director Okada does a striking job of integrating subtle imagery and symbolism in the construction of the scenes and the background. It was as if Okada brought storytelling to life, mixing in metaphors into the flow of the story to the point where it doesn't detract at all from the viewing experience but gives a small enjoyment to those who notice them.

I don't know what I expected. I'm not even sure how I found this movie. I seem to remember randomly seeing the thumbnail on a streaming website and thinking it was pretty. Safe to say, it was easily one of the best spontaneous decisions I've ever made.This movie is what you would get if you could put beauty in a bottle. The Iorphs are elf-like humanoids, pale, blonde, living isolated from the rest of the world, and their average life span is probably in the thousands of years. All they're missing are the pointy ears. Throughout history, they've come...to be known as the Clan of Partings.Maquia, our protagonist (voiced by Kana Hanazawa), is merely 15 years old. She's an orphan and, as such, there are many things she doesn't understand. She wants to see the outside world and can't grasp why their village elder would advise against it. The reason why they're called the Clan of Partings is, as of yet, still mysterious to her. Unfortunately, fate is not kind enough to allow her to wallow in ignorance. When tragedy strikes and their isolated, peaceful society is destroyed, she is forced to face the world, face the reality of being a nigh-eternal being in a garden full of ephemeral flowers. Gradually, the meaning behind her people's name becomes painfully transparent to her.The sheer amount of unfair plight suffered by her and her people in this picture will break your heart, however, if there's a silver lining, then it's the technical mastery behind this project. It's not the sadness, but the beauty of the film that keeps it all together. At any given moment, you'll be at a loss between feeling heartbroken because of the story or being in awe of the background art. The film's animation is great, but it's nothing you haven't seen before. The background artwork, though, would give Makoto Shinkai a run for his money, and in fact, I enjoyed it here more than in any Shinkai film, because it was actually meaningful here.My only warning is this; in case it hasn't already dawned on you, there is a lot of drama in this film. Maybe don't watch this if you're low on tissues. Otherwise, by all means, treat yourself to this marvel. to be known as the Clan of Partings.Maquia, our protagonist (voiced by Kana Hanazawa), is merely 15 years old.

Blooms is a tapestry of the titular character Maquia voiced by Manaka Iwami, being a Iorph, a secret race of humans able to have longer lives than regular humans, when her village is found out by the forces of Mezarte and she flees, she encounters a baby and promises to protect the baby now named Ariel voiced by Miyu Irino. It\'s a tale of motherhood in all shapes and situations, a tale of what ""immortality""...does to someone be it good or not, it\'s a tale of partings.Spoilers Ahead!Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms\' core themes and what Mari Okada utterly nailed is the shapes and situations of what motherhood is like and sure LA isn\'t one AT ALL, but nonetheless, what Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms brings to the table just shows off Mari Okada directing and passion on the themes of the subject matter. Maquia our titular character having the most focus gives us one of an orphan herself taking care of Ariel and if she\'s an actual ""mother"" to Ariel or not, Maquia is multi-faceted as her extremely slow aging is also a factor and what this means to their trials and tribulations Maquia and Ariel both on a personal level but also with outer factors also getting in their way. As such Maquia\'s constant worry of her not being a mother to Ariel due to her having no experience in the matter not to mention her essentially adopting Ariel when she to was a kid at the time and on the other side, as while Ariel is growing up, Ariel\'s want to protect Maquia with the outer factors getting in the way to the point of war breaking out in Mezarte. Lelia voiced by Ai Kayano is another Iorph, being captured by Mezarte forces to produce a heir to Mezarte line so they can last forever, but being essentially held captive, no able to her daughter and Mezarte themselves shunning Lelia and her daughter brings in the isolationism to motherhood and how this quite obviously fracturing any chance of a relationship between Lelia and Medmel voiced by Misaki Kuno her daughter.Ariel as a character is something of focal point as well, even though Maquia is our narrative focus throughout the movie. We get to see Ariel from baby to an adult, from his naivete about the world and what Maquia means to Ariel, his defiance and his want to protect Maquia and though his adolescences is him being a rather annoying brat, he is smarter than one looks, even to adult as a character and the burden and love he gives to Maquia though it comes out in not the way he wants to show it and to be honest those reactions that Ariel portrays is extremely relatable in this sense thus his actions though brash at times does mean alot to Maquia.Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms has two major plotlines, the focus on Maquia and Ariel through the times and that of Lelia and Krim voiced by Yuki Kaji another Iorph who escaped the raid of his village and wants everything to be back to normal and was in love with Lelia. Though Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms spends the majority of it\'s time on Maquia and Ariel which by all means makes sense, LA would like to see more of Lelia and Krim to this regard as seeing what kind of turmoil they both went through through the times would had been interesting. Though this brings up how each of the escaped Iorph lives their lives, Krim wanting life to be back to normal and willing to do ANYTHING to get that...wanting to keep his cloth as it were, Lelia being forced a life she didn\'t want, shedding her previous personality for the Mezarte and unable to do anything about it being something akin to someone giving you different clothing for the rest of your life and Maquia who weaves her own cloth but with Ariel, so it\'s a stronger and unique cloth as a result.For it\'s animation done by P.A Works, well LA will say this, the animation is gorgeous to the nth degree and expected of P.A Works but the attention to detail, great battles, beautiful background and expressive facial motions were all spot on and executed to amazing degree, huge and major props to the animators of P.A Works bringing us such beautifully detailed and gorgeous animation.As for voice work, the voice actors were amazingly casted, from Miyu Irino as Ariel, Manaka Iwami as Maquia and Ai Kayano as Lelia all three that might as well of gotten LA\'s MVP\'s for this movie hands down, especially Manaka Iwami bringing so much emotions and range from doting mother whilst keeping her innocence and even nailing the more dramatic moments in the movie, Manaka Iwami is showing off what she\'s capable of as a voice actor and this might as well be her big break as LA remembers her as Chiaki Hoshinomori from Gamers and Kotoko Watatsumugi from Urahara. But nonetheless the voice cast for Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms has a great cast, from Yoko Hikasa, Yuki Kaji, Miyuki Sawashiro and Tomokazu Sugita and Yoshimasa Hosoya.With such praise, does Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms have any flaws?, well nitpicks to say the least, due to how interweaved and solid it\'s theming are to it\'s characters, some of the few nitpicks LA would say to Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms would be that the movie has lots of time skips and LA will defend this at least they subtly but cleverly gives us hints to this showing the entire ""show don\'t tell"" but it has some jarring shifts especially early on, the other is something LA aforementioned of LA wanting Lelia and Krim more screentime but this being MAQUIA: When the Promised Flower Blooms LA thinks it makes sense they didn\'t and even then Lelia has some relevance to the plot when it involves Mezarte so it\'s partially satisfying at least. Finally and this it the most nitpicky so this is LA but the movie gets pitch dark at points like LA gets it your trying to portray they are in the dark, but we kinda have SEE as well, otherwise it\'s nothing but darkness with little animation to convey it besides...darkness with little outlines. Nitpicky but this by NO MEANS deter Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms as a whole as it\'s strong plot and characters especially Maquia and Ariel was enough to hold the movie to it\'s fullest potential.LA will say this again and it can\'t be understated but Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms  is one of the best work Mari Okada has done, it was her baby that she scripted, storyboard and directed, showing and executing the themes of motherhood and what the pain of partings and meetings are in it\'s most natural and visceral degree to the point of LA weeping and it takes ALOT of emotional distraught to get LA to cry and Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms  did just that and with the few flaws LA pointed out just barely isn\'t enough to stain the tapestry of Maquia at all...Parting is such sweet sorrows...but Maquia will always be there and Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms leaves one hell of a mark for future anime movies to come... does to someone be it good or not, it\'s a tale of partings.Spoilers Ahead!Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms\' core themes and what Mari Okada utterly nailed is the shapes and situations of what motherhood is like and sure LA isn\'t one AT ALL, but nonetheless, what Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms brings to the table just shows off Mari Okada directing and passion on the themes of the subject matter.

That being said I do think it has some flaws which I will get into, which was primarily the story and the characters.Story: 9/10The story is simple and executed greatly but not to perfection which is why I did not warrant it a 10/10. The war sub-plot just doesn't feel important enough. You could replace it with any other real-event conflict and you wouldn't change the overarching themes or characters too much. I think Mari Okada just bit off more than she could chew here. Apart from that,...the story revolves around Maquia, her child, and her friends and her experience with the emotion love. It executes the themes of Motherhood beautifully with great story-telling elements such as the use of symbolism, juxtaposition, and colour to set an appropriate tone and mood for the story. With stories they should always try to immerse you into it, as if you are with Maquia and feeling what she is feeling, which the movie does without any problems.Art: 10/10Not many words to be said. Watch the trailer and you can see for yourself the amazing backdrops and the vivid smooth animation of the characters and how beautiful they all are. Each character feels unique in how they are protrayed from the small meek Maquia to the bold and tall Krim. The CG is fine and doesn't look out of place.Sound: 9.5/10The sound is amazing for sure but it doesn't feel unique. To say something what Mothers Basement had to say about the movie: it doesn't have a unique musical piece. Its the same fantasy music you hear in fantasy anime and JRPG's.Character: 9.5/10My biggest complaint here were the confusing motivations of one of the characters which I will not name. This character and her relationship with her daughter and the interactions between them just don't make sense. The king is just the stereotypical evil fat king with no actual characterization other than he's a fat slob. This is just nit-picking but Krim's motivations also don't feel too believable and that he is just being too extreme and melodramatic. Other than that though, the main characters and their motivations do truly feel relatable and real and justify their actions. How Maquia interacts with her daughter exemplify the themes of saying goodbyes to loved ones no matter how painful it may be. I cried when I saw Maquia cry because she feels like a real person and I was able to connect to her past a superficial level. I could see what my Mother and what Maquia did for me and I could see myself in Ariel. Aside from that the character growth is the biggest prize here. We get to see Ariel grow up: a kid who loves his mother so much, to a teen that goes through a rebellious phase, to an adult who is able to live without his mother - all because of Maquia and the things that she has taught Ariel.Enjoyment: 10/10I was simply looking for something to make me feel alive and this made me feel alive. This review is getting too long.Overall: 9.5/10If you simply skipped to the end to see my overall rating and just want a TL;DR. If you like moms you will like this movie... probably. the story revolves around Maquia, her child, and her friends and her experience with the emotion love. It executes the themes of Motherhood beautifully with great story-telling elements such as the use of symbolism, juxtaposition, and colour to set an appropriate tone and mood for the story. With stories they should always try to immerse you into it, as if you are with Maquia and feeling what she is feeling, which the movie does without any problems.Art: 10/10Not many words to be said. Watch the trailer and you can see for yourself the amazing backdrops and the vivid smooth animation of the characters and how beautiful they all are. Each character feels unique in how they are protrayed from the small meek Maquia to the bold and tall Krim. The CG is fine and doesn't look out of place.Sound: 9.5/10The sound is amazing for sure but it doesn't feel unique. To say something what Mothers Basement had to say about the movie: it doesn't have a unique musical piece. Its the same fantasy music you hear in fantasy anime and JRPG's.Character: 9.5/10My biggest complaint here were the confusing motivations of one of the characters which I will not name. This character and her relationship with her daughter and the interactions between them just don't make sense. The king is just the stereotypical evil fat king with no actual characterization other than he's a fat slob. This is just nit-picking but Krim's motivations also don't feel too believable and that he is just being too extreme and melodramatic.

It makes Maquia\'s lack of real development a significant juxtaposition.The weight of the character\'s position, and many short sighted swings in the story that skip over so many things, make it very difficult to become emotionally invested and find anything to empathize with the character.A lot of people in reviews talked about how it was a reasonably emotional portrayal of motherhood and the challenges that come with it... But there\'s another movie that came out 5 years before that handles practically everything Maquia does in terms of the portrayal of motherhood VASTLY better in every regard.From the animation style that allows a significant range of character detail, and an incredibly immersive and drama supporting animation to the Main character who deals with her children growing up, and making choices and her developing along with them.Wolf Children doesn\'t randomly skip around through time frame, and instead smoothly transitions through many age mile stones for the children, without dropping bait and switch and dropping setups.Wolf Children also cleverly develops Hana\'s children away from their initial expectations into their end of the film growing selves incredibly well. You simply don\'t expect Yuki and Ame to take the paths that they do, and it so skillfully executed that it\'s absolutely marvelous every time.And all the while, Hana is learning and growing with them, taking the falls in stride, working through the struggles and finding the positives where it matters.Especially considering Ame and Ariel. Both being characters that pull away from their mother to learn to go their own path.The problem I think with Maquia isn\'t necessarily that it was written poorly, or anything to that degree. It\'s that it didn\'t have enough run time.I think every single problem that the Maquia film had was rooted in the fact that it\'s a 2hour movie, when it would have been ideal as a 24~26 2 season long anime. OR at least 13 episodes with an OVA(like Violet Evergarden). So much of the setup, skipping around, and lack of pay off in so many of the situations in Maquia come from the fact that it had to portray almost 2 lifetimes worth of a story in a 2 hour movie.This is something Wolf Children essentially had perfected. It was ideally set for a film and paced things carefully and quietly so that it\'d fit nice and neat and hit the right beats while as a film.TL;DRBoth films are about ""mommy struggles"", and Wolf Children blew it out of the water, where as Maquia didn\'t seem to know what to do with it and should have been an anime series.If you\'re looking for a good film for Motherhood experiences, Skip this and watch Wolf Children instead. good, but in the same sweep the animation style was restrictive and overly simplified character appearances to the point of having almost comedic designs that couldn\'t be taken seriously.The main character Maquia being essentially stuck as forever 15 years old(she doesn\'t age) made it so the character was fairly difficult to take seriously as well, and many moments fell flat because of the lack of real development and synergy of her character with her son.She has very little development and is a stagnated character, and this is made even more incredibly apparent with the way Leilia and Krim DO have reasonable developments and changes to their characters.

It was enjoyable, but i just wasn't really feeling it.The story, while unique and definitely sounded cool, was going so fast i was left unattached and uninterested in the characters and story. I just couldn't 'get into it'. I would've liked to see this in a series format rather than a movie, because it has a lot of potential but just fell short due to the time constraint of a movie. That aside, it had an amazing ending which definitely boosted my opinion on the movie as it ended on a high note.The art/animation...and sound were amazing. The characters were cool but as stated above i didn't really feel attached to them. I recommend people to watch this if you have the time, almost everyone else i watched it with absolutely loved it. and sound were amazing.

Impressed by the visual & then when it came in the middle I recalled my memory & even though I was confused with the story I resumed it. And eventually I have to say it is a masterpiece.Let me explain my points, this movie is impressively has a great plot, a beautiful world building, good choice of colour palate. The characters are designed briefly but, has defined roles. And with that confusion stuff, so its not new though, many directors choose that process...where they create a curiosity at the start of the story & clarifying that little by little throughout the journey. The story gets almost 90% clear by the end so its fair. The masterpiece stands for a mixture of all needed stuffs in an entertainment, & it has all of it. it has a little comedy, sadness, action & thrill so it clarify its path to become an master piece in my opinion.i'd recommend this movie to the mature anime watcher who knows very well about the styles & trends of the animation industry & who enjoy complicated, brain storming story stuffs mostly. This is not an movie that you wanna watch to fresh your mind after a busy day at office or college but, its a great choice for weekends & holidays. watch it calmly open your brain to observe what's goin on & all of it will combinedly give you serious chills at the end. where they create a curiosity at the start of the story & clarifying that little by little throughout the journey.

This is a heavy statement but it is indeed one of the best animated movies I\'ve ever watched. i have only watched it onceStory 9/10:Well, Mari Okada all right. She is known for her emotional stories and this one indeed enters the category just fiiiine!The movie feels very long in a good way: The story, the world and places, the character development, the sub plots... All these elements adds up and fill...the ensemble to the brim giving the impression to have lived and discovered a lot with the characters ; and that is one of the main strenghts here. Everything is well rounded and the difference of pace in the various plot elements do not leave any space to get bored. There is a well-balanced mix of emotional moments, intense action and everyday life organized in a non generic narrative structure, which I find very refreshing.The theme developped is that of the relationship between mother and child. It is not a very common subject developped in detail and I really enjoyed the depth and various angles the movie takes to treat the subject.-Takes place in a world that is a mixture of high-tier utopia fantasy where peaceful beings similar to elves are coexisting with nature and medieval human race in where kings and knights rule their part of the land in highly immoral and not-so-peaceful manner.-Mixes together political thriller, war, drama and daily life of both races.-Focuses on interracial willing and unwilling relationships. The main plot line being about elf-woman and a human child starting a family together where she takes the role of a (foster) mother. Another heavy motherhood-related concept is related to another elf-woman who is raped by the human king and becomes a (biological) parent to her child, but never sees her.-Deals with heavy questions about family, love, living, finding your own place in the world. As well as regret, adapting and one\'s purpose in life.Art 10/10:It goes without saying that this movie is beautiful. One look at literally any scene in the movie will go to show the polish put into it. The way that the sun and lighting are portrayed, the ethereal landscapes, the imaginative yet fully developed world, and even the tiny details such as the look of bricks were clearly polished and given thought. This is one of the greatest aspects of the movie.In much of what the storytelling lacks in time of narration, it makes up for in sound and art design. For example, the world\'s continual push towards industrialism is seen and reflected in world design. Scenes of similar areas in different time periods will have the nuances of the time period worked out. The introduction of steelworking is reflected in the lighter nights, the sight of smokestacks throughout regions of the city, and even more specifically reflected in the lives of the world. As the introduction of more industrial applications is continued, some jobs, for example, weaving on the loom, are accurately presented as slightly less common for it can be expected that such developments are becoming more centralized in factories. These are the sorts of nuances that will draw a viewer in without them fully realizing, and the degree to which the imaginative world reflects realism in such an intricate manner is what drives me to say that the story is outstanding; it is because the art and sound are outstanding to a degree that it greatly strengthens the story.One of my first worries about the art in specific was the usage of CGI in the animation of the movie. Yes, there are perhaps two scenes where the usage is notable in a way that could affect immersion. Despite that, the usage of CGI was so well accomplished that I was instead pleased with the fluid animation and vividness that it allowed. Thankfully also, the fluidity never subtracted from the style of the movie, and only added. It was a surprise to me seeing the two layered on top of each other to such great effect. That said, every facial animation and every camera angle was given much care as well. Even without extensive film training, I could see the desired effect of such framing in a way that was incredibly natural; that\'s just one more thing I was impressed by.Sound: 9.5/10:The sound is amazing for sure but it doesn\'t feel unique. To say something what Mothers Basement had to say about the movie: it doesn\'t have a unique musical piece. Its the same fantasy music you hear in fantasy anime and JRPG\'s. it feels very nostalgia.Characters: 10/10:I have seen many dramas, slice of life, romance and all other genres that tend to be thoroughly driven by the characters for the simple reason that they tend to be my favorite animes. And, well, in terms of characters, Maquia holds quite a high spot. And it seems only logic given how the anime works. You see the characters growing, so the character development that is usually done through flashbacks or other means of going back to the past are not necessary here as you are literally seeing all characters grow from children to adult. That means that the character development is close to complete, as you see all the important moments of their lives but get to live it at the same time as them and really gets you to like the characters a whole lot more. Along with that, although I\'m not really sure whether what I\'m about to say falls under Story or Character, the fact that you see the characters grow along the whole movie means you see their departures and deaths making it sad or at least gloomy, but it also makes you feel incredibly happy when friends that you had left at the beginning of the story reappear as adults, even if you saw them for only a minute or two before. For that simple reason, I consider this worth a 10/10 as i have just not seen anything better than that done before in terms of characters.Overall: 10/10This anime takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions, showing the hardships of the MC and the destiny fated to the clan of partings. My favourite quote from the movie, ""Once you love someone, you\'ll truly be alone"". This movie made me love love more, not just romance. Tear-jerking, heart-breaking, heart-mending. Beautiful movie, an artwork on a digital canvas. i simply scrolled down on MAL to see amovie for the night but it ended in a shocking happy way how good the movies truleyt was. the ensemble to the brim giving the impression to have lived and discovered a lot with the characters ; and that is one of the main strenghts here.

This review will henceforth be extremely biased as I enjoyed it so much I've rewatched it more than 5 times over the years.Much like Ariel , I was not raised by my biological mother but had a mother-like figure. As such , the film was oddly relatable and left a strange sadness in me. This film is a touching and thought-provoking exploration of love, loss, and the passage of time. It covers themes of identity, sacrifice, and the transient nature of existence.  Through the eyes of Maquia (a youthful, nigh-immortal...girl), we witness her journey through the joys and hardships of motherhood, offering a fresh perspective rarely seen in anime.Due to the context, the pacing was fast and involved many time-skips , so as to say that time in the eyes of the immortal go by very quickly. Years appear to pass by in the blink of an eye. It was meaningful but it may have messed with the storytelling.Characters in Maquia are beautifully realized and remarkably relatable. Maquia herself is a respectable protagonist, navigating the challenges of motherhood while grappling with her own immortal nature. The supporting cast is equally well-developed, their struggles and growth add layers of depth to the narrative. These characters have been imprinted into my head long after the credits rolled, a testament to their impact.The OST deserves special mention, as it perfectly complements the film's emotional journey. In moments of adversity , I find myself replaying these ethereal melodies and haunting compositions which evoke a powerful sense of wonder and melancholy. The sound design further helps with the immersion, creating an atmospheric backdrop that intensifies the emotional resonance of the story. girl), we witness her journey through the joys and hardships of motherhood, offering a fresh perspective rarely seen in anime.Due to the context, the pacing was fast and involved many time-skips , so as to say that time in the eyes of the immortal go by very quickly.

What these tall claims state though, was nowhere near what I experienced from this movie. I mean this in a bad way, not at all positive.Animations and Soundtrack: At the moment, the only positive aspects of the film I can really justify is the artstyle that is NOT cg as well as the score. Animation in this film was buttery smooth. The animations were crisp, finely woven with the world and just...really really fricken cute. What stains this, however, is that godawful cg. The Renato look so damn ugly, and I don't understand how why they didn't animate it instead because it looks like a fricken animatronic: lifeless and dead. It's especially concerning how this was a high budget movie and not some boned in episode of a certain anime show called Overlord Season 3. Other than that, great animations all around. The soundtrack on this film is phenomenal. Every track was deeply engrossed with the film and meant something rather than a few tunes that accompany the animation. If there is one thing that this film matches in quality with the top guns, it is the soundtrack; easily up there with A Silent Voice and Devilman Crybaby.Story: Severely cluttered, lacking and unfocused. The first half of this film was well introduced. The characters were introduced swiftly and very clearly to the viewer and the themes were easily captured in being about paternal love. That's cool and all, but the execution of said theme as the movie progresses was what really irks me. There were way too much timeskips in this film. I get that the film was trying to show the maturing nature of Ariel, but Story development based on just timeskips alone is generally going to be pretty damn mediocre (A Silent Voice and The Anthem of the Heart does a much better job at story development across several years through the use of timeskips but are minimal and not at all distracting compared to this garbage mumbo jumbo). The film had a pretty awful worldbuild as well. As the film progresses, you'll start to notice many, many things being introduced with absolutely no information accompanying it. You are introduced with the kingdoms yet they are just mere mentions, nothing more. I don't understand at all how they relate to each other. You are introduced to the renato, dragons that are utilized by a kingdom in war and dying by a disease; yet this very disease is unexplained, as I've said, merely mentioned. The stars of the show, the eternally young Iophorials (I hope I spelled it right) are not explained properly at all, lacking in the basics of how they even function. The concept of Hibiol is briefly touched upon, same old; merely mentioned and never explained. I just don't understand how people would stand to give this story a 8,9,10 with such glaring errors and mistakes. This film had plotholes the size of the Moon, it felt rushed in at times and wasn't coherently sorted at all. IMO this story is understandable but really, really terribly executed; probably the worst I've ever seen. More times than not, you'll be asking 'Who is this guy?, what's wrong with this guy?, why is this happening?' rather than enjoying the film, which really should not be happening.Characters: Firstly, the main characters of this film: Maquia and Ariel. The film went from baby Ariel to adult Ariel in a quarter of the movie and it simply wasn't enough. Ariel had so little development that there really was no empathy or sympathy at all for him. At the climax of his arc, all I could think of was how poorly developed this character was. He comes of as snotty and an overall brat which I had guess wasn't what the film was aiming for. His motives were unclear, his character; confusingly elaborate. If this film focused on just one stage of his childhood likewise to A Silent Voice, watchers would feel for him, understand him. The film doesn't do this. They try to shove every minor moment that Ariel had, trying to create a mishmash character development out of irrelevant timeskips. The result was sadly not up to par. Maquia, on the other hand was the better character. Out of the entire film, she was the only one that had great character development but her entire character was based on the trope of a kid parent learning to be a parent; which isn't inspiring but hey it gets the job done, though it really doesn't bring praise to this movie. The rest of the cast was used very,very,very unwisely. This exact film is what I call a show without secondary characters as they are all third rate. Not a single character in this film had a redeemable moment outside of Maquia and Ariel. Characters are popped in as instantly as they are popped out. Connections are rarely made and their actions are just mysterious and irrelevant as their role within the movie As I watch the events unfold I'll often be wondering to myself 'why does this even matter?' 'Wait, who tf this guy? Why should I care?' Precisely because not a single of these characters were developed well.Enjoyment: Did I enjoy it? I want to say I did. I really do. But there was way too much to consider that just pulled my overall experience level down. If you're looking at these reviews and seeing these 9s and 10s and expecting something of legendary status like A Silent Voice and Your Name, prepare to be disappointed because as it stands, this film is nowhere near the quality of the king and queen of anime films.This is my first review, written when I should've been studying exams at 12 in the morning xd. If you spent the time to read my wall of text, god fricken bless you >.< really really fricken cute. What stains this, however, is that godawful cg. The Renato look so damn ugly, and I don't understand how why they didn't animate it instead because it looks like a fricken animatronic: lifeless and dead. It's especially concerning how this was a high budget movie and not some boned in episode of a certain anime show called Overlord Season 3. Other than that, great animations all around. The soundtrack on this film is phenomenal. Every track was deeply engrossed with the film and meant something rather than a few tunes that accompany the animation. If there is one thing that this film matches in quality with the top guns, it is the soundtrack; easily up there with A Silent Voice and Devilman Crybaby.Story: Severely cluttered, lacking and unfocused. The first half of this film was well introduced. The characters were introduced swiftly and very clearly to the viewer and the themes were easily captured in being about paternal love. That's cool and all, but the execution of said theme as the movie progresses was what really irks me. There were way too much timeskips in this film. I get that the film was trying to show the maturing nature of Ariel, but Story development based on just timeskips alone is generally going to be pretty damn mediocre (A Silent Voice and The Anthem of the Heart does a much better job at story development across several years through the use of timeskips but are minimal and not at all distracting compared to this garbage mumbo jumbo). The film had a pretty awful worldbuild as well. As the film progresses, you'll start to notice many, many things being introduced with absolutely no information accompanying it. You are introduced with the kingdoms yet they are just mere mentions, nothing more. I don't understand at all how they relate to each other. You are introduced to the renato, dragons that are utilized by a kingdom in war and dying by a disease; yet this very disease is unexplained, as I've said, merely mentioned. The stars of the show, the eternally young Iophorials (I hope I spelled it right) are not explained properly at all, lacking in the basics of how they even function. The concept of Hibiol is briefly touched upon, same old; merely mentioned and never explained. I just don't understand how people would stand to give this story a 8,9,10 with such glaring errors and mistakes. This film had plotholes the size of the Moon, it felt rushed in at times and wasn't coherently sorted at all. IMO this story is understandable but really, really terribly executed; probably the worst I've ever seen. More times than not, you'll be asking 'Who is this guy?, what's wrong with this guy?, why is this happening?' rather than enjoying the film, which really should not be happening.Characters: Firstly, the main characters of this film: Maquia and Ariel. The film went from baby Ariel to adult Ariel in a quarter of the movie and it simply wasn't enough. Ariel had so little development that there really was no empathy or sympathy at all for him. At the climax of his arc, all I could think of was how poorly developed this character was. He comes of as snotty and an overall brat which I had guess wasn't what the film was aiming for. His motives were unclear, his character; confusingly elaborate. If this film focused on just one stage of his childhood likewise to A Silent Voice, watchers would feel for him, understand him. The film doesn't do this. They try to shove every minor moment that Ariel had, trying to create a mishmash character development out of irrelevant timeskips. The result was sadly not up to par. Maquia, on the other hand was the better character. Out of the entire film, she was the only one that had great character development but her entire character was based on the trope of a kid parent learning to be a parent; which isn't inspiring but hey it gets the job done, though it really doesn't bring praise to this movie.

Jk ok.Honestly why is the rating so high it was mid. Like good but not good enoughSoundtrack is midStory is good not bad I understood everything. I don’t understand how people like say plot holes, time skips? Bro that’s how some people tell stories man. I kind of like story telling like this gives a sense that time pass by so fast for her since she lives so long. Kinda sad but didn’t cry at all. Unique plot.Characters are cool they grow and shitz but you know like the focus of the...characters are kinda messy. Are they going to focus on war? Becoming a mother? Relationship of other characters? … but at the end they clear things up but you know messy.Pacing is good short movie you know didn’t really feel boredAnimation is good but nth like your name or koi no katachi or even the ghbli movies.Emotions and after thoughts not much just mid thought would feel sadder.Overall mid I thought it would be a more unique and more emotional grabbing movie. This movie nails how human life is so brief but lacking in execution.Btw I rate movies on how I feel during and after the movie. If the movie is funny I want to laugh. If the movie is scary I want to be so scared I can’t fall asleep. You get the point.So 7/10 prolly going to like change how I rate this stuff soon. characters are kinda messy.

Then boom, suddenly theres a war, the scummy king runs away (with no...explanation of what happened to him) and ariel decides to fight the war instead of going after her mother. Then its over and maquia left him for no reason. She goes on about forgetting him but she came back anyway when the dude was old.ART:the art was pretty good since it was a movie but it was no ""Your Name"" which ill give a 10 for art.SOUND:sound was pretty good i guess theres nothing special about itCHARACTER:Theres Maquia, the nice mother figure which ive grown to like but lowkey makes me mad since she was a little ""too"" nice for her own good. Its like everyone around her wants her. Apperently, its said she was pregnant some time in the movie but that was never shown.Ariel, a scummy kid that makes me grit my teeth everytime he comes onscreen. He loves his mother but treats her like shit when he\'s an ""adult"". Gave me hella rapey vibes. Wasnt really attached to this one, wish he was nicer so i could alteast affect me when he died.Leilia, didnt remember her much, she was basically a tool for the king or whatever.Lang, another irrelevant character that has feelings for maquia and got shot down.and etc, in conclusion i didnt feel any attachment to these characters at all.Overall, its a 5 its nothing special atleast to me so dont hate me if you love this movie. explanation of what happened to him) and ariel decides to fight the war instead of going after her mother.

Works were able to reveal their full potential with ""Maquia : when the promised flower blooms""I\'ve actually seen a lot of bad reviews for it, probable reasons are :-Early subs for the movie (pre blu-ray releases fansubs) are really messy : sentences are badly turned, which makes some scenes lose sense(like the one between Maquia and Krill). Moreover there are a lot of timeskips thus the viewer needs full attention to get in the flow of the movie.-Some people just hate Mary Okada or don\'t connect with her works. She has a unique style of storytelling and...pacing that is different from what you usually see in anime productions.-Lastly you need a certain emotional maturity to fully grasp Maquia and Ariel motivations.Thus I wouldn\'t recommend the movie to teens. The reason being that teenagers generally don\'t have enough retrospective on their own lives to understand and feel empathy towards the mother and child relationship that Maquia and Ariel have.Each of us have at some point acted cold towards our mothers and then reconciliated with them towards early adulthood, and that is the accuracy in the interactions between Maquia and Ariel that makes it such a good movie. I was laughing when Maquia and Ariel were laughing, I was crying when they were crying and I was cringing when Ariel was doing something stupid because I have also been there before, the way they interacted felt so real to me.The art was georgeous especially background art and the character designer Akihiko Yoshida (Nier Automata, Final fantasy tactics) models blend in well with it.Another highlight is the sound : voice actors for Maquia, Leila and both V.A. for Ariel ( child and adult) made a poignant performance.The ost is also really pleasant to the ears and is timed well with the strong moments from the movie making them even stronger. You could however nitpick about the lack of variety in it.In conclusion: Maquia is a tale about motherhood and the shapes it can take and it capitalises on the empathy one will feel towards its characters. However once it grips you, you\'re in for a rollercoaster of emotions comfirming Okada\'s ""genius of character drama"" title. pacing that is different from what you usually see in anime productions.-Lastly you need a certain emotional maturity to fully grasp Maquia and Ariel motivations.Thus I wouldn\'t recommend the movie to teens.

Sayonara no Asa ni Yakusoku no Hana wo Kazarou, or so-called ""Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms"" is an amazing movie resolving around Marquia, a member of a race called the Iorph, a race that can live for hundreds of years. One day, the outside world found out about her race, attacking her homeland and kidnapping Iorph females because the king of the power-hungry kingdom wants immortality of the Iorph to his bloodline. Luckily, Marquia escaped from the power-hungry kingdom by luckily getting carried away by a Renato.The Renato carried her...until it lands on a forest and dies. Marquia then found a baby in a destroyed village and decided to raise him. Naming him Ariel. Though she is inexperienced, she still tries her best to raise the baby with all she could.I\'d give the story around a 9. The ""mother\'s love"" plot was quite emotional and it touched me. Nearly making me cry. However, I feel like the story is missing some important factors that if added, it may fill the unfilled gap and make the movie become a masterpiece. I also feel like the movie\'s slightly rushed, so I didn\'t really feel like I got much development from the story.For the art I\'d give it around 8. Hey, don\'t get me wrong. The art\'s beautiful. But I don\'t really like this type of art style. That\'s all.Sound, 9 out of 10. Probably because it fits the scenes within the movie, especially important ones. That\'s all.As for character, 9 out of 10 as well. Character development is overwhelming, but could\'ve been better if it didn\'t feel too rushed.I enjoyed this movie. It was so fun and entertaining that it didn\'t even wipe by depression from Dusk Maiden Of Amnesia. But instead added more depression into my heart. Fuck.Overall, this movie was great. Well, could\'ve been better. But it\'s still great. You can watch this if you don\'t know what else to watch. Seriously, it\'s an amazing movie. until it lands on a forest and dies.

Characters. Beginning with design and ending with what comes out of them is straightforward terrible. I didn't shed a single tear unlike most. I guess they haven't seen something truly touching.It's almost 2 hours long, but first half was just wasted on god only knows what. Drama for the sake of drama, banal lines and flat characters that aren't developing but focused on one idea that's not driving the story or them anywhere. Click. One of...the main characters decides to move on (thank god!). Click. He's in the army now. Click. He got his childhood chick pregnant. That happens in less than 30 minutes after that wasted first half.There are couple of good moments but that's not enough from stopping you from breaking the screen. I wish they all died a painful death. But no. My wishes won't come true. Half are nearly (or completely) immortal. The other half lived an overall peaceful life. There's almost nothing about the world, situations or story overall that can involve, they focus on annoying characters instead. the main characters decides to move on (thank god!). Click.

The themes of immortals raising mortals and forever baby fever are admittedly not a ""safe bet"" like good vs. evil and (good xor bad) boy meets !(good xor bad) girl. So there are moments where the actions of our two polar opposite personalites and forever young Mama Bears Laylia and Maquia seem trite or unfortunate. But again, the execution is brilliant - and frankly those moments can either be read as true to the character OR trite, depending on the viewer. I think this is the main axis that splits people on...meh/love for this movie. The story is quite ambitious - it spans a lifetime and explores all stages of life thematically through a mature lens, without focusing too much on this aspect and making room for a dynamic plot about people stuck under the rule of brutal regimes and what they must do to eek out a living, or to survive when they find themselves at the center of conflict. As that implies, there is some solid action and the stakes feel quite high.I loved this thing. The story and everything that supports it. This is a complete package. Sound and score in particular are just amazing, the art is phenomenal although not as colorful as we are used to for most of the movie - but I will point out that the muted palette contrasts with the vibrant one we begin/end the movie with. Clearly this was intentional, it reflects the arc of life and parenting which has it\'s greatest joys and greatest struggles roughly in step with the choice of palette here which is awesome and hilarious. It is a more ""realistic"" style and the major effort seems to have gone into the detailed backgrounds, scale, and overall fluidity between the characters and their environment, the mood of the scene and mode of art direction appropriate for that scene. The production values are subordinate to the vision, the direction - as it should be. Still, many of the animation ""accents"" and action scenes were remarkably good and hit their marks without fanfare. The subtelty is appreciated.I don\'t usually put sound on a pedastal, but this is a beautiful soundtrack. We open with the sound of a harp and a massive industrial loom working in sync. Slowly we are shown angles that reveal the absolutely massive extent of this process in a beautiful spire with flowing water as a scintilating cloth that filters light like a prism and is to be understood as what The Fates of greco roman mythology weave i.e. a record of the past/present/future is spun. This melancholy, free spirit progression sets the mood for the ""clan of the separated"" and where they live to perfection. The quality of the opening tune and shots was incredibly immersive. Right after that, we get a clear first look at the personalities of Laylia and Maquia who will drive the plot forward later on. The exuberance of Laylia and trepidation of Maquia are both conveyed in the score as well as this scene. When things do turn dark, the sounds of the dragons and fire and things getting destroyed is equally impressive, likewise for the BGM. The same could be said of the final battle scene. Top notch voice acting for everyone except ironically Maquia, who has that very high-pitched ""oh, uh, um..."" thing going on, completes this package. They really got the sound effects, BGM, and the voice acting to a level you rarely see. The feel is that of a sophisticated high-quality live action that isn\'t trying to be sophisticated, just trying to do what makes the most sense. In line with that the sound and art (which clearly draws direct inspiration from lord of the rings) reminds me of the lord of the rings movies. Most scenes found a useful synergy between sound, art/set dressing/makeup, and the script. Bravo!Spotlighting the artwork, I\'ll go back to the opening. They conveyed with the bright colors and remote mountaintop vista a peaceful life observing the flow of time without affecting it, beyond the reach of the mortal realm. They wear white togas and sandals, the architectural features are reminiscent of ancient greece and stonehenge, certainly there is a druidic influence to the designs - but with functioning wooden windows and doors. The interiors are reminiscent of Hobbiton from LOTR. Plain stone steps, circles and ovals, simple quarters with wooden looms and a small bed by a window, candlelight, water flowing everywhere. It is all beautiful and simple and functional - a purposeful existence. I felt they were alluding to mount olympus in that they appear to be at the peak of some mountain somewhere, but there are so many other influences it feels unique. A warm place for some of the elves, and a cold place for others - for Laylia, an ill-fated, free-spirited girl, it is a home. For Maquia, whose fate is less tragic, and who does not appear to have any loving relationships with other elves in contrast to Laylia, it is a limbo. Just as we begin to feel comfortable with the setting, amid a beautiful field of blooming flowers in the night... DRAGON RIDERS! OH SHIT! ""Take the women, kill any who resist!"" - well then, and now for something completely different! A completely different set of influences and elements will now be revealed as we explore the world beyond this mystical mountaintop. These dragons look incredible by the way. The mouse like Maquia, having escaped, will be shown prying the rigomortised fingers of a slain mother away from a crying baby in the night and taking him in. We see from this point on a marked change in the art direction - it is as if the idea of the place where the cloth was woven has been forgotten. It\'s really good. This is some game of thrones stuff in terms of the world they are able to create visually - and thankfully no one drew their starbucks onto anyone\'s desk.My feeling overall is that this is one of the best movies I\'ve seen in recent memory. The package is generally appealing enough as a film, that it makes my very short lists of ""Anime for people who hate Animated stuff"", ""family viewing"", and ""plan to rewatch"" titles. Clearly some recycling from live action classics like lord of the rings, probably game of thrones too - but it was distinct enough to feel original. Reminds me of Kyousou Giga in a way. Something of a case study on bloodless family bonds and how to navigate them as an immortal being that hits surprisingly close to heart for the viewer, because it puts a strain on the natural version of these bonds that the average lifespan cannot. The theme of motherhood, in all its high glory and ugly desperation, overriding all other aspects of being regardless of circumstance is really what we\'re exploring in this movie. The grief of losing a loved one and the relative value of our bonds when they pull in opposite directions, war and the strange duality of citizenship - it is both the most and least important thing, we are both detached from and inextricably linked to the political absurditites of those who rule. It succeeds quite well most of the time in dealing with the long arc of life and intracacies of love - both a sad, and a happy ending. What glues it all together is a beautiful soundscape and score that nails every section of this story - it\'s not particularly original, but it is just perfect for precisely the sequences it supports. That\'s the +1 from a 9/10 for me, having watched the dub I have to say every supporting character does incredible work in an atypically mature style of dialogue, and the title character\'s more anime-traditional delicate flower voice is not much of a drag on that thankfully. meh/love for this movie.

And in movies which should appeal to one's emotional, those are the most important features.The first quarter of the movie is decent.Spoilers ahead!...One of the MCs goes from cute kid to generic rebel character to saying he'd be a responsible son to responsible parent to being an unresponsible parent within a short time.The other MC is as plain as it gets.The rest of the cast is weak, I feel like they could've been much better. Krim seemed interesting, but ended up being quite pathetic. And Leilia, the second mother, the one who wanted to see her child so much and dreamt of being free, once she becomes free and sees her child, she decides to jump of a tower and leave it all behind. What a fantastic development.The subplot, war, is actually better developed than the main plot and makes sense.The art, which was the reason I watched this, was disappointing, but that's on me, I was expecting to see more of Yoshida's art.The scenaries are gorgeous and the animation is good.The 3D animation was ok but offputting.Soundtrack is barely there.In the end, it's still somewhat enjoyable.

This movie is such a fantastic anime story which circulates you in non-ending emotions.This superb movie script was written by Mari Okada, the one famous for anohana, gundam iron blood and many more. I have yet to watch anohana but by watching the movie I can expect more of the series.I am sad that its not in higher ranks. This movie is such a underrated gem and it should be on the level of fantastic movies such as Your Name and A Silent Voice.You guys should circulate this...movie around the world and share it please, I dont want to see such a best gem in lower ranks.I have also saw that there are many fans disliking the movie plot or about characters but I don't care even it had some skips this movie made my day and i enjoyed it.Story=9.5The story is a bit skipped but overall its not that much to be considered as a worst. The story is such a emotional rollercoster which is why i had towel of mine instead of tissues. Well this movie is that much great that it will leave a impact in your heart and whenever you will remember the movie it will calm our heart.

I enjoyed it because it delves into the emotional struggles of its characters in a way that feels genuine and heartfelt.The art style is quite fitting for the story. It's beautifully animated, capturing both the fantastical and mundane aspects of the world, which complement the emotional depth of the narrative.The characters are well-rounded; they have both strengths and flaws. Maquia, for instance, possesses resilience and love but also faces challenges stemming from...her immortality. Other characters also undergo realistic development, showcasing their strengths and vulnerabilities.Their reactions to situations feel genuine and human. They grapple with difficult decisions and emotions, reacting in ways that feel authentic given their circumstances.As for others' enjoyment, it depends on individual tastes. Those who appreciate emotionally rich narratives, stunning animation, and themes of love and sacrifice may find it captivating.

I personally found the story to be scattered, and all over the place. There was no logical divide between the ""Chapters"" of their lives. In one scene Ariel is a kid, and then 2 seconds later he is a teen, and then 2 seconds later he is a young adult. So there were multiple times when I had to pause and go back 5 seconds to see if I missed anything. And, I feel, that if I have to manually do that, then it is not directed properly, and the story has no flow. The beginning hour,...let\'s say, of the story was quite enjoyable, however, they dragged it on too long (It is roughly a 2hour movie) and left many things ""in the dark"", such as the red-eye disease that wiped out the dragons, what happened to the rest of the Iorphians, etc.Art and Sound design:9/10 and 9/10 respectively. The art and animation are smoooooth man and it\'s very pretty. The eyeshines and the general physical appearance of the characters ""fit"" medieval times and that era in general, whether that be how they\'re dressed or how their faces are drawn and the colors used. Overall, not the most amazing aesthetics and style but still veeery beautiful.The soundtrack and voice acting are exquisite as usual, I particularly liked Maquia\'s voice. I felt that it suited her character very well, and that scream she gave at the end daaaang.Character:6/10I don\'t know why, but I don\'t like how some characters behaved in certain situations. For instance, Ariel and Dita; he hated her in the beginning, they didn\'t have a friendship and she acted like a bully. Then they showed no further interaction between the two, but decide to skip to the part where she is freaking pregnant with their chiiild????

Yeah probably... but did I enjoy it? Not at all. Honestly I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. About halfway through I just wanted it to end.Story 6/10To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of tragedy but from an objective point of view, most of the plot feels like it was written as a poor attempt to make me pity the characters or something... I guess. We're presented with the point of view of MC who lives much longer than the rest of the cast and also some other challenges people with longevity face which obviously will have its...cons... except that there were so many it was pretty much a two-hour trainwreck and there was no time to breathe. Though I have to give credit to how the story was presented. As from the point of view of the MC, it was purposely fast-paced to imply how time that seems very long to us passes by her in a flash.While finishing the movie did leave a bitter taste in my mouth, I eventually realised that some plot elements which I thought didn't make sense or were downright stupid turned out to actually be really clever. I agree with the reviews that say we don't see enough of Maquia and Ariel's relationship, the main focus of the movie, in fact it was hardly there... after a certain point... while other characters I had no interest in got the spotlight.Art 10/10I'm no art expert, like at all. But in my opinion it was beautiful, consistent, and the CG Renato was pretty awesome. If something is worth sitting this movie for, its to admire the art and animation and you can just turn the subs and sound off. (just joking but saying this in case)Sound 8/10To be honest this might not be a fair review as I didn't even pay attention to the sound, I only noticed the ending song which is quite pleasant to listen to.Character 4/104 for decent because honestly the only decent development was Maquia, but only her. Learning to not fear love and all, not bad. It really makes her the only likeable character in the movie and literally everyone else just gave me a headache right until the end. Did their actions make sense? I mean they were realistic, but on an enjoyment level I couldn't bring myself to like any of them.Enjoyment 1/10If Satan made a cinematic masterpiece it would be this.

I read a similar manga where there were many time skips in 6 chapters (from birth to death and to heaven and then the afterlife) and I loved and cried 10x more for that manga than this movie so just being honest, they probably did something wrong.I didn't like Your Lie in April either (which is hugely popular and many people can safely call a masterpiece) so I think as a rule of thumb - if you liked Your Lie in April then you should watch this and if you didn't then don't. cons... except that there were so many it was pretty much a two-hour trainwreck and there was no time to breathe.

Maquia is very insistent on this. It is written into the premise of the movie, about how an immortal, elf-like woman tries to raise her non-immortal, very human son. This promise is repeated throughout the movie, so much so that you’d think it really was only a matter of time before she would be separated from her son. And yet, somehow, this movie is not a tragedy. Though it is mired by its frequent narrative missteps, Maquia...is perhaps one of the most profound reflections on parenthood and responsibility I have ever seen.Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms, Mari Okada’s directorial debut, follows Maquia, a mythical, ageless being, after she rescues a baby, Ariel, and raises him as her own. It chronicles their lives as Maquia adjusts to the outside world and learns how to provide for her newborn son. Much (honestly, all) of the draw of this movie involves Maquia and Ariel’s journey across foreign lands, their bond together as mother and son, and what we can learn from how it changes over time and circumstance.And to its credit, Maquia’s chronicle of parenthood is told with surprising acuity. Maquia’s early days of raising a baby on a farm are replete with the simple joys of parenting itself. Seeing Ariel walk for the first time, or being there to hear his first words—to Maquia the movie, these are joys worth sharing, milestones in parenthood that feel like their own reward. But parenting is not just some babysitting here and there. Maquia the movie does not shy away from the uncomfortable realities of being a working parent and its newfound emotional and economic toll. A forced relocation turns into a financial disaster, with Maquia struggling to make ends meet. At home, Ariel is uncooperative, and lacks the maturity and understanding to support his mother when she’s down. Maquia the movie shows an incisiveness to parenting that feels as if it was drawn from Mari Okada’s own experience with motherhood herself, and it is certainly all the more convincing for it.Adding to Maquia’s strengths is how it sells itself as a powerful and moving film, and everything from the sophistication of its production to its loving journey of a mother and her son would speak as such. This is because Maquia is adept at keeping the “texture” of its drama intact. In its big moments, everything feels the way it should. Its ideas of parenthood and love are (supposedly) universal. Its animation is fluid, and the various subtleties of each character’s emotional states are expressed in thoroughly convincing detail. The soundtrack that plays during key moments between Maquia and her son may be one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard.And that, on a basic level, is about where the strengths of this story end. Maquia the movie prides itself on being an important, heartfelt drama, but much of this drama either doesn’t land, doesn’t make sense, or both. The things these characters are saying are just too unnatural, too out of touch, too focused on some heightened dramatic reality where children swearing they will grow up to “protect” their parents (from… what, exactly?) makes those parents break down in tears. And it’s telling how blunt some of the drama is that I was rarely left with the sense that anything substantial was actually said during what should have been key moments of catharsis.Then there are the pacing issues. The frequent timeskips create tonal disconnects where characters we thought we knew spontaneously change, some for seemingly no reason. It takes active effort, as a viewer, to readjust to people behaving in ways that seem incongruent with how we have seen them only moments prior, even if the movie has some ostensible reason to do so to reflect how people change through the passage of time. One minute we see Ariel reconciling with Maquia after the stress of being a parent becomes too much for her to bear. The next minute, he’s… avoiding her? With no explanation? And then it happens again, a few scenes later? Where is the movie going with this? And what’s a Hibiol, again?And yet, this is still a movie worth applauding. Maquia is not just a drama about the trials a mother goes through in raising her son. If that’s all this movie had going for it, I would not be writing this review. Because Maquia does not just chronicle the relationship between a mother and her child. Maquia charts Ariel’s growth over his entire lifespan, from early childhood to teenage development to independence in his adult years. Suddenly, Ariel is leaving the house, he’s getting married, he’s expecting his own baby. And suddenly, you realise Maquia isn’t just about someone figuring out how to be a parent—it’s about the nature of parenting itself.The promises of parenthood are never what we expect. There is no guidebook, no instructions, no steps on parenting that teach us how to treat our children right. Being a mother is something Maquia learns only as she does it, where she has to both realise what her mistakes are and fix them, all on her own. We are constantly reminded of the lingering doubt in her mind if she has actually been a good parent at all. And as Ariel matures, new problems arise. As he grows older, he is no longer the naïve, dependent child he once used to be. But Maquia continues treating him as such, her good will getting in the way of being a good mother because she is parenting in the only way she knows how.Which was why I found it so curious this movie would insist that Maquia losing Ariel was all but inevitable. Because it’s true. Maquia does not stay with Ariel forever. This movie makes it a point to show Ariel beginning his own life as an adult, now as a husband, and a soon-to-be father of his own. The childhood innocence Maquia once saw in Ariel is lost as he grows older, and in its place is the same sense of maturity and responsibility Maquia had to learn as she was raising him. People grow, and people change, and Maquia the movie posits that, sometimes, that change is irreconcilable with the past. The idea that familial love is unconditional and forever is incompatible with this movie, where Ariel’s relationship with Maquia grows ever more strained as he matures into adulthood and becomes increasingly independent, and as he comes to terms with his own unique responsibilities that arise from it. Instead, Maquia the movie is about accepting how our children will one day grow beyond us, and how they will come to value the efforts and sacrifices they made for their children as we did for them.I don’t know if this is a good movie, but I do know it is ahead of its time. The script itself feels amateurish, and what should have been powerful and moving drama was let down by characters talking in ways that meant nothing of substance and carried little meaningful dramatic weight. It has pacing issues, tonal issues, and is full of confusing narrative ideas—some which work, and some that absolutely do not. And yet, I have never seen a movie that makes such profound statements on the nature of parenthood, and the courage of those who undertake it. Maquia is a movie that cares deeply about what being a parent really means, a movie that understands how our children will not always stay with us, and how they will grow up and learn to take on the same mantle we took on for them. As a character drama, this movie is riddled with missteps and questionable narrative choices. But as a reflection of parenthood? As an affirmation of everything that makes parenting worthwhile? It is a triumph. Sometimes, being a parent is about being there for them when it matters, and to love and nurture them all the while. And sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is to let them go. is perhaps one of the most profound reflections on parenthood and responsibility I have ever seen.Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms, Mari Okada’s directorial debut, follows Maquia, a mythical, ageless being, after she rescues a baby, Ariel, and raises him as her own.

Seeing Ariel walk for the first time, or being there to hear his first words—to Maquia the movie, these are joys worth sharing, milestones in parenthood that feel like their own reward. But parenting is not just some babysitting here and there. Maquia the movie does not shy away from the uncomfortable realities of being a working parent and its newfound emotional and economic toll. A forced relocation turns into a financial disaster, with Maquia struggling to make ends meet. At home, Ariel is uncooperative, and lacks the maturity and understanding to support his mother when she’s down. Maquia the movie shows an incisiveness to parenting that feels as if it was drawn from Mari Okada’s own experience with motherhood herself, and it is certainly all the more convincing for it.Adding to Maquia’s strengths is how it sells itself as a powerful and moving film, and everything from the sophistication of its production to its loving journey of a mother and her son would speak as such. This is because Maquia is adept at keeping the “texture” of its drama intact. In its big moments, everything feels the way it should. Its ideas of parenthood and love are (supposedly) universal. Its animation is fluid, and the various subtleties of each character’s emotional states are expressed in thoroughly convincing detail. The soundtrack that plays during key moments between Maquia and her son may be one of the most beautiful things I have ever heard.And that, on a basic level, is about where the strengths of this story end. Maquia the movie prides itself on being an important, heartfelt drama, but much of this drama either doesn’t land, doesn’t make sense, or both. The things these characters are saying are just too unnatural, too out of touch, too focused on some heightened dramatic reality where children swearing they will grow up to “protect” their parents (from… what, exactly?) makes those parents break down in tears. And it’s telling how blunt some of the drama is that I was rarely left with the sense that anything substantial was actually said during what should have been key moments of catharsis.Then there are the pacing issues. The frequent timeskips create tonal disconnects where characters we thought we knew spontaneously change, some for seemingly no reason. It takes active effort, as a viewer, to readjust to people behaving in ways that seem incongruent with how we have seen them only moments prior, even if the movie has some ostensible reason to do so to reflect how people change through the passage of time. One minute we see Ariel reconciling with Maquia after the stress of being a parent becomes too much for her to bear. The next minute, he’s… avoiding her? With no explanation? And then it happens again, a few scenes later? Where is the movie going with this? And what’s a Hibiol, again?And yet, this is still a movie worth applauding. Maquia is not just a drama about the trials a mother goes through in raising her son. If that’s all this movie had going for it, I would not be writing this review. Because Maquia does not just chronicle the relationship between a mother and her child. Maquia charts Ariel’s growth over his entire lifespan, from early childhood to teenage development to independence in his adult years. Suddenly, Ariel is leaving the house, he’s getting married, he’s expecting his own baby. And suddenly, you realise Maquia isn’t just about someone figuring out how to be a parent—it’s about the nature of parenting itself.The promises of parenthood are never what we expect. There is no guidebook, no instructions, no steps on parenting that teach us how to treat our children right. Being a mother is something Maquia learns only as she does it, where she has to both realise what her mistakes are and fix them, all on her own. We are constantly reminded of the lingering doubt in her mind if she has actually been a good parent at all. And as Ariel matures, new problems arise. As he grows older, he is no longer the naïve, dependent child he once used to be. But Maquia continues treating him as such, her good will getting in the way of being a good mother because she is parenting in the only way she knows how.Which was why I found it so curious this movie would insist that Maquia losing Ariel was all but inevitable. Because it’s true. Maquia does not stay with Ariel forever. This movie makes it a point to show Ariel beginning his own life as an adult, now as a husband, and a soon-to-be father of his own. The childhood innocence Maquia once saw in Ariel is lost as he grows older, and in its place is the same sense of maturity and responsibility Maquia had to learn as she was raising him. People grow, and people change, and Maquia the movie posits that, sometimes, that change is irreconcilable with the past. The idea that familial love is unconditional and forever is incompatible with this movie, where Ariel’s relationship with Maquia grows ever more strained as he matures into adulthood and becomes increasingly independent, and as he comes to terms with his own unique responsibilities that arise from it. Instead, Maquia the movie is about accepting how our children will one day grow beyond us, and how they will come to value the efforts and sacrifices they made for their children as we did for them.I don’t know if this is a good movie, but I do know it is ahead of its time. The script itself feels amateurish, and what should have been powerful and moving drama was let down by characters talking in ways that meant nothing of substance and carried little meaningful dramatic weight. It has pacing issues, tonal issues, and is full of confusing narrative ideas—some which work, and some that absolutely do not. And yet, I have never seen a movie that makes such profound statements on the nature of parenthood, and the courage of those who undertake it. Maquia is a movie that cares deeply about what being a parent really means, a movie that understands how our children will not always stay with us, and how they will grow up and learn to take on the same mantle we took on for them. As a character drama, this movie is riddled with missteps and questionable narrative choices. But as a reflection of parenthood? As an affirmation of everything that makes parenting worthwhile? It is a triumph. Sometimes, being a parent is about being there for them when it matters, and to love and nurture them all the while. And sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is to let them go.', 'A tear-jerker, that\'s definitely over-hyped.Sure I shed tears on the right cues, so I could\'ve rated it higher, but the fact remains.. this anime is just average.- Things aren\'t explained. Random events just happened. Stupid flying dragons suddenly turning red and dying, with no explanation. They don\'t even bother explaining much about the ""EVIL EMPIRE"" (people seem to be happy, was the empire even evil or not?).- The loom nonsense is just a bunch of gobbledygook with elves (or ""Iorph"", whatever they wanna call Elves in this) being all depressive and child-like (can\'t have anime without sexualizing 5000 year old children). Only time anything with...""loom"" was interesting, was in the movie Wanted (2008), and it was because of the action, not because of fucking thread weaving skills of the characters.- Plot-holes maketh the plot, so do the jump-cuts. This movie needed another 30-60 mins to fill in the lore. Characters not only age every few mins, they even have background romance and suddenly are popping children while the viewer is left wondering, ""Dafuq, did they even have any chemistry in that 10 second scene an hour ago?"". Maybe if they didn\'t spend time on pointless lingering shots of characters crying, they could\'ve added some dialogue and lore, minus the jump-cuts.Art is good, English dub is garbage (muffled dialogues with music blaring in on max volume). Main character is just a weird mess who spends the whole movie crying, ending the movie crying. Movie just randomly ends and you now have to figure out who the new characters are, not that it matters as the movie rushes to end the movie.Overall, I just felt disappointed at the end. I did like the last scene of the fields, it was beautifully done.. which is why I gave it 5, not 4.Art saves it, story is a mess. If you shed tears during emotional scenes easily (like I do), you\'ll do here as well. But don\'t mistake those tears for quality. Those tears are NOT quality tears.

This movie did a few things well, and I quite liked the story and the message it delivers. It does however lack seriously in character development outside of the two MCs, like seriously lacks. It was only so apparent because it seemed like they were setting up several other characters to have their own great stories or developments and then basically did nothing with any of them. It left a few characters fairly open ended as the story progresses which is also pretty disappointing. We spend enough time with them to grow some attachment...and then literally never see them again and no one really seems to care.I came to this movie becuase I kindof like \'tear-jerker\' movies and shows but this really didn\'t hit the way I thought it would. I got a little watery eyed but no real tears and it honestly left me wondering ""why?"" over and over again.Art style is meh, not a fan. The world it\'s set in is kinda cool. There are some elements relating to abuse, suicide, and manipulation that felt honestly a little innapropriate for the movie (these were NOT the focus in any way of the movie, just elements thrown in there a tiny bit).I still liked it and recommend it, hence the 7/10 rating, but I wouldn\'t bash anyone for rating it lower though I would be concerned about any opinions that gave it a higher rating. and then literally never see them again and no one really seems to care.I came to this movie becuase I kindof like \'tear-jerker\' movies and shows but this really didn\'t hit the way I thought it would.

Properly sob. I will endeavour to talk about this film more, but I think this has to be put up-front because it has NEVER happened to me before. I mean never. This is why I have to give it the score I've given it, because I cannot plausibly have a film hit me on an emotional level I have never experienced before and give it anything else. It hit VERY close to home for me, and I will talk a bit (as impersonally as I can) about why, but that emotional response comes above...everything else to me.So, Maquia.

I have spoken many times about my admiration for her as a writer, and this sort of proves a lot of the reasons why I love her so much.On the direction level, her new endeavour, I can't say I have any major issues. It was fairly conventionally directed, with the occasional shot here and there that feels a bit more aspirational. I think that was probably a sensible approach, it meant the direction didn't get in the way and was largely successful, rather than jumping into something really ambitious and stumbling. The animation is strong, the background work is particularly astounding. The character design is decent, although a couple of characters look a little similar, which does lead to a tiny bit of confusion at a couple of points. But as a production, P.A Works' strengths certainly shine through.But I show up to a Mari Okada film for the writing, and she's given us some of her best work here. This is a beautiful story, heartwarming and heartbreaking and tragic and gentle. It's a story about love, about growing up, and about motherhood. For someone who doesn't have the best relationship with her mother right now, it kicked me square in the gut. Sometimes a story just hits you somewhere so deep, so personal, and Mari Okada is someone I find does that for me quite often, but even then, never anywhere close to this level.I can't promise you'll have that experience. The friends I was watching it with reacted at various different levels, and not all of them at anywhere close to the same level as me. But even if you don't, it's a touching, emotional film that's bound to give you something you're looking for. And maybe, just maybe, you'll find something in it like I did. I, for one, will remember this movie for a very long time, and I imagine it will come to hold a very special place in my heart, as the first piece of art to ever make me break into tears. everything else to me.So, Maquia.

But first, SPOILERS ALERT!!!Firstly, I would like to congratulate P.A Works for another excellent production. I didn\'t know that they made Nagi no Asukara (A lull in the sea) as well. Which if you haven\'t watched, I highly recommend you do.The way this movie presented itself might have caused a lot of people to be annoyed, confused, or even angry. The actions that some of the characters chose to do were at times questionable to say the very least. However, the main focus of this movie to me was about...Moving On. For me, this really hits home, because of my parent\'s occupation, I move to different countries every few years. Not to say that I don\'t have any friends, but never a place I could truly call home.Characters such as Leilia at first was upset that she couldn\'t be with Krim, but eventually moved on, and she also moved on from her daughter, knowing that she would just bring more pain if she had stayed (similar situation to of Ariel and Maquia). As for Maquia, she had to move on from her clan, then her family (Mida and the dog), and at the very end Ariel as well. While I felt a lot of empathy for her, I could not say that I felt bad for her. She acknowledges the reality of her situation and decides to fully embrace it. If anything, I\'d say she has balls made of steel. Ironic isn\'t it, a clan that was suppose to frozen in time, moves on in the end (Maquia and Leilia), and ultimately, for the ones who are immortal, even if they can live forever, if they cannot resolve the past, no matter what happens, will eventually end up like Krim, who also held on to the past, unable to move on, scared of what Leilia has become, winding up dead.Motherhood, another strong theme presented in this movie, Maquia and Leilia, both showed how strong a mother\'s love can be. For Leilia, she loved her daughter enough to abandon her at the very end (reason stated above), despite Medmel being a child her was forced to have. As for Maquia, she decides to adopt a orphaned child, and raises him to be her own. This movie shows the situation of different motherhoods, all of them have different problems and obstacles, but what is common is their love for their child.I thought the art, the sound, the characters were all great. And I would say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. However, the one thing I cannot overlook, not just in this movie, but in most animes is that the story is kinda wonky. One thing I hate is plot holes and lazily written scripts, and no matter what you think of this movie, this movie definitely has those moments. Excuse my french but, how the fck did the soldiers from Mezarte find Iorph in the first place? Like, can you just walk in and walk out like whenever you want? Wtf is up with that dumb idea?? Also, wtf happened to all the other women in Iorph, I remember the king of Mezarte was looking for more Iorph women because the prince was bored with Leilia, wtf did they do with all the other women? Killed them all? nah, they didn\'t explain shit, and same argument with the males of Iorph. Also, I felt as if they could\'ve made the weaving stuff more significant to the story. I felt as if the symbolism behind it was largely missed out due to the writing. Also, I understand why Leilia left her child, but seriously? I felt really angry about that, she was so desperate to see her, and even disregarded Krim for it, but nah, the moment she saw her, she was like ""sike"" ""forget about me lmao"". That was really wack writing from the writers. Also, where tf did Maquia and Leilia end up at the end? Iorph? Wasn\'t it destroyed? wut???? While some may argue, oh that\'s not important, I\'d say it\'s just lazy writing again.But despite these flaws that I thought to be present, overall, this movie was amazing in a lot of different ways. Some moments were so realistic, that I even almost teared up. This is a must watch, a great movie with a good theme. 9/10 for me (the missing 1 is for the wacky plot holes). Moving On.

Everything here is written based on the assumption that you, as the reader, have at least read the synopsis, if not watched the actual movie.Sayonara no Asa ni Yakusoku no Hana wo Kazarou, or SayoAsa, was a great goddamn film. Although I\'m a male and currently not yet in a relationship, even I could sympathize with Maquia\'s (the main lead) tribulations as a mother and learned to appreciate those like her, who raise us. I was crying constantly during the last few dozen minutes like I had been reverted back into when I was a baby from how beautiful the...portrayal was. But, without further ado, the actual review:Starting off with the story aspect, I feel like this was the weakest out of everything - though admittedly, it was still very good. The start was pretty generic and simplistic in terms of how these types of fantasy-drama anime movies go - Maquia\'s home village is attacked and she manages to escape through sheer luck by using the dragon to take her away from the village. After this, however, everything gets much more interesting - especially with all the characters meeting up again after years have gone by. Unfortunately, even though I consider Maquia to be incredible, it does admittedly have a lot of plot holes even I could spot over all my time spent crying. For one, it was way too convenient for the first dragon to contract the Red-Eye disease or whatever it was at the start, just in time to save Maquia. It was also jarring how fast some of the time skip transitions were in the latter half of the movie. All-in-all though, these points are generally just nitpicking.Onto art, it was really good. Not much to say here. The animation was fluid and the art portrayed people\'s emotions very well. Everything was very detailed, too, as expected for movie production. Not once did I spot any characters in the background missing any details, like eyes and mouths. The character designs were very pretty and even though all the Iorph\'s were quite similar in appearance, it was always possible to distinguish from who was who even without the character\'s voices.Speaking of voices, the next area to critique is the sound. And damn was the sound good. Every character\'s voice acting was absolutely incredible, especially the main few. Maquia has a relatively subdued, quiet, and polite voice most of the time, but when the scenes require it, her VA does an excellent job at portraying incredible happiness, sadness, etc. I especially felt like it was really good at that line about ""her promise"", and if you\'ve watched the movie, you know what I mean.As for the character portion, this was the area which bumped my enjoyment and overall rating to a ten. All of the characters have unique personalities and the character development is incredible to watch, specifically those of Maquia and Ariel/Eriel. The way the movie showed how painful it was to be a mother (especially so for her age), and also its portrayal of Ariel\'s rebellious stages was especially nut-busting good. And when I mean nut, I mean NUT-nut. The struggles and tribulations EVERY major character in the film goes through, and I mean EVERYONE (except for Izor, but eh) goes through will make you tear up, if not individually then collectively.In the end, this movie was a 10/10 for me, and it\'s probably my favorite film of all time. Take that with a huge grain of salt, as I\'m a weeb who doesn\'t go outside much and therefore I haven\'t seen many movies (actually probably watched more anime films than live-action), but still, it says what I like about the movie. In terms of overall anime I\'ve seen, I would rate this film in my top three. Go watch it if you haven\'t, if not for the presentation of motherhood and all that, then just to see a good story with good animation, sound direction and heart-pulling scenes.Ten-out-of-goddamn-ten. portrayal was.

I liked the story line very very much. It is a very beautiful anime and it sometimes made me very sad.This is one of my favorite anime movies that I have watched I liked the development in each character and how it progresses further on the story and how each of them interact in some ways it reminded me of a kinda broken family but reunites again further on the story progresses.I would highly recommend this to people who like movies that have this much emotions. They progress...so much in how their life and shows the different kinds of ways that a family is hard and how hard it is raising a child as a single parent. so much in how their life and shows the different kinds of ways that a family is hard and how hard it is raising a child as a single parent.', 'Maquia: When the Promised Flower BloomsThere\'s a quotation, ""Death leaves a heartache no one can heal, love leaves a memory no one can steal.""It\'s a fatal example of an extreme heartbreak in the name of motherhood, an astonishing story of the immortal girl named Maquia... I\'ve never seen such  storyline like this but heck, every second was worth of the time! The story has it\'s own charms like you wouldn\'t mind to go with the flow....And the most significant part of the movie is how a girl becomes a mother, a worrier who is ready to do everything to protect her child....Like raising the child during the development of her motherhood adventures and the feelings being elaborated in her terms was phenomenal....Last but not the least this was remarkably dramatic animé so far but still I would love to watch it again and again.

The desire to see how humanity advances, the intriguing future prospects are so tantalising - and yet, when you think about how you would go about life. The people you meet, the relationships you build and saying goodbye to those that are dear to you. It will...make anyone feel lonely. I feel that the film has captured those emotions well, and thus delivered to the viewers in sentimental moments of the film. However, the total execution of events wasn't the cleanest, and at times the plot was somewhat difficult to follow with the time skips, and the lack of explanation of certain plot points did make me feel disconnected with the story at times.Art: 8/10There are very nice details in the settings and characters, and the animations are crisp and clean. I'm not very well-versed in this part but I'd say the studio did a good job with the art.Sound: 7/10Nothing too notable here for me, there are some nice inserts here and there and I believe the music wasn't detrimental to the experience in any way, but I wasn't particularly moved or felt that certain scenes were enhanced by the sound provided.Characters: 8/10Most characters are developed well enough and I never felt stale with anyone but there are some that could use some explanation, with how and why they're back in the plot, as those that were present had few details elaborated on.Enjoyment: 9/10 + Conclusion; 8/10Overall, I am pleased with the movie.

Stories where we see characters really grow up and change are favorites of mine. And stories about the bond between parents and children hit home with me personally.The journey that Maquia and Ariel go on is a truly special story that was a joy to see. Huge props to every single cast member and crew member stateside and in Japan. This one is something else. She kept her promise alright.This film shows such a beautiful depiction of motherhood and parentage that it becomes magical....Not since maybe Wolf Children have I been so taken aback by a films display of this subject. Maquia is such a fantastic mother to Ariel even not being his biological mother. Their journey is such a long stretching one bonkers to think about. But the story on whole is much larger in scale. All the politics and world machinations are fascinating to watch in how they unfold over the course of many decades.Everything this film does is magical. It's such a marvel in its beauty.

In general, there were many chances for the entire film to become your run-of-the-mill, cheap, boring romance movie, but the creators knew exactly what was best for the story, and they were able to stay on track for Maquia to reach its brilliant conclusion.I fell in love with Maquia, as a character, as well as many other members of the cast. The best thing about the time-skips that take place throughout the movie is the fact that we can watch the characters develop and mature in a very smooth and realistic way. I remember crying when they cried, and smiling when they smiled, making them very relatable and easy to see the world through their eyes.Speaking of the world of Maquia, I personally think that it was built very well. It's a well-realised setting with beautiful writing and stunning art. To me, it feels like a world from a fairytale.Overall, I may be very biased, but I truly love this movie. I was hooked long before I even watched it, ever since I saw the trailer for the first time.

This movie will go in my top animes of all time, but it is not without faults.*Warning: spoilers ahead*Like a lot of critics mentioned, I felt the story was overly ambitious for the amount of time the movie has. In particular, I felt the battle between other nations at the climax was rushed and unresolved. The invading nations won, so what is the fate of the support cast? There is also no closure for most of the support casts...who had long pass away by the time Maquia returned back to the village to bid her son, Ariel, farewell.I don't think the story had bad elements per se, but just lacked the extra scenes needed to make the movie whole due to time constraints.But this is nit-picky of me, because the main focus is on the relationship between Maquia and Ariel. Everything else serves to explore their relationship (which I wish we could have more of!).I really think the movie is best enjoyed by people who can really empathize with others. Here, we have a 15-year-old immortal who was ripped away from her home and family, and tossed into a foreign world with nothing but a burnt cloth that serves as memoir of her home. It's absolutely devastating and the only thing that gives her purpose to move on is this orphan she picks up from a raided camp.I'm not a woman, but I could imagine how happy she was to have someone to bond with as family. You get to see how Ariel is attached to his adoptive mom as a child, and how he grows distant in his teens. He doesn't mean to, but he said some mean things that really hurts his mom.The raw emotions of the characters are so real that it really hurts me, and I found myself crying three times throughout the watch.I will never forget what my literature teacher taught me: It doesn't matter whether there's a moral to the story, or if there's a specific message the author is trying to convey. What really matters is how YOU can relate to the story and characters; Losing my dad to cancer was the most traumatizing experience I've ever encountered. So hell-yes, I cherish the bond between family members, but I also know how painful partings are.We are so caught up with everyday life that we take for granted how lucky we are to be among loved ones, and sometimes we regret how we didn't spend enough time with them when it's too late.

This time around it is SayoAsa.As soon as the PV got released, me alongside many others were waiting for the release.Personally i feel that for an Anime or Manga to be considered quality it has to come good in terms of its basic pillars like ART/SOUND/STORY/CHARACTER. So lets go over these one by one.STORY - 8The setting of the story is in medieval age, where humans are living alongside many other races. From here on, we follow the story of our two main...characters Ariel and Maquia, seeing them grow together, connecting disconnecting and exploring each other again, developing a strong bond and making endeavors to overcome hardships was such a heartwarming roller coaster ride.The Strongest point of the story is how realistic the mother-child relation is being portrayed. Mari Okada, the veteran in making people feel emotional, once again took it upon herself to narrate this beautiful bond unlike ever before.We also have a colorful side cast. Each of them playing imperative roles to carry out the story.ART - 9Arguably, the strongest point of the movie is its art. I always thought that making compelling visuals was the forte of only MAKOTO SHINKAI\'S movie but how can one be so wrong.SayoAsa is brimming with Eye-catchy visuals woven with unique character design that made it easy to project the emotions of the characters to the audience, thus complimenting the message being conveyed by the movie.Through and through movies is filled with mesmerizing background and sceneries that can infatuate anyone.SOUND - 9OH BOY!!! OH BOY!!! Kenji Kawai, you did it again. From the well-acclaimed composer of GHOST IN THE SHELL, FATE STAY NIGHT comes another masterpiece. I thought that was the best of his work but OH BOY THE EARGASM!!! In my view, soundtracks in this movie were the MAGNUM OPUS of the Kenji Kawai.Every soundtrack with its impeccable timing leaves a huge emotional impact on the viewer, but not to mention, here we have to give credit to the director whose direction of right soundtrack at the right time made every single scene more impactful.CHARACTER - 7This is probably the weakest area of SAYOASA. The story follows our two main characters and builds further on the relationship between the two. The side cast is also colorful that wrestle with their inner conflicts and emotions that makes them feel like more human and easy to connect.My main gripe in this department is the way some characters were handled and the way how some of them were re-introduced that made it feel like a bit forced.Also, i feel that some of them could have been excluded which would have made it easier to give more screen time to the characters that could have made the experience more wholesome.OVERALL - 8All in all, the movie excels in all the departments and portrays a strong mother-child relationship that will keep you engaging and probably would make you emotional and tearful.Does this movie deserve 10/10 as some people are suggesting? Does this movie deserve low rating if we go by the narrative of the other? I would say ""NO"" to both cases and it is purely subjective. SayoAsa could have been a lot better but the execution of the story down the middle and forced re-introductions of some characters pulled its legs. But that in no sense is taking the credit away from the movie.Thanks for reading. characters Ariel and Maquia, seeing them grow together, connecting disconnecting and exploring each other again, developing a strong bond and making endeavors to overcome hardships was such a heartwarming roller coaster ride.The Strongest point of the story is how realistic the mother-child relation is being portrayed.

Each of them playing imperative roles to carry out the story.ART - 9Arguably, the strongest point of the movie is its art. I always thought that making compelling visuals was the forte of only MAKOTO SHINKAI\'S movie but how can one be so wrong.SayoAsa is brimming with Eye-catchy visuals woven with unique character design that made it easy to project the emotions of the characters to the audience, thus complimenting the message being conveyed by the movie.Through and through movies is filled with mesmerizing background and sceneries that can infatuate anyone.SOUND - 9OH BOY!!! OH BOY!!! Kenji Kawai, you did it again. From the well-acclaimed composer of GHOST IN THE SHELL, FATE STAY NIGHT comes another masterpiece. I thought that was the best of his work but OH BOY THE EARGASM!!! In my view, soundtracks in this movie were the MAGNUM OPUS of the Kenji Kawai.Every soundtrack with its impeccable timing leaves a huge emotional impact on the viewer, but not to mention, here we have to give credit to the director whose direction of right soundtrack at the right time made every single scene more impactful.CHARACTER - 7This is probably the weakest area of SAYOASA. The story follows our two main characters and builds further on the relationship between the two. The side cast is also colorful that wrestle with their inner conflicts and emotions that makes them feel like more human and easy to connect.My main gripe in this department is the way some characters were handled and the way how some of them were re-introduced that made it feel like a bit forced.Also, i feel that some of them could have been excluded which would have made it easier to give more screen time to the characters that could have made the experience more wholesome.OVERALL - 8All in all, the movie excels in all the departments and portrays a strong mother-child relationship that will keep you engaging and probably would make you emotional and tearful.Does this movie deserve 10/10 as some people are suggesting? Does this movie deserve low rating if we go by the narrative of the other? I would say ""NO"" to both cases and it is purely subjective. SayoAsa could have been a lot better but the execution of the story down the middle and forced re-introductions of some characters pulled its legs. But that in no sense is taking the credit away from the movie.Thanks for reading.', ""since i have nothing to do i think i'm going to write a review, its my first time tho so sorry if its a flopi'm aware that this anime has been really hype currently and finally went to watch this with high expectations and somehow ended up blown away. even though the plots leap here and there, it's very certain and still manage to reveal the important point at every events, the characters development is quite good as well especially maquia and ariel, you can tell how much love and care was put into each other. and don't forget the beautifully made artwork, it blessed...my eyes. the lightning, angles, camera, foreshadowing, everything.i've been craving for an angst lately and this movie literally hit me there, i shed too much tears that i sobbed at the end. even though there are certain events that still confused me but it's truly a phenomenal movie that i would highly recommend this to anyone to watch before they die (: my eyes. the lightning, angles, camera, foreshadowing, everything.i've been craving for an angst lately and this movie literally hit me there, i shed too much tears that i sobbed at the end. even though there are certain events that still confused me but it's truly a phenomenal movie that i would highly recommend this to anyone to watch before they die (:"", 'I wanted to like this movie, I really did. The art and music are lovely and the story has so much potential but it continually falls flat of what it clearly wanted to be. It momentarily touches on a lot of deep emotional and philosophical concepts but fails to actually explore a single one of them in a meaningful way.The biggest failing this movie has is that it continually chooses to ""tell"" instead of ""show"". Everything we learn about every character in this movie is because they outright say ""I feel [x]!"" and we\'re expected to just go along with it despite there often being...absolutely nothing to back up the feelings being expressed. After watching the two main two characters for a full two hours I genuinely could not describe their personalities aside from what they\'ve outright said they feel about one another (which is honestly pretty undefined). They are given no real temperament, likes or dislikes, or motivation to do the things they do. The backing characters are even worse - they usually show up only to say something that\'s supposed to be thought-provoking or emotional and then vanish again.For a movie that\'s centered around the concept of the passage of time, the plot is also all over the place. We are given no concrete sense of how much time has passed between scenes and it skips around constantly. The politics of the world/country/etc, for example, are mentioned in broad strokes from time to time but are never elaborated on despite being treated like they\'re an important part of the plot.

This question was well thought through and executed even better.Story: (I gave a 10/10)The story about the unlikely mother and son was followed through to the end. Even if that meant some logical inconsistencies along the way, and a big case of ""convenience"" right before the climax. But to me that were sacrifices I was ready to endure. For the story started to make me wonder, fantasize and but-what-if... right along...watching it and even more so after I had finished it. It posed some riddles, some questionmarks, into my brain which the latter will work on during the next days (though hopefully not at the cost of me slipping from reality...). And if a story achieves that within me, I consider it a good one. SayoAsa did so in an intensity very few stories have done before. Hence, I consider it a ""masterpiece"".Art (I gave a 10/10)The movie didn\'t look like one from 2018, it looked older for the most part. Not much, but older. More handdrawn and less CGI (though I\'m not sure e.g. Leilia\'s flight was done that way). To me that\'s great. Because It did what it was supposed to: it evoked in me the feeling that this is another world far from my own. Yet, one that is inviting and worth exploring.Sound (I gave a 8/10)This is not to say I didn\'t like the sound. To the contrary - I loved the basedrum sound during the battle scenes, and the soft music in the emotional scenes sure worked well to underline the mood. But it is not a soundtrack I would buy and listen to. There are Anime movie soundtrack pieces I regularly listen to while relaxing, but I doubt any one from SayoAsa will get part of my playlist.Charakter (I gave 10/10)Here is where the movie shines. Some voices I heard/read complained about the missing development of the main characters, partly due to the large jumps in story time during the movie. But to me that didn\'t seem the case: Maquia truly developed while Ariel went through the well known crises of young adulthood. The side figures mostly where functions rather than full-fletched characters (apart from Leilia maybe). But that doesn\'t hurt since the characterization of the two MCs was done so well.Enjoyment... Overall... and my judgementHere I should state that, yes, I started writing this like 15 min or so after finishing SayoAsa. And yes, one may say that tomorrow I might give it a 9 or 8 only.

Yes, I can see why people would cry to this movie, but I'd only expect a handful of people to actually be overcome by emotions. Why? I didn't feel sad while watching this movie because most of the emotional interactions felt forced and botched. Not to mention that there is no depth to any of the characters, which makes their actions in the climax seem forced as well. An example is when Ariel comes home drunk and pushes his mom down. Trust me, there was some weird ass...tension between them that almost made me think he had a thing for his mom. Not to mention the scene where Leilia tells Krim she can't go with him because she wants to see her fucking daughter? Then Krim dies like an irrelevant mutt on the side of a road? And when Leilia is given a chance to see her daughter, she books it and runs away happily to the dragon? Leilia's daughter who also wanted to see her mom for years, is somehow so mature that she understands what just happened and accepts it? The way this movie unravels is like a huge maze with lots of dead ends, arriving at the one-way ending that they wanted to force from the very beginning. Overall the animation is great, but you'd have to be super emotional if this movie makes you tear up, as the shitty characters and interactions make the movie feel insincere and ruins many moments. tension between them that almost made me think he had a thing for his mom.

Instead of listing both the good and the bad, I’ll spare you the long read and only write my criticisms.The overall plot was boring to me.

Other than that, it was gorgeous.So, why does this deserve a 10, despite the uninteresting plot? Because that’s not what’s important. The dynamic between Mequia and Ariel is so heartwarming that I felt captivated the entire duration of the movie despite not caring for the plot. The movie genuinely changed my view on life and made me realize the importance of expressing love to my parents.Please. Watch this movie.

While other movies try to capture just bits and pieces of human nature, Maquia captures each and every single goddamn piece of it. After reading other reviews, I understand the critiques that come with it; yes there are coincidences, yes the plot at times is shakier than my bank account at times, and yes, some characters have more screen time, and more of a full arc than others. But hey, that's life, and in the case of Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms, the stories of...the lives it captures is truly a masterpiece beyond anything I've ever seen. The story starts at the beginning of life and calamities of war, has characters that are foils of one another, is a coming-of-age story for so many characters, and has an ending that truly moved me in a way that few others have. This is a movie that's probably better enjoyed alone, a story that gets better the more you think about it, and at the end of the day, I believe is a movie, a piece of art that maybe just maybe make you view life in a little bit of a different light. the lives it captures is truly a masterpiece beyond anything I've ever seen.

The story really gets you emotionally invested in the characters, but only if you really follow them. If you\'re not interested in the characters, the story is kinda lame.I really had some issues with the ""time jumps"". It kinda felt harsh and there\'e not a lot of explanations about how coïncident some encounters were.Maquia is likeable as a kid, but somehow gets cringey as an adult.

Beautiful. the characters flourish.This film is what every show and film weather it be live action or animation should strive to be. Beautiful."", '*MILD SPOILER*""I\'m sorry, Ariel. Mother is gonna break her promise...""Those simple words, when were spoken my Maquia, the heroine, sparked an emotional explosion to me. Because of it, Maquia hands down is one of the most impactful anime that I have ever watched. So many emotions packed in 2 hours of screen time, and it was executed beautifully.Let\'s get straight to the fact that the plot is not always logical, it is full of plot holes and unexplained lore for such an elaborate fantasy world. But does that matter? At least in the case Maquia, it is not. The fantasy setting is nothing but...just a medium to portray the power motherhood, shining like a beacon in such a chaotic and cruel world. The story is fairly simple, it is the time diary of an immortal mom and a human child, and the challenges they face in the midst of political wars and internal conflict when a discrepancy in their life span becomes apparent. If we look at the story from that perspective, it was executed really well. The movie follows the mother and child from the time he just a baby to a teen, and later as an adult. It is not a normal mother and child relationship because of the fantasy twist emphasizing the difference in mortality. The struggles between Ariel and Maquia as well as the consecutive time jumps throughout the characters\' lives are such cool concepts. It makes you feel living throughout a circle of life instead of just a snapshot in the time period. It is grandiose, ambitious, bitter-sweet, and heartbreaking to embark on such a journey. And that ending hits straight into the heart of the viewers. the flashback at the end would not hit home that hard if you only see the character\'s life in a small period. It culminates through time and experience, both old and young. Nearing the end, blending the war images parallel with the birth scene provides such an intense, over-the-edge feeling, and the contrast of death and life provides a strong message and profound impacts on the story. It is a cycle, people are sacrificing to protect the future lives thriving on the homeland. Tragically beautiful!Maquia has a grand cast of characters, but it only focuses on certain 10 or less including both Maquia, Ariel, and supporting characters. The supporting cast has a decent amount of time for their personality to shine and develop, and none of them you will feel as such as an extra and annoying. Each person has his/her own story, background, and regret. And when time keeps moving forward, their lives are inter-weaving each other naturally. Ariel and Maquia, the main characters, were created naturally, Maquia is an inexperienced, shy, and young maiden who works hard to care for a child that not blood-related. Deep down inside she knows falling in love for her is the suffering and watching beloved people walk through her life is a curse. That constant contrast between her fear and her love is surreal and yet heart wrenching. On the other hand, we have Ariel growing with devotion to his mother, then to his inferiority complex to unable protect her, and finally the pain of separation. All of them are handled with high-level detail of care, there is no waste of time for unnecessary drama. The transition is surely fast but never feels unnatural.Music and Art deserve the respect from viewers. PA Animation really outperforms themselves in this with gorgeous animation ranging from the dreamy but yet cold and lonely world of Iorphs to the bustling human city, and finally the lustful green blended with peaceful, nostalgic feeling in the countryside. Characters are given the souls to them with sophisticated animation, diverse facial expressions, and always retain their own traits despite growing up between the time skips. Music is another important component to enhance the viewing experience. There are not a lot of soundtracks but when they hit, they hit really hard. The use of harp, flute, and string instruments portrays perfectly the medieval fantasy world that the story bases on. It is magical, powerful, deep, and reminiscent, like the story itself.A good story overall usually requires a complete sketch of the universe, well execution / original element concept, the fluid transition between scenarios, and the perseverance of setting continuum as well as character\'s progression. While Maquia might fall short on certain factors, it takes the concept very seriously and does it best in the limited timeframe of 2 hours. Coupling with the impeccable visual manifestation is the script that just works and represents Maria Okada\'s talent for her first directorial debut. the characters\' creation and storytelling are pleasantly fresh. The narrative is coherent and tight knight, but for what it counts can also be a stifled mess, and it takes skill to walk on that thin line and convey the story. The inclusion of a high sheer amount of time jumps is well thought and necessary to shift the dynamic between the characters and on a larger scale, the world they live in themselves. It makes Ariel and Maquia are just peas in the pod but simultaneously does not diminish their individual value. The movie did not spoil the reader with straight facts, it treasures hunts with hints and subtle details, and the answers ultimately come from our accumulation of life views through the lens of not only Maquia, Ariel but also the supporting casts. Their lives are reflected through the mother and son and the mother and son are reflected in others\' way of living. There are a lot of things to unpack, and as viewers, if we treat the story seriously and respectfully with high attention, then the confusion would not inflate to be an issue.If we look at the movie with a barebone perspective, it is not a 10/10 perfect story. It is not a masterpiece in terms of plot. It may be way too fast and have too many plotholes to fill in. But nevertheless, it is not a movie that tries to explain wars between species, or a fantasy action-adventure of the heroine. It is the story about the motherhood, and motherhood alone. Mother\'s Love is always underrepresented in the anime setting. And by focusing on this beautiful relationship, viewers share the pain, the smiles, and tears with the characters. Motherhood is the one we can expose without hesitation, without condition that can stand still in the test of time. If it touched your soul spiritually, then Maquia has fulfilled its purpose masterfully. A story about Mother\'s love that transcends the difference of race, species, and mortality.For anime fans, this isn\'t the masterpiece your mind rationalizes, it\'s the one your heart always knew it to be. just a medium to portray the power motherhood, shining like a beacon in such a chaotic and cruel world.

There are a lot of things to unpack, and as viewers, if we treat the story seriously and respectfully with high attention, then the confusion would not inflate to be an issue.If we look at the movie with a barebone perspective, it is not a 10/10 perfect story. It is not a masterpiece in terms of plot. It may be way too fast and have too many plotholes to fill in. But nevertheless, it is not a movie that tries to explain wars between species, or a fantasy action-adventure of the heroine. It is the story about the motherhood, and motherhood alone. Mother\'s Love is always underrepresented in the anime setting. And by focusing on this beautiful relationship, viewers share the pain, the smiles, and tears with the characters. Motherhood is the one we can expose without hesitation, without condition that can stand still in the test of time. If it touched your soul spiritually, then Maquia has fulfilled its purpose masterfully. A story about Mother\'s love that transcends the difference of race, species, and mortality.For anime fans, this isn\'t the masterpiece your mind rationalizes, it\'s the one your heart always knew it to be.', 'Saw this at US theaters, this review contains spoilers.Story 6The story was the weakest part of the entire movie. The set up of the story was going to work out well with the setting but the plot was very slow even with its time skip. The movie gently touched on a few topics that could had made the story so much better, but never went into the cores of the topic. The parts that were more interesting was Maquia rescuing her friend whos in the castle instead of Maquia\'s motherhood. A movie\'s theme which is motherhood was outshine by a different event in the movie....There was good motherhood events that could had made the story of motherhood so much better but it didn\'t go deep enough into the core of the struggle of a single mom who never had a mom. Overall the core message was motherhood but the story didn\'t touch deep enough into the topic. It was lacking the connection. Maquia and Ariel obviously has some sort of strong like connection throughout the timeskips but the connection that was missing was making a connection to us the viewers. The story wasn\'t able to pull me into its fantasy world. The point of a fantasy like genrne is suppose to pull us in into the world. Sayonara no Asa was barely able to do it but wasn\'t able to keep pulling you in to where you felt like you were a part of it.Art and Sound 10/10If it wasn\'t for the art and music the movie would had not stand out at all. It had amazing animation and soft like music to fit the tone of the movie. I can\'t even recall any OST besides the ending song haha.Character 7Supporting characters had a fairly good supporting role in the movie, we introduced to only important sup. characters which we\'ll end up seeing overtime in the movie and not forgetting about them. The biggest problem was Maquia, the MC, she developed so little even throughout the time skip, Her whole purpose was being a mother, yet it felt like she developed so little knowing nothing about what being a mother is. The only way to go while being at the bottom is to go up, but she barely developed as a mother, the story didn\'t provide enough event and struggles for her to overcome and become a better mother to Ariel. Ariel developed pretty well overall. He was pretty much as any other kid. Love the parent and at some point becomes a rebel and comes back to loving his mom/understanding her love.Enjoyment 8Even with such a weak story I still enjoyed the movie overall. I took my mom with me to watch this, she doesn\'t watch any anime at all so I had no idea how she will feel about it and she loved it. She even had a few tears in her eye saying ""it was such a sad story"".Overall 8If only it was given more time to hit some core topics of motherhood better and making them an obstacle for Maquia to overcome and become a better mother it would had turned out so much better. The plot was too slow pace and it felt like there was good time wasted throughout the middle of the movie. It is so sad to see the kid you raise to past away before you did.

Not only did it had an amazing artwork and story, It also had an amazing moral/ viewpoint of being immortal.Overall, I strongly recommend watching this amazing anime movie, not once but more than once.

I realize this happen everywhere, any moment from the past over the world. War killed millions of people, millions of families, millions of couple, millions of child... I can never think of myself killing someone I have never met.Why people hurt each other? or we were born to hurt each other ? What is the purpose of life. I am in pain.

This movie is far too beautiful, to not become emotional when watching it. Please do not hesitate to watch this movie, because it's an experience that you won't ever regret having.*Non-Spoiler Review*Before I begin gushing with praise for this movie, let me get out the few extremely minor issues I had with it. For starters, there were certain parts of the story that moved a bit too slowly for my taste, and there are a few infuriating events that happen within the story. These don't derail...the narrative, but depending on the impact it will have on you, it could either enhance or put you off the story entirely. For the majority of you, it shouldn't be a problem though.The story told is intriguing, as it isn't a format that is often seen in media nowadays, but it uses a setting that we're all mostly familiar with. This could either be seen as a good or bad decision, based on your perspective, but personally I found this to be a good choice. It helps cut out the need for excessive world-building narrations, and lets us discover the world on our own through dialogue between the characters, and certain events that happen within the story. Thus, increasing the amount of time we get to become emotionally attached to the main character, which enhances the story by ten-fold.The narrative took a few interesting turns here and there, but overall it remained consistent to the main theme this movie is trying to get across. Now, while the story may be beautiful, the animation for this movie is able to match, or even surpass its beauty. P.A. Works did a great job with the animation and backgrounds, that just looking at it could make you emotional.The way that characters developed felt natural and real. Their interactions are interesting watch, and they all feel real because they're not perfect in anyway. Each of them gets to continue down their path, and ultimately learn from their experiences. These experiences that aren't always the best, but they're the ones that make you who you are. Who would've thought that the ups and downs of life could all be so beautiful to experience?In summary, this movie is a must-watch for anyone really. You don't have to be an anime fan to appreciate a great narrative with compelling characters and a wholesome conclusion. Which is why I recommend watching this movie to anyone reading this review, and also why I was bold enough to give this a 10/10 rating.A true masterpiece deserves to be called one.Thank you for reading this review! I hope you all have a wonderful day, and don't forget to tell your mother that you love her!

This movie is fine. Its goal was to tell a story of a mother's love for her child, and it did so just fine.However, there is definitely room for improvement. Apart from the relationship between Maquia and Ariel, the whole side story with Leilia just seemed... there. This meant there was less time with Maquia and Ariel. It is especially true in the last third of the movie when the film tries to wrap up many of the character arcs.And...that brings me to Wolf Children. I felt more invested in Hana's love for Ame and Yuki than Maquia's love for Ariel simply because I felt like I spent more time with them. Wolf Children's story just seemed more focused. Apart from motherly love, it also addressed the children's struggle with their identities as both wolf and human.But this film had too many things going on. What did it mean to be a mother? How does it feel to watch everyone else age, but not you? Why should you love your child, even if you didn't intend to have one? There's so many questions and the film tries its best to answer them.Apart from story and characters, the art and music is well done. The film looks absolutely gorgeous and the art does a great job with the world building. The music knows when to be loud for the bombastic moments and soft for its intimate moments.So should you watch this film? Sure, go ahead, it's not a waste of time. Is it a great film? Well, I'll leave that up to you. that brings me to Wolf Children.

Well, I'll leave that up to you."", ""if you still haven't watched it, watch it. oh my god was it emotional. But it was completely earned. It's one of those movies like Koe no Katachi (A silent voice 10/10) or like The Wind Rises by Hayao Miyazaki where you know that you're going to cry going into it. Except it's not sad in a bad way, it made me cry because of the way that you become so enthralled with the world and with the characters that whenever you see them struggling or whenever they're sad, it's amplified to the viewer. I'm not going to lie and say that you won't cry...if you watch this, because you will. but it's emotions that are earned by the movie. I wanted to cry when I was watching it. The characters are so good and it's absolutely beautiful in terms of animation. 10/10 amazing if you watch this, because you will. but it's emotions that are earned by the movie.

The dialogue was pretty horrible and too simplistic. The story had steady progression albeit slow but suddenly became discontinuous towards the end. Some weak phrases were thrown around with a feeble attempt to sound like words of wisdom. The only one that even came close to words of common sense was ""To...love is to be alone"".I could have forgiven all this too if it had a better ending but the story was too weak from the start. The animation was good and the sound was bearable but the story left much to be desired. love is to be alone"".I could have forgiven all this too if it had a better ending but the story was too weak from the start. The animation was good and the sound was bearable but the story left much to be desired.', 'TLDR Review at the bottom. Hopefully, that helped, thank you for reading it in advance.For convenience, I will be referring to Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms with high expectations as Promised Flower BloomsI went into Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms with high expectations, did the film meet those expectations? Well, not really. Did it meet my standards, however? Yes, certainly. To be fair, I didn\'t read any review or synopsis beforehand, I just dived right into the movie hoping for the best. And whilst I can say that the movie is no masterpiece, it is something that I wholeheartedly recommend that you shouldn\'t...skip over.Story - 8:I\'m going to be honest if you have had a decent experience with a movie regarding family relationships, you will see everything coming, the story is predictable and it has nothing new to bring to the table. It is sad really, that most dramas regarding family use the same formula of ups and downs in family, and whilst one could argue that that is probably the most realistic thing in a drama to do with family, it is by no means original.So then you might be asking. What\'s up with the 8/10 for the story score? Well, short answer, the execution. A longer answer is that the execution just changed everything. Even though everything is predictable, Promised Flower Blooms is one of those movies where no matter how much experience you have with drama, you still feel as if this were your first time viewing one of it\'s kind. I could have just said that, yeah, this is your mediocre kind of stories you get every now and then since studios need to make a quick buck. But Promised Flower Blooms isn\'t in that group despite being anything of original quality. It is quite funny, people are quick to shun down average stories just because they are average. But sometimes even those that take upon the average path can still shine through the others that are just like it. So much so that it will be a story you can remember in the years to come.If I had to split the story into sub-categories of elements, then I would give scores to:Plot - 6, Execution - 9: Overall - 7.5 (8)I did try to find some flaw in the execution, but I didn\'t really get anything, everything flows so smoothly and nothing seems cheated or half-assed. To be fair, anything with great visuals like Maquia can actually pull off good execution simply because everything looks so good and realistic to the world it is set in, which is why I didn\'t give execution a 10/10. Other than that, it does a great job of telling its own story.Art/Visuals - 8:Very good visuals all around, though unlike your average Ghibli film or Makoto Shinkai film. The film didn\'t seem to pay attention to the setting/surroundings it had to offer. It kind of gave a simple, yet pleasing character design, and kinda just forgot the setting existed. I\'m not saying that you will get what looks like your mediocre setting for an anime adaption of an isekai/fantasy light novel, in fact, it looks way better than that. It just, wasn\'t as focused as the characters there are some beautiful shots here and there but all around the board, everything is just character detail at the end of the day for the anime.The animation wasn\'t bad. It had more detail than what you usually get in anime around its time of releasing. Nothing more to point out there other than it is a pleasing experience to watch.Sound/Audio - 8:Whilst writing this review I am literally listening over the OST lol. But I can say that since I have done that, everything feels like a variation of ""Iorufu, Wakare no Ichizoku"". Only non-similar audio I could remember where ""Yakusoku no Hana"" and ""Viatoru"". Both of which are great by the way. The varied versions aren\'t bad, but it just becomes a narrow selection of sounds to remember, in which, you have a better chance of remembering the original over the variety anyways, though, I will point out the variety in instruments the varied versions use as well as different pitches are quite nice as a change to the original. ""Iorufu, Wakare no Ichizoku"" on its own is an amazing piece to listen to though. I felt like it does a good job of telling the story of the Iorphs and their lifestyle.The VCs did a good job with the character and presenting their emotion too. Nothing more to focus on that matter, other than a job well done.Character - 8:The characters again, suffer like the story with predictable behaviour and unoriginality. Despite this, the characters feel real in the environment and actions that happen towards them. What I really liked about the characters however is that both Maquia and Ariel are learning. They are both, in the eyes of their respective races still very young people trying to go through life together with one another.Maquia reaches this hits this target more so than Ariel however, she is someone who becomes a mother figure for someone she literally doesn\'t know anything about, did she have to do this? No. No, she didn\'t. But out of the goodness she bore within her, she did so anyway. I wouldn\'t know what most would do in this situation but if I had to guess it would probably be something along the lines of sending a child-like Ariel to an orphanage or something similar. Though she didn\'t do this. She dedicated to go strong and whilst some may say, ""well that was dumb"". You need to remember that at this time Maquia had lost everything to her and had no more Hibiol (the memory paper), she had essentially lost some of her identity then too. The same is with Ariel. He had nothing, hell no one knows his real name too. Nevertheless, Maquia was the best fit for Ariel as a mother figure due to the similarities between the two. They really did come off as a good pair.The side characters don\'t have a lot to offer and to be frank, they don\'t give anything special to the wider picture of the story accept from Leilia who had a deep life I will not go into due to spoilers.All in all, very good characters.Enjoyment - 8:I don\'t really dislike anything I come across and Promised Flower is another one of those examples. Despite its predictableness and unoriginality, as said before, the execution made for a joyous experience and something that was certainly worth my time. As well as the visual beauty that was given.Overall - 8.0 (8)TLDR Review:Story - 8: Unoriginal and predictable story, yet execution made up for all of that, which turned out to be so very good.Art/Visuals - 8: Amazing character design and detailed animation. Though detail cannot be said the same for backgrounds.Sound/Audio - 8: Multiple variations of one particular soundtrack, however, nothing was actually bad rather, they were all well made.Character - 8: Again, unoriginal and predictable, but the pair of Maquia and Ariel was so very good and actually made a load of sense.Enjoyment - 8: Very enjoyable due to but that is just me enjoying everything I come across.How I came across this movie was by chance after the search ""Makoto Shinkai"" on YouTube then coming across on what is literally titled ""Makoto Shinkai is JEALOUS OF THIS ANIME FILM"". I am really glad that I got to take on this anime because it is a wonderful experience one can take themselves upon. Would I recommend this? Certainly. Though, if you are into originality and non-predictable behaviour then I don\'t recommend you watch this. However, due to the great audiovisuals, the movie has to offer, you probably should take the chance to watch it anyways regardless of where you are on the scale of watching unoriginal stories. skip over.Story - 8:I\'m going to be honest if you have had a decent experience with a movie regarding family relationships, you will see everything coming, the story is predictable and it has nothing new to bring to the table.

Meaning it only has so much time to finish up the story in a satisfying way. I believe it accomplished this but at the cost of the run time. I don't really have a problem with movies, it just makes me wish that we could know more. A good example of a movie done right is A Silent voice. I won't explain any further since this is my review of a different anime.  If this whole movie was adapted into a couple of seasons then I...would've broke. If all of the characters backstories were introduced and it slowly took it's time then my eyes wouldn't of lasted.Story -I'm disappointed of how much info we got regrading this. I've said previously that it's a movie so we get what we get. There is so much that I would of loved to learn, about their origin, and more about the red eye disease. I know it was hinted at being about their emotions being bottled up but it could of gone more in depth. There is so much about this world that we don't know. So there are dragons but what else, monsters? Magic? well we don't really know. Would've been awesome to get more world building.Art -Holy shit was it beautiful I want to give it a ten but at some points the CGI distracts from the overall experience. All the landscapes and animations were so fucking good. This is a strength of being a movie, since you're able to take your time and not have to worry about a hard deadline to meet.Sound -The Ost was soothing and felt really good to listen to. Especially the credits really hit home, the music here was used correctly but we didn't have enough information.Characters -This is where my main criticism comes in. The audience didn't see much about anyone, even on the island where the start takes place, we are just placed there, not really knowing anyone and why should we care in the first place. If there is a character whom I don't really know his story or his emotions then I just don't give a shit. Kinda like Krim. Hopefully I spelled it right. The anime can take it's time for character development and that should of been how this was made.9/10Make an anime out of it would've broke. If all of the characters backstories were introduced and it slowly took it's time then my eyes wouldn't of lasted.Story -I'm disappointed of how much info we got regrading this. I've said previously that it's a movie so we get what we get. There is so much that I would of loved to learn, about their origin, and more about the red eye disease. I know it was hinted at being about their emotions being bottled up but it could of gone more in depth. There is so much about this world that we don't know. So there are dragons but what else, monsters? Magic? well we don't really know. Would've been awesome to get more world building.Art -Holy shit was it beautiful I want to give it a ten but at some points the CGI distracts from the overall experience. All the landscapes and animations were so fucking good. This is a strength of being a movie, since you're able to take your time and not have to worry about a hard deadline to meet.Sound -The Ost was soothing and felt really good to listen to. Especially the credits really hit home, the music here was used correctly but we didn't have enough information.Characters -This is where my main criticism comes in. The audience didn't see much about anyone, even on the island where the start takes place, we are just placed there, not really knowing anyone and why should we care in the first place. If there is a character whom I don't really know his story or his emotions then I just don't give a shit. Kinda like Krim. Hopefully I spelled it right.

When we stumbled about this movie. It had decent reviews and ranked quite high on MAL so we decided, why not, and gave it a watch. few seconds in and we were already in awe of the art. we got excited. Then as the first character stumbled on my screen I saw they had no nose and thought huh that weird.

With a charm that achieves the drama to deliver the sadness, it is genuine that this is not a lazy work to handle such a masterful writing of melodrama. It never abandons the theme itself to the point that watching them (him) grow up is exactly a systematic irony towards the reality itself. It never abandons the grasp of connection and contrast between two main characters, Maquia and Ariel, who builds their wholesomeness into a simple yet significant empathy to hold such a meaning with the tears shedding from our eyes.First...of all, I really love the entire ambiance throughout this film to exhibit the beauty of light and Ionian wonders before our eyes. The prologue creates a good job to introduce the brief origin of how Maquia has provided her ideal and behavior to the point that we can understand that she has been curious around how the practice has been dealt with her to grasp the felicity. We can see the peace that pulls up its breathtaking start to realize what will come up next. Then, in the next time, there is a threat that deals Ionian to offer the prosperity of biological greatness that the royal blood will acknowledge Ionian ethnicity due to its lengthy life expectancy. In which, the threat makes Maquia walk off from her home as she seeks an escape to her own peace. While escaping, she finds infant Ariel crying while being held by his deceased biological mother. Ignoring the baby to leave himself in hunger is inexcusable for Maquia to leave him alone, so she instead carries and cares him to ensure his life not to be wasted by his actual mother's sacrifice. Thus, the motherly theme has begun.Such admiration to see them growing and building each other up is chaste to recognize their familial love in a large extent of contentment. As such playing and educating together is a rightful thing that can suffice the charm with heartwarming aura. A slice-of-life which can deliver their daily lifestyle into something that will prepare to trigger their gradual struggles is a total gaiety to enrich their relationship up until Ariel realizes his maturity doesn't offer him to give back everything that is worthy for his mother, Maquia. Honestly, that is such a fallacious belief for Ariel to give back everything towards his mother because it's like you're giving back the present from Maquia towards Maquia herself. That's not how Christmas gift works. She just wants to nourish him and his love to the fullest, and yet Ariel acts arrogantly with excessive idea of minimalism. That being said, giving her back will result to discontentment between each other because she knows it's not enough for him to offer since their life expectancy is far different to await.On the other hand, the side characters have their own struggle to liven themselves up due to the corruption that the royal blood is trying to pursue for. Honestly, they're not significant to follow the main storyline of this film, and yet this bonus thing is a plus points to consider that the worldbuilding is transverse from its narrative limit. We get to explore more what's going on which leads Maquia and Ariel to be apart for their own agenda. It's like the son is going to his first work while the mother is heading towards her origin to reflect what and how she had been going through, realizing that they forget to bid their farewell properly in a sense that it clouded them to die for.The art itself is perfectly fantastic that the background and structure really affects the world to be alive for excellent immersion. The designs are well-fitted throughout the ambiance, and the fluidity is masterfully present with perfect camera angle and saturation. Thus, I consider it to be exceptional in this case.The sound is indescribable. It's like when you listen to Celtic flute music, it feels like you're going to relax while watching this film for the better effect. Your ears will going to pierce your mind like an acupuncture, and your eyes will feel like you're in that world to perceive the understanding of what's going on and touch the texture of its medieval, light-hearted ambiance.Overall, my enjoyment is soothingly indescribable. The tears I have with this film really strike me to value the love for my family until I'm going far away from them. Loneliness is the only thing you can think of, and it is harshly beautiful in a way that there is no way to return back what has been offered ever since. The story is simple yet mixed with emotional seasoning to it. It is to the point that there's no more words to say about this. This film is self-explanatory to describe the feeling of solitude. The consequences they had have already fulfilled to realize it is indeed worth an ending. Thus, I highly recommend this series with a cozy touch.

For almost as long as I\'ve lived, I\'ve been in a weird relationship with my mother. Not a relationship where we downright hate each other but there certainly is bad blood there that is pretty far gone as far as family goes. I\'ve spent forever searching for something to show me why everyone who engaged in loving relationships with their mothers say ""you should talk to her more"" or ""but she\'s your mother!"" Like yeah, I know, but what does that really mean? Being a mother, all that nonsense.That\'s the same question...that is posed to a young Maquia when she is separated from her village of Iorphs, a race that harbors individuals that can live for much much longer than the normal person. A dragon sweeps her up and she is inadvertently sent to a forest. As she is kind of wandering around in her new environment, she finds the dead body of a mother who seems to still be hugging her supposed child. And I don\'t exactly know what compels her to pick up the child, either be it the director had to do it to progress the film or maybe it came as a shock to her that someone would be willing to go so far for anyone. Her sentimentality on love is, ""If I ever love anyone, I will truly be alone"" as explained to her by Racine, the village elder. I imagine this sight is not just one to behold but one that holds deep significance to her. She realizes that he is not truly alone as his bond with his mother, even if he had never seen her was still much greater than having nothing. And so she grabs the baby from outside of the mother\'s grasp, one that was still firm and adopts it.And just in that moment alone, I applied it to my life back in better times. Times that I can say I unconditionally loved my mother and she did so for me as well. Would she, in some type of catastrophic event have sacrificed herself for me? Would her protective grip be so strong, that she is able to hold on to me and comfort me even from beyond the grave?When she brings the child outside and smells him, he smells like the sun. Beautiful.And sure, you can say this scene is a bit overblown in terms of emotion especially when that somber soundtrack comes on, but I think its meaning far outweighs that. For now, anyway.Her name-choosing process was quite adorable. Her eyes darting around the room, at first choosing a female name to honor her lost fried before blurting out Ariel and staring at the floor like a nervous wreck. It\'s a fun, lighthearted moment, but this is the moment when the child really becomes hers. His identity is set now.She goes on a small walk around town with Mido before coming to a stop where Mido explains a mother\'s life is hectic. After being hit with a, ""I don\'t know"" from Maquia, she jokingly slaps her stomach. When Maquia laughs, Ariel follows suit. These fun, energetic, and bright scenes really help the narrative develop as we see how Maquia becomes more of a mother, how Ariel begins as such a loving baby, it humanizes this ""mother"" role that we\'ve all come to misunderstand. Our moms are people just like us. The film then shows us another symbolic showing of Maquia dyeing her hair to fit Ariel\'s, distancing herself from her heritage and in a way, leaving that life of pain, of misery, and of isolation, a theme that comes to be developed.Which is really one of Maquia\'s strong suits. It develops every idea it starts, every theme, every narrative is woven together through progression of the plot.More light heartedness ensues after the first time skip which is understandable if you want to show someone\'s whole life in the span of 2 hours, but they do start to get a bit much later on into the movie.And it\'s when Ariel\'s friends tell him that liking your mother is weird is when we see the first instance on valuable social commentary. This is definitely not a thing limited to fiction as children in real life are ridiculed by their peers for loving their moms all the time, especially little children who don\'t know any better. And when Maquia meets an existential crisis as she comes to realize everyone will die much quicker than her, she truly understands what the elder meant by her words. The irrationality of this scene is what really sells it because almost everyone understands that others die, it\'s just a fact that we don\'t really account for. Lang goes on a charade about how mothers don\'t cry, which may be just a tiny drop of chauvinistic and completely irrelevant to the narrative they\'re trying to sell and quite frankly might have only been introduced to make the final scene that they did.When you hit the festival, the first thing you notice are the vivid colors flying across the screen as the citizens are dressed in different types of the colors, the banners up are characterized by a royal blue, and the venues offer a wide array of hues for you to feast your eyes on. But if this is the first time you notice the breathtaking audiovisuals, I hope you look back because almost every scene is brought to life with lively animation befitting of the moment. The high definition water, unique art style, wonderfully apricot skies, the velvet trailing of the Renato as Maquia is soaring through the illuminated night, every detail is left observed and there is no speck that doesn\'t amaze me in the art department. Tranquil plucked strings for the calm scenes as opposed to grandiose choirs for the climactic ones, who can\'t love that?My least favorite moments of this picture are when the themes of motherly love go overboard. Leilia not wanting to leave because of her child, Leilia only wanting to see her child (despite it being unwanted in the first place and her freedom being taken for it), and an assortment of other melodramatic ""but my kid!"" scenes make the narrative quickly go from heartfelt to cinematic tool for drama.As Ariel grows up, he goes from wanting to protect his mother to...wanting to protect his mother. But this never feels static because his outward personality wanes from warm and loving to cold. His overall personality changes, of course, but it\'s important to the narrative that he remains wanting to protect his mother. He just realizes he\'s too weak and undeserving of someone who treats him so carefully.And when I heard the line, ""Why does that person treat me so carefully?"", I couldn\'t stop the emotion crawling up my throat. It\'s such a relatable emotion. such a genuine piece of dialogue, such a beautifully understanding moment.Maquia really understand both sides of adolescence. Both from the parent\'s perspective and the child\'s. But it\'s this superb understanding coupled with powerful intertwined themes such as finding happiness in separation that really catapults this picture in quality.Beautiful artwork, beautiful morale, but sometimes the otherwise genuine and vehement themes are blown out of proportion into something else entirely. The pacing is, honestly fine but those time skips don\'t do it any favors.I\'m feeling a strong 8 to a light 9 on Maquia. that is posed to a young Maquia when she is separated from her village of Iorphs, a race that harbors individuals that can live for much much longer than the normal person.

The stroy about how Maquia gets seperated from her race and founds her hibiol in a human baby is so sensual. There is just so much to say about the story that greaty moves my emotions.The movie consists despair, love, fantasy, action and drama. The artwork was just outstanding and most of all, the feelings of characters in the movie seemed real as if no excessive or weird drama was there.The theme that Maquia (a stranded 15 year old Lorphian orphan) raised...Ariel from his birth and also got to bear witness his last breath and all the despair and love they both went through is just nastolgic.I am more of a thriller than a feeler but this movie clearly is neck n neck with Koe No Katachi and Kimi No Na Wa (my fav).

There are instances that you can’t understand what's going on because of the time skips; this time skips are gaps which your life will fill into it. You will either relate, hate or be envious of the maternal love shown as you watch this masterpiece.At first, I was expecting a child who truly loves their mother even when they grow up because of the fiction plot, but as the movie progresses it...will show the harsh reality of what a son/daughter becomes as they age; forgetting the heartwarming promises they have made to their parents and lost sight to the path they wanted to take on the past, only to realize their mistake in end.Story: 10/10The setting of the story is very beautiful, as expected for a fantasy type. All of the elements have been done very well, the only thing off is the climax; I can imagine something like “The son will risk his life just to save his mother” for the climax, but that thought was shattered halfway throughout the movie and was offered with a more realistic approach instead.Art: 10/10In the first few minutes I was already amazed, the art is gorgeous, scenery is fantastic and well drawn. There are times where you will see CGI but it’s bearable.Sound: 10/10The music is magical and fitting to the theme, it enhances the way you feel throughout the movie, it could be heartwarming or even heart-wrenching depending on the way you want to hear it.Character: 9/10The characters here are realistic, they are genuine and have what us real humans possess. I am rather disappointed by Ariel but that’s what also makes him a real person.Enjoyment: 10/10For a son that loved his mother when he was a kid, I cried many times watching this. I regret and realize that the past me was very pure and innocent compared to myself now (I’m currently 16 of age). Just like what I said in my first paragraph, you’ll like this movie more if you relate to it, otherwise this will just be an average drama movie for you have not or yet experienced the life within; to understand the true intention why this movie was created. I enjoyed it a lot and will recommend this for those who have similar experiences to me; I will watch this again with my mother on her birthday.Overall 10/10The theme is about maternal love and focuses on this throughout the very end, there are also sub themes which are loneliness and the pain of separation. It was indeed a rollercoaster of emotions. The 2 hours I spent on this was worth it.I apologize for my one-sided and personal review.

But Mari Okada, director and writer of Maquia, decided to take the cliché to a more personal love course. A motherly love Being a film mostly focused on the perspective of the protagonist Maquia, where we can see what it is for her to be a mother. A film that could bring a tsunami of memories to many people who had a similar experience to the protagonists or bring...a feeling of disappointment. Being a film of almost 2 hours, the film had enough time to make the protagonists feel human and understandable, along with a cast of secondary characters mostly not relevant to the story but pleasant to see them, only for few of them.Introducing the protagonist, Maquia, a character who has changed a lot due to the events in the movie. Starting with a protagonist creating a cloth named: Hibiol, which can transmit stories, experiences, and emotions in it, to a protagonist leaving her homeland, she was a person limited and molded by fear and loneliness to a Maquia who had to force herself to be an example to others. From its beginnings in the world of humans until the last visit of his son. As the story focuses on the theme of the mother, it seems that Maquia\'s changes were going towards that route.She is a girl who suffered a tragic event at an early age, during the shock, found and picked up a homeless baby to see that the child was in his similar situation; she living with the thought that her people were in the process of extinction and the baby who did not have the opportunity to have a memory with her parents. As Maquia was still young, she had no experience in knowing how to care for a baby, although she already had the attitude of knowing it like, being protective, affectionate, and grateful to the baby.After considering the baby as her and before naming Ariel to the baby, because of the age of Maquia, it made Mido doubt about the custody of the baby. Mido is a single mother that the young girl found during her first steps out of her bubble. The mother doubtful of the skills of Maquia, extended her hands towards the direction of the baby as if she were telling her that she knows better taking care of the little Ariel than the young mother. Maquia, with a quick reaction, rejected Mido\'s proposal for the love she had established with the child and also for being an unknown for, obviously, not yet having the confidence to leave the baby in her hands.When Ariel was already a child who no longer needed some basic cares (feeding or bathing), Maquia was going through a stage of desperation to choose whether or not to take Ariel on her journey to see Leilia, being aware of the difficulties of being in an unknown place and having a child in her care. In the end, she did decided to go with the child. During the trip, Maquia was involved in a plan to rescue Leilia, which ended badly, when she met up with Krim by coincidence. After failing the plan, she could not return with Mido possibly due to lack of money, she had no choice but to go to different places to get a temporary job and a temporary house since Maquia was an unusual person. And yet, Maquia was still a loving and worried person towards Ariel, but with the plus of having a stronger mentality learned from Mido, regardless of the things he did during his teenage years.While Maquia remained the same, his son had already become an adult and with a family, he was already aware of the things he has done to her in the past and wanted an apology for his mistakes. Maquia, with a quick nod, did not forgive him but thanked him. “When I am with you, all the sad and painful things ... they all subside.” Her love for Ariel was so strong that she was able to smile in the face of fear and destiny, freeing her and being able to fly freely, because since she considered Ariel as her son, her Hibiol, she stopped feeling alone because she could record the feelings she had with her son in her memory. Amiability. Force. Despair. The feeling of loving someone. Ariel is his main source of happiness, resembling sun and earth, being the main source of life and energy. Remembering Maquia\'s phrase: ""Smells like the sun."" Referring that he is her world because the only thing that Maquia can think about is her son.Ariel is a main character that we had the opportunity to see his beginnings until his end. During the movie, he is the character with the most attitude changes in the entire cast of characters throughout the film. In his childhood, we saw that he was an innocent, curious, and energetic boy. During his teens he was a spoiled and impotent boy who acts without thinking. Already when he was an adult, he was more mature and regretted the things he has done in his past. And as an old man, in his last moments, he showed his mother an expression of having no remorse. Establishing Ariel as a realistic character, but also unnatural because of the use of time-skips.Being a fantasy world with a protagonist who have the promise to protect his mother, the base of the story can be compared to the highly acclaimed: The Hero\'s Journey. A structure initially designed for adventure stories such as the classic ""Star Wars"", ""Indiana Jones"", or ""Harry Potter"" movies. But this time, with a touch of slice of life in it. The cycle has different steps on it:• The call to adventure - leaving the country, when Maquia decided to take Ariel with her on her trip to Leilia.• Supernatural aid - the desire to want to protect his mother, whose desire was implanted by Krim by asking only 2 questions: “Can you protect them? The things that you treasure the most? ”After they failed the rescue plan.• Threshold (the beginning of a transformation) - During the film they did not show the beginning of their change but what it was transformed into. Ariel become a more isolated son with his mother, who acts like a spoiled boy for feeling helpless and also acting before thinking. Why impotent? Since Ariel made the promise to his mother, all he could do was watch at her while the others had the freedom to interact with her. For example, after the second time-skip, we could see Maquia as a waitress in a restaurant where there are usually workers in a weapon factory, just when the movie introduced Ariel as a teenager, there was a scene where one of those workers touched her Maquia’s butt. And what did Ariel do? Nothing. He just sat and looked the other way, while listening his coworkers talked about rumors about his mother, for not feeling confident enough in his physical strength, in how to be a man.• Challenges and temptations - his impotence can count as a challenge, while temptation would be the time when his coworkers persuaded Ariel to consume alcohol with the excuse that it will make him a man to drink it, something he wants to be.• Abyss (death and rebirth) - it is not necessary to be literally a death, it can also be something that could negatively affect the character. In this case it would be to get home drunk and tell his mother that he does not consider Maquia as his mother, causing a collapse of the emotional state of Maquia and more isolation for Ariel. The rebirth would be the desperation of wanting to be a knight to be a true man who can protect his mother.• Transformation - it’s after the timeskip, when Ariel became a knight along with a wife in the final stage of pregnancy, during the adult phase of the child who ceased to be.• Atonement - when Ariel meets again with her mother for the penultimate time, after they lost the battle against another kingdoms, he apologized for the things he has done to her mother in the past to purge of his sins and not feel guilty for the rest of his life.• Return - it is when Ariel returning to Mido\'s house and starting a new life.The secondary characters. Although most of them only appeared very rarely, a few of them could have stayed in the minds of several people. Mido is a good example of it, she is the other perspective of being a mother. Being a certainly relevant character when Ariel was a baby until when he was a kid, becoming a figure of an older sister to Maquia and being the one who has taught her how to be a mother, which is to maintain a strong mentality so that in the future they can teach it to their children how to have a strong mentality in difficult times.Mother to son, the next one is Lang. He is a character who tried to be something for Maquia, but it was impossible because of her fear of losing someone. Lang could not be someone close, but yes as an emotional support for Maquia. Since when she couldn\'t stand the dog\'s death, Lang was with her, even being with her when an entire kingdom was looking for a Lorph.Izor, being a character who is blamed for murdering legends, he had no choice but to be loyal to his king and fulfill his orders. There were a scene, when the King ordered to find another Lorph for his son and all he could do was tilt his head down with an expression of guilt on his face, he felt so guilty that he even asked Leilia to punish her. He had the potential to further develop to a much better character, but during the other second half of the film, he sadly stopped being important to the film.Leilia, a character who seemed to be a close friend to Maquia, she had a curious parallel with the protagonist. Both of them had a baby, Maquia a boy, Leilia a girl, Maquia was able to take care of the baby for herself, Leilia no, Maquia is free, Leilia no, Maquia has friends to lean on, Leilia does not. Having so many parallels, we as the audience, Leilia’s story that was missing could possibly be completed based on her other parallel, Maquia. Now we can expect what Leilia have experimented throughout her life prisoned by just filling the gap and credited ourselves for it, and not the movie.The use of time-skip in the movie is not random, each timeskip shows a different stage of Ariel and the progression of Maquia\'s relationship with her son. Although it only shows the minimum, limiting too much in just the essentials in each phase and not a more complete relationship, that may caused a disappointment to some of the audience for the expectation they had. The first time-skip showed Ariel\'s childhood, having a funny and funny relationship. While in the second time-skip demonstrated Ariel\'s most rebellious stage and a more isolated and toxic relationship. Then the third timeskip of the son already as an adult, having a healthier relationship. And the last time-skip, in his last moments without any regret of having had Maquia as his mother.It would have been better if it were a serie, instead of a movie, because that way it could have developed and shown more of the relationship of Maquia and Ariel as mother and son, forming a more complex connection that is not only: he is your son and she is your mother. Explore some elements that have not yet been squeezed enough. Examples would be, Ariel having to deal with his coworkers for pretending about his mother being his sister. It would have been more interesting to show more how Ariel\'s co-workers can doubt about his relationship with his mother for being aware that him and his mother are not blood related. Also, show more of the difficulties that Maquia had to face as a mother during the different phases of the film. Thus creating a stronger and more credible connection between mother and son.The use of time-skip was not bad because it was useful to advance the previous stage to the next stages, but it was also not good to use so many time-skips in such a short time, giving the audience the feeling that the film felt rushed. The events had to be compressed enough to fit in an animation of almost 2 hours, leaving with several plot holes of different sizes in the story:• How did the knights knew the location of the Lorph?• Why did the King order to capture only 1 Lorph and slaughtered the rest? It would have been more beneficial if the king had left the others captive.• How is it that Krim and others Lorph survived the massacre?• Why did they keep Leilia captive in a room that has a window in it? It would have been much better if they left her locked in a windowless room so that Krim and the others had a more difficult time to develop another rescue plan. Something that happened in the movie, but failed.• Why couldn\'t Leilia\'s daughter inherit her mother\'s longevity?• Who is Barow? How could he know where Maquia and Leilia were during the rescue plan? He had connections with Leilia?• What did Maquia do to convince the dragon to fly again at the end of the movie?Maquia is a film that is easy to be overrated because of how simple the audience can empathize with the protagonist and forget the rest, seeing how everything that Maquia and Ariel have experienced different emotions during the story can instantly give a “that happened the same thing with me ”, perhaps causing a blur in the other perfections and flaws that has in the film and wanting to see more of “that happened the same with me”. The film having an excellent animation, with a good change of maturity on the part of the protagonists, along with an unbalanced but with purpose of the use of time-skip, made it quite enjoyable and direct, although leaving arguments without being answered that makes the movie drives further from perfection. a feeling of disappointment.

It was a film about parenthood, the passage of time, and ultimately, love. Let's get into why I think this movie has enchanted so many people-- and also why it didn't exactly do the trick for me.First of all, there's absolutely no need for improvement in the art and sound departments. Musically, this film exceeded my expectations. I didn't notice it all of the time, but where it mattered (such as emotional scenes, dramatic scenes, etc.), it blew me away. On to the...art, nearly everything was exceptional. Personally, the character designs weren't something I loved, which would probably be my only gripe about it. The buildings, the coloring, the landscapes-- they were all done so well, so it wasn't difficult to become immersed in the world itself.I think one of the bigger gaps that I found in this film that made it less remarkable to me came with the story and the characters. I do think it was built up quite well to a satisfying ending, but a lot of the in-between got lost for me. It wasn't that the characters weren't compelling, and they each had such interesting and painful pasts, but the merits I found within the characters are more attributed to the *idea* of what their characters were rather than what they actually presented as on screen.The story did accumulate very well by the end, as I mentioned, so it all worked together as a whole at the end of the day. That being said, there were instances where I felt the plot was giving us information we didn't need or that certain details weren't explained well enough or that character relationships weren't explored properly. Calling back to the beginning of this review, I did love the fact that this story was about... well, love. The events that happened showed how powerful it can be, for better or for worse. It showed how love can act as camouflage or be as flamboyant as possible. Because the story was imbued with those things, it made it heartwarming to watch, but as far as the specific makeup of the plot, it wasn't the best.I do feel like maybe this film just wasn't for me, and that's okay. I know many people adore this film, and I can see where they would form that opinion; it just isn't something I was crazy about myself. To each their own. art, nearly everything was exceptional.

I tend to judge films with a hyper-stereotypically anime visual style harshly right off the bat, but I knew that it was Mari Okada\'s directorial debut, and so I was extremely interested in it.The film has a somewhat meandering beginning, but the plot only grows in strength and emotional weight as it continues, which is an amazing feat for a nearly two-hour film. The intensity and importance of the connections between the various characters only really hits you towards the end of the...second act, and then you\'re hit with a wall of emotions that sneaks up on you suddenly.This is a really beautifully told story about the relationship between mother and child that will have you wanting to call your mom immediately after.

I highly recommend it.', ""This is by far one of my favourite anime movies. It made me feel all type of emotions from excitement, fear, sadness, happiness etc. I watched the movie knowing nothing except for the trailer, which didn't have eng sub. I highly recommend going into it not knowing anything, it makes the movie more unpredictable and way more enjoyable.By the end of the movie i was a wreck, sobbing my eyes out while listening to the ending song killed me. I'm not gonna lie i cried for an extra 30 minutes after watching just thinking about the characters. The story is absolutely painfully beautiful let alone...the characters and the growth of the main character. This was one of those movies where it made me think about the topic after the movie while crying obviously. I definitely wouldn't re watch this unless i want to make myself cry, also it was one of those anime that made me unable to watch anything until i got over how heartbroken i was about this one. the characters and the growth of the main character.

Sadly I can’t agree with those viewers. I didn’t cry during this movie nor did I think that this was a good movie. The story was sub-par due to the time skips, the characters where flat, the music went unnoticed, the character art is fine but the environment art is good, and I kinda enjoyed the show. Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms, or Sayonara no Asa ni Yakusoku no Hana wo Kazarou, was sold to me as a gut-punch of an anime...movie, but sadly it simply didn’t deliver. 5/10.*Spoilers beyond this point*The story is very disappointing. The prospect of a girl meets a boy who will die sooner could work. It actually has worked in Plastic Memories and I Want To Eat Your Pancreas, all be it with the genders flipped. So, what makes this story so disappointing? Well, it is the time skips that make vertical cuts into the main characters’ lives. In theory, this makes sense, but in practice, it gives the characters little depth and it makes the viewer have to “learn” a new character.On the subject of characters, most of them are unlikeable, irritating, or bland. With no motivations, no depth, and/or no development, it really makes the characters boring to watch. One of the characters I did like was Izol. Not because of his development or depth, but how the viewer sees him climb up the ladder in their version of the military. I also liked the farm owner Mido. She was smart and caring, loving but firm, and this made for a great character.There is very little to say about the music and the animation so, I will lump them in together. The animation is good. I got some good screenshots of landscapes and towns, but the characters look kinda bad. They are animated to look like they are melting into themselves. For example, most people have no chin an/or no nose. The final point about the animation is that the Iorphs all have the same body type and hair type. This makes them all fold into one another and they don’t stand out. Speaking of not standing out, the music is fine. It doesn’t have any memorable tracks, and I also didn’t remember it being used at all. It’s almost like it wasn’t even there at all.In the end, I didn’t enjoy this movie. Maybe I have become a jaded and cynical adult, or maybe I have something wrong with me. But whatever the reason may be, I found this movie bland and uninteresting. The story is a 4, art is a 6, the characters are a 5, the sound is also a 5, and enjoyment is another 5, coming out to a 5 overall. movie, but sadly it simply didn’t deliver. 5/10.*Spoilers beyond this point*The story is very disappointing.

It doesn’t have any memorable tracks, and I also didn’t remember it being used at all. It’s almost like it wasn’t even there at all.In the end, I didn’t enjoy this movie. Maybe I have become a jaded and cynical adult, or maybe I have something wrong with me. But whatever the reason may be, I found this movie bland and uninteresting. The story is a 4, art is a 6, the characters are a 5, the sound is also a 5, and enjoyment is another 5, coming out to a 5 overall.', '-Story: The concept of races of different lifespans mingling is by no means original. However, I appreciate that this movie explored all of the different nuances of how a relationship between members of different races in a platonic manner. In my experience, similar stories generally focus on the difficulties of having a romantic relationship in such a situation. I do like romance stories, but romance is often used as a prop to get the viewers to make a quick and easy emotional connection with the characters. To be able to lead the viewers into making that kind of emotional connection without relying on romance takes...a lot more effort, but the payoff is that it leaves the viewer with a deeper, more well-rounded appreciation for the characters.The pacing of the story was inconsistent, slow at some times but jumping ahead by years or decades at other times. That being said, that kind of pacing was necessary in order to allow the story to cover the scope of a human lifespan. It was an adjustment, but it didn\'t bother me. If you don\'t like that kind of timeline, you may not like this movie.The end of the movie was a little anti-climactic and open-ended. I am not a huge fan of that kind of ending, but I can see why the writers left it that way. The whole point of the story is how humans are born, live, and die while the people of Maquia\'s race stay more or less the same, so it makes sense that an ""end to the story"" on the human side of the relationship would not equate to the same thing for Maquia.-Art: Nicely done, consistent quailty. Good background details.-Sound: Better than average. I definitely felt that the soundtrack added to the atmosphere of the movie. I liked the song at the end credits as well.-Characters: The two main characters, Maquia and Ariel, were well-rounded and interesting, particularly their relationship. What I felt was one of the weakest parts of the movie, though, was the secondary characters. Most of the secondary characters where develop with only shallow details, without much, if any, growth. They were mostly just props for the two main characters to interact with and move the story along.

Yet, the lack of storytelling or focus on anything left me feeling empty with no understanding of why I was even watching this. It just didn't have anything worth rewatching, the plot points were nothing special...but also not explained properly. There was a severe lack of narrative and direction that I simply didn't like.[Art & Sound]> I had no issues with the art or the sound, maybe the character design could have been improved but it was an interesting style.[Characters]> They weren't bad but I didn't connect with any of them really so it was hard to root for them.[Enjoyment]> As you can tell, I didn't enjoy it but it wasn't terrible. It just didn't provoke much emotion or interest in me after a while. I feel like if they halved the time, it would've been better.[Overall]> Wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to someone else.

By now I've must have watched well over a hundred different shows and movies, with some 10/10's along the way: Stein's Gate, Tatami Galaxy, Lain, Your Name, etc. Thing is, I never bothered to rate them because they were already popular, so what's the point in tossing a review on a pile of thousands?It is 2 am and I am submitting my first ever review.Maquia was a movie I heard about on an...obscure anime channel on youtube that I found mindlessly scrolling that recommended a bunch of equally obscure movies and shows I never heard before and claimed they were amazing. Well to me it just sounded like a contrarian or something. Yes I admit I was an asshole and judgemental for this attitude.Well over a year later, I gave it a shot on Thanksgiving day after coming home from family dinner late at night. I was tired but not enough to fall asleep, so I put on a movie to watch. I chose Maquia because I figured it wouldn't be good enough for me to finish and I'd probably fall asleep 30 minutes into it. Truth is I just wanted to get it off my list.Boy, I was so, so wrong. My expectations have never been surpassed as much as with Maquia. This movie is one of the best animated films I have ever watched, up there with Studio Gihbli's best works. Not only that, it is one of the best films I have ever watched, period. The animation and art is drop-dead gorgeous. Not a single frame was placed without love and passion from the animators. The soundtrack and voice acting were straight out of a Triple AAA studio. The direction and script is phenomenal. And of course, the plot is one hell of a tearjerker.I am absolutely shocked at how underrated this movie is. It only earned ~$1 million at the box office. Even without details on the cost of production, it was without a doubt a financial disaster. Princess Mononoke in comparison grossed ~$100 million in Japan alone. And yes, I am comparing the two because Maquia is genuinely THAT GOOD.For the love of God, watch this film now. Don't make the mistake I did. This film deserves far more attention, and I guarantee you that by the time you finish watching it you will be rushing to hug your mama with tears running down your face. obscure anime channel on youtube that I found mindlessly scrolling that recommended a bunch of equally obscure movies and shows I never heard before and claimed they were amazing.

Don\'t you dare hit the skip button!!!!', ""If you are familiar with Mari Okada as a screenwriter, then you've seen or heard of Anohana, Anthem of the Heart or Hanasaku Iroha. She tends to write strong character driven dramas. Mari Okada's attempt at fantasy is just like Goro Miyazaki's Tales from Earthsea. It falls flat. Her writing is most engaging when she is able to pull from parts of her life, like she does with Jintan from Anohana.The reason this falls flat compared to Anohana or Anthem of the Heart is due to how emotionally flat the characters/cast are. There are too many characters among the main cast. In addition, there...are too many time skips for the viewer to be emotionally invested in the characters. There's the main duo: Maquia and her adopted son Ariel. Maquia and her character design reminds me of Hagumoto Hagumi from Honey & Clover: she's that bland with her own love triangle at one point. Her son isn't any better. The time skips make his characterization completely unpredictable. Within an hour, Ariel is a baby, then a sweet 6-7 year old, then a 13-14 year old who out of nowhere develops a crush on his adopted mom and then announces he is father right after he joins the army who are attacking his mom's people. No joke, when he is 13-14 Ariel he gets drunk and could have almost sexually assaulted his mom. That seemed added for the sake of drama. I wished there could have been one age we could have focused on for Ariel.I did it find it interesting how Ariel learned from his mom how to weave. It seemed that weaving was a means for communication among the Iorphians. I felt that was characteristic to their culture that I wish could have been explored further.Then there's the rest. Leilia who experiences jumps in her characterization: she who is fearless and able to jump into the water becomes someone unable to run away when her clan tries to rescue her because she is pregnant.There were too many characters with not enough screen time.I found the character designs detract from the sadness the Iorphians have to face when they will outlive the ones they love. The character designs for the female Iorphians scream moe: semi flat chested with voice acting found in moe characters. I'm not sure if they are meant to forever look like pubescent middle school students.This is a film that seems to have too much going on. This reminds me of the reverse of Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood in that the blond haired humans (Amestrians aka Iorphians) are the ones to be targeted and attacked. Additionally, there seems to be too much facts surrounding the world building that we are given that it's difficult to form a coherent narrative. What is the Hibiol tapestry they are weaving? Why is that important? Then there are those dragons that look like they were ripped out of Tales of Earthsea. Why are the locked in cages?All and all, it was sort of a mess of a film.

I think this movie had a lot of issues that I just couldn\'t get through. It could\'ve been really good too, I get why people like it. SOME SPOILERS.I\'ll start off with the stuff I liked. It was very pretty (though the CGI dragons were ugly and distracting). The music was good too from what I remember. And the scene where Maquia found and saved baby Ariel was my favorite throughout the whole movie. Now to my complaints.I could tell right off the bat that the vitality of Maquia\'s people was going to be...a plot point thanks to the narration at the beginning. This seems like such a huge misstep, as it would have been so much more fascinating to let the audience piece this together themselves. If we hadn\'t known, we\'d be left in the dark as to why they were being attacked and kidnapped, there would be mystery and intrigue at least. We\'d still know who the bad guys were obviously, but we wouldn\'t know their motives (show, don\'t tell). This was a minor complaint so I\'ll move on.I thought the characters were either extremely boring or unlikable. There was a point where I thought Ariel was going to have romantic feelings for Maquia, his mother, and while that would have been gross, it at least would have been interesting, something I hadn\'t seen (in conventional TV). Instead, it\'s the same ""I must protect you"" motivation I\'ve seen a million times. In the wake of a tragedy, Maquia decides to save a helpless infant and devote her life to raising it. On paper, that sounds good and it grabbed me at first, but lost me very quickly. Most mothers care for their sons, and most sons love their mothers. Neither their motivations nor their actions were enough to keep me invested in them. I absolutely hated Izol. He kidnapped Leilia, let\'s her get raped, then all of the sudden feels guilty? He knew what he was doing. Maybe just don\'t do the bad thing in the first place. I was extremely frustrated with Leilia\'s decision to stay, it boggled my mind. No one else really stood out for me, which meant that I didn\'t have anyone to root for not even half way in to the movie.Again, the story grabbed me for the first 10-15 minutes, but then it just lost me. I didn\'t like the ""evil king wanting power"" plot point, I didn\'t like Leilia\'s story, and Maquia\'s and Ariel\'s relationship wasn\'t enough to carry the film for me.

It is no easy task for movies to impact me so profoundly, seeing as I have weirdly high standards thanks to the excessive number of movies I have viewed (I assure you, I am not boasting, I have sat through an unhealthy number of Movies and TV shows, and now I am a very unnecessary snob) and also considering how easily I get distracted or bored,...this movie, containing such a beautiful plot, stunning art design and such an immersive and detailed universe which I wish could be expanded upon, really is worth-while to see.

You aren't a mistake, you have a purpose to live, whatever it is, don't give up and continue to shine as stars can only be seen when it's dark. So just because you're in a dark place, let your light shine and guide those who are lost now, because you've been there yourself.Sorry this isn't much of a review and I apologize really understand this feeling and we see so many young people take their life because they never understood this feeling. They thought they were in loved but never felt loved. This movie is beautiful, to show that we shouldn't think that way, that our lives are meaningless and pointless, we should look at our life and see the people around us. Not that do they love us, but do we love them? It's not about giving a love hoping you get something in return, you love them because they are part of your life, your world and part of who you are. A mother's love is something some people never feel and I always feel sad for those people, because there is no love greater then being loved by parents who cares about you. It isn't perfect, they will make mistake, but they are doing their best to raise you. It is never easy to learn to become a parent, to love someone so much and you don't know why but you just do.I love this movie and I dare call it a masterpiece, because I feel like it is one. One of the most satisfying feeling even if you do end up bawling by the end, it is so beautifully told. I won't review the movie too much, I think it deserves a watching and you can decide for yourself if you like it or not.

The story is beautiful, I loved the sort-of unique animation with the faces and I thought the general animation was absolutely STUNNING, even to this day!

A story about motherhood that needs no explanation to those that have experienced it. While this might seem to be a niche audience, the other characters of the story can easily be attached to and feel compassionate about. Their own situations can allow anyone to have a perspective in the movie, my it be as the child or the adult. Maquia is the story of this show, and her character is shaped in a way that seems to not be the A typical character you would normally think of. Neither hot headed or cold cool, mysterious or...all powerful, she starts as and ends as a normal kinda bland character. At first I thought it would be liele that was the main character but the view point switched early to establish Maquia as the main character. This kinda character really cemented her as the typical mom you would see from any family, not that being a mom is bland but the characteristics she has really defines what mothers would seem like, bringing more emotional attachment since you understand why she experiences the things that happen. Ariel fit the perfect role of the child. Growing up first with feelings of carelessness and love. Then becoming defiant and confused. Before reaching appreciation and remorse. These two characters serve as the backbone of the story and the other narrative elements that are spread throughout the movie. I found the ending to be amazing and perplexing in different ways. It’s rare for mothers to experience the old age of their child and seeing it happen in the movie was powerful because it brought her whole character and her son full circle in the movie, a great way of doing character development by any means. But at the same time seeing her not age was a bit of a pull back because of the fact she hadn’t aged herself, making a slight disconnect happen. I also am convinced now that the only way to do time progression is either forwards or backwards, you must have a general direction of where time flows. Without that you always have a convoluted story that has no grounds for the audience to grasp there understanding. The Maquia did it fantastically by having appropriate time skips without cuts and doing general scene changes instead. It felt fluid. You could understand generally how much time had passed and never was jarring or confusing of what happened. Without the time skips we wouldn’t be able to see the growth of Maquia and see how she as a mother changes since motherhood isn’t a fast process but something that takes decades to come full circle and the movie captures this perfectly. It shows the irrational behavior of kids toward the parent and feeling remorse and regretful they feel later cause of it. This movie defines the behavior of mother relationship and I couldn’t ask more with how it was presented. The animation was good but I feel it was a bit rough, typical of PA works but I’m starting to feel spoiled by all the latest shows to come out and how gorgeous they look. None the less it was up to standard and nice to look at. The music was also decent, some good tracks to invoke the emotion of scenes and great timing for maximum effect.

A man cautiously stepping his face out of the window, expecting bad things to come. Yet, he was welcomed with a glorious warmth.I literally had no other words to describe this movie better than those words. Sayonara no Asa ni (in this case, Maquia) have one of my highest expectations in the circle of an anime movie. No shit, this was written by Anohana’s Mari Okada, making it the first movie debut based on her original work. At the time this was promoted, I raised two important questions, “Is this going...to be as good (or even more) than her previous project, let’s say, Anohana?”, and “If Mari Okada is given freedom to construct her original work, it’s definitely gonna affect much, but what if it doesn’t?”. Because personally as an audience, Anohana isn’t labelled in my favourite list and I’m sure that (emphasize this: ‘maybe’) this movie isn’t going to punch me that hard. Turns out, Maquia has distinct interesting stuff in it that approaches the audience in a unique way.Maquia is like when you’re emotionally being caressed away towards the warmth of loneliness until you find a new light. Especially if you’re close to your mother, or even you’re a mother yourself. The movie connects us with the real world on how motherhood can change the whole course of your life and exquisitely explained how is it to be lonely. Some might find the characters are boring and lame, and I agree on a few parts. The movie itself isn’t packed with interesting and memorable characters, but the message and a plot that’s close for resembling people’s life by emphasizing on humane is a wonderful thing. It’s a simple story that will leave you with a little smile.Overall, in my opinion, Maquia isn’t a masterpiece or even the best anime movie out there.

Well, looks like this\'ll be my first.To start off, the animation work in this film is quite a spectacle. From the lustrous grassy fields to the immaculate castle and town, everything is shown off beautifully. You got to hand it to P.A. Works for the designs of these backdrops as they are seriously a treat to the eyes.The character designs were pretty alright as well. They nailed the medieval fantasy look nicely with the characters. Colorful, diverse, and clean, the designs got the job done.However I...can\'t say the animation was all perfect. Of course, there were some instances of the dreaded ""quality"" shots, some scenes even looking really odd compared to others, but overall it was fine.I can say the same with the sound, it was amazing. Nothing more to add there.Now, here comes the main part.Man, what a mess of a story. The concept of a mother who can\'t age living alongside a son who does seems like it can be interesting but the way it was handled in this film is downright confusing. Obviously with a story like this there\'s bound to be times skips here and there but oh man, they really love those time skips. I get that they\'re supposed to show the life of this child grow up next to his forever teen mom but can\'t they just put some brakes and let us see their development a bit better? It\'s like there\'s one scene here explaining something, giving background or plot details, then next scene later it\'s a couple years in the future. There were plenty of parts of the plot that I would\'ve loved to see fleshed out more but sadly we don\'t have the time for that. This really affected the character development between Maquia and Ariel, which was supposed to be the main focus of the story, by not allowing the audience enough time to truly care about the child (Ariel) similarly to how Maquia would. This also applies to the events of the story as because of these seemingly random time skips certain scenes are missing key background information, making the viewer confused on what exactly is going on. Minor spoiler but there was a scene at the end involving an escape which made me almost burst out laughing at how absurd it was.Overall, I\'d say this film is a feast to the eyes and can even be recommended for the animation alone but is riddled with wasted potential for a concept that could\'ve been so interesting. can\'t say the animation was all perfect.

It resonated with me to earn the 10/10.Story: Maquia's story follows the journey of Maquia, and the struggles through life as she has to live almost undercover, away from everyone and everything that she has ever known. Later on, she does get meetings with her past, but these encounters ultimately either serve as representations of change, or a reluctance to move towards the future. What this movie does well is with the pacing, and how the movie tells the story. Events happen at...the same rate, throughout the movie. The timeskips are used in a way that isn't distracting to the overall story, accelerating the plot and developing the characters. With the 2 hour runtime, the movie also fits a lot of content in the amount of time that it gives. Overall, the story of growing up and finding a place in the world that Maquia presents is an amazing representation of the idea, and gives the viewer basically everything they would want. I wish I could say everything, but in general, the movie's story is spot on. At the end of the movie, everything that has been built up comes to one moment of pure feels action, so I really enjoyed watching that.Art: I have no real complaints about the art in this movie. Backgrounds are beautiful, comparable to that of Violet Evergarden's, but the only thing that seems a bit off is with the characters. It's harder to keep them fluid while maintaining shadows and lighting, so they seem to stick out when compared to the background. In other cases, this would be a problem, but this movie handles it in a way that the differing art benefits the experience, since you can keep track of everything as it happens.Sound: The music is amazing, and not just because I love orchestral soundtracks. Other than that, everything else is on point, especially voice acting. Maquia especially brings life to the character with the emotions you can feel in her voice, and Ariel also shows this too with his display. Also, coupled with the scene at the later part of the movie, when feels are at an all time high, the music brings that scene to life, almost too well. No problems here.Character: This aspect of the movie was skillfully crafted. Although certain characters from the Iorph could have gotten more, everyone else did get what they deserved in the time that the movie had. Maquia's progression into a loving mother, despite looks, is one that you can follow and feel as it happens. You can feel the awkwardness she feels at the beginning with Ariel, and the gradual confidence she grows as he does. In a way, Ariel is the physical embodiment of Maquia's feelings and thoughts. This development and trade off blends together well, and all leads to the more climatic points in the movie with the kingdom. Speaking of Ariel, I want to point out that his development is genius. The timeskips not only progress his character, but also Maquia's as they're both intertwined into one huge plot. When she feels like she's not enough, eventually Ariel does too. This play-off allows for greater connection between the characters. The various side characters are also given lots of detail when compared to what other movies would give them. For example, Lang with his time as a knight allows for more character development with his time when Ariel is also a knight. It may not be to the extent that a full show season would give, but for the 2 hours, it's more than enough. With the other Iorphs, I felt that they could have been utilized more. They're used as the vagrant sort of characters, but just because they don't belong doesn't mean that too little development is the best choice for them. For instance, Krim. He's basically real estate when it comes to development. His change in character stems from his unwillingness to change or adapt to new change, but why? It's a little unclear if he's an example of being captured and unable to be freed, but that would be my guess. Other than that, characters were well done.Enjoyment: This was like Clannad. I cried on the inside a lot, especially at the end. You'll know when it hits you. This movie was enjoyable from start to finish, with development and plot that keeps you wanting more. It's one of my favorites now.Overall: The movie's story is captivating, with scenes that develop and give characters life. The art is beautiful, and there's almost nothing to hate on my end.

As you watch the movie, you can see its potential to be a great film. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't deliver. The only characters you end up caring about don't get developed or have enough screen time, while the characters that do mature do it in a way that ends up just being frustrating. The art is fine, with some passable CG scenes. The sound is good but forgettable - it's just the general anime movie background music that you would expect to hear. Overall, I wouldn't say you would hate this movie, but...you would probably rather be mildly annoyed that it was so underwhelming. you would probably rather be mildly annoyed that it was so underwhelming."", ""When I first heard about Maquia: When The Promised Flower Blooms, I knew it was going to be something special. I mean, not to diss anime as a whole, but these days, a lot of anime seem more focused on fan service and putting characters in dumb, sexual situations for kicks and giggles over telling riverting stories involving compelling characters you can care about. Thankfully, though they're far fewer in number, they're still being made. Whether they're movies or TV shows or just short OVAs, genuinely good anime are still there, especially the ones that really remind you of what makes anime truly amazing. Maquia...is definitely one of those anime. I admit, I'm kinda torn about this one, because it has everything I love in a good anime and is very beautiful, but it does have a lot of flaws that prevent it from being a true masterpiece in my eyes.The story centers on a woman named Maquia, who hails from a clan of people who stop aging physically when they turn 15 years old. She lives a peaceful life in the village of Iorph with her friends and family. However, everything changes when an army from the Mezarte Empire attacks her village. Maquia manages to escape, but her friends aren't so lucky. One of them, Leilia, is kidnapped by the royal family for the purpose of creating an immortal heir, and others go missing. As she's lost in her grief, she comes across a newborn baby whose family was killed in the onslaught. Taking pity on it, Maquia decides to raise the baby as her own, naming him Ariel. But she knows full well that unlike her, Ariel will grow up and age, and in the process of learning to be a mother and raising him, she's intent on finding her friends and making it through the Mezarte Empire unnoticed by those who hurt her friends.Full truth: Maquia was actually P.A. Works first feature-length animated movie, but you wouldn't know it just by watching. Seriously, the animation is absolutely stellar. The background art is lush and beautiful, from the light reflecting off of tranquil waters to antiquated stone buildings that depict the Iorphs' home as a land frozen in time. Everything absolutely oozes with vibrance and life. The way the characters move is so fluid that you feel like they'll pop right off the screen. This is especially true in every scene involving a tavern, and there's one part where some of Maquia's patrons slam their wooden spoons on bowls, cups, and tables like they're drums during a happy hour. To me, that part alone was the most well animated scene in the entire movie. Plus, the war scenes are very striking and hyper detailed, with no single character being little more than a gray blob in the background or a still frame used to save costs. There's always something going on in the background, making the world of Maquia feel so much more alive. The music also helps in not only capturing the medieval feel of the movie's setting, but setting the mood for every scene, especially the big, heavy, emotional parts that are sure to strike a chord in anyone. Each track feels distinctive and unique, even with similar instruments being used over and over again.The characters are where things start to get kind of...mixed. Don't get me wrong, I loved the whole ensemble, and every character brings something to the table, so in that aspect, they're all great. Maquia herself is a very good main character, even if she doesn't look or act like it. She's a young, frail woman who's very sheltered and doesn't always know what to do. She's not snarky, sassy, physically strong, or even very complex, but she goes through some pretty bad things and still manages to be true to herself and be herself even in the face of adversity. The other characters are admittedly rather one note, and since this is a movie, there's only so much time you have to develop the characters. Plus, the movie's themes involving the passage of time means you see them change over the course of the film. Some changes are good, and some...not so much, what with Ariel being more sullen and moody as a teenager. Still, I loved all of the characters, though I did think the Mezarte family seemed a bit too stereotypically evil.Unfortunately, as much as I absolutely want to exalt this movie as a full blown masterpiece, I can't deny that it has some pretty significant logical problems that really hurt it. First of all, the Renato dragons. What's their deal? The whole Red Eye issue was never resolved, the movie doesn't really explain what Red Eye is and why it makes them go berserk, and it seemed like the Renatos were just used as living props to move the story and characters forward rather than being characters in their own right. Plus, with the movie's themes involving the passage of time, it tends to jump around a lot from time period to time period without really clearing certain things up. For example, Ariel gets bullied by a girl named Dita early in the movie, but later on...out of absolutely nowhere, it's revealed that somewhere down the line, he met back up with her, married her, and she's pregnant with his kid. What?! This raises a crap ton of questions. How did he meet back up with her? What made them fall in love and get married? Why would Ariel want anything to do with her after she bullied him so long ago? This comes right out of nowhere with zero explanation, and the movie doesn't try to establish how they got together, and its haphazard pacing in this regard, and in other scenes, really hurt the movie.However, I consider the film's biggest flaw to be this one scene in the end, where a certain character acts completely out-of-character despite her earlier depiction. I won't go into spoilers, as that's not allowed, but this character is repeatedly stated to love another person, but when they actually see said person again, they just leave and forget about them, like she never even cared about them in the first place. Not only does this completely go against her characterization in the movie, which is just bad writing IMHO, but her actions actually have a lot of really dark ramifications that I don't think Okada and the other writers caught on to when making it. I know a lot of people complain that Okada's anime tend to be melodramatic and heavy handed, which I can get behind, but I think those elements not only worked in the movie's favor here, but were much more reigned in this time around. That one scene I mentioned leaves a pretty nasty aftertaste in an otherwise great movie.I often watch Doug Walker/Nostalgia Critic's reviews, and one specific moment in his Snow White mini-review for Disney-cember spoke to me. He described Snow White as being a movie that doesn't show you what you logically or ethically want to see, but what your emotions want to see. In that aspect, Maquia is basically this in a nutshell. The movie is absolutely fueled to the brim with emotion, practically bursting at the seams, often times at the expense of pacing, character development, and plot threads that really need to be resolved, so it's not always for the better. I think most of the movie's problems can be attributed to the fact that it seems like it'd be better fit for a TV series than a movie, that way many of its plot threads can be tied up and many of the subplots getting more screen time than the medium of films allow. Is Maquia a perfect movie? No. Is there room for improvement? Oh, hell yes. But in all honesty, Maquia is still a genuinely great movie filled with a lot of heart that'll definitely resonate with anyone, whether they're a parent or not. I'd rather watch a flawed but still good movie over a straight up bad movie overall.While not without its problems, for Mari Okada's directorial debut, I think she hit a home run with this one.

And you just have to assume why Maquia ran off when she could have left a note or something. Why...did the Iorph had to be killed off when all they had was immortality and no special powers to be utilized against the other countries.

He was supposed to protect his 'mom' but then never really had the chance to protect his 'mom' in any shape or form, Maquia pretty much had to defend for herself. There were so many other characters that needed to either get killed off or explained more because there were no real point to them.

I’m glad I accidentally ended up with rather expensive tickets to see it. It was worth it.', 'Let me start this review by providing a fair bit of context in how I view stories of this genre. One thing I’ve noticed a lot in Anime Western Medieval Fantasy is how common it is to see them employ video game tropes and game-like mechanics. They’re ridiculously proliferate in the new Isekai fad that now grips the medium but they’ve also been present in non-Isekai stories like “Goblin Slayer”, “Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash” and Ichiro Sakaki works like “Scrapped Princess” and “Chaika the Coffin princess”. These stories often portray things like ""partys"", ""classes"", ""stats"", “guilds”, “dungeon crawling” and other such elements all of...which have roots in RPGs. More specifically those are elements that have been used to translate classic Western Medieval Fantasy book concepts (e.g. Lord of the Rings) into a game system. I’ve always pinned this phenomenon down to cultural differences: When we think of Western Medieval Fantasies we\'d usually think of classic stuff like “Lord of the Rings” which pre-dates video games. Other Western Medieval Fantasy writers in the West who came afterwards have generally followed a traditional route of being influenced by other books (many authors cite “Lord of the Rings” as a huge influence). In Japan it\'s different though: most probably know what “Lord of the Rings” is but for the most part, the Western Medieval Fantasy genre was imported into Japan through games not books. “Lord of the Rings” led to “Dungeons & Dragons” which then ultimately led JRPGS “Dragon Quest” and “Final Fantasy”. Japanese writers are less aware of writing classic Western Medieval Fantasy settings without game tropes because they\'re more exposed to game versions than book versions. And now it\'s come full circle where elements that were originally designed to translate book concepts into a game system have now been transitioned back into books and similar media (Light Novels, Manga and Anime). I tend to view this as a pitfall because you need to be from a particular niche to understand these game tropes. They won\'t really make much sense to anyone who isn\'t familiar with RPGs and it shouldn\'t really be in a story if it\'s not a game. Storylines often end up relying on them to make sense and it all contributes to a world setting that will never feel as immersive as classical versions filled with rich history and lore. Instead they often comes across as cheap and inferior derivatives by comparison. And arguably one of the most important elements of the Medieval Fantasy genre is its world setting.The reason I mention all of this is because Western Medieval fantasy is a genre that I hold very close to my heart. I\'ve loved them since I was a kid. Tolkein, Robin Hobb, Kate Elliott, Robert Jordan, George RR Martin etc. To me the differences between their works and Western Medieval Fantasy in anime in terms of world setting/building is as clear as night and day. The only anime I’ve ever seen to avoid this particular pitfall are “Berserk” and “Rage of Bahamut”. That was until now.This film is one of the rare few Western Medieval Fantasy anime that avoids this pitfall completely. The only thing potentially game-like about it are the aesthetics thanks to the influence of long-time veteran fantasy artist Akihiko Yoshida, but I have no issue with that. The film’s approach to Western Medieval Fantasy isn’t generic by classical standards either. There is no evil overlord or empire looking to take over the world. There is no chosen hero destined by fate to save the day. It’s a down to earth story about a boy and his mother of a different fantastical race set in a low key fantastical world. It reminds me of the type of Low Fantasy in the vein of Robin Hobbs works (one of my favourite Fantasy writers). In her “Realm of the Elderlings” series, the magic in that setting is a largely forgotten art and a shell of its former glory. Robin Hobb also puts a strong focus on character relationships as opposed to the epic adventurers more common of the genre, or even the political drama more common to Low Fantasy in general e.g. “A Song of Ice & Fire”. Speaking of ASOIAF, I wonder if Okada (The director and writer) was inspired by that franchise. The destruction of the Iolf homeland in the beginning does bear a passing resemblance to the destruction of the Stark House, particularly in the way the focal trio split up and went their own ways and especially in the way Leilia’s situation emulated Sansa Stark’s (with Izor acting as a more simpler and straighter take on Sandor Clegane). I also liked the how the fantasy elements/races were a slowly dying element in this world. That said, one thing I didn’t like was how awfully rushed the political element of the setting was. I get that the film format is a limiting factor though.The film actually started off quite rushed and the beginning could’ve been a lot better fleshed out. Events started happening way too fast and explanations were a bit too “blink and you’ll miss it”. There were so many things I would’ve liked to appreciate better and it wasn’t just events like why the whole Iolf homeland needed getting sacked or what happened to Ariel’s real mother but also some the little cultural elements too. For example it took me a long time to understand that the tapestry that the Iolf weave is their actual form of literature and that’s why they spend all day weaving it. I didn’t click the two and two together until halfway through the film, but it’s such a cool and imaginative element that I wish they gave it a little more focus. There was a cultural element to it as well with the belief in “Hibiol” but I was never able to fully connect with the Hibiol and partings subtext. I think I got, but not enough to resonate. The pointed use of different terminologies was also kinda unnecessary to be honest: Just call them Elves and Dragons. If you don\'t have time to explain it, use more familiar terms.But once the first time skip happened it started getting progressively better. The exploration of motherhood and the general difficulty of single parenting was done really well. It’s kind of worth contrasting this to another film called “The Wolf Children” which had a different take on the same thing. In “The Wolf Children”, Hana the mother is basically supermom and it was inspiring to watch her as a result. It was pretty much outside forces beyond her control that conspired to leave her with a bittersweet end. Maquia is a bit more complex: It doesn’t just have an external fantasy element causing issues but the fact that Maquia herself wasn’t perfect either. There was a very real and grounded element of dysfunction to Maquia’s motherhood and her relationship with Ariel (presumably inspired from Okada’s own experiences which she’s detailed very frankly in her autobiography) and the result was something more low-key tragic than inspiring.The timeskips themselves were generally poorly transitioned and certain side characters aren’t handled all that well. It’s a shame that the film format leaves them and the plot with such little time for focus (and explanation). If it were a TV format and they had equal focus then we might have really had a great anime version of “A Game of Thrones”.Overall a really good film. There were a few issues and I still don’t rate it as highly as “The Wolf Children”, but as a huge fan of Medieval Fantasy, this was a great experience. which have roots in RPGs. More specifically those are elements that have been used to translate classic Western Medieval Fantasy book concepts (e.g. Lord of the Rings) into a game system. I’ve always pinned this phenomenon down to cultural differences: When we think of Western Medieval Fantasies we\'d usually think of classic stuff like “Lord of the Rings” which pre-dates video games. Other Western Medieval Fantasy writers in the West who came afterwards have generally followed a traditional route of being influenced by other books (many authors cite “Lord of the Rings” as a huge influence). In Japan it\'s different though: most probably know what “Lord of the Rings” is but for the most part, the Western Medieval Fantasy genre was imported into Japan through games not books. “Lord of the Rings” led to “Dungeons & Dragons” which then ultimately led JRPGS “Dragon Quest” and “Final Fantasy”. Japanese writers are less aware of writing classic Western Medieval Fantasy settings without game tropes because they\'re more exposed to game versions than book versions. And now it\'s come full circle where elements that were originally designed to translate book concepts into a game system have now been transitioned back into books and similar media (Light Novels, Manga and Anime). I tend to view this as a pitfall because you need to be from a particular niche to understand these game tropes. They won\'t really make much sense to anyone who isn\'t familiar with RPGs and it shouldn\'t really be in a story if it\'s not a game. Storylines often end up relying on them to make sense and it all contributes to a world setting that will never feel as immersive as classical versions filled with rich history and lore. Instead they often comes across as cheap and inferior derivatives by comparison. And arguably one of the most important elements of the Medieval Fantasy genre is its world setting.The reason I mention all of this is because Western Medieval fantasy is a genre that I hold very close to my heart. I\'ve loved them since I was a kid. Tolkein, Robin Hobb, Kate Elliott, Robert Jordan, George RR Martin etc. To me the differences between their works and Western Medieval Fantasy in anime in terms of world setting/building is as clear as night and day. The only anime I’ve ever seen to avoid this particular pitfall are “Berserk” and “Rage of Bahamut”. That was until now.This film is one of the rare few Western Medieval Fantasy anime that avoids this pitfall completely. The only thing potentially game-like about it are the aesthetics thanks to the influence of long-time veteran fantasy artist Akihiko Yoshida, but I have no issue with that. The film’s approach to Western Medieval Fantasy isn’t generic by classical standards either. There is no evil overlord or empire looking to take over the world. There is no chosen hero destined by fate to save the day. It’s a down to earth story about a boy and his mother of a different fantastical race set in a low key fantastical world. It reminds me of the type of Low Fantasy in the vein of Robin Hobbs works (one of my favourite Fantasy writers). In her “Realm of the Elderlings” series, the magic in that setting is a largely forgotten art and a shell of its former glory. Robin Hobb also puts a strong focus on character relationships as opposed to the epic adventurers more common of the genre, or even the political drama more common to Low Fantasy in general e.g. “A Song of Ice & Fire”. Speaking of ASOIAF, I wonder if Okada (The director and writer) was inspired by that franchise. The destruction of the Iolf homeland in the beginning does bear a passing resemblance to the destruction of the Stark House, particularly in the way the focal trio split up and went their own ways and especially in the way Leilia’s situation emulated Sansa Stark’s (with Izor acting as a more simpler and straighter take on Sandor Clegane). I also liked the how the fantasy elements/races were a slowly dying element in this world. That said, one thing I didn’t like was how awfully rushed the political element of the setting was. I get that the film format is a limiting factor though.The film actually started off quite rushed and the beginning could’ve been a lot better fleshed out. Events started happening way too fast and explanations were a bit too “blink and you’ll miss it”. There were so many things I would’ve liked to appreciate better and it wasn’t just events like why the whole Iolf homeland needed getting sacked or what happened to Ariel’s real mother but also some the little cultural elements too. For example it took me a long time to understand that the tapestry that the Iolf weave is their actual form of literature and that’s why they spend all day weaving it. I didn’t click the two and two together until halfway through the film, but it’s such a cool and imaginative element that I wish they gave it a little more focus. There was a cultural element to it as well with the belief in “Hibiol” but I was never able to fully connect with the Hibiol and partings subtext. I think I got, but not enough to resonate. The pointed use of different terminologies was also kinda unnecessary to be honest: Just call them Elves and Dragons. If you don\'t have time to explain it, use more familiar terms.But once the first time skip happened it started getting progressively better. The exploration of motherhood and the general difficulty of single parenting was done really well. It’s kind of worth contrasting this to another film called “The Wolf Children” which had a different take on the same thing. In “The Wolf Children”, Hana the mother is basically supermom and it was inspiring to watch her as a result.

It's not a bad movie but it's not the narrative or emotional masterpiece the trailers and review content make it out to be.The art direction, animation and musical accompaniment largely backpack the rest of the movie. It is very visually appealing. The character designs are interesting, the scenario gets you invested very early into the world being presented to you and the music plays appropriately and swells at key moments.But the narrative... boy the narrative. It bumbles, it fumbles, it drags on and it's just plain confusing. It feels like one writer wanted...to do a political drama, the other a character drama and the project manager between them gave up on reconciling the difference.The characters behave in weird ways and make odd decisions that lack a purpose or meaning beyond purely driving the narrative forward. Key story elements are introduced 90 seconds before they are relevant and then are never mentioned again. There are repeated time skips with no editing, voice over or anything to indicate the passage of time nor how much time has passed. For a story whose central theme is about life and death, having characters die on screen and then are mysteriously alive for un-explained reasons causes a lot of the lines about the meaning of life to really fall flat.  Several of the characters drivel on about wanting to live  long lives only to be willing to throw themselves off of high places in moments of conflict?A lot of the super emotional moments have the right elements to make you want to cry but its so hard to be invested in the characters motivations and the overall plot because both are so shallow. It causes these really hard hitting moments to fall on their faces because despite the efforts of the acting talent you just aren't sold that these characters who's motivations shift every 5 minutes really mean what they're saying.It's a beautiful movie to look at, just don't think about it all or attempt to absorb any meaning out of it. to do a political drama, the other a character drama and the project manager between them gave up on reconciling the difference.The characters behave in weird ways and make odd decisions that lack a purpose or meaning beyond purely driving the narrative forward.

Maquia is very different from those two yet also similar. All three shows are very emotional, yet Maquia strays away from the typical melodrama used in the other two, and portrays a more family oriented story rather than friendship and love. Unfortunately, this film could have been so much better.Characters and Story: The story of this movie should honestly be a series. Too many plot points were squished into the tiny time slot of a movie without being able to fully flesh out every aspect. Many plot...points felt rushed over and, in the end, made half the movie feel very forgettable. The main societal conflict especially felt in the end lacking in relevancy due to a lack of development. So much was unclear and all over the place that it left a bad taste in my mouth despite my love for many other aspects of the movie.Being a fantasy movie, there was just not enough time dedicated to fleshing out the world and society. When you bring me to another world I want to feel immersed in the world. In this aspect Maquia falls far short of expectation. Don't get me wrong, as for the world, Okada has amazing ideas, I just feel like she didn't give her own idea the justice it deserved in this case. Thiis could easily have been a 10/10 story.The parts where the story does shine Is when it focuses on Maquia specifically, as she tries to be a good mother. The relationship between Maquia and Ariel is heart wrenching, I do however still wish that the pace was slown down during some of the development scenes, and again I believe this would have worked much better as a series rather than a movie. In terms of characters, other than Maquia and Ariel, every other character seemed to be left behind.Okada knows how to hit the emotions just right. Even if you found a hundred flaws in the progression of the story, somehow you will still end up in tears by the end of the movie.Sound: The music is beautiful. Many of the emotional impact this show has is greatly enhanced by its beautiful soundtrack, and I cannot tell you how many times I listened to the main theme of Maquia.Art and Animation: The movie looks amazing for the most part. I could be nitpicky here, but overall, I don’t have many complaints.

Regarding the animation, expect nothingness from PA Works, producing striking graphic works and able to animate the emotions beautifully. Although the character design is a bit off, the story itself compensated it very well.The movie itself is a roller-coaster, from slow-paced scenes to intense scenes and then back to slow, jumping between timelines is also what makes this show a bit...confusing. But each chapter in the movie is well documented and able to witness the development of each character. But time lapsing without the indication of the amount of year passed by will be the only thing I will criticise the anime for, as it misses out some key moments, especially near the end.Overall, this is the most fantastic, dramatic anime movie I have watched since “Your Name”.

This review will refer to the film as Sayoasa for simplicity’s sake. Sayoasa is about Maquia and she is from a clan of people who refer to themselves as lorph. They live for centuries, yet maintain the appearance they had in their late teens; their looks don’t change once they hit their late teens and look the same for the rest of their life. The clan that Maquia’s...a part of is invaded by the Mezarte army as they want to take over the land of the people of lorph with the goal of obtaining the blood that grants the people of lorph a long life. However, Maquia manages to escape and finds a baby who is a sole survivor of a brutal attack where all of the other people, including the baby’s parents, were killed. She takes the baby with the intent to raise him and names him Ariel. This film explores the difficulty of parenthood when there is inexperience in raising a child and the love a mother gives to her child to make sure they grow up to be a good and healthy person. This film also explores death in the sense that in your life, you are most likely going to see someone die and the pain that lingers in your heart knowing that you will have to continue living on while seeing the people you love die before you do.Sayoasa is a film about the longevity of Maquia’s life so there are quite a few timeskips that happen in the film but the reason I mention the occurrence of the timeskips is because they were done really well and didn’t feel messy or out of place. A scene change didn’t feel jagged and the film flowed through the story quite well from the beginning to the end.This film is produced by P.A. Works and I have seen anime series produced by them previously, such as Charlotte and Angel Beats!, but I have never seen an anime film that was produced by this studio. This is mostly due to the fact that this anime film is their first standalone feature-length, theatrically-released production. It is exciting to see one my favourite anime studios produce their first feature-length, theatrically-released anime film as it expands the competition and showcases the talent of anime producers in anime films as the anime films tend to have a higher budget than anime series. This allows the animation quality in films to be improved and better than anime series which is absolutely amazing to look at. The animation quality in this film is spectacular. P.A. Works is known for their style in animation and they have proved that they can make animation beautiful in a feature-length film as well. Mari Okada directed this film and this film serves as her directorial debut. This film is pretty impressive for considering this is Okada’s first time directing.The voice acting in this film is quite standard and familiar for the most part when compared to other anime. There’s nothing outstanding about the voice acting, but it is still good and comparable to other anime films and series alike, hence its familiarity. The soundtrack is good and it notably increases the tension in action scenes effectively. The ending theme that plays during the credits is so fitting for the film. The ending theme, ""Viator"", is performed by rionos. It sets the mood for you to just stay in your seat and collect your thoughts on the film and just taking in all the emotion that you get from the ending of the film.Character development was actually quite well done despite several timeskips and the relatively vast number of supporting characters. The amount of characters didn’t feel like excess. The film allows you to genuinely care for both the main and supporting characters. This film excels in portraying the family-like relationship and dependence that Maquia and Ariel have on each other. This film explores Maquia’s discovery of love and the types of emotions that are felt when you live longer than the people you love and seeing them pass away -- the discovery of true loneliness and the integral importance of emotional support and dependence on others.This film is no masterpiece, but it is still very good and enjoyable to watch. This is a very impressive directorial debut by Okada and it’s very delightful to see a standalone feature-length film produced by P.A. Works get a theatrical release in many countries worldwide. I hope to see more standalone films produced by P.A.

I believe there was a slight fault or technical error that happening during my screening but since it was so subtle, I don’t think it has affected my review, my thoughts on the film, and my final score of this film.I highly suggest that you go check this film out when it is released in your country.

Moreover the trailer fools us thinking it was about two lovers when it was all just mostly about a mother\'s love, which I had no problems until they added in what felt like forced romantic love stories (read below to see what I mean). If you want a movie about a mothers love as well as maturity of children just watch Wolf Children it\'s so much better. If you like to disagree with anything...I said, missed or failed to understand then just leave a comment.ART AND MUSICThe art is pretty good, if only they decided to add more variety to looks since the Iorph race all look around the same to me as I will explain below. The ending song (the humming in the trailer) sounds so meaningful filled with nostalgia and sadness, couldn\'t have picked a better song. Though the music for everything else wasn\'t that memorable.CHARACTERSLeilia (favourite) is a character filled with so many complex emotions especially when she broke down and snapped off all her jewellery we can see her psychological state and love for her child. Maquia is another wonderful character who tries so hard to be a good mother. A true shame there wasn\'t more scenes with Izol who we can tell does not truly agree with the king and is actually a respectful decent person. I would have wanted a scene where he betrayed the king unfortunately that didn\'t happen. Getting rid of a bad king  That would have made such a good story plot. a much better reason the country was at war in the first place lets be honest no one cares who won the war anyway there was nothing personal about it. Every other character seemed badly done to me. One went psycho one was boring and the others we just see for a couple of minutes for plot convenience and know next to nothing about them.STORY PROBLEMSBiggest problem was all the forced love interest in it. You do not see your sister or mother in a romanic light. Sure they aren\'t actually blood related so if your fine with that then sure but I can\'t stand that sort of thing, since young they have all being raised as a family.It has a slow start but one of the worst things about it was the wasted potential the had. It could have dived better into themes such as war, racism, betrayal it would have been so easy to do but none of that. Let me explain...A few minutes of war was shown but why was there a war happening? instead of just giving us the common because they want more land duh, why not take it more personal then that so it could be more climatic. It was said that Iorph race were treated unfairly but it would have being better to actually have one of those scenes where they go down a street and get food thrown at them or actually end up executed. A reason that could have also connected for a war to happen. Watching the trailer thinking it was going to have all that I was disappointed hoping it would be a big thing.Character design was absolutely terrible.  Genuinely had trouble telling the difference Maquia and Leilia when Maquia hair turned long blonde again. At the start it never told us why her changed to brown in the first place and gave no reason for it turning back to normal. As why was she even pregnant in the first place? did she actually get captured? then why is Krim there with her? how did they even manage to escape? And I guess the writers forgot she was even pregnant in the first place since it was never ever mentioned or shown again.They used too many time-skips with a failure to show any beforehand build up in order for it to make sense. We all get throw suddenly into a war leaving the audience completely confused on what has happened and happening.Spoiler- Ending was a good idea but I just don\'t see why Leilia still needed to to separated from her daughter when they clearly love each other. It would have been fine if it was just a reunion scene added in with a hug while Maquia flew away symbolising their freedom. I just don\'t care about the ending after that.One of the things I think actually did pretty well was the topic of mortality. Everyone would sooner or later die. That was why it was mentioned  "" if you fall in love you will truly be alone"" At first I was confused how can you be even more lonely? It\'s because if you don\'t love someone you can\'t miss them. You can\'t miss something you never had or wanted. Living old enough to see everyone die we can see this happen. I said, missed or failed to understand then just leave a comment.ART AND MUSICThe art is pretty good, if only they decided to add more variety to looks since the Iorph race all look around the same to me as I will explain below.

It could have dived better into themes such as war, racism, betrayal it would have been so easy to do but none of that. Let me explain...A few minutes of war was shown but why was there a war happening? instead of just giving us the common because they want more land duh, why not take it more personal then that so it could be more climatic. It was said that Iorph race were treated unfairly but it would have being better to actually have one of those scenes where they go down a street and get food thrown at them or actually end up executed. A reason that could have also connected for a war to happen. Watching the trailer thinking it was going to have all that I was disappointed hoping it would be a big thing.Character design was absolutely terrible.  Genuinely had trouble telling the difference Maquia and Leilia when Maquia hair turned long blonde again. At the start it never told us why her changed to brown in the first place and gave no reason for it turning back to normal. As why was she even pregnant in the first place? did she actually get captured? then why is Krim there with her? how did they even manage to escape? And I guess the writers forgot she was even pregnant in the first place since it was never ever mentioned or shown again.They used too many time-skips with a failure to show any beforehand build up in order for it to make sense. We all get throw suddenly into a war leaving the audience completely confused on what has happened and happening.Spoiler- Ending was a good idea but I just don\'t see why Leilia still needed to to separated from her daughter when they clearly love each other. It would have been fine if it was just a reunion scene added in with a hug while Maquia flew away symbolising their freedom. I just don\'t care about the ending after that.One of the things I think actually did pretty well was the topic of mortality. Everyone would sooner or later die. That was why it was mentioned  "" if you fall in love you will truly be alone"" At first I was confused how can you be even more lonely? It\'s because if you don\'t love someone you can\'t miss them. You can\'t miss something you never had or wanted. Living old enough to see everyone die we can see this happen.', 'There are many series and movies in the Anime industry that doesn\'t make any sense and some people still love them for some reason, ""Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms"" is a good example for this kind of bad writing people still love.In ""Maquia"" there\'s a big world with a good amount of side characters, such as the mystic dragon-like creatures that slowly annihilated, The people of Iorph who isolated themselves from the rest of the world, and the humans who obviously are the ""bad"" race that destroys everything for power.Yet, with all the potential of the world surrounding our characters, throughout the whole...movie, we get very little information about the world our story taking place in.

Every decision the characters made would make more sense if we knew where they came from.There\'s nothing special about the plot itself, but it still had the potential to become a good fantasy movie, especially with such a professional staff.I can\'t recommend a movie that feels like you started near the end of it, it\'s not worth the time. movie, we get very little information about the world our story taking place in.

This movie is the debut movie of director Mari Okada (the person who directed Anohana) and she has created yet another masterpiece (to me at least).LAST WARNING: THERE WILL BE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW SO CONSIDER YOURSELVES FULLY WARNED...Story: Follows the tale of a girl named Maquia whom is from a clan where people are essientally immortal or ageless(IDK they never truly clarified) when one day people from the nearby kingdom decide to attack them and takes one of them to the kingdom to marry to the prince. But maquia escapes and she then lives her life from then on. It then goes on to maquia finding a baby and she decides to raise him herself.The story here on out follows the child growing up and while facing the problems an immortal mother would face with a growing child. The main themes presented here are Motherhood and oppression. While there are a few more a very large part of the movie is focused on Maquia's journey as a mother. The theme of family is a very large focus as well, looking to how important it was to treasure the moments with loved ones before they all fade away.Art/Animation/Style: Amazing, The background designs were nothing short of creative and amazingly well drawn, i loved the design for the Clan village and the kingdom, the architecture felt very unique to the movie and that made it a whole lot more believable.The colors of every scene created a unique style where there was little shadowing but maintained a steady lighting the color palette was diverse and rather bright. The animation was beautiful, the CGI was kept to a minimum especially when it went to large objects such as the dragons where in my experience CGI has always made the movements for them. The art was amazing and i think is one of the most visually appealing anime for me to date.CharacterMaquia: Maquia's character truly hooked onto the movie and she showed me the happy times of family and the responsibility to raise a child while also hiding her true self, this perspective immersed me into the movie and truly showed me how hard it was to raise a child by yourself and in Maquia's situation it seemed overwhelming hard. Maquia's character is resolved with the simple motivation to raise her child. Maquia is someone whom did not have a mother herself was lonely internally and with the addition of the attack on her clan, it makes it as clear as day that when she makes the resolve to raise the child she was also as dependant on him as the child was to her. To say the least Maquia is a strong character whom despite being a woman went against odds to raise a child that wasnt even hers and in a bad situation, created something that was very rarely seen in my experience with anime, a strong female lead.Ariel: The adopted son of maquia. His character was first introduced as a baby when he was found by Maquia. Ariel's growth as a character was greater that that of Maquia as while Maquia had the resolve to raise him properly and kindly. Ariel strove for independence from Maquia. He eventually grew up into a man whom we see in his teenage years find his new resolve. I felf during his teenage years most people in the audience could relate to him and understand his inner feelings of his mother of being unable to age but yet didnt want to tell her how he truly feels until he actually does it. He eventually leaves the house and starts his own family. The change Ariel faced i felt like i could relate to him as someone too who is coming of age. This made be truly understand Ariel whom may get of your nerves and think why was he treating his mom like an ass sometimes but that is because we as the audience were biased to the fact we saw Maquia raise Ariel and that we also might see a little of ourselves within Ariel. At the end of the story i can say to the very end that Ariel's growth as someone whom was coming of age was well handled and treated carefully for the audience to understand his inner feelings.Verdict: Maquia - When the Promised Flower Blooms is in my book a masterpiece, the art, characters, story were all so well executed into creating a well done story about family. The characters were believable and overall were not at all annoying. The art as i said was amazing without a doubt amazingly drawn and animated.

This movie is not perfection, and it contains multiple flaws from the side stories to side characters, and the lack of world-building.However.This film holds a special place inside my heart. I gave this film a 10 not because of it's technical prowess, but because it has impacted me on such a personal level that I can't simply bring myself to drop it below a 10. As such, I'll be covering it's flaws and the absolutely beautiful strengths the film has to offer. (And having watched it in theaters just enhanced my experience tenfold)The side characters are generally not very...likeable or just have not much of an engagement as I would like it to have.

I’ve noticed that themes of parental love and specifically mothers really get to me, especially since I have been on the receiving end of such love for my whole life. It’s probably the strongest bond humans can have with each other. And yes, it did make me cry. Not the little better-wipe-it-off-with-my-sleeve type but more of a whimpering.First of all, the world-building was amazing, almost reminiscent of studio ghibli movies. It’s one of the few rare cases where you wouldn’t...be able to put it into a book, because describing the scenery with such detail would take so many pages that no one would want to read it. Whether it’s in the home of the Iorphs, the fields of Helm, the capital of Mezarte, or the ironworking factories of the industrial zone, it really transports you to a new place along with the characters.The story was also amazing. It’s not the first to be about a struggling mother in a new place, and it’s not the first to be about mystical legends being used as political weapons, but as far as I can tell it’s one of the first to combine the two. As a result, tensions and emotions always run high, especially when Maquia finds herself stranded in a new, unknown place. The climax reaches a fever pitch in the end as it is split between Ariel in the war and Maquia with Dita. But unlike so many movies out there, there are so many “pause” scenes where there is no action happening. But rather than making it feel long and drawn-out, these scenes serve to immerse you in the character’s lives and the tribulations they face through their dialogue. It’s also a way for the viewer to catch up with the numerous time skips (the main story takes us from Ariel’s infancy to adulthood in under two hours). In a way these two elements--”still” scenes and time skips--try to balance each other out by making it fast-paced while building up an emotional attachment to the character’s lives. Although it may not be perfect this is done effectively enough so that I couldn’t pick up on any flaws as I was watching it. Maybe the one thing I would have liked would have been to have more time to experience the stories of all the characters outside of the constraints of a movie. Although realistically it would made more viewers detached from the main story, It’s so good that I would have liked to stay in that world a bit longer.Due to the natural time constraints, only two characters get developed beyond ten minutes of screen time: Maquia and Ariel. I wouldn’t necessarily fault it on the creators, but the sub-plot with Leillia, Krim, and Medmel was a bit confusing. The only time it worked was when Maquia tried to convince Leillia to escape before her marriage, because it gave growth to Maquia’s character. However, when the story remained largely separate from Maquia, such as during the battle at the end, it’s confusing why they are even mentioned in the first place, such as why a character like Medmel exists. But that’s nitpicking. Most of the other minor characters serve to enhance Maquia, Ariel, or both. Mido and her family is the first example of a family to Maquia, which in turn helps her learn how to be a mother to Ariel. Dita feels a little overwhelmed by Maquia, who is literally an otherworldly mother compared to a woman like her. But although each character is very interesting, the time that they have seems to short. The minor characters are the main reason why I would want a medium longer than a movie, because I would like to explore the lives of the characters in Helm, especially Lang and Dita. However, it’s something to take points off for, as to effectively develop a relationship between Maquia and Ariel within two hours it’s necessary to stay with each minor character for only a brief period.Of course, there’s the premise of the entire movie: the fact that Maquia almost never ages while Ariel and everyone else around her grows older. Although it’s not uncommon to see immortal beings falling in love with mortals and later regretting that everyone they love will die (Hohenheim from FMA is a prime example), This story uses it in probably the most unique way so far. As a mother Maquia is supposed to be “grown-up” around Ariel. In the beginning it’s not as much of a problem, with Ariel being too young to understand the implications of his mother being an Iorph. Yet from the very beginning the movie convincingly portrays the bond of motherhood that Maquia has for Ariel, starting from when she found him abandoned at a settlement to the frustrations she faces as she is basically stranded in Mezarte with no work or money. Of course, as the years goes on and Ariel goes from childhood to adolescence their relationship gets more complicated. I mean, who can blame the guy when his supposed mother looks like she could be his beautiful teenage girlfriend. But it doesn’t devolve into unnecessary fanservice with a romantic love between Maquia and Ariel (which is what I expected). Instead, it handles the matter in a mature way by showing Ariel’s frustration at feeling helplessly unable to protect Maquia. I only wish that this part would be extended, specifically between when Maquia and Ariel start working in the city to before the battle happens. They kind shoved all of the complexities of adolescence into a single scene, then had Maquia become captive so that it could skip over to Ariel’s adulthood. I sound like a broken record at this point, but time constraints seem to be the only gripe I have. Otherwise, the “epilogue” at the end was very satisfying. It’s something that everyone expects to happen and is even explicitly mentioned in the very beginning, but actually experiencing it makes the emotions (and the tears) come to life.The art is some of the best I’ve seen in any animated show. It’s something that you have to see for yourself. It kind of ties back to worldbuilding, as the vast fantasy landscapes that the characters live in wouldn’t nearly be as immersing if it hadn’t been for the high-end art. Light is particularly beautiful here. In once scene where the characters are standing in front of a window, as they walk and pass over the sun it’s amazing how the light gradually dims and lights up again, as if it’s a video from real life. I found the people and especially Iorphs well-drawn as well. Although Maquia in particularly looks slightly different from the average anime character (I think it’s the eyes, but I’m not sure), it only highlights her feeling out of place in Mezarte. Similarly the music is also amazing. Not only does it establish the mood of the setting, but it helps immerse you into this fantasy world. I would even say that the silence was a deliberate creative decision. There are many scenes where there’s no music at all and just dialogue so that the raw emotions remain undiluted.Overall this is a very enjoyable experience. I feel like the themes were tailor-made to my preferences, but there’s so much to like here that most everyone will come out feeling satisfied. be able to put it into a book, because describing the scenery with such detail would take so many pages that no one would want to read it.

I won't say who it was, but they deserved better and it hurt my soul that they died in a way in which I'm afraid to die: alone.Other than that, everything else was just phenomenal. I decided to give it a chance at Otakon 2019 and I was so glad that I did. I cried at the end, (ironic because that's the one thing the main character was not supposed to do) I guess that since because SHE was holding it in all that time it was okay...to release all those tears that had been built up along the way.

I wholeheartedly recommend this movie."", 'I went back and watched this for a second time last night, a little over a year after watching it the first time, and I felt compelled to change my original review, in which I had scored this between a 7.75 and an 8.This anime is absolutely gorgeous, both aesthetically and thematically and that is true to such an extent that it easily carries this anime across the finish line and makes it very easy to forgive this anime\'s nitpicky shortcomings. It\'s one of those very rare movies where if you watch this you\'re more or less guaranteed to feel SOMETHING. You\'re a robot rather...than a human if this anime doesn\'t hit you in the feels in one way or another.I cannot stress how visually stunning this anime is. It\'s right there with Shinkai levels of gorgeous and it\'s the absolute top echelon as far as what a modern anime can look like. Thematically this anime goes deep and goes hard and it stays consistent with its theme throughout its two hour runtime, including foreshadowing and multiple subtle but evocative uses of environment to convey emotion. There\'s a profound story at the core of all this and it addresses some tough themes and concepts head on.In the best possible way, this is a movie only a woman could properly write and direct and I could not possibly sing the praises of Mari Okada loudly enough. The filmmaking industry as a whole, anime or not, needs way more women in power and in directorial positions and there\'s no better example of that cause than this.Nitpicking at some flaws, if they are even large enough to be called that, I\'d say that minus the ending piece the soundtrack is completely forgettable and the voice acting, or the subtitles depending on how you\'re watching, are not always on point. There\'s way more good here than bad, but there\'s one or two lines that really stand out as ""man, that came out weird"" or ""that must be a translation error or at very least there\'s got to be a more organic-sounding way to word that"". There\'s also one or two convenient moments that stretch plausibility even within the rules of its world, but I\'ve seen dozens of anime that are far more egregious offenders than this.I genuinely liked Maquia the first time and I really, really liked it the second time. I predict this anime will age really well and will still be gorgeous and heart-wrenching a decade or more after its release. This is a special anime anyone with even a vague interest in the genre should see and I\'m very glad I went back and gave it another go. It\'s just shy of a 10 for me, and if you want to call it a 10 I won\'t argue, but one way or another this is an all-timer and a magnificent piece of art.OBJECTIVE RATING- 9-10PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 9-9.5 than a human if this anime doesn\'t hit you in the feels in one way or another.I cannot stress how visually stunning this anime is.

The filmmaking industry as a whole, anime or not, needs way more women in power and in directorial positions and there\'s no better example of that cause than this.Nitpicking at some flaws, if they are even large enough to be called that, I\'d say that minus the ending piece the soundtrack is completely forgettable and the voice acting, or the subtitles depending on how you\'re watching, are not always on point. There\'s way more good here than bad, but there\'s one or two lines that really stand out as ""man, that came out weird"" or ""that must be a translation error or at very least there\'s got to be a more organic-sounding way to word that"". There\'s also one or two convenient moments that stretch plausibility even within the rules of its world, but I\'ve seen dozens of anime that are far more egregious offenders than this.I genuinely liked Maquia the first time and I really, really liked it the second time. I predict this anime will age really well and will still be gorgeous and heart-wrenching a decade or more after its release. This is a special anime anyone with even a vague interest in the genre should see and I\'m very glad I went back and gave it another go. It\'s just shy of a 10 for me, and if you want to call it a 10 I won\'t argue, but one way or another this is an all-timer and a magnificent piece of art.OBJECTIVE RATING- 9-10PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 9-9.5', 'H o l y  s m o k e s. I have never cried so hard from an anime before. The way P.A. Works animated every single finger of Baby Ariele\'s hand brought me to tears and this would just be the first time. I fell in love with the story from the moment The Anime Man raved about it. I can see why. Its story is a loving tale between a mom who\'s from an immortal species and an abandoned human child. There are so many themes present in the anime that I don\'t even know where to start. The song ""Vios"", which...is the movie\'s ending, is so emotional. It\'s definitely Angel Beats\' level emotional. The only thing off with the movie was probably the sheer number of themes being thrown at the viewer at once. In a span of 10 minutes,  there\'s a representation of the Maquia and Ariele reuniting, but there\'s also a castle being invaded, dragons dying, and Ariele\'s baby being born. Like wha- it can be overwhelming. Here\'s what I learned from the anime:1. A Mother\'s LoveAs an exasperated teenager who talks back to my parents, I had not seen a mother\'s love from the view of a growing mother who was just starting out. I never noticed the strength, worry, and hardships mothers have to go through whole raising kids. You get to see how hard adulting really is and how fast youth is.2. Humans are GreedyThe king takes in one of Maquia\'s friends who is immortal to have a child with. Maquia\'s friend is deprived of seeing her daughter and ultimately goes crazy because of the loneliness she feels as a queen. She is unable to see her friends and is sheltered away in the castle with no social interaction. The king, who kidnapped her and forced her to have a child with him, feels nothing towards her.3. Life is Insanely ShortYou watch as Ariele grows up from a baby all the way up to adulthood. It\'s insane. You see him first as a playful young boy, into a moody teenager, and then finally as an adult who yearns for his mother. The final scene touched my heart. You finally see Ariele and his mother Maquia in the most beautiful way possible. I did a Violet Evergarden cry right there. is the movie\'s ending, is so emotional.

I did a Violet Evergarden cry right there.', ""After reading through many of the comments on this movie, I generally got the feeling that a lot of the audience was disappointed because of the expectations that they set for the movie that the movie never set for itself.At its heart, Maquia is a mainly a story about bridging the concepts of love and time, with subtexts of freedom, family and the past. This is plainly laid out at the very start, when the leader of the Iorph tells Maquia to never love someone outside of their tribe, lest she feel lonely for the rest of her life due to the difference in lifespan....By setting this up at the start, it's clear that the exploration of this concept is the focus of the movie, not the plot. The plot is a vehicle to explore this theme rather than the focus of the film. This does not excuse the few problems that the plot does have, but rather lessens the impact that they have on the movie.The theme is mainly expressed through Maquia and her adopted son Ariel. The movie mainly uses motherly love to push the theme, but also uses romantic love as a secondary method at times. For me, the time skips weren't too much of an issue, with only the second time skip being a little confusing as Ariel doesn't look like he aged too much, but I found the time skips to be very important to the plot. It's mainly used to drive home the theme that even though the people around Maquia grow, especially Ariel, her love towards them doesn't change. It highlights the leader's warning at the beginning of the movie each time a time skip happens.As the story moves towards the climax where all the stories intertwine, we get to see the stance that the movie has on love and time- no matter how much time may pass, our love will stay the same, both for good and bad. Pretty much every character comes to understand this revelation at this point in the story learn to deal with it in their own respective ways.The last scenes of the movie hammer the concept home once again, with Ariel on his death bed and Maquia seeing him one last time.The story was definitely slow, but that's a given. We have to see what how the characters show love to one another in their daily lives and how their emotions stay the same even though time passes. The pacing highlights the theme of the passage of time.Maquia is a brilliant case study of how we are able to love, and continue loving once all is said and done, yet gives us a warning to not cling onto what is no longer there. Once we are able to see the movie for what it is rather than what we want it to be, only then can we fully appreciate it.Also sound and art was pretty good I guess, and the last few scenes of Maquia and Ariel are really touching. Was it worth 2 hours? Eh, up for you to decide but I thought it was fine By setting this up at the start, it's clear that the exploration of this concept is the focus of the movie, not the plot.

I\'ve been seeing so many hate reviews which criticize the movie so I\'d also like to share my opinion regarding it.The movie itself gives off a kind of vibe that brings you into the world of the main character. It basically makes you sympathize with everyone and feel everyone\'s emotions as if they were real people. Every character in the movie had enough screentime for me. They were all well-developed and everyone seemed to mature so much over the years. To believe that Maquia...who was previously a crybaby, even crying with being alone despite being with her clan and friends, now turned into a strong and courageous (and VERY independent) woman who promised her child that she would not cry ""for a mother never cries"" got me real good. Emotions were just overflowing throughout the movie, and I even felt sad for Krim and Leilia.For me, this journey was a beautiful tragedy, and the Parting Clan really got me good when it was finally explained at the end.I don\'t commonly cry in movies (I didn\'t even cry in Your Name), but this one made me shed a tear or two. If you haven\'t watched the movie, still give it a try despite what the other comments are saying. It\'s a masterpiece and it clearly deserves your attention. who was previously a crybaby, even crying with being alone despite being with her clan and friends, now turned into a strong and courageous (and VERY independent) woman who promised her child that she would not cry ""for a mother never cries"" got me real good.

Now that I may have caught your attention, here\'s my verdict of this film as a casual viewer...*anime recommended by @shinobu_oshino1 on tiktok*Want to watch a film with as much emotional appeal as Mamoru Hosoda or Makoto Shinkai and Ghibli films without the couples romantic cliche?This film suits your criteria, it has such a resilient soundtrack and maintains its emotional appeal till the end. I must admit that the beginning is extremely vague and unimportant to the plot but I felt it was much needed to build the premise and pace of the overall...film. I\'ll try my best to describe what I interpreted from the film...Plot:The story line isn\'t necessarily innovative, in fact I feel there are A LOT of similarities to Disney\'s and other western animated films than I\'d like to notice. (Added a list at the bottom) Despite starting very slow and vague to the context of the film\'s characters and storyline, I feel Maquia slowly progresses in order to provide a premise that we are able to consume easily. The film does progress at a satisfyingly fast rate that doesn\'t dwell unnecessarily. Overall the plot was fairly vague at the beginning but makes up for it at the end with very emotional scenes the beginning built up... I will be giving this film a 9/10 in terms of plot since, as an action/mecha fan this really surprised me with its ability to story tell.Art & Sound:Note: I watched 20 minutes in SUB and watched the entire film in DUB..The dub I watched was amazing, the character VA perfectly voiced their characters as I anticipated how they\'d sound. This film has a great soundtrack to back the emotional scenes to attack your feelings.. Although this film didn\'t solely rely on the animation and art style, it was very aesthetic and visually appealing. Overall in terms of both Character and Sound, I\'d say it\'s well deserving of an 8/10!Character:Not much changes in terms of character development, I\'m not sure if this film relies on character development to develop the overall narrative. As such, the only developments I\'ve noticed is Maquia from the birth of Ariel to when she leaves him with his wife and child. I\'d probably only see both contrasting events to be the character development of Maquia and Ariel over the duration of the film. Therefore, in terms of character development would be a 7/10; fairly good development but since it doesn\'t heavily rely on its presence it wouldn\'t make sense to blindly rate this highly.Enjoyment:As much as I\'d hate to say this as an action/mecha fan, this definitely has potential in cinemas, not only did it go against the romance trend where the world occurs around 2 main characters but it also did it with such an emotional and realistic premise (in terms of thematic application in society). In short, I loved this film for its differences and execution to near perfection!9/10 should sufficiently display my enjoyment of this film...NOW!

I was getting some Atlantis vibes at first but quickly swatted those away.Love the fact that it’s a Love story but not with two lovers. When the lady in the beginning (her mom, the elder,???...) says that love leaves you alone you can’t love blah blah blah, I thought “well oh shit I guess we know what this movie is...gonna be about, her meeting some dude and falling in love” The relationship Ariel and Maquia have is just sooo sooo sooo amazing.All the characters are fine FINE.I think what I liked most about this movie is the fact that we see the characters grow (age-wise and mentally); especially Ariel.So I’d say overall, it was really good. The only issue I had is that some parts and characters were kinda just.... put into the story in a half-assed kinda way and then played an “important” role.Ex- The dita, Dina girl idk her name: we see her ONCE, and it wasn’t even important. I mean, props to her for head butting the dude other than that she has nothing going for her and is virtually unimportant in my book.I’d have much rathered Ariel to have married a random girl than her.

One of the most satisfying feeling even if you do end up bawling by the end, it is so beautifully told. I won't review the movie too much, I think it deserves a watching and you can decide for yourself if you like it or not....I just hope that you know that at one point in time you were loved and right now in life too... you are loved. Just because we no longer have those people, they live in our memories and are a part of who we are today. You aren't a mistake, you have a purpose to live, whatever it is, don't give up and continue to shine as stars can only be seen when it's dark. So just because you're in a dark place, let your light shine and guide those who are lost now, because you've been there yourself.The time skips suck and ruin the pacing. This isn't even a controversial statement, most people don't like time skips in anime when they are done poorly. It's a storytelling device that lets us get from Point A to C without wasting time telling B. The implication when a time skip is done is that the audience has enough information to fill in the blanks. Time skip #1 is great because this is possible to do. #2 - 4 on the other hand are just confusing. Especially 3, where we go from Maquia being kidnapped by the royal guards, to Krim cutting her hair in some weird room (but wait I thought Krim died, what?). Oh, the kingdom is at war now I guess, cool, I don't know how that happened. It just comes across as they didn't have enough runtime to tell everything they wanted to tell (even with a 2-hour runtime). I understand why they wanted to have time skips at all, to show everyone around Maquia growing older. It's a cool idea but I've seen it done better before, if you are going to time skip, the story better be 100% coherent to let us fill in the blanks.Overall I give this a Solid 9.7/10 but i'll round it to a 10/10 I just hope that you know that at one point in time you were loved and right now in life too... you are loved.

One can easily tell that tons of love have been poured into the art, music and animation. Unfortunately the story and character development lack behind. I'm under the impression that the movie was trying too hard to push feelings into the viewers, and some moments work well and are endearing or sad, but some other just feel like being pressed to feel something. It's as if the movie was trying to tell too much without having a clear idea of how to do it. Probably over-ambitious.All in all is an enjoyable movie, but...not what I was expecting not what I was expecting"", ""I decided to watch this movie after a friend told me that it would make me sad. I really like sad, drama filled, emotional work (and I plan to watch Nana and Clannad next because I've heard they have plenty of that), so maybe I'm a little biased towards this movie, but I truly loved it and am happy that I watched it.Story - 8There were a bunch of aspects going on in the story and plot, and every part of this movie was done so nicely. It mainly follows the perspective of Maquia, an Iorph. Iorphs live way longer than humans do, and...live in a hidden utopia-type area hidden from the rest of the world. That is, until Maquia's homeland is attacked and she's left to fend for herself...and a newborn baby in a forest far away from what she's used to. It also focuses on Leilia and the boy Ariel.When I first read the synopsis, I was wondering if it would be good. It was. In my opinion, this movie was tied together perfectly, from beginning to end. It showed the bond of a mother and child, and how sacrificial and important love can be. The movie showed how hard it can be to love something, and how hard it can be to let it go. As my parents got divorced and now I mainly live with my mom, it put some light onto her and helped me understand how much she goes through just for me to be happy. All of the characters each had to go through their own struggles, and while a lot of their stories weren't covered completely, I feel like that adds on to the movie, because in reality, you don't know everyone's hardships, and how they get over them. I cried so much watching this movie. It was beautifully done in such a unique setting.Art - 9I personally really liked the art in this movie; it was simple yet mythical and beautiful at the same time. Sometimes it looked weird and oversimplified, but that's normal for anime. I loved it though. I loved the way all of the characters and creatures looked, how the sea and the world looked, how the villages looked; it was so pretty.Sound - 7Very pretty soundtrack. That's all I really can say.Characters - 9The characters were so fun to watch. All of them were very well written, especially Maquia and Ariel. I can't spoil anything for anybody, so I can't really say why I loved their development so much, but I think that Maquia is one of my favorite female characters that I have encountered in an anime. Aside from the technicalities, I loved the characters on their own. Their personalities and how they dealt with their hardships were all very likable and interesting to me.Enjoyment - 8(.5)The movie started off slow, and at parts I was confused. In addition to this, I wasn't as invested in Leilia's story so I took off a point there. However, I loved this movie.Overall - 8.5I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone. Everything about it was done wonderfully. live in a hidden utopia-type area hidden from the rest of the world.

I can't spoil anything for anybody, so I can't really say why I loved their development so much, but I think that Maquia is one of my favorite female characters that I have encountered in an anime. Aside from the technicalities, I loved the characters on their own. Their personalities and how they dealt with their hardships were all very likable and interesting to me.Enjoyment - 8(.5)The movie started off slow, and at parts I was confused.

Our main character, Maquia is one of that mysterious creature called Iorph which is basically just humans that can live for hundreds of years. the story revolves around Maquia trying her best to raise...her adoptive son that is a mere human while hiding her identity as an Iorph.the premise of the story itself is already very intriguing and once you watch the movie, you will know that it has way more than what it promised on the premise and the trailer. the story isn\'s just about maquia raising her adoptive son, we will also be given the story of the character around her that became victim of the stupid king who is abusing every magical and mysterious creature in the kingdom. we will also be given the story of how the kingdom that have been the strongest because of the power of magical creature that they have, fall just because they rely to much on that power.the characters\'s action and emotion also seems pretty realistic for me. maquia as a single mother wasn\'t always cheer and patient with her son, ariel, as her son is also wasn\'t always a sweet and obedient son. all the characters have their own unique flaws that makes them more ""human"". the drama is also pretty natural for me. nothing is over dramatized. more like everything is underdramatized. we don\'t see tears here and there each and every scene. but for me personally that is a plus point because that way, even though the characters are less loveable but they become more relatable as reality is not as dramatized as your regular drama show would be.this review might be pretty bias from me but i still think this movie is worth watching and i\'ll give it a solid 9 her adoptive son that is a mere human while hiding her identity as an Iorph.the premise of the story itself is already very intriguing and once you watch the movie, you will know that it has way more than what it promised on the premise and the trailer. the story isn\'s just about maquia raising her adoptive son, we will also be given the story of the character around her that became victim of the stupid king who is abusing every magical and mysterious creature in the kingdom. we will also be given the story of how the kingdom that have been the strongest because of the power of magical creature that they have, fall just because they rely to much on that power.the characters\'s action and emotion also seems pretty realistic for me. maquia as a single mother wasn\'t always cheer and patient with her son, ariel, as her son is also wasn\'t always a sweet and obedient son. all the characters have their own unique flaws that makes them more ""human"". the drama is also pretty natural for me. nothing is over dramatized. more like everything is underdramatized. we don\'t see tears here and there each and every scene. but for me personally that is a plus point because that way, even though the characters are less loveable but they become more relatable as reality is not as dramatized as your regular drama show would be.this review might be pretty bias from me but i still think this movie is worth watching and i\'ll give it a solid 9', 'I have no idea what everyone is praising this movie for.

There is too much flirting with incest for me to ignore, which is horrible and uncomfortable, and there is an odd fascination with rape.

But i will warn you before telling spoilers.Maquia starts with a really calming atmosphere. With its wonderful animation and colors you will be atracted by it so quickly. And the story also goes on like that. Even if the story-telling is kind of slow, its so beautiful that you watch it with a smile on your face.The world, the interactions of the characters and how they are not forced at all but so true, all of them make you love the anime.But there was one point when i kind...of felt lost. I guess it was around 1 hours and 20 minutes after the movie started. The story started to feel so rushed. Even if the rest of the movie was really emotional, i couldnt really feel that. Maybe i liked the first 1 hour and 20 minutes really much that i had really big expectations from its ending too.I mean i still liked it and kind of felt the emotions but it didnt live up to my expectations.Also there were some points which were left unexplained.*Contains spoiler after this point*Like was Maquia really pregnant? If she was, from who? Some people thought she was pregnant from the prince but did the royal family really managed to kidnap maquia? Lang told Ariel that the royal family was searching for Maquia but he never talked about them managing to capture her. Also if they managed to kidnap her, how could she escape from the castle after getting pregnant.I dont think she was kidnapped by the royal family but instead maybe the other people from Iorph took her with them ? But if thats the case how did she get pregnant ??? Maybe it was some kind of a metaphor but they never explained it. If it was a metaphor what was it about ? If she was really pregnant again the same questions... Also what happened to the baby? Maquia would care about her baby a lot like she did for Ariel. But nothing was shown about it.The other thing that bothered me was Leila\'s behaviours...She thought about her child a lot and wanted to see her a lot but then left her without even talking with her... She just saw her and went away.Then medmel said ""oh my mother is a beautiful person...""Why would she think something like that? Her mother just left her after smiling to her for a second.To sum up the events that happened during the war felt so rushed and some felt so nonsense.I also couldnt understand Ariel\'s behaviours to his mom. Its really normal that he feels so complicated but i felt so angry towards him because of not really keeping his promise. He didnt really need to protect her but he should have been by her side. At least till he married to Dita. The conversation between Land and Ariel kind of made me forget my anger but still i felt disappointed.The ending was beautiful againBut because of the nonsense things that happened before the ending i couldnt enjoyed it fully.Still i want to give 8 out of 10 because of the first 1 hour and 20 minutes and because of the last 5 minutes.*No more spoilers after this point*I think this anime could have been much better.

I can definitely understand why people give the movie an 8. But, for me the main theme is focused on a bit too heavily. The Art ist veeeery beautiful and was the main reason why I picked up the movie. The fantasy setting is interesting. The story is alright, not too surprising. The first and especially the last quarters are my favorite parts. As for the soundtrack nothing particular stuck out to me. I...will relisten to the ED though. This is one of the few works I have seen where even I realized there is great character development. 7/10 overall. will relisten to the ED though.

I was hoping to compare this movie to the emotional impact that A Silent Voice and Your Name had on me, but it just didn't hold up as well.  I'm going to go over what I liked and the things I thought hurt this movie.Art/animation: 9/10.  Beautiful looking.  I would give this a 10/10 if the character design itself was a little better.  The character design isn't bad, it's just not distinct.  If nothing else though,...this movie looks gorgeous.  Fantastic scenery.Sound: 7/10 Nothing super special, but well fitting for the emotional scenes and overall worked well.  It's not a soundtrack that will stand out too much, but it does its job better than average.Character: 6/10 Ariel is my favorite character and I felt his personality more than the others, but overall the characters felt impersonal to me.  Some characters like Krim just didn't have enough screen time to really have any impact at all Maquia herself is good main character who does show some development over the movie, but never became as memorable as I thought she would.Story:  9/10  I thought the story itself had enormous potential.  Unique enough to grab your attention and make you want to watch it.  The time skips, which I will get to at the end of the review, were kind of choppy but time itself is important to some of the themes in this movie.  Overall great story.Overall/Enjoyment/Discussion: 7/10  Ok so here's where I want to really talk about this movie.  As I stated I thought the story itself was great, but the execution suffered.  The time skips I mentioned above were very choppy.  They would just kind of happen.  I would be watching and Ariel would now be older and I would just think oh ok I guess they time skipped.  This happens numerous times without warning and I understand that the flow of time compared to lorphs like Maquia has to be presented somehow, but to me it just didn't feel cohesive.  Compared to the time skip in A Silent Voice that felt like it belonged perfectly when it happened the skips in Maquia felt random.  I don't want to spoil anything for anyone because I do think this movie is worth watching, but explanations in this movie seem almost non-existent at times as is the case with the dragons called Renato (which looked amazing by the way).  My guess is that the dragons are more symbolic than anything, but more of an explanation on what exactly they were would have also been nice.  The last 5-10 minutes of this movie I will say were extremely well done though.  It ties the emotional aspect of motherhood and the flow of time together very nicely.  Again I did enjoy this movie, but overall it just didn't have the same impact on me as other emotional anime films have.  Absolutely worth the watch though and conceptually this movie is a 10/10.

The art and music were gorgeous and the story was intriguing to say the least. However it definitely fell short in a few areas that were vital and therefore earned a lower score from me.Story: The story for Sayonara no Asa was original, intriguing, and unique. However, there were quite a few moments throughout the movie that felt disjointed and awkward. I\'m not sure if it was a pacing problem, but perhaps this story could have been executed better in the series format rather than a movie. There were also a lot of scenes that had little to...no explanation, and left me as a viewer with questions that were never addressed or answered, which was very frustrating.Art: This is where Sayonara no Asa really, really excelled. The art was absolutely gorgeous! Particularly the scenery, which was as beautiful as a painting and such a joy to look at. The character designs were fitting for the mood of the story, from the colors to the wide shots, everything looked amazing.Sound: The music was beautiful and fitting for the movie, and while it was a soundtrack I wouldn\'t necessarily want to download, it was perfectly suited and moving in all the right places. However, I had to take an additional point off for that one awful ""mama"" moment (you\'ll know what I\'m talking about when you watch it, it\'s hard to miss).Character: This category also fell short for me. I feel that there was a lot of character development missing from most of the main characters. The other Iorphs felt half-formed, and even Ariel could have used more character development. The one character that felt fully fleshed out was Makia (which is how her name should have been spelled).Because of some of these faults, my enjoyment was probably a 7 out of 10.Overall, this is a beautiful movie, and was not at all what I expected. I think the best part of the movie was the care it took to show just how special mothers are - I loved how the story takes care to show how hard it can be to be a mother, and how amazing that person can be in your life.

That being said, the plot isn\'t airtight. It starts off well, but towards the end some of the threads start to fray. To get to the end of the story a number of things are glossed over, without going too far into spoiler territory, in the last act main character Maquia finds herself in a situation that REALLY deserved more screen time than it got and should have affected the plot and other characters...far more than it did, particularly Ariel, but it was scarcely touched on.

This question becomes the emotional crux of the story as Maquia cannot forever avoid the fact that she will outlive her adopted son by centuries.

Since everything having a note below that has a lack of professionalism or flaws breaking the viewing experience.Since there are many long reviews, I will make mine really short.I will start with the conclusion: Maquia was a great movie overall and I think anyone will find some aspects to their liking while watching this movie... but I would also say that even if there were two or three touching moments in this movie, it is far from beeing a masterpiece.For me, this movie...is like a huge wasted potential. It had the visuals, which are astounding at some moments... and average with 3D CGI at others... and a world creation giving the opportunity to build a story on myths and legends. They had so many opportunities to create symbolism with what they had... and they unfortunately made a story which had a hard time following itself.There are so many things happening in this movie, that even the story got lost in the middle of it, not knowing where to continue.The beginning of the movie was great, but the pacing came out of hand, giving not enough time for the character development to be done properly. There was so much potential to get us to like the characters even more... but in the end, there were only two really touching scenes in the movie.For me, the movie has wasted a big amount of its potential. But even with that, it is still a beautiful movie, which is worth watching. Don\'t expect a masterpiece, since there are plotholes (and a bit of 3D CGI).Overall, I rate it as a 8 out of 10... wait, let me reformulate.I rate it as ONLY 8 OUT OF 10!!!!!!!!Did you notice the ONLY ?! That\'s because it could have been so much more. For me this movie is ONLY a good movie, not a great one... and even less a masterpiece.This review could sound quite negative, but it was a pleasure to see ""Sayonara no Asa ni Yakusoku no Hana wo Kazarou"" and I recommend that you watch it to make your own opinion. At least the visuals will not disappoint you.PS: Seems this review became long after all. is like a huge wasted potential.

It moves very, very quickly, however I believe that is intended to be that way.However despite this the movie was very good in terms of the art and sound design. It's very pretty to look at, and has almost a calming sense, but if the mood shifts, the creators knew how to shift everything to match what was being told.The characters in this could have used more exploration. The two main focuses of the movie had everything they needed, however even they felt slightly rushed, though this is mainly...due to only having 2 hours to explore them.Honestly I would say that most people would enjoy this movie overall. The main reason I loved it so much was because it opened my eyes to seeing from my own mother's perspective, both in the present and in the past tense. It made me realize how deep that connection between us is and brought me to tears when I realized it.This movie is a story about a mother trying her best to raise her son to have the best life he can. In this regard the movie gets a solid recommendation from myself. due to only having 2 hours to explore them.Honestly I would say that most people would enjoy this movie overall.

Mari Okada has done a commendable job on her directorial debut. With a little less than two hours she's made me feel like I traveled through someone's entire life, The movie has that impact on me. A fresh take on love and in this case, A Mother's love. The animation is gorgeous, The music is great. Very impressed with some of the character development. The fantasy ideas and concepts are simple but creative and well done. The journey of Maquia and Ariel is something that is both...poetic and epic, A journey that takes you thorough time, love, loss, pain, fear and everything else that connects it and comes along with it. Definitely recommend to give this a try. poetic and epic, A journey that takes you thorough time, love, loss, pain, fear and everything else that connects it and comes along with it.

If Maquia loved Ariel so much, and vice versa, and they made up at the end of the battle, why did she leave him for ~60 years? It doesn't make sense that she wouldn't want to spend time with her family. Plus, why did Leilia just leave her daughter and say she'll forget about her, if she so desperately wanted a connection with her? The ending was obviously contrived in order to make it a tearjerker. Which is a puzzling choice, because they still could have had the exact same ending with Ariel's...death after a long life spent with Maquia, and I believe that would have had the same effect as a tearjerker.I'm conflicted on the score. The movie was a beautiful showcase of life, love, family, and the inevitability of time marching on from the unique perspective of an unaging being. I want to give it a 9 for that, but the ending annoys me enough to make me want to give it an 8. I guess I'll give in and give it a 9, for what it was trying to be and how beautiful it was before the ending.As a side note, the art and sound are masterpiece level. death after a long life spent with Maquia, and I believe that would have had the same effect as a tearjerker.I'm conflicted on the score.

The anime that no matter what, you always come back and it feels like nothing's changed, the feelings are there like the first time you experienced it. Maquia is that anime.

With AnoHana, Kokoro ga Sakebitagatterunda, Sakura-sou, True Tears (quite literally so, lol) as series she has had a significant role to play in, I went into to Maquia perhaps expecting a little too much.So what if it didn\'t match up to AnoHana? So what if it wasn\'t as grounded as True Tears? She just had to swing her magic wand and make the feels hit me in the chest....And so, arming the critic in me with a generous amount of slack she truly deserves, I put on SayoAsa hoping to be blown away.My bad.It goes without saying that a movie this well-made comes with its holy shit moments. The moments where the cityscapes are revealed (God knows how those large waterwheels were assembled in the first place, but I don\'t care, they look amazing), and the lush landscapes of the kingdom of Mezarte are enough to make my eyes believe they were watching a masterpiece.The calm, despaired lives of the Iorph as they went about their existences was a spectacle, but you peek behind the shiny curtain and it just reveals a very hollow interior.This movie does not suffer from an excess of exposition, far from it. What it suffers from is the sheer inconsistency of it.Minutes of monologue spent gushing about Hibiol (some cloth they weave and can read as some kind of ancient recording device), and how maintaining their distance from the shorter-lived human race was the best option to avoid self-suffering. Minutes I spent subconsciously searching for my phone to pass the time, even though I make it a point not to by keeping it in a different room.Why does it matter? Why do I care? Why am I supposed to give a damn?Nothing.On the other hand, it tries so hard to show us the mother-son duo that the majority of the supporting cast is left completely blank, one-trick ponies with no past and no future, present merely to deliver their appropriate pieces of dialogue and then leave.It tries so hard to show us Maquia and Ariel\'s lives in a sequence of isolated incidents that it forgets to add in any explanations for the multiple, sometimes years-long time skips that mainly leave you confused. Why bother with explaining the irrelevant bits, taking precious feature-film runtime away from the actual story?Slowly, with one random swerve after another, the movie hacked away at my patience. I have never treated my monitor as something to be yelled at before. But the entirely random interactions with Krim and Leilia and their entire quest to save her from the prince who raped her triggered me.I want to feel something for Leilia. For Krim. For their loneliness and alienation. But I goddamn cannot because the movie simply does not give me a reason to.Even though this runs the risk of oversimplification, I feel the entire movie can be condensed into:""Iorph live longer than people who live longer than dogs. Since the first two are sentient, it is sad for the Iorph to watch the humans die.""Suddenly, a war plot similar to Attack on Titan appears out of nowhere. Mezarte has been using epic large CGI birds with a random death timer to dominate their rivals, and not that those birds are almost extinct, they can retaliate with guns and manpower and conquer Mezarte itself. None of the warring parties are introduced, none of their casus bellis are revealed. Just sprinkled in for the sake of \'plot happens\'.There is plenty of suspension of disbelief in AnoHana as well. The entire \'Menma is a ghost\' premise is iffy at best, but it can be ignored as the character drama in the show is spectacular. Each of the kids is given a backstory, motivation, and a set of values that are in direct conflict with each other. We cry at the end because we feel empathy for those characters.Maquia tried. Oh, God it tried. The last half hour of the film was a masterpiece in its artwork, animation and soundtrack. But by then I had lost all semblance of interest in the characters. Sure, seeing Maquia visit Ariel on his deathbed was a scene that had immense potential, but because it had no legs to stand on, it fell short of what it could have achieved.Maybe it was the run length. Perhaps it could have done more with a 12-episode anime instead of a movie, but then financial constraints would have affected the quality of the art and music.

Moving on to Hanazaku Iroha.', '*this review contains spoilersThe beauty of Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms is that it attempts to launch multiple fireworks into the air at once, accidentally sets off its neighbor’s fire alarm, and kills someone, but if you keep your eyes fixed on that one spot in the sky where the fireworks are the brightest, you can realistically forget all about the burning building. In this analogy, the mother-child relationship that lies at the heart of this film is that one exceptionally beautiful firework. Everything else is on fire.Maquia and Ariel’s relationship is a treat to watch develop over the course of the film. It’s...uncertain, tricky, and filled with emotional outbursts by teenagers who don’t know where to direct all their pubescent angst, things which have haunted parent-child relationships across the history of mankind itself. The film doesn’t shy away from the unpleasantries that come with parenthood. Neither does it treat Ariel, who spends a solid third of the film as a skinny brat (and later becomes a taller skinny brat), as a one-dimensional Child Character. It’s clear that they matter, not only to each other, but also to the staff behind the film. This, for me, is Maquia’s high point. That it manages to follow one (1) boy and his mother throughout most of the boy’s life, and emerges with a coherent, sympathetic narrative that speaks to the deeply human desire to love, and the equally strong fear of the loss of it.Unfortunately, There’s More. Enter Krim and Leilia, the useless royal family, Leilia’s daughter, and Izo the guard guy. I acknowledge that these characters and their stories are all, presumably, not the main focus of the story. But given that the entire film is less than two hours long, I think it’s fair to regard anything included in its brief runtime with a discerning eye. With that in mind, the film opens with Maquia’s people and their homeland being viciously invaded by the king’s men. The women are taken, their land is ripped apart, and Maquia, displaced from home, understands immediately that it’s no longer a place that she can return to. This bears a striking similarity to colonial activity in the twentieth century and earlier, but regardless, what we want to acknowledge here is the ruthlessness of it all. A greater military power waltzing unannounced into someone’s home, killing their ruler (the Elder, presumed dead), taking their women, and leaving everyone else to die.It sucks. It sucks for Maquia, Leilia, and Krim, whose stories we follow to varying degrees throughout the film. Leilia gets put up with a prince who thinks she’s a monster, has his kid, isn’t allowed to meet said kid, and finally loses the prince’s acknowledgment, the one thing that brought her to the castle. Maquia picks up a kid. Krim tries to save Leilia, fails, tries again, fails again, and joins up with a neighboring kingdom. To put it more bluntly, he is radicalized. The difference between a revolutionary and a rebel lies in the nature of the current government itself, and here, I believe it’s quite clearly established that the existing government is shit. The king is a spineless brute who keeps women, mythical creatures, and mythical women locked up in a cage. His son is no better. When the enemy strikes, both of them run, and they leave their child behind. Even before that, they destroy a people, kidnap and impregnate a woman against her will, and prevent her from meeting with that child. It seems to me that this particular monarchy possesses no merit whatsoever. Regardless of how sweet the prince might have been (he isn’t), the Iorph have every reason to hate him.And yet Krim is reduced to the archetypical ‘I got so fixated on revenge I lost sight of what truly mattered’ character who, unable to bear the thought of the love of his life caring about her only connection with the world for years and years, tries to kill her. And is killed by the head of the king’s guard. Who saves Leilia. And who has also kept Leilia locked up for years, and years, and years, and done nothing to help her.At a glance, this is what Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms seems to be saying: if someone destroys everything you’ve ever had, you’re not allowed to hate them because that would make you the bad guy. In spite of everything someone might have done to make you miserable for decades, they actually want the best for you. Loyalty to the king is a great thing, even if that king’s a piece of shit.So I take issue with all of the above, for reasons that I hope are obvious. Presented with an interesting premise full of potentially complex characters, Maquia went for the black and white morality angle and reduced everything to a zero-sum problem because it wanted to talk about Maquia and Ariel’s relationship which, again, is quite a stunning piece of character work, so my question is: why try to talk about everything else to begin with? Why not do one thing well, and flesh out the characters more while you’re at it, because if asked to describe the cast of this film I’d say that everyone tries their best and cares a lot and really, that’s about it. Time devoted to a clown of a king and the invasion of a kingdom which I as a viewer had no sympathy for could have been spent on little moments between Maquia and the rest of the cast. Why did Ariel fight for this king? Is the only way to protect the ones you love by working within a corrupt system? Do all rebels and revolutionaries deserve to die?The above are my grievances with this story. Those aside, this film is literally beautiful. The lighting, background work, and color palettes are a mirror’s reflection of the tone at any given point, the soundtrack is lovely, and the voice actors are marvelous. If you’re looking to kill time and you happen to like cool colors, I can confidently present you with this movie. But as far as thoughtful commentaries on the complexities of life, society, et cetera go, I’d like to gently place my hands on your shoulders as does a parent to their child, and steer you in another direction.6/10 uncertain, tricky, and filled with emotional outbursts by teenagers who don’t know where to direct all their pubescent angst, things which have haunted parent-child relationships across the history of mankind itself.

The women are taken, their land is ripped apart, and Maquia, displaced from home, understands immediately that it’s no longer a place that she can return to. This bears a striking similarity to colonial activity in the twentieth century and earlier, but regardless, what we want to acknowledge here is the ruthlessness of it all. A greater military power waltzing unannounced into someone’s home, killing their ruler (the Elder, presumed dead), taking their women, and leaving everyone else to die.It sucks. It sucks for Maquia, Leilia, and Krim, whose stories we follow to varying degrees throughout the film. Leilia gets put up with a prince who thinks she’s a monster, has his kid, isn’t allowed to meet said kid, and finally loses the prince’s acknowledgment, the one thing that brought her to the castle. Maquia picks up a kid. Krim tries to save Leilia, fails, tries again, fails again, and joins up with a neighboring kingdom. To put it more bluntly, he is radicalized. The difference between a revolutionary and a rebel lies in the nature of the current government itself, and here, I believe it’s quite clearly established that the existing government is shit. The king is a spineless brute who keeps women, mythical creatures, and mythical women locked up in a cage. His son is no better. When the enemy strikes, both of them run, and they leave their child behind. Even before that, they destroy a people, kidnap and impregnate a woman against her will, and prevent her from meeting with that child. It seems to me that this particular monarchy possesses no merit whatsoever. Regardless of how sweet the prince might have been (he isn’t), the Iorph have every reason to hate him.And yet Krim is reduced to the archetypical ‘I got so fixated on revenge I lost sight of what truly mattered’ character who, unable to bear the thought of the love of his life caring about her only connection with the world for years and years, tries to kill her. And is killed by the head of the king’s guard. Who saves Leilia. And who has also kept Leilia locked up for years, and years, and years, and done nothing to help her.At a glance, this is what Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms seems to be saying: if someone destroys everything you’ve ever had, you’re not allowed to hate them because that would make you the bad guy. In spite of everything someone might have done to make you miserable for decades, they actually want the best for you. Loyalty to the king is a great thing, even if that king’s a piece of shit.So I take issue with all of the above, for reasons that I hope are obvious. Presented with an interesting premise full of potentially complex characters, Maquia went for the black and white morality angle and reduced everything to a zero-sum problem because it wanted to talk about Maquia and Ariel’s relationship which, again, is quite a stunning piece of character work, so my question is: why try to talk about everything else to begin with? Why not do one thing well, and flesh out the characters more while you’re at it, because if asked to describe the cast of this film I’d say that everyone tries their best and cares a lot and really, that’s about it. Time devoted to a clown of a king and the invasion of a kingdom which I as a viewer had no sympathy for could have been spent on little moments between Maquia and the rest of the cast. Why did Ariel fight for this king? Is the only way to protect the ones you love by working within a corrupt system? Do all rebels and revolutionaries deserve to die?The above are my grievances with this story. Those aside, this film is literally beautiful. The lighting, background work, and color palettes are a mirror’s reflection of the tone at any given point, the soundtrack is lovely, and the voice actors are marvelous. If you’re looking to kill time and you happen to like cool colors, I can confidently present you with this movie. But as far as thoughtful commentaries on the complexities of life, society, et cetera go, I’d like to gently place my hands on your shoulders as does a parent to their child, and steer you in another direction.6/10', ""This movie was incredibly moving to me and completely shifted my viewpoint on motherhood and what it means to raise a child and be a child. I can't recommend this movie enough to everyone; no matter who you are this movie is worth watching! There may be some discrepancies in the film, but it's easy to overlook them in favor of the overall picture it paints for the viewer. I have cried over this movie every time I've watched it, which is many times by now and will be many more times in the future. Sincerely, this film touches the heart and tells a wonderful,...meaningful story that deserves to be seen the world over! meaningful story that deserves to be seen the world over!"", '[OVERVIEW; NO SPOILERS AHEAD]While this movie has clear issues (in terms of plotholes), I am not surprised to so many viewers moved by the message and overall package that this film shares with its audience. If you are like me and are a big fan of non-isekai fantasy settings, you\'ll likely be impressed with the world-building that this two hour film manages to accomplish. Now, of course it isn\'t perfect and it leaves a lot to be desired, however this movie clearly knows what it wants to be.What do I mean by this? Well, for starters the story opens up with a very common trope...found in the fantasy genre: the ""protagonist\'s"" peaceful home or village is assaulted and destroyed by the ""bad guys,"" which causes the protag to flee for their life. However, unlike most fantasy stories that focus on the protag getting revenge for that awful event and teaching the world about the villain\'s evil deeds, this story does none of that. Instead, our ""hero"" is a teenage girl who flees persecution, immediately becomes an adoptive mother, and simply tries to live in peace with her new son despite owning nothing. There is no retribution, no feelings of hatred, no blaming those around her. There is just life.That concept may not appeal to some, as in many ways Maquia comes across as a passive protagonist who accepts her fate. That being said, while she does not have the power to avenge her fellow Iorph, she devotes herself to protecting what she can. The beautiful yet difficult dynamic between the mother and son is undoubtedly the main focus of the movie, and the world building (including their dire circumstances) work around and with this precious core concept. The various time skips allow us to experience the full course of their lives, and the emotionally charged scenes culminate wonderfully in the final acts. Sometimes time skips too much between segments, and the viewer is left scrambling to piece together context clues, but overall it is a smooth transition in the grand scheme of things. The various side characters that the two leads encounter manage to find their role neatly in later arcs, giving the viewer a sense that the story is well fleshed out and easy to immerse oneself in.[NITPICKY CRITIQUES; MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD]Now, with all this praise comes critique about the ""bad"" parts of this film. Most if not all issues stem from the side characters, particularly the decision to include Barlow. I don\'t particularly dislike his character; I just think his presence complicates the narrative unnecessarily while adding very little to it. Firstly, the fact that he is half-Iorph leads to confusion as to why Leila\'s daughter (Medmel) with the prince is effectively disowned because she did not inherit the longevity of her mother. Barlow did however, meaning that it is possible to inherit it with only one Iorph parent. As for why Medmel did not, it is not addressed at all. It may seem like a minor point, however this plothole harms Leila\'s and Krim\'s entire portion of the story (which is sizable) because too many questions arise of this awkward situation, and it takes focus away from the main story line. Barlow also makes a comment at the very end to Maquia about ""seeing other people she would have to say goodbye to as well,"" leaving a sour implication that she was living a double life and that her relationship with her son Ariel was not as significant to her as the movie seems to suggest. Again, a one-liner that adds little to the scene but damages a lot in terms of the movie\'s buildup. Go away Barlow.[CONCLUSIONS; NO SPOILERS AHEAD]I believe this is a must-see movie because 1) good non-isekai fantasy anime is unfortunately very rare, 2) the mother-son dynamic is a well told story that is likely a tear-jerker for most audiences, and 3) it remains a very unique movie/anime in terms of what themes and tropes it chooses to focus on, and what tropes to ignore completely in an artful way. I also firmly believe that this is a type of experience that you will never be able to replicate elsewhere, simply because of its unique composition and its style of writing. Hope you enjoy it, and call your mother to thank her if you are able. found in the fantasy genre: the ""protagonist\'s"" peaceful home or village is assaulted and destroyed by the ""bad guys,"" which causes the protag to flee for their life.

Yes.*Minor Spoilers* TLDR at the bottom :)Sayoasa is a relatively decent movie with a pretty solid theme behind it. Maquia the main character is from a race of people who live to be hundreds of years old, and she finds a regular human baby, who she names Ariel, and decides to raise him by herself.

The sound design worked well, although the choice in music sometimes would give the wrong feeling for the movie, which, in turn, created false implications. However, there was a distinct gap between the aesthetic and the functions of the movie. First, the movie’s plot had many holes with regards to development of political conflicts, improperly introducing important players in the political sphere. The plot felt distracted from the mother/son dynamic in the sense that I wasn’t watching a movie with one central character, but...around three or four main characters, with no clear direction for the movie. The character development felt like an afterthought, where none of the characters seem to learn anything about love, about being a parent, about what protecting their families meant. The symbolism was rushed, either being too basic and spelled out for the audience, not truly integrated into the story, or it wasn’t developed enough to warrant being a symbol.Overall, this movie doesn’t warrant as excellent a score as it did, but it was cozy to watch, and though I found it confusing at times, it wasn’t god awful. 6/10 around three or four main characters, with no clear direction for the movie.

The concept of a mystical being that outlives humans but struggles to understand and relate to humans is becoming more common (think To Your Eternity and Frieren) and for good reason. By the very nature of the length which they live ample time is provided to flesh out their feelings/emotions. I think this is Maquia's biggest downfall.A movie setting doesn't provide time to do this. By its very nature, it takes this extremely long life and compresses it to essentially half of an anime season. World-building, character development, and the ability to...create relationships between viewer and characters all suffer because of this. I think this is why To You Eternity and Frieren are far superior than Maquia for me.Other points:The scenery/backdrops were out of this world. This is definitely one of Maquia's strong points. They knew this too I think which is why we're hit with a jaw-droppingly stunning view in the first seconds and the final seconds (post credits).I liked the world/setting. It allowed for political conflict and its natural extension--war--and it had fanciful fantasy elements which I love.I really enjoyed the soundtrack.Not sure what else to say honestly and I think that itself is a slight on the movie. Glad I watched it though I don't think I would recommend it to someone. 7/10 create relationships between viewer and characters all suffer because of this.

So, let\'s start, and this will be a very short review. It may contain some spoilers, so be warned.So, Maquia (Sayonara no Asa, or Sayoasa) is basically the same as reading a book, word by word: a book with pages and a cover delicatedly fabricated, which we have a beautiful story, an fresh and sweet atmosphere, great characters, and talking about something that will inspire a lot...of people, teaching so many amazing lessons, that we need to take to our entire lives. Full packed with emotions, tears, tears, and tears, and very few comic relief moments.Story:The movie was originally written by Mari Okada. AND NO!! She\'s not a underrated anime producer. And Okada already know: how to make some beautiful and tearjerker animes as well. She already produced animes like: AnoHana, NagiAsu, Hanasaku Iroha, Kiznaiver, The Anthem of the Heart, Black Butler, Sakurasou, True Tears, Toradora, Zetsuen no Tempest, and etc. So, this anime selection is very variated, in terms of genre, but when it comes to make a beautiful coming-of-age story, she\'s one of the masters. At the first sight, the story looks pretty simple. Firstly, we are introduced to the Iorph village, where the people that inhabite are known by living a lot of time without getting old. Thanks to an fabric produced by them called Hibiol. The story initially centers on three main characters: Leilia, an smiling princess; Krim, an confident guy; and Maquia, the Leilia\'s friend, and a very fearful girl, that cries in the most of times, to be feeling alone, without parents. Leilia and Krim are passing by very cute moments, determined to live a fairytale life. But one day, Iorph is attacked by the enemy nation, to steal the Hibiol, and specially take all the women to serve as slaves. The only one that escaped was Maquia, and in the middle of her escape, she found a baby in the arms of a mother, that died trying to protect him. Hiding her Iorph identity, Maquia decided to take care of the baby (which she called Ariel), to know more about the role of being a mother. Okay, simple right? But man, see this masterpiece, and you\'ll notice that\'s more than that. The story is very balanced. As I said at the top: it mixes action, everyday life, and emotional moments, everything to make the narration less generic as possible. The characters, the place and the moments are here to make everything being less bored. The story centers all the time on the relationship between mothers and daughters, but sometimes it moves you to another screen or something. Like we wanted to see more moments between Maquia and Ariel, but they sometimes simply puts you to another screen which shows Leilia or something. And the timeskips are another problem. But, to be honest, I won\'t definitely remove points for that. The story is presented by different angles, to deal with the main subject: the role of being a mother. I only saw Wolf Children (Ookami Kodomo) talking about that. But the story is still solid for me.Art:Ok, P.A Works already impressed me with Angel Beats (it\'s an 2010 anime, pretty old, but with a very gorgeous art). So, with Maquia, it couldn\'t be different. Yoshida Akihiko was the responsible for the art. He already produced the art of Final Fantasy games. And along with P.A Works, they impressed me again with a beautiful job on Sayoasa.  Beautiful backgrounds, and a very balanced CGI use. They used CGI on the Renatos (which are the dragons), and it fitted so perfectly. Sometimes, I\'m very doubtful about the 3D (or CGI) use on animes, Arifureta was the worst to be honest. But the CGI on Maquia was just simple, delicated and turns to a pretty thing. The character design is not that perfect, it looks simple at the first sight, due to the rounded heads, but very cute nonetheless. It kinda made me remember of Ghibli movies for some reason, but the art style is gorgeous. Rich in details, and with so many bright and vivid colors.Sound:Kenji Kawai produced the music btw. And I think it was so inspiring and deeply touching. Specially about the ending scene, which we have Maquia crying, with a very sad soundtrack at the background. And theOST (ending song - Viator) was simply cute, and it really fits with the main theme. I tried to find some references on the lyrics, but I couldn\'t. But the lyrics are just inspiring and sad touching as well. Like a lullaby song, beautiful piano and keyboard, with a hidden meaning.Characters:Like I said, this review may contain some spoilers, and here we are. So, I\'ll not coil too much with the characters, but i just want to highlight some questions. 1st: I was reading the reviews, and I saw some people giving 5 or 4, which I found kinda strange. They claimed that the characters are soulless and doesn\'t have too much screen time sometimes. I personally didn\'t find any problems with that. But, I need to admit: sometimes, the movie messed up with my head. Especially with the scene which Krim said that Maquia were pregnant due to her long hair. I didn\'t know if it\'s like a joke on Japan, or references to something, but I tried to ignore it, to don\'t lose my focus on the movie. I think I\'ll need to find some answers to it on the VN, because the movie was adapted of the 2 chapters of the light novel, so I\'m definitely need to check it out. Removing that, I simply can\'t understand the problems that some people tried to point. They probably slept in the middle of movie lmao because somethings were obvious. And something that I found kinda boring is that: sometimes, they talked about something, instead of showing the actual thing. I don\'t know if I was clear, but summing up: sometimes, they preferred to talk instead of showing somethings. The secondary characters, for me, weren\'t that well developed. I wish to see more screen time of Leilia, but as I said: it can have some minor flaws (as all the anime movies as well), but I still won\'t remove any points for that. An example: Kimi No Na Wa. Did you remember? Some scenes were kinda confusing, and I\'m still vaguely trying to understand the mountain scene (the encounter of Taki and Mitsuha). But, overall, I\'m still giving a 10/10 to this one, because it was a sweet and unforgettable romance story (that I\'ll keep forever), and it ended up emotionally, and leaving a big smile in the face at the same time. With Maquia, it was the same, but more understandable. Even Koe No Katachi has some flaws: the main deffect on this one was because, comparing to the manga (the original matterial), they just cutted a lot of scenes. But again, still a 10/10. Maquia exclusively focuses on the relationship between her and Ariel, and I\'m glad that, in the most of times, they don\'t throw off you to another screen.Overall:I wish to see more about Leilia of course, but still a great movie that I recommend to anyone. The characters definitely had a very paced development, and we could see a big evolution of Maquia. At the end, Ariel got old and died. Remember of what I said? Maquia live on Iorph: an village inhabited for people that live too much without getting old. So, they never experienced the death of someone, and Maquia was the first one. Ariel grew up, got his own family..... the time passed, and he got old, and died. So, with that, Maquia finally accepted the loss as a part of life, and obviously cried with that. The sentences ""I\'m sorry, but mommy\'s gonna break her promise"", or ""I\'m glad I loved Ariel. I\'m glad I loved"", or the last time that Ariel said Okasan can easily break with the heart of anyone. The ending scene was so memorable, and made me ugly cry so much. I already felt sad watching another animes like: Kimi No Na Wa, Koe No Katachi, AnoHana, Angel Beats, and etc. But this one was the saddest one. It taught some beautiful life lessons about family love: something irreplaceable, and I ended up the movie giving a huge hug in my mom. I watched along with her, and even if I was the only one that cried, I\'m glad I shed tears, because I love her so much. It really caused an overwhelming impact on me and her, and clearly balanced with some fantasy moments. Again, this is not a typical romance story, it\'s not a slice-of-life story, but it\'s something beyond that. Wolf Children 2.0. And I\'m very curious, because this was the movie that the awards forgot. I saw in Funimation and Crunchyroll at the ""best anime film"" category, but I found nothing, neither on the runners up. And I know: Makoto Shinkai, the creator of Your Name, saw the movie and said it was fantastic. And I can totally agree with that. Didn\'t found any major problems (as some people), but I\'m still recommending you to watch this movie, along with your mom. A movie that talk about so many delicated and mature subjects, and it will make you cry so much, with the last sentence: ""I\'m glad I loved Ariel. I\'m glad I loved"". At least, take a chance to Sayoasa, and you won\'t get disappointed.Thank you for reading until here! Show this movie to your mother, because family love is something that we need to take to our entire lives! Thank you! of people, teaching so many amazing lessons, that we need to take to our entire lives. Full packed with emotions, tears, tears, and tears, and very few comic relief moments.Story:The movie was originally written by Mari Okada. AND NO!! She\'s not a underrated anime producer. And Okada already know: how to make some beautiful and tearjerker animes as well. She already produced animes like: AnoHana, NagiAsu, Hanasaku Iroha, Kiznaiver, The Anthem of the Heart, Black Butler, Sakurasou, True Tears, Toradora, Zetsuen no Tempest, and etc. So, this anime selection is very variated, in terms of genre, but when it comes to make a beautiful coming-of-age story, she\'s one of the masters. At the first sight, the story looks pretty simple. Firstly, we are introduced to the Iorph village, where the people that inhabite are known by living a lot of time without getting old. Thanks to an fabric produced by them called Hibiol. The story initially centers on three main characters: Leilia, an smiling princess; Krim, an confident guy; and Maquia, the Leilia\'s friend, and a very fearful girl, that cries in the most of times, to be feeling alone, without parents. Leilia and Krim are passing by very cute moments, determined to live a fairytale life. But one day, Iorph is attacked by the enemy nation, to steal the Hibiol, and specially take all the women to serve as slaves. The only one that escaped was Maquia, and in the middle of her escape, she found a baby in the arms of a mother, that died trying to protect him. Hiding her Iorph identity, Maquia decided to take care of the baby (which she called Ariel), to know more about the role of being a mother. Okay, simple right?

It is deeply touching, and focuses on so many things like live, the love of a mother for her child, wars, getting old age, always in a way that reaches your heart.So far, this is one of my favorite movies, I will...always remember it as such.If I could give it higher than a 10/10, I would give it higher than 10/10. always remember it as such.If I could give it higher than a 10/10, I would give it higher than 10/10."", ""It's been a while since I've watched this, but I do remember crying like a little baby. Although that was the first time I think I've ever actually bawled because of a movie, I didn't just give this a 10 because I soaked my t-shirt with my tears of sadness and joy. I don't have anything to philosophical to say, other than the fact that I think the theme of motherly love and the eternal quality this anime possesses to be something I've found particularly beautiful, and this film moved me in its expression of these themes. The art was maybe the only thing I...was a bit iffy on at first, but it quickly grew on me as the movie progressed and I came to realize that it fits the essence of the story quite well. This movie helped remind me that its possible to actually become so emotionally attached to a fictional character that at the climax real tears can be shed. was a bit iffy on at first, but it quickly grew on me as the movie progressed and I came to realize that it fits the essence of the story quite well.

All of the pieces of this film are brilliant. The story is really nice and touching. I really liked the characters and the way they interacted. There are a lot of really nice moments, and interesting ideas. The art is beautiful and creative, particularly the architecture. The world building is kind of insane (in a good way). The ending was perfect, and the closing theme punctuated it all perfectly. That said, I could tell from about five minutes in that this was never going to...work as a standalone film, and my suspicions were only confirmed as I continued to watch.This film rarely ever felt like it had time to breath. A lot of the touching moments were undercut by the fact that I never had time to connect with a lot of the character. The film was filled with time skips, and I constantly found myself watching a montage or seeing a flashback or listening to exposition and thinking ""wow that sounds really cool. I want to see the characters going through that. It sounds like a really cool arc with a lot of cool ideas to flesh out. I want to watch that"". But alas instead of an arc, I got a time skip followed by a few sentences of exposition. It was honestly kind of disappointing.I thought that surely this must be some sort of adaptation of a manga or television series. But it really seems like its not, which actually kind of baffles me, because of the sheer amount of work that seems to have gone into the world building. This should not be a film. It should be a franchise.If this ever does get adapted into an television series or a manga, I will be very excited. I can honestly see it being one of my absolute favourites. But as it stands now, it just feels like a lot of wasted potential, which makes me kind of sad. I really want to see this story fleshed out. I really want to see this story get the treatment it deserves. But I know that it\'s usually mangas that get overly compressed film adaptations, not the other way around.Also, just one other minor nit pick. I find the dynamic range in the volume of this film really annoying. It had the same problem that Lord of the Rings has, in that I had to strain my ears to hear the quiet dialogue, only to have them shattered by a loud action scene. I know it probably sounds really cool in cinemas, but at home it\'s kind of annoying. Pretty minor issue though, and it was honestly fine for most of the film. It\'s more just a minor pet peeve of mine. Definitely not a reason to avoid watching the film. In fact please watch it. Then talk publicly about how it needs to be a franchise until someone listens.EDIT: Okay, so now that I\'ve said all that, it sounds like there might actually be a manga. Just one that isn\'t licensed in English. I don\'t know why it\'s not mentioned anywhere, but that is exciting to know. That said, my excitement is a quite hampered by the fact it seems to only be three volumes long (and it\'s apparently finished). I feel like it really needs to be close to the length of Fullmetal Alchemist to do it justice. But I\'ll definitely have to check it out.

This film was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen and I don't think I will ever forget it. Words can't do it justice and they can't describe the absolute ugly crying I was doing either. What's best about this movie is that it gave me a new perspective on life which sounds cheesy, but it made me realise how valuable a love between a mother and child can be. A mother lives for her child and would do anything for them and knowing Eriel...is loved like that, and I am loved like that made me break down crying honestly. It made me want to go hug my mum and thank her for always being there for me. I've never felt so much in such a short amount of time. My advice going into this would be not to pick it apart and just ride the emotional rollercoaster. So so beautiful. is loved like that, and I am loved like that made me break down crying honestly.

I went in without expectations, and you should too. Here is some info without spoilers:The setting-  Medieval fantasy, but at the end of its era. The running theme of this movie is ""generational shift."" The movie starts with knights, swords, dragons, and magic, but its right at the point in their history when industrialization is beginning to form. Magic and legends are fading out while muskets and canons are seen more as the movie...goes on. This is a metaphor for the themes of the story.The characters- Full of confusing emotions. Very likeable.There are some dark themes and implications, but there is not a grotesque focus on them.The art- Gorgeous. The lighting and detail is breathtaking.The story- About family, found-family, loss, fear, and a lot of sadness. Allow yourself to cry. If you have children (or have owned a pet for the duration of its life) this will hit a little harder.OVERALL: This could easily be a 10/10 for a lot of people. It probably deserves it. Definitely for the art. I enjoyed the experience but i wanted it to hit me harder. Those who can connect with the themes in the movie would get more out of it, but anyone can appreciate this film.

Beautifully narrated, emotional, tender and with an intense poetry perceptible in every single element of its stunning visual art, including in its delicate and nostalgic soundtrack.I also found the main characters very pleasant and genuine, with the story itself bringing to some inevitable moments of tears and sadness, while also giving at the same time a lesson about life and love which I really appreciated.Maquia in the end, is a little gem of Japanese animation which I easily recommend, especially...to those seeking for great heart-warming stories! Thanks for reading me! to those seeking for great heart-warming stories!

I expected some sort of conflict and separation of the clan, but I just can't say that I expected so much war and nothing else.Your heart has to go out to Makia and she struggles to raise a baby that is not her own or of her own race, something so out of personal responsibility and beliefs. Thankfully she had people around her that did help and when she was able to get established, Ariel had a fortunate home to go to for many...years. Unfortunately there came a Time, just like everywhere else and everybody's life, where you have to new things. This is a great depiction of life and the growth of Ariel and then his relation to Makia. It really is a heartbreaking story if you've had any sort of great fallout or trouble with one of your children.These are all great things, but the amount of war totally overshadows that relevance and importance. They struggle in a different time, which I get, but there still seems an overwhelming part of the story that leads to an underwhelming part of the story.

Unfortunately there came a Time, just like everywhere else and everybody's life, where you have to new things. This is a great depiction of life and the growth of Ariel and then his relation to Makia.

I do agree that the animation is beautiful and the ending may have had a little impact on the viewers.. but not for me. The story is beautifully expressed and animated. But I still don't get the point. To me its not bad neither good.Despite the mixed feelings i think for some people this is a masterpiece and for them it maybe so. To me it was rather disappointing, seeing such beautiful animation and a good concept.I think the story should have had more depth. "", 'This is a very poorly written film. It tries to emotionally pull you in, but a little bit of reflection will show just how empty of depth it is. Here are some questions that show how nonsensical the film is:1. If the Lorphan are so wise and have lived so long, then why didn\'t they have either a proper defense of the village or pass down any wisdom to their own people? Moreover, why is Maquia so unbelievably dumb about everything including being a parent? They seem clueless to the outside world and weak. None of the Lorphan seem particularly bright. Shouldn\'t they all be...wise from the accumulated Hibiol across all the ages?2. Why is a race of ancient dragons such cucks? It doesn\'t make sense for them to be tamed by a corrupt empire and repressing emotions. Ancient dragons would fight back and try to escape, and they seem clearly capable of it.3. Why does Leilia refuse to escape with the Lorphan? Because she wanted to see Medmel, her daughter. Leilia put up with a lot in solitary confinement, even seeing her own kindred murdered. Okay, then why does she try to immediately jump down right after she sees her daughter and then abandon her?  Why did she sacrifice so much to see her daughter and tell her to forget about her? It\'s completely senseless. Leila doesn\'t act like she is an elder of the clan.4. Why has there been no coup attempt on such a corrupt and stupid king? The chief of the guards seemed like he disagreed with his decrees, so why do they just unthinkedly follow such a short-sighted incompetent king? The way the politics plays out is unrealistic.Finally, I want to touch on what truly annoyed me about this film: the atmosphere of genociding an ancient race does not meld well with the irrational desire to raise an orphan not of your own race, which is also to the detriment of your own people\'s survival. Maquea could have just left Ariel with the other mother at the idyllic hut. Instead, she selflessly works for years to support Ariel who starts to develop ""incestuous"" feelings towards her (note, they\'re not biologically related so it\'s not technically incest but it is still awkward).The entire film is an awkward mess, full of characters repressing emotions, even the supposedly ancient and wise Lorphans. They seem to have no emotional regulation such as Leilla\'s acceptance of solitary confinement and Krim\'s insanity.Just reflecting on this gives a headache. It doesn\'t deserve such high praise. It\'s a senseless film that tries to emotionally pull you in, but the character motivations are poorly analyzed and there is next to no lore or world building. wise from the accumulated Hibiol across all the ages?2.
