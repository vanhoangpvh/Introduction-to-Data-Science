Works well as a recap or refresh episode after ""More Aggressive"".If new to this series, I recommend watching the OVA and two TV seasons before starting this - however, this movie works as an introductory piece as well.---Story: It actually feels much like an extended normal episode of Tamayura, and the longer airtime led to substantially more and higher-quality scenes and interactions between the cast. The relationships between the four main characters and the supporting cast remain the same as ever. It definitely has...not lost the trademark healing feeling.Art: What an amazing jump in quality! I was particularly surprised and impressed by the difference in the character designs, but every visual aspect has shown some improvement as well. That said, the gentle backgrounds and colors seen in the past ""Tamayura"" works has remained, which only serve to immerse the viewer in a gentle mood.Sound: Spot-on sound as expected of the franchise. Satou has a great knack at sound direction in both Aria and Tamayura, and it shows. The voice actors remain vibrant and gentle, and their familiarity with the characters shows in their delivery.Character: Although far from unique, the four main characters interact with each other brilliantly as always. None of the characters seem out of place or lack airtime. The supporting cast holds the main characters up as well, and they do not seem discarded or forgotten. It has been like this since the very beginning, and it\'s great that this has not been lost even with the amount of character development every main and some regular supporting characters have undergone.Enjoyment: Trademark ""healing"" anime feeling, an incredibly refreshing watch after a long day. The extended time only adds space for the producers to fill in the atmosphere and further immerse the viewer in a relaxing, warm, gentle feeling that has been this series\' strong point for its entire run.Overall/Remarks: Fans of ""Aria"" and ""Tamayura"" cannot be disappointed with this great addition to ""healing"" anime, and it can only get better from here! not lost the trademark healing feeling.Art: What an amazing jump in quality!

Soukyuu no Fafner: Dead Aggressor - Exodus Part 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30549/Soukyuu_no_Fafner__Dead_Aggressor_-_Exodus_Part_2,"['I definitely have a soft spot for this series, so I can\'t vouch for the objectivity of my review, but it is definitely vastly underrated on MAL (it deserves at least an 8), and I just finished this series and need somewhere to vent all my feels right now. This review is for both the first and second season of Fafner Exodus. I\'ll try to be as vague as possible so as not to spoil anything, but some things I refer to will give you a sense of what happens in the anime.Story: 10/10Ok, so I should probably be giving this an 8 or a...9... but my bias won\'t allow me to give anything about this series lower than a 10 :\'D The plot is definitely really complex, and you need to know very well what\'s happened in the previous season + movie (I watched the original series + movie again back in the spring and still had some trouble following along). Oh, and as an added bonus you should watch Right & Left as well, it definitely will help you understand certain dimensions of this show (although it\'s not necessary for the main plot). The story follows the pilots of Tatsumiyajima Island as they pull themselves out of isolation and join the larger scale war/peace negotiations with the Festum. There are definitely multiple storylines going on at once, mainly the Island arc and the ""world"" arc, and I really enjoyed the way they split up the time and episodes devoted to each arc. I only wish they had more episodes to develop what the outside world was: with 26 previous episodes and a movie devoted to the island, I really had a good sense of what it was but in terms of world-building I had to take a lot of what they presented at face value when concerned with the world outside of the island (there were points where things felt flimsy and on the verge of collapsing, but I put my trust in the creators). They do pull some lame stuff during the second half of the second season (as well as some really cool stuff though), but since it\'s Fafner I forgive it.... Towards the end thought it really returns to its roots and is reminiscent of the first series of Fafner, and it\'s amazing because you not only see how the characters have changed/matured over time, but how you yourself have changed/matured as well throughout the years, or throughout your time with this series. This series uses the power of ""variation on a theme"" to great effect, and I feel so full of appreciation just thinking about it.With the time they had for the story they needed to tell, though, I thought it was well organized and structured and logically presented, to great emotional effect. So good story, but it would have been even better with a lot more episodes.Art: 10/10I for one love the art style of the original Fafner, and it is only enhanced here. The characters look great, but I think the art definitely shines with the mechs and the scenery, especially the island scenery and ocean waves. The integration of 3D and 2D is brilliant and seamless (the mechs and the island look amazing!!!!) Cinematography and storyboarding was absolutely stunning at times, and there were many instances, especially towards the middle of the series, where I was watching episodes while making an ((:O face the entire time. One thing I really love is how they utilize time of day to their advantage, with battles often taking place during sunset on the island, it really gives an eerie and foreboding atmosphere as if an apocalypse was coming (The orange of the sun, reflected on the ocean and the sky. as well as complementing the golden festum colors...) Basically, the art is original Fafner on steroids, and major majorly improved. You still feel like you\'re in the same world, but it just looks so much more beautiful now.In terms of character design, I actually really like the new Festums (they look creepier and crazier than ever haha). Some human characters can get a bit hard to tell apart, and I always was really confused with what they did with Nishio Rina\'s character (it\'s like she did a full 180 between the first season and the movie, and then her haircut makes her look like a totally different person). The mech design are really cool though, and they look amazing doing all their fancy tricks and shot from all kinds of angles in Exodus.Sound: 10/10The soundtrack is absolutely brilliant and really helps to sweep you away with your feelings. We have classical music (I heard Chopin\'s Winter Wind Etude at one point, and some Baroque sounding pieces), and we have the addition of choral music at some points as well :D The opening and ending songs for both seasons are absolutely amazing and very fitting. Especially the second season, it\'s definitely on full throttle as we have some chanting/choral-esque music mixed in with the rock qualities of angela\'s songs, which makes for very epic sounding OP and ED indeed (which is somewhat reminiscent of Shingeki no Kyojin\'s OP hehe) On an aside, I just wish the series could have delivered on some of the epicness they showed in the last ending song (you never do get to see them wearing those coats :/)Character: 11/10The characters and character relationships are definitely the driving point of this series and they continue to deliver in Exodus. Unfortunately due to the complex plot there were times where there wasn\'t as much character development as I would\'ve liked (not as much as in the previous series unfortunately), but everything there was was absolutely precious. The character development is where this series really shines so it\'s unfortunate that they weren\'t able to incorporate more. A lot of new characters were introduced, and while the new Island characters were introduced and developed magnificently (they seem to know just the right things you need to know about the characters in order to feel connected with them), I definitely would\'ve loved to see more development with the Neo UN, Human Army, etc characters (Mitsuhiro Bartland especially). However, the series really continues to develop some of the old cast, endearing yourself to them (Canon, Seri, and Akira are notable mentions, and in terms of new characters I have to say I absolutely love Orihime and her precocious tsundere-ness!!) Unfortunately, Kazuki and Soushi don\'t get much development (I would even venture to say they don\'t get much air time), but given how much the series has focused on them for the past 26 episodes + movie I\'d say that it\'s understandable haha...I think what I really love about this series and find very progressive about it is the cast with pretty much an equal amount of female and male characters and the development of same-sex relationships between both female and male casts (I find them open to interpretation: platonic, romantic, or otherwise, whatever floats your boat!). Both females and males are presented as complex, multi-dimensional characters with their own strengths and weaknesses. Females can fight just as well as the males, and males have just as many emotional struggles as the females. We really get to see all characters as human beings (and some perhaps partial humans as human lol) (perhaps the non-islanders get less development and are a little less multi-dimensional, but the islanders are definitely very well fleshed out), and no one is one-dimensional or just there as a piece of meat fanservice. As for the relationships: wow. I can\'t comment enough about how endearing what they\'ve presented is to me. The continued development of the somewhat circular relationship between Soushi-Kazuki-Maya, Seri-Orihime, Akira-Hiroto, Kaburagi and his family, Mimika-Reo, and Canon\'s inner conflict are what comes to mind at the moment. I think each one presented at least one tearful moment to me, or a moment where I really felt touched. I really love what they\'ve done with Maya\'s character as well and only wish I could\'ve seen more (I definitely think she could\'ve used a lot more character development, but they seem to have chosen to focus more on others instead, probably since she\'s already received quite a bit as well, being third to Soushi and Kazuki in terms of importance). I think the creators have definitely improved a lot in terms of character development (or understanding of human inner conflicts?) and their ability to portray very relatable emotions to viewers. I should probably stop now since I can go on forever about this haha.Enjoyment: 11/10This series isn\'t just for entertainment, it\'s really a work of art which I feel extremely grateful to have encountered and experienced (thank you brother for introducing it to me!). It\'s something that, if you take it seriously, pay attention (they make every second count, so pay attention closely), and think about it, can change you for the better. Watching it I just feel so many feelings which a lot I don\'t understand and I feel will take me a long time to understand. I think most of all what comes through to me is the creators\' love for what they\'ve created, their love for the characters, story, and world of Fafner, and their message of love for the world. It makes me feel really appreciative of what I\'ve experienced and what I have and inspires me to continuing spreading the love as well. And this love is what makes me able to forgive any flaws in story/character development, and certain parts they had to rush through and find all the good this series has to provide and gives me no choice but to give it a 10.Overall: 10/10Fafner is a sophisticated series with serious themes that any mature person can appreciate. Buckle up and let yourself be swept away by the tide. 9... but my bias won\'t allow me to give anything about this series lower than a 10 :\'D The plot is definitely really complex, and you need to know very well what\'s happened in the previous season + movie (I watched the original series + movie again back in the spring and still had some trouble following along).

Buckle up and let yourself be swept away by the tide.', ""Hello everyone this my second review so it might not be very good but anyway i just wanted to make a review for this anime after i saw that it doesnt have one yet and i really mean it when i say this. this anime is really underrated on myanimelistwell first of all Soukyou of fafner is a mecha serie that is at the second part of season 2 exodus with 2 other movies so its quite a long serie. you don't want to start this show on this season though because you really need to see all of it to really understand it.for...people who didnt watch any fafner, the background of the story is alien attaced earth, humans were defeated but are still resisting. the good guys of this show are on an island that moves, its really cool how it is a bit simillar to evangelion s fortress like every single part of the island becomes weapons and all when aliens come. One of the plus of this mecha show is that it has its own robot and dont try to copy other series at all. the pilots of the robots are only the young kids because they are born on the island and the adult came from japan that was anihilated. So the aliens are an existence between void and normal world and their attacks make void so victims dont have any corpse left for the family to mourn. when piloting the robots they kind of fuse together like they feel what the robot feels, it hurts when the robots are hurt and they can't pilot for too long or they will  get assimilated, basically they will disappear so each generation of pilots don't pilot for very long. WARNING if you watch this show be ready to see a lot of death, even if they didnt retire very fast they don't last very long。  i won't say what happened in the previous shows because maybe there are readers who didnt watch.Story 9well there are still 8 episodes left so if i gave too high a score it would be inappropriate but i think that it would have around 9 because fafner is awesome xD. as of now the pace is good we really have a progress on the two fronts. i cant really say the details because it might reveal too much for people who didnt watch the previous series but anyway it really have some twists that come nicely, i mean it striked me when it happened at the first episode of the second season. I was really disgusted and it leads to a change of the course the characters must take but it comes with the right number of flags and not too much.character 10one of the best thing in this show is how the characters are consistent. its great how they don't go for the easy romance like many anime tend to do. like an anime isn't good if we don't have romance. in this anime the two main characters are soushi and kazuki are both man so romance isnt the main theme (and do not worry it isn't a yaoi ) but we have kanon who has some feelings for kazuki but she doesnt really show them because i guess she realises unlike many anime fmc that its not because we are in a pinch that couples must be formed. well good news is that she finally assume her love like she says that she loves kazuki but i won't say the details because it was just great and sad. I also have to say that supporting characters in this show are all well worked. even if a lot of them die they are not rushed and we feel sad every time sometimes dies and dont feel like some failed tragedy sad the first episode and get used to it when someone dies every episode.for example we have two parents of one of the pilot of new generation that have always been having a problem with mourning their eldest daughter, refusing to believe that she is really dead, which is something that isnt taken into account in most of mecha anime. I am not saying that other mechas are bad they are also great but as sydonia no kishi was praised on how it put into light a lot of litlle problems we dont see in gundam like how we get water in space, what happens when we change of direction for an emergency dodge and all. in fafner all the characters are not perfect, and supporting characters are not blank. it s just that they take some time to become interesting because we have 3 pilots from the first generation (i mean first tv season and not the first movie who are the real first generation) and sou and kazuki shines too much so its normal that new supporting characters take some time to share the spotlight.Art 8well its the same character design as gundam seed and destiny but this time they felt that their character looked really alike (unlike heroic age or majestic prince they even have same hairstyle) so they made some kind of blush on everyone s face. well it doesnt really hurt the art. the robots are still all unique and cool, animation is good and so is the landscape.sound 9bgm is great op has a touch of epicness and the ed is slow and sad but thats not a minus. on the contrary, in this show that really have sad moments it would be strange if the music wasn't sad. war isn't only the epicness we show on the front (op) but also the sadness the survivor have at the end of each fight because they have to mourn their deads (ed).well i know that this review is far from perfect and i think ill redo one when i finish this season, I am not really inspired right now. I hope that other people who like fafner can be a bit more active on myanimelist because i was really shocked when i saw that there was only one review for exodus and non for exodus second season. I see there are a lot of reviews for the first season but almost none for exodus so i was a bit sad. T*T  fafner really deserves to be at least in top 500 not top 1616 so lets try our best to make it go up in ranks!! people who didnt watch any fafner, the background of the story is alien attaced earth, humans were defeated but are still resisting. the good guys of this show are on an island that moves, its really cool how it is a bit simillar to evangelion s fortress like every single part of the island becomes weapons and all when aliens come.

T*T  fafner really deserves to be at least in top 500 not top 1616 so lets try our best to make it go up in ranks!!"", '#1: You need to watch Soukyuu no Fafner: Dead Aggressor to have a glimpse on what\'s happening ( either the TV series or the recap movie will do), and of course Exodus season 1.#2: Must watch for those who have watched season 1 of Exodus.#3: Good for fans of mecha and tragedy.The show picks up after the 1st season of Exodus, where Kazuki and Soushi lead the Human Army side to the Promised Land, while the Island D\'s staffs try to fend off Festums and the increasingly potent assimilation effect.While the last season seems to be interesting after the second half, the second season dropped...this flaw and let the death train rolls.*spoiler alert*It starts of by showing the betrayal of the ally, Neo-UN and death of one of the pilot.And one major character is assimilated to move the plot.Another major character is half dead.And the betrayal game is strong. Neo-UN is getting betrayed by their Mir.*spoiler end*The major strong point of 2nd season is the momentum. No drag. No stopping. The plot just develops and plot twists strike at any moment at will.The scriptwriters have done a great job for not making loose ends.Animation wise, Fafner is not a hand-drawn marvel from Sunrise, yet the CG is a level below the peak of CG mecha animation-Knights of Sidonia.All the mecha and fight animations are animated decently, god knows where the budget comes from.Fafner still keeps some of the artstyles from it\'s 00\'s TV series, characters aren\'t as good looking as modern animes as they still have those 90\'s-00\'s moe-huge-eyes.  And characters look very similar to each other.The Festums are still as ungodly disgusting as one could imagine. Can\'t help with it.Character development is another spot 2nd season benefited from the 1st season. New characters need not to be introduced, old characters are developed.And we see one of the old guy from the 00\'s TV series makes a comeback. Marvelous.Other than that it\'s business as usual, you just sit back and pray your favourite character won\'t get killed.The new OSTs are stellar. Angela\'s ""DEAD OR ALIVE"" is one of the best opening of the season and is getting people into the series. The ending, Horizon is creepy, but well suits the ""everyone will die before arrival at the promised land"" vibe.The mecha battle tracks are marvelous too. Should be the same as 1st season where they use Angela\'s その時、蒼穹へ (Sono Toki, Soukyuu e).Overall it\'s an exciting and unexpected season of Fafner. The 2nd season outperforms the 1st season and the 00\'s TV series by a big margin. The ""plot seeds"" that are planted in 1st season has given countless intense mecha fight and emotional trainwrecks in season 2.Given how the plot is going, we\'re very likely to see a 3rd season, or 3rd coup for Exodus.May the guys from Island D survive the attack of new Festums. this flaw and let the death train rolls.*spoiler alert*It starts of by showing the betrayal of the ally, Neo-UN and death of one of the pilot.And one major character is assimilated to move the plot.Another major character is half dead.And the betrayal game is strong.

The humor is very straight forward and 1 dimensional, even doll at times. It tries too hard to make something...out of every scene it parodies, but at the end of the day, it's just another special to distribute along side the Blu-Ray release. out of every scene it parodies, but at the end of the day, it's just another special to distribute along side the Blu-Ray release."", ""This special is 7 two minute episodes with each episode containing three 30 second short skits. The other 30 seconds are the introduction and voice actor credits.These are Chibi animations about the third season, in a similar style to the earlier Attack on Titan picture drama. This time however the skits are less repetitive and with slightly better humor. The voice acting and sound are good, the animation is alright as far as Chibi animations go.Overall I don't feel like this is worth watching, it doesn't add anything to the main series and the humor is pretty hit or miss. Unless you like...chibi animations or find the suggestion that a titan can slip on a banana peel to be enjoyable humor, this probably isn't worth watching. chibi animations or find the suggestion that a titan can slip on a banana peel to be enjoyable humor, this probably isn't worth watching.""]"
Trapp Ikka Monogatari,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2557/Trapp_Ikka_Monogatari,"['Part of the World Masterpiece Theater, Trapp Ikka Monogatari is a classical story that is not based on any person’s misfortune or fighting fates for a better tomorrow. There are no evildoers; it is just a mellow and sweet series with day-to-day events of the Von Trapp family with Maria holding the most important role.The story itself is really simple and holds no real twists for the most part; Maria Kutschera, a nun in training, is sent to be the teacher of one of the girls who is too weakened to attend school. One thing leads to another and slowly, but unofficially, she takes care...of everyone and helps them grow as a person. That is the main gist of it and while there is progress, the series stays the same pattern-wise and although that would normally mean it would get repetitive and possibly boring, it manages to keep a warm feeling throughout with almost every “adventure” of theirs, such as preparing a gift for the housekeeper or fight against a possible new stepmother. The pacing is quite good for a show like this and thankfully, the series does not spend too much time on one thing and thus, keeps the interest high enough and only towards the end it seemed to be a bit more abrupt.The characters have variety as there are 7 children and the story gives enough time for any of them to show their personality and gain some development (some more than others, since a couple of them are really too young to be able to portray complicated thoughts), through their own personal problems. The father is not as strict as he is awkward; an awkward father who has to work a lot out of his house, but the family values he has shine through. Each family member complements each other and one can really see how much they mean to each other and this makes the series a great family story. Maria is the one true change they all needed to move on and is probably the only person with the least development. She stays true to the main girl cliché that wants her positive and bright and helping anyone, but there is no change in herself. We do get to know more about her past and her personality is very likable, either way, but all in all, she will always be that happy girl only.Art/Music-wise, the show offers nothing much, especially since it is an older show. For anyone familiar with the movie “The Sound of Music”, this series is not a musical. There are songs throughout, though mostly they are only a couple of songs put on repeat, however the characters do not break in song at random times. The songs seem to be children’s songs, but they are nice and some are very easy to sing along too. The art is simple, not detailed and the animation is saving frames whenever possible, but it has bright colors and it is very easy on the eye. The characters are distinct and despite the fact that the characters wear the same outfits almost in every episode, they are easy on the eye too.As a family story, it did a good job generally. There were times it felt a bit more dragged on or not as interesting, but it is a very easy watch when in mood for some slice of life with no deep drama in every other episode, but enough to spice things up. of everyone and helps them grow as a person.

Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2202: Ai no Senshi-tachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33064/Uchuu_Senkan_Yamato_2202__Ai_no_Senshi-tachi,"[""As the credits finally began to roll for the last time of Yamato 2202 and Yamato Yori ai wo Komete played, I felt a sense of relief that this dreadful re-imagining of the 1978 Space Battleship Yamato II had reached its ill fated conclusion. I had gone into 2202 with incredibly high hopes after the spectacular Space Battleship Yamato 2199 introduced me to this wonderful universe. After completing 2199, I went back and watched nearly every single Yamato series and movie (season 3 is the sole exception here with no decent subtitles existing to my knowledge) I could get my hands on, eager to immerse...myself into the trials and tribulations of the Yamato and her crew.And then this series happened. Featuring a different director than 2199, and new character designs, Yamato 2202 failed spectacularly to capture any of the enjoyment and adoration I have for the rest of the franchise. The story is mostly made up of philosophical musings from the leader of the White Comet Empire revolving around the notion of love and humanity that never really develops into anything except a plot device to copy the ending of Farewell to Space Battleship Yamato and give it a new twist. Every time Zordar spoke, I found myself rolling my eyes at how shallow and silly the writing was. I am supportive of attempting to change the formula. After all, this is a re-imagining and not a full fledged remake of the original season 2. The execution, however, is conducted with all the skill and grace of a 12 year old writing a fan-fiction in their head during school as they day dream. The writing thinks it is far smarter and deeper than it actually is. Nothing ever quite comes together smoothly. Characters just die for the sake of dying while newly introduced characters are woefully underused despite being incredibly interesting and full of potential. Characters do not really develop much at all, save the space marines really. One character in particular is able to just magically figure things out and explain them to the audience because the show simply is unable to convey what is going on visually or through actual storytelling. In 2199, we would have been treated to scenes of characters researching and trying to understand things, allowing for explanations to the audience as they shared theories with one another and debated for an answer. In 2202, they just know things and that's that.Visually, 2202 is a mixed bag. The space battles are wonderfully animated surpassing 2199 in the scale and quality and a magical plot device is able to keep Earth in the fight far longer than it had any right to be giving the viewer plenty of eye candy to watch during battles. Unfortunately, the character designs and direction during battles at times is jarring. Characters now look much less crisp than they did in 2199 instead with sketch lines and awkward looking faces due to oddly drawn mouths and noses. As for visual direction, there clearly was some sort of eye fetish going on. Many times in battles or even normal dialogue, the only thing we see is a characters eye/s as they stare in horror at something or just look at something in general. During one egregious part in the first episode, a large battle is taking place. As ships are destroyed, the camera keeps cutting back to Kodai over and over again as he makes the exact same determined, grit teeth, face for about 30 seconds. This sort of weird visual direction takes place multiple times during the show, with awkward, jarring cuts during dialogue and battle. At least the music is solid.If you go into Yamato 2202 expecting nothing on the story or character development front, you are likely to find an enjoyable space action show. Otherwise, steer clear of this mangled mess of a re-imagining. As for me, I am just going to pretend that this was never made and rewatch the original season 2 and Farewell to Space Battleship Yamato film instead. That simple and basic writing of 1978 is somehow superior to the poor attempts of the 2202 team to re-imagine its namesake. myself into the trials and tribulations of the Yamato and her crew.And then this series happened.

However, it would be no easy task, 2202 had to remake two different - yet complementary materials, Farewell to Yamato and the TV series Yamato 2.While Yamato 2 had to stretch the 2-hour long story of Farewell to Yamato into a 26 episode series (and make a new ending), it succeeded in many aspects and failed in others: the overall plot of the series was better and alongside the new OST and mecha, allowed Yamato 2 to feature many new facets unexplored that the original TV series and Farewell, such as villains subplots, good battle strategies, and the Yamato being unable to do anything in some situations. However, Yamato 2 failed to impact audiences with the same drama that Farewell had and some subplots were boring, e.g. Shima and Teresa\'s love story.With that in mind, 2202 could easily take the strong points of the originals and 2199 to craft a good sequel and remake. However, 2202 fails at it; ""Soldiers of Love"", except for the battle at planet 11, the presence of the space fireflies, and some other minor points, almost fully ignores the majority of the strong points of Yamato 2. No villain subplots, no iconic mecha from the series (eg. Earth\'s aircraft carriers), none of the battle strategies, and none of the memorable character moments.The new director Nobuyosh Haraba and scriptwriter Harutoshi Fukui chose something different: they would take the original plot of Farewell to Yamato and add their new elements to the mix. However, the idea backfired: Yamato 2202 turned out to be a mess.Firstly, the insertion of the new philosophical element into the series isn\'t done in a smart matter. Indeed, some might argue that it represents Nishizaki\'s vision of love (vision of which bothered Leiji Matsumoto so much to the point where he reportedly refused to work on the final scenes of Farewell Yamato due to his own feelings on the subject), but what one truly observes is that it, practically speaking, only serves as a way to explain plot devices and to allow Zordar to make some nonsensical and monotonous dialogs. The blaring and unstoppable talking about ""love"" more alienates viewers than highlights the themes of the series.When one talks about characters, the core aspect of the originals and 2199, the results are sad: almost none of them develop that much, characters that were much stronger and charismatic, such as Kodai and Kato, are incoherent to their previous counterparts of the remakes, Yuki and Akira now don\'t have half of their personalities, and Desler, which surprisingly gets a retcon of his version from 2199 and whose return is not explained at all, is boring.New characters also don\'t get any better, Zordar is a philosopher with a terrible motivation, Sabera, and all Gatlantis officers are only plot devices, Teresa, Saito, Hijikata, Yamanami, as well as the whole Andromeda fleet (which were supposed to be a big thing in this season) are underused, and the Ginga shouldn\'t even exist in the first place. The only character that gets some decent development here is Kiman, who is unfortunately affected by the occasionally clucky dialog of the series.As for the action, the use of CGI in the show is good, but not perfect: ships sometimes feel weightless and the Yamato doesn\'t get the same level of detail on its big scratches after every battle as it did in 2199. 2D animation, fortunately, is in the same standard as it was in the first season.The mecha designs are a mixed bag: while some are good and detailed, adding a lot to the series, others have a debatable quality, such as the Earth\'s new aircraft carriers, the Ginga with its glass dome, and the Comet Empire\'s new ""true form"", which completely obliterated the original design (the same here applies to Zordar dreadnought, although this one might have happened due to budget reasons).The direction of the action scenes is good, despite the overuse of the Wave Motion Gun (which caused a loss to its dramatic effect) the action here is one of the best things in 2202, however, given how there\'s little emotional attachment to being found between the viewer and the characters, especially new ones, some scenes are often very bland.As for the drama, it is even more diluted than the one in Yamato 2. Characters here die for the sake of dying, Saito\'s, Kiman\'s and Higashikata\'s deaths don\'t have a fraction of their original deaths. And Kato had a death so mediocre it was comical.The soundtrack is absolutely the best thing of the series, although Akira Miyagawa\'s style is somewhat different than the one from his father, being more bombastic and colorful, his additions are often amazing (cf. Tsubasa).Overall, Yamato 2202 is a disappointment for a show that had everything to be great but turned out to be mediocre as a show and as a remake.

If you are gonna watch season 2 be prepared for a ride of joy, enjoyment, emotions and some brilliant moments.Earth again faces a new crisis and our old crew from Yamato must once again embark on a journey in the distant universe to assure a future for Earth. Each encounter and fight holds a meaning and this season gives a lesson to its viewers about the mistakes that our characters did and shows us their path to clear them and make the right choices for their future.The...characters are what makes Yamato 2202  the best work of Matsumoto Leij. Each character has its own spotlight and each of them manages to stir up different emotions for its viewers. Sometimes you will hate them sometimes you will love them and sometimes you will encourage them. Another amazing thing is how well this season  presents us the reasons of the enemy that Yamato faces with some strong and solid base behind their actions and choices.One thing to mention is Desler's development from season 1 thourgh season 2. As you may know in the first season he was pictured as a cold-blooded dictator who sent most of his people to death to achieve victory. In season 2 they go inside his mind they present his reasons and choices, everything that made him do that and gives him a second chance, makes him a likeable character even more than the ones from the Yamato crew.Desler isn't the only one who contributes to this season, each character manages to portray the main themes of this show . Their speeches, their monologue, their own story and past mistakes, all of them provide a warning and also a lesson for us viewers. Leji Matsumoto was a man who 40 years when he created the Yamato series he looked way ahead in the future and predicted how our society will become in the near future. And damn he nailed it ! Our modern society is almost identical as the one from the Yamato series.The most amazing stuff from this show is how well the raw human nature is presented and explored, and how well the human mind is studied during a crisis situation and the decisions made by them. Our own greed for war, our capability for destruction but also our good side our creative mind , our undying will and that we cling in desperate times, our heart to hate but also love! Our possibilities and choices to create a Future for ourselves!This is Yamato Space Battleship 2202 a study about humanity about their choices their love their capability to destroy or create a FUTURE! This is Leji's Matsumoto masterpiece from almost half a century ago! Just don't miss this...you will not regret it trust me! characters are what makes Yamato 2202  the best work of Matsumoto Leij. Each character has its own spotlight and each of them manages to stir up different emotions for its viewers. Sometimes you will hate them sometimes you will love them and sometimes you will encourage them. Another amazing thing is how well this season  presents us the reasons of the enemy that Yamato faces with some strong and solid base behind their actions and choices.One thing to mention is Desler's development from season 1 thourgh season 2. As you may know in the first season he was pictured as a cold-blooded dictator who sent most of his people to death to achieve victory. In season 2 they go inside his mind they present his reasons and choices, everything that made him do that and gives him a second chance, makes him a likeable character even more than the ones from the Yamato crew.Desler isn't the only one who contributes to this season, each character manages to portray the main themes of this show . Their speeches, their monologue, their own story and past mistakes, all of them provide a warning and also a lesson for us viewers. Leji Matsumoto was a man who 40 years when he created the Yamato series he looked way ahead in the future and predicted how our society will become in the near future. And damn he nailed it ! Our modern society is almost identical as the one from the Yamato series.The most amazing stuff from this show is how well the raw human nature is presented and explored, and how well the human mind is studied during a crisis situation and the decisions made by them. Our own greed for war, our capability for destruction but also our good side our creative mind , our undying will and that we cling in desperate times, our heart to hate but also love! Our possibilities and choices to create a Future for ourselves!This is Yamato Space Battleship 2202 a study about humanity about their choices their love their capability to destroy or create a FUTURE! This is Leji's Matsumoto masterpiece from almost half a century ago! Just don't miss this...you will not regret it trust me!"", 'I’d just like to review this quickly fresh off from watching the ending. There aren’t that many reviews here on MAL for whatever reason coming off from an amazing original series.Looking back 3/4 of Yamato 2202 I quite liked a lot. A space adventure of epic proportions where the Yamato is placed in outlandish situations that it somehow manages to escape from every time. A few twists and turns here and there and I enjoyed it up until the end.The art is beautiful and the character designs are pleasing. The CGI is iffy at times, but I think the show looks great.A somewhat negative...is the enemy is faceless. It’s sad an unfathomably large race out to destroy all of humanity is represented by 3 characters at best.Even at this point I didn’t see where the negative reviews were coming from, until I watched the last two episodes. The show hints at its mystical, beyond life and death, god … whatever you want to call it themes but my goodness it is laid on THICK at the end.Yamato 2202 had no business pulling what reminded me of the original Mobile Suit Gundam merging of consciousness deal at the last possible moment.  It doesn’t earn the right to do it. I mean the show is practically done and it’s busy preaching about human bonds and grasping for the best possible future … I mean … what am I even watching? is what I was asking myself. It’s like what’s the point of all of this? It all ends normally anyway.Even still, I recommend watching Yamato 2202 if you’ve seen the original. Its more of the same anyway of what you’ve enjoyed before, until the ending that is, and even then, it’s not that bad. is the enemy is faceless.

As a sequel to 2199, the only strength it really carries forward is the fantastic visuals and models for its ship to ship combat. But aside from spectacle, it falters heavily in terms of its plot, themes, characters, and at times, even comprehensibility.The most apparent issue with Warriors of Love is the extreme plot bloat that only heightens the convoluted nature of its...central themes. While 2199 was fairly concentrated, with only two significant subplots that eventually tied into their journey to Iscandar, 2202 has arguably four or even five of these crammed into the same space. This leaves some of their themes like the proliferation of Wave Motion weaponry and the question of integrating AI control on Earth\'s warships woefully underserved. Warriors of Love does raise interesting questions with a thematic resonance with the rest of the franchise, yet it never has the time to deal with them. The inclusion of Teresa ends up being more of a plot catalyst than an actual plot point, an excuse to dump exposition and prepare for a deus ex machina, than anything that furthers the themes or events. The need to adhere to this element from the original Space Battleship Yamato II hamstrings a plot that should be focused elsewhere. Probably entirely on the conflict with the Gatlantians and their attack on Earth. In fact, it sacrifices a lot of the time its predecessor 2199 spent developing their characters to cater to the myriad of plot threads. This presents a fundamental problem since character development can be done in smaller, more contained stories that buttressed the central plot. That was how 2199 handled a chunk of its episodes which eased the show\'s pacing and added an emotional depth to the stakes. Warriors of Love adds more characters to the cast while being forced to use its time outside the central narrative to attempt to flesh out its side plots. Even writing out some of the Yamato secondary crew early on in the season does not alleviate the pressure for screen time. As a result, none of its new or old characters feels particularly well developed, and the sheer number of subplots ensure that none get enough time to fully realise their potential.This general overload spills into its frankly confusing central thesis of questioning what makes a being ""human"". While the general idea of the emotional experience being a powerful core part of human existence is eventually put across, it is done in such a convoluted manner that it undermines its already very irrational premise. The use of irrational here is not meant to be pejorative, but rather its literal meaning in that it hinges on the lived experience instead of any genuine philosophical basis. The problem lies in that 2202 does not let their character\'s motivations and conflict carry this emotional thesis across but instead tries to deliver it like an intellectual one. You can have your characters debate and agonise over something like deploying the Wave Motion Gun since it is an ethical quandary. On the other hand, something as intangible as love and its meaning or as a source of motivation is something that must be more parts demonstrated than monologued. All Zwoder\'s rambling does is obfuscate and convolute the relatively simple point he is making and drag it into the depths of melodrama. The irony is that there are already stronger character moments that demonstrate this on screen. Kato\'s pain of having to choose between his duty or his sick son embodies one of the central themes of 2202. That love is both a great motivator but also an incredible source of pain, and that this emotional experience is integral to understanding being human. Yet it is a mere subplot and never replicated in other areas. Warriors of Love seems either deeply insecure about how simply its idea can be put across or really does think in such a self-aggrandising way. And neither reflect very well on its construction.Translating back to the characters, this also means that all of them either stagnate or are incredibly shallow. None of the characters are leveraged to dig into the theme of love and emotions being central to human existence. Instead, they constantly veer into melodrama since the show never develops their motivations clearly and spends time using their actions as just a means to further the plot. In particular, the reintroduction of Desler is done in both a hamfisted and contrived manner that only tangentially ties into an examination of what people will do for love or in an emotional state. So much of 2202\'s run time is spent trying to clumsily recontextualise Desler\'s actions from 2199 that it feels closer to a retcon than being presented with a different perspective. Barely any of this was set up in 2199, and sadly, Warriors of Love does not earn enough goodwill with the viewer to have them give it the benefit of the doubt and accept the changes. Nor does 2202 reward anyone who does overlook this since the radical changes to Desler does not add any substantial value to the plot or themes of the story. Again, these all feel like inclusions for the sake of drawing plot elements from the originals without effectively integrating them. Sadly, it just comes out as a confusing eclectic mess that is only saved by its still impressive spectacle and the viewer\'s pre-established connection to the characters.Even then, the spectacle of the massive battles veers from exaggerated into ridiculous at times due to the endless escalation of things. The only battle which does not suffer from this is the opening engagement between the Gatlantians and the combined Earth-Gamilan fleet. There is still a sense of manoeuvring and gradual attrition on both sides, with the fleets maintaining formation. The scale of the battle with the number of ships involved was already verging on being unwieldy, but the focus on the Yunagi and Kodai\'s actions kept it in check. 2202 then repeatedly jumps the shark by attempting to outdo its previous battles in terms of scale and spectacle. While it is initially visually impressive to see hundreds of ships endlessly fire at each other, it soon loses its lustre and becomes a mind-numbing experience. Without any narrative focal point in the battle, it is just ultimately a series of explosions that reduce to nothing more than eye candy. While that is important for any action show, it cannot fully compensate for its other failings.What makes this worse is the scale of the battle, and the weapons employed start to shatter the viewer\'s sense of disbelief. The Karakum-class Battleship is already shown to be a colossal vessel that dwarfs other battleships. To then immediately raise the stakes by having the Gatlantian fleet be comprised of literally thousands of them makes it hard to take seriously. Part of what creates a convincing fleet engagement is the variety of ships present. Just having walls and walls of one ridiculously large ship class flood into the battle feels simply uninspired and absurd. Again, the irony is that 2199 knew how to write excellent naval engagements and understood that merely increasing the scale endlessly did not necessarily increase tension. The battle at Balun in 2199 appropriately only occurs late into the season. Even then, the writer/director knew not to let the spectacle of thousands of ships attacking the Yamato overstay its welcome. Similarly, Operation M at the start of 2199 does not outstay its welcome and gets its point across. There is an understanding that spectacle can only hold for so long before viewers lose interest, which has been lost with 2202. Ship to ship combat is at its best when there are fewer vessels that undertake more intricate action. Again, the irony is that 2199 already did this well with the excellent battle of the Rainbow Star Cluster, which only involves five ships and their air wings. The viewer can follow a sense of tension, stakes, move and counter move. Warriors of Love going in the exact opposite direction is a tragic disappointment that is only compounded by knowing how well its predecessor executed their action scenes.On the more technical front, Warriors of Loves fails to balance the campy retro origins of many of its ship designs and ideas with more modern, ""harder"" sci-fi interpretations. Some elements are adapted well enough, like the asteroid shield from the original series being written in as a legacy of the Izumo plan. Others like the Karakum-class sits on the knife\'s edge of this, having exaggerated features like its main mast being literally three turrets stacked on top of each other. This finally goes into the territory of the plain absurd when they introduce the Gatlantian supercarrier that launches its planes by spinning its flight decks like a drill. There is no logical reason for this, and it looks ridiculous. This shatters the suspension of disbelief since it undermines the spectacle of the action while drawing attention to the fact that so many of these designs already bordered on the insane or even plain stupid. This was already a mild issue in 2199 with the idea of battle carriers and the four decked carriers that obviously lacked the appropriate internal volume to house the rest of the ship\'s systems. However, the strengths of 2199\'s other elements allowed it to be handwaved and viewed as an exaggerated stylistic design instead of absurdity. A similar problem can be found in the Gatlantian battle tactics, with their legionary cannon utilising ships circling each other in a cylinder formation being absolutely ridiculous. This pushes the boundary of what is already closer to space fantasy and into the realm of pure camp. It undoes so much of the serious tone and effort put into the technobabble by showing battle scenes that are so detached from any semblance of sense. It discards the suspension of disbelief that 2199 earns by mirroring naval combat and goes straight into the epitome of appearance over substance by coming up with wild detached ideas.But perhaps worst of all is the mass proliferation of Wave Motion Guns. While it is an impressive sight to see a whole volley of them being fired, it actively cheapens one of the central themes of Space Battleship Yamato. Wave Motion weapons become a dime a dozen and are shown to have mostly middling power and effectiveness. This undermines the idea that it is a dangerous power that the cast of Space Battleship Yamato bares a heavy heart whenever utilising. When combined with the general lack of debate over the Wave Motion fleet\'s use, implications, or ethics, it significantly detracts from 2202\'s thematic strength. It feels almost like it is spitting in the face of one of the strongest points of 2199 just for the sake of spectacle and leaves Warriors of Love feeling even more like melodrama dressed up with action. While 2199 balances out the strengths and weaknesses of a space opera, 2202 seems to dive headlong into the genre\'s pitfalls. Sadly, the strengths 2202 brings to the table, like the interesting ideas presented by the inclusion of the Ginga are not developed enough to compensate for this. And while the action involving the CRS and the Black Bird technology is creative and engaging, it does not make up for the other elements lost in 2202\'s breakneck escalation of scale.Overall, Warriors of Love is a disappointing sequel that devolves into a convoluted mess. It attempts to do too much and hamstrings its own central themes by aggrandising what is a simple idea. Love and emotional attachment has the potential to resonate with viewers more than more distant concepts like duty, heroism, or the moral burden of war. Yet its contrived delivery and mess of multiple plot threads make its theme of love either incomprehensible or hard to take seriously. This thematic weakness (made worse by its casual use of Wave Motion guns that retroactively cheapen even 2199) is barely propped up by the spectacle and emotional scenes. The latter are few and far between and are achieved mainly due to the viewer\'s investment in characters from 2199 than any new developments.The rating system here lacks the granularity to properly rate this show. It is still technically competent, and the spectacle is undeniably entertaining, at least initially, and if only for what it shows than any of its implications. Yet it fails so drastically in other areas that it is hard to give it a 6. On the other hand, a 4 feels too harsh since the show is still comprehensible and eventually gets its point across. Objectively, Warriors of Love is likely a 5.5 out of 10. Not due to its mediocrity but due to its fundamental problems in certain areas. Yet it still can keep a viewer invested through its initial hooks, unlike other shows that lose their audience. And even a frustrated viewer will still be inclined to stick around to the end, strung along by the action and the hopes of finally comprehending the motives and themes of Zworder. Sadly, with how the rating system is, Space Battleship Yamato 2202: Warriors of Love is far closer to a 5 with all its problems than a 6. I would still recommend this to fans of 2199, but only them. At the very least, it will present some good combat scenes and enough context to watch 2205, which will hopefully be better. central themes.

The second season in the original series was even better than the first.The deviation from the original story is by far superior planning, and well executed.The American voice actors on Funimation are not as dead on as I would hope.  For one the Captain sounds a LOT more grizzled in Japanese.  In the American actor choice you have someone sounding young.Now the vast increase of firepower and the extensive explanation, all inter tied in is well...planned out.

Currently I am up to Volume 5 direct import from Japan, and I have the American Funimation copies as well.... And each of the models they have released.As you can tell this is my favorite Anime of all!', 'As I recently finished this show, I felt it was time to give it some love through a small review. This show surprised me in a good way, especially considering the fact that it\'s based on what\'s considered one of the best pieces of media in the SBY franchise (Farewell Yamato, and by extension SBY 2).The core theme of love, signified by the under-title ""Soldiers of Love"" is brought to life through use of clever directing tricks, an expanded scope granted to the writing of this world (Considering Gamillas survival in 2199 and some other changes from the source, this was an inevitability) by...a master of Sci-fi (Harutoshi Fukui, Gundam UC). Even more beautiful scores both old and new are once again composed by Akira Miyagawa (Son of original composer, Hiroshi Miyagawa), leit motifs granted to both Zordar and Sabera among other characters, something that wasn\'t present in the original show.Some fan favorite characters return and are introduced, as plot threads left in 2199 (And its movies) about Hijikata, Yamanami, Saito and Gamillas are brought to full fruition, as the Gamillan-Earth cooperation gives us tense political intrigues in the aftermath of a world crafted from the cradle that was the Iscandarian Cosmo-Reverse system.My Sales Pitch: The crew of the Yamato are pushed into situations beyond the scope of their imagination, willingly heading out to save someone (Teresa) in need of help in our universe as recompense for the same favor being granted to them by Iscandar 3 years back. The Comet Empire is an entirely different enemy than Gamillas was, an intricate war machine hell-bent on annihilating the universe! Or so it seems... The promise to not use the Wave Motion Gun again in 2199 takes big focus this season, as its destructive capabilities in 2199 has left a sour taste in the crew of the Yamato, Kodai Susumu in particular.Reintroduced after the 2199 side-story movie is the White Comet Empire, and its leader who despises love ""Emperor Zordar""What I love about Gatlantis as a race and enemy is their internal struggle against basic human emotions suppressed through means I won\'t bother to explain here, as that would be spoiling the fun. It\'s like watching genetically manufactured child soldiers getting thrust into war, and some of them naturally rebel against their locked away emotions to emulate normal human beings. And in the midst of all this, the Yamato has to stop the onslaught of all mankind with weapons they promised to never use again.This show has themes like sins of the father, redeeming irredeemable crimes, the pro\'s and con\'s of love and the irrationality behind that emotion, are orders always absolute? Is co-existence between different races possible? The generation after Okita, or as they\'re referred to in the show ""Okita\'s children"", are they capable of overturning great peril and imminent annihilation with their wits, morals and strength?In this show you\'ll find ethereal beings, a natural evolution to the formula that was established in 2199, a tightly knit web of sub-plots slowly progressing to their climax in one big explosion of satisfaction the closer we get to the end.As a final note I\'d like to commend the new director Habara for managing to pick up the work his predecessor (Izubuchi) left off, having worked on the Clockwork prisoner and first half of the Rainbow cluster battle in 2199, he is more than well equipped to handle this task hand in hand with head writer Fukui. The new voice acting talents on all sides are mostly veteran VA\'s from the Galactic Heroes and Original Gundam days, so those of you who have a good ear will be able to spot some of your favorite old men and women from decades past.All in all, this show is one big celebration of Yoshinobu Nishizaki\'s vision of love as a tool to help make the world a better place, gathering talents in all departments form both the older and newer generations to create a masterpiece in the making called Space Battleship Yamato 2202: Soldiers of Love.Please watch this show all the way until the end before you pass judgement, I can assure everyone that the buildup will be worth it. a master of Sci-fi (Harutoshi Fukui, Gundam UC).

The promise to not use the Wave Motion Gun again in 2199 takes big focus this season, as its destructive capabilities in 2199 has left a sour taste in the crew of the Yamato, Kodai Susumu in particular.Reintroduced after the 2199 side-story movie is the White Comet Empire, and its leader who despises love ""Emperor Zordar""What I love about Gatlantis as a race and enemy is their internal struggle against basic human emotions suppressed through means I won\'t bother to explain here, as that would be spoiling the fun. It\'s like watching genetically manufactured child soldiers getting thrust into war, and some of them naturally rebel against their locked away emotions to emulate normal human beings. And in the midst of all this, the Yamato has to stop the onslaught of all mankind with weapons they promised to never use again.This show has themes like sins of the father, redeeming irredeemable crimes, the pro\'s and con\'s of love and the irrationality behind that emotion, are orders always absolute? Is co-existence between different races possible? The generation after Okita, or as they\'re referred to in the show ""Okita\'s children"", are they capable of overturning great peril and imminent annihilation with their wits, morals and strength?In this show you\'ll find ethereal beings, a natural evolution to the formula that was established in 2199, a tightly knit web of sub-plots slowly progressing to their climax in one big explosion of satisfaction the closer we get to the end.As a final note I\'d like to commend the new director Habara for managing to pick up the work his predecessor (Izubuchi) left off, having worked on the Clockwork prisoner and first half of the Rainbow cluster battle in 2199, he is more than well equipped to handle this task hand in hand with head writer Fukui. The new voice acting talents on all sides are mostly veteran VA\'s from the Galactic Heroes and Original Gundam days, so those of you who have a good ear will be able to spot some of your favorite old men and women from decades past.All in all, this show is one big celebration of Yoshinobu Nishizaki\'s vision of love as a tool to help make the world a better place, gathering talents in all departments form both the older and newer generations to create a masterpiece in the making called Space Battleship Yamato 2202: Soldiers of Love.Please watch this show all the way until the end before you pass judgement, I can assure everyone that the buildup will be worth it.', ""Since there's just no positive review here, I decided to add my own. It will be short and to the point.Overall, I'm satisfied by the first 14 episodes of Yamato 2202. It's a good space opera, and I enjoyed watching it. But, I wasn't as thrilled as when I watched Yamato 2199.The use of 3D to animate battles with thousands of ships is fairly well done as to not become too distracting, but not perfect. The rest of the art is very good.The music could be called a remix of 2199's. The general themes remain the same, with variations on the instruments.It has its interesting...moments in the story, but it doesn't *feel* like the one and only Yamato 2199, and more like a generic space opera with the characters from Yamato. moments in the story, but it doesn't *feel* like the one and only Yamato 2199, and more like a generic space opera with the characters from Yamato."", ""I think the best way to describe Yamato 2202 is, unfortunate.After thinking about this for a long, long time I've finally realized why the episodes with the space battles were my favorite. It's because they're the best part of 2202. Space battles on this scale and activity are rare and I love it for that. I can even forgive the Super Space Battleship Yamato, even though more advanced ships that are superior in every way are available this ship for some reason is special. Yes, it's the mascot of the series but having to constantly believe that through the sheer skill and/or tenacity of...the crew or some dumb luck is why this thing is still usable gets a bit tiring. Still, big lazer make thing go boom. That's always fun to watch.Unfortunately there is very little else to love. Like, plenty. But love? No.If I had to describe my absolute least favorite aspect of 2202 it would have to be the blending of the mystical/unexplainable with the tangible. Hinting at something bigger than life that may or may not exist is fine, but outright showing it removes most of the mystery and reveals it to be kind of boring.A factory placed inside of a Time Fault that was created when the Cosmo Reverse System was activated so that they could mass produce ships at an incredible speed? You know what? That doesn't seem too out of place in a sci-fant universe. I approve.A planet of ultradimentional beings that appear as a praying blonde woman who may or may not be god?...wot?In storywriting exposition is something that must not be treated lightly. There must be just enough so that the viewer knows what is even going on. However explaining too many things too many times is bad. If a writer must explain almost everything new they introduce then they have failed to properly prepare their audience, whether by introducing objects/plans/people from nowhere or weaving the world to make it believable that something like that could possibly exist, thus making the introduction of such a thing seem natural. And unfortunately, 2202 is infected with brand new things that appear out of nowhere and long expositions introducing them to us.However. There were certain concepts that managed to intrigue me, the biggest one being the questions revolving around the being of humanity. But that's going into spoiler territory.The characters range from pretty good to down right annoyingly stupid.I found myself skipping most of the talking-only scenes during my rewatchings and ended up being lost on the story. Any normal person would tell me to just let it play and I'll have a better time. I would respond that the parts I skipped are boring and I am a person that enjoys reading dry material like the Silmarillion. I acknowledge and accept that this story is lame. Gimme the good stuff. Damn right I enjoyed seeing bigger and bigger ships from both sides as the war intensifies. Still, there were some QUALITY moments where I could definitely see the CG sticking its head out of the hole, not to mention the countless reused scenes and ship placements that yes, I could notice and sometimes got annoyed by.Try and give it a complete watch for the first time but don't feel bad if you skip to the space battles, especially during your subsequent watches, which the Yamato series has always done well. the crew or some dumb luck is why this thing is still usable gets a bit tiring.

But if you are brave enough go ahead.OK lets start with the positives! Personally I think the animation is quite good as I could clearly see more than sufficient details especially in space battles and the background was nice as well. For the story, it kept me hooked as I literally finished the series in a day without getting bored. The sound was good, I think the music matched the scenes. Overall I enjoyed Uchuu Senkan Yamato and I give it a 6 out of 10.However in my humble opinion the characters especially Kodai was not refined well. I feel that...his decision does not make any sense. As an example he was willing to kill himself for no particular reason in episode 23. The man just drops his gun and let an enemy shoot him because he has this so called ""faith"" in the enemy.... Like wtf the dude just forgot about his own wife and all his friends and is willing to lay down his life for some really dumb reason????? I think that the series could have been a lot better if the character team really put on some thought on how to display the MC\'s idealism. Kodai\'s ideals are noble and something people should aspire to be but take it to the extreme and the whole nobleness of it disappears. To elaborate people who are generous should always help others. But we all know that if you keep donating money and resources to those who need help, you will simply run out of money and resources. Likewise if you are have ""faith"" in an enemy and you give your gun to an enemy who you just met like 3 seconds ago trusting him with your life... It is utter foolishness.In conclusion the series was good in every aspect except the character development simply because of Kodai\'s decision. His logic was great but how he put it into action endangering his own life AND SO MANY OTHERS without any good reason was just stupid. his decision does not make any sense.

I am so glad I watched it anyway, and am writing this review to tell you that it is worth it.I think many of the negative reviews are due to the fact that 2202 is different from 2199 in several ways. If you were expecting the fun, exciting adventure of 2199 to continue with another journey across the stars with your favorite characters, you will be disappointed.2202 tackles tougher themes, is more philosophical and dives into the motivations behind this universes protagonists and antagonists. Everything doesn't...just work out the way 2199 did, where the seemingly indestructible Yamato and its crew plunge head first into danger and make it out unscathed. there are more costs and consequences, more pain and choices, your favorite characters are more desperately fighting for everything they care about and love. They require more help too, as their problems can't be solved with one blast from the Wave Motion Gun. If you were like me, and loved 2199 but felt the Yamato was just a little too invincible, you will love 2202.One of my favorite parts of 2202 is how some characters were developed. There are several new, important characters, but in 2202 we also learned so much more about several key 2199 characters. I almost feel that you really don't know some of these characters until you watch 2202.Overall, if you enjoyed 2199, I highly recommend you watch 2202. If anything just for the sake of truly understanding several key 2199 characters. But I think you will find the themes and concepts pondered interesting, and enjoy the increase in costs and consequences. just work out the way 2199 did, where the seemingly indestructible Yamato and its crew plunge head first into danger and make it out unscathed. there are more costs and consequences, more pain and choices, your favorite characters are more desperately fighting for everything they care about and love.

Yes, it has a lot of copy-and-paste space fights but then the source it is based off is ancient compared to the shows people compare it with. The story I can admit was a bit heart-gushing compared to the previous one and is effectively the exact same storyline essentially but with a more powerful enemy. An enemy let us not forget in the first season that was held on a prison planet as weak now are coming from this absolutely unstoppable force.Artistically...speaking the show is just a more polished version of what we got before but that isn't bad since it makes the show bearable and not like watching something completely different. Seeing the new city and the old city used was a nice touch comparing the 2 seasons. I will say especially towards the end how the city on earth looks almost exactly the same as Atlantis from the Stargate Atlantis series, like literally an anime version of the CGI city with people living in it. Or maybe Stargate copied the design from the source here, who knows in the end.The sound was pretty good, and a variety of SFX from battles along with the sometimes striking art was really great.The characters were interesting and yet the same. Since it was essentially more or less the same show it was difficult to really get sucked into the stories. That said you do get some surprising events that happen along with a pretty rushed end.With how the show ended I was left wanting more from the enemy, not just develop 0-100 in 2 seconds. It is a pretty enjoyable show all things said though.8/10. speaking the show is just a more polished version of what we got before but that isn't bad since it makes the show bearable and not like watching something completely different.

Utawarerumono,https://myanimelist.net/anime/856/Utawarerumono,"[""Utawarerumono manages to be one of those harem animes that anyone can possibly find enjoyable, even if they don't particularly like the concept of harems. Based on the ero-game with the same title, Utawarerumono focuses on an amnesiac man who is found critically injured in a rural village. With the kindness of the villagers, he recovers and spends his days peacefully with them. However, the peaceful times quickly end with a heart shattering event that throws the man and his fellow villagers into a life of war.StoryThe story in Utawarerumono is somewhat simplistic at first, with a majority of the anime following a simple formula...of battles, battles and even more battles while introducing new characters. One may find that the way the story unfolds in this show is quite repetitive. However, if you're a fan of war stories with occasionally comedic situations and intelligent strategies to undermine the enemy you will most likely overlook the lack of variation. Despite what has been said, Utawarerumono also has a number of twists and turns (especially in the second half of the show) that should keep the viewer glued to their chairs long enough to see the story through.AnimationAnimation is both a positive and negative point in Utawarerumono. While the animation actually animates the characters in combat (compared to other anime that may just use still images and lines to indicate action) with a good amount of detail, recycled animation occurs. The reused animation is unfortunately quite noticeable (although not too frequent) and may detract one's enjoyment of the battles. The CG animation present in this show is a mixed bag. Some may like it, some may not. Either way, the CG is only used occasionally so it shouldn't be a huge issue. Character designs are more or less consistent, detailed and interesting, albeit one (or more) episode(s) may have the characters looking slightly more odd then usual due to different animators.SoundSound is also quite a mixed bag; you may like it or hate it. The opening song is quite catchy, although there is nothing particularly memorable about it. The ending song also proves to have a unique flair to it, with the overall tone of the music befitting the ambiance of this anime. As Utawarerumono contains a number of battle scenes, the background music does well in giving out the proper mood that is needed to set atmosphere of the show. The voice acting is decent, with no one really standing out but with everyone befitting their character.CharacterUtawarerumono being a harem anime contains the usual female stock characters that you would find from other harems. The serious one, the flirtatious one, the cute one, the shy one and etc. However, due to the majority of the show focusing on war, thankfully most of the female characters are not just part of the harem and play a role in the story. Not every character is developed, most likely due to time constraints (although I'm not sure whether the original game developed the ones missed out in this show). Thankfully the main character and a number of other major characters are given some development and time to flesh out their backgrounds.EnjoymentAs for why I enjoyed Utawarerumono - I have natural bias against anything that would be considered a harem anime, but the nicely animated action scenes and character designs won this series over for me. Storywise I thought most of the show didn't really offer much, but I was quite suprised towards the second half of the show where a number of twists were thrown in, making the overall story of this anime much more interesting. I also found almost all the characters to be likeable, except for the certain few which are obviously meant to be hated by the viewers. I only wish some other characters besides the ones given time were developed more properly.OverallOverall, Utawarerumono manages to deliver an enjoyable package to the casual anime viewer. One may desire to watch this show more then once due to the presence of foreshadowing and a good amount of the background story told in different episodes. Either way, Utawarerumono has a little bit of everything for everyone. It has fan service-like scenes and characters, a large amount of intense action scenes and an intriguing and somewhat deep plot for those seeking something less mindless and profound. It may not prove to be strong in any given area, but it delivers a show that should leave most anime fans somewhat satisfied with what they've just seen. of battles, battles and even more battles while introducing new characters.

I&rsquo;m not usually into science fiction/supernatural anime series, so I wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to anything when I started watching Utawarerumono. However, I was proven wrong. Utawarerumono was just so exciting and fun to watch and I really liked it &ndash; 4/5 of the 26 episodes. For the last 1/5, I didn&rsquo;t like it too much. I don&rsquo;t wanna give out any spoilers, so I&rsquo;ll just say that the last arc was too weird and it didn&rsquo;t register.All the characters were really likable and I felt sorry for them whenever another war or battle emerges. It&rsquo;s...a good thing they laugh and make me laugh now and then. My favorite was Oboro &ndash; I loved watching him fight alongside Dori and Gura, the adorable twins. I love Touka too. I&rsquo;m still wishing that he&rsquo;s secretly a guy so my crush on Touka would be justified, but that will never happen. Aruruu was just so adorable and I like her WAY more than her older sister Eruruu. I just find Eruruu a bit weak and bland. I really didn&rsquo;t like the idea of Hakuoro and Eruru as a couple. It&rsquo;s just too weird since Aruruu thinks of him as her dad. The villains were also as irritating as the main characters are likable. They really convinced me to hate them.Animation was above average. Everything was well drawn and surprisingly, I&rsquo;m OK with the earthy color palette. The CG is something I have to think about. It&rsquo;s not bad, but it&rsquo;s not good either. It reminds me of early PlayStation1 video game graphics, similar to Suikoden 2&rsquo;s graphics. The fight scenes were impressive (and exciting) &ndash; I love how the characters move swiftly and smoothly when fighting.I&rsquo;m not familiar with most of the voice actors, but they were all very impressive. I have to admit that I was iffy with Hakuoro&rsquo;s voice at first, since I thought it was too manly and old for him, but in the end it turned out well. Everyone was able to bring out their respective character&rsquo;s personalities and that is what&rsquo;s important.As a stand alone, I probably won&rsquo;t like the music that much. It&rsquo;s because the music was really tailored for the series. If I&rsquo;m gonna enjoy the music, I have to watch Utawarerumono along with it. On that note, I really love the opening theme. Whenever I watch Utawarerumono I just have to sing along with it. The BGM was good too. Most of it sounded tribal, for lack of a better word, which also went well with the theme and feel of the series. I also noticed that the music, although it sounds tribal and almost authentic, it would have sounded better if it was less synthesized.It almost made my favorites list if it weren&rsquo;t for the last 4-5 episodes that were too weird for me.

Usually I think average guy, a bunch of overly cute unattainable girls and some kind of story arc surrounding each girl. However Utawarerumono disregards this overused high school romantic formula, with girls that require conquering like a RPG boss and goes for a more fascinating approach.Utawarerumono is an Action Adventure set in a world of Fantasy. Just think Lord of the Ring, but minus the Ring and Hobbits. Following the disturbing opening scene, we our introduced to our protagonist, a mysterious masked man with no recollection of who he is and why...he has an immovable mask on his face. Now this amnesia plot device is one of the most over used but taking into account that this is based of a visual novel, it’s certainly a good way for the player to start off with a clean slate. Now as for the story, a good amount of time is spent bringing this fantasy world to life, in what looks to be a very mild mannered series. But soon after being lulled into a false sense of security, the story develops into that of a war between nations. So instead of harem filled romance you can expect bloody battle after battle, in an ever developing storyline. Sure it would have been better if more thought was put into how to kick start this warfare plot but as a whole, the series did prove to be very exciting to watch. If only it remained that way throughout however in the last batch of episodes you’ll witness one of the most thoughtless plot developments ever, which did a good enough job in ruining whatever impression I had of the series.The male protagonist did suffer from this drastic change but before that he was a really interesting and mysterious character. It’s a great thing seeing him develop from a nameless nobody to a charismatic figure and the other characters that gravitate towards him certainly have their own appeal or role in the story. Not to forget the female characters, who are what make it this an obvious adaptation from a visual novel but that isn’t really a bad thing. The only negative aspect is the few really stupid and annoying characters (the Emperors) that stifle the quality of this anime.The quality of the animation is really good as there’s a fair amount of detail put into the characters and environments with some good water, fire & smoke effects. Yet a lot of corners were cut, like when it came to animating the fight scenes. At times it just looked cheap, with a lot of recycled scenes and who could forget the poorly implemented CGI character models in the armies. At least the music is truly special as it manages to go well with the anime, especially during the battles or when it is building up to something epic and I am particularly fond of the ending theme (R.I.P Eri Kawai).Overall Utawarerumono turned out to be a great Fantasy, Action, Adventure that pulled off a tale about one man and his journey onto greatness. There is quite a lot going for this show to get anyone into it, like the way the characters interact with one another and how the battles & politics were handled. Personally I was disappointed by the number of flaws that plagued the show, from the corners cut in animation, to the terribly erratic pacing and the few stupid decisions the characters made. But none of that really compares to how appalling the last couple episodes were handled. If you can overlook these then you’ll enjoy it.^_^ he has an immovable mask on his face. Now this amnesia plot device is one of the most over used but taking into account that this is based of a visual novel, it’s certainly a good way for the player to start off with a clean slate. Now as for the story, a good amount of time is spent bringing this fantasy world to life, in what looks to be a very mild mannered series. But soon after being lulled into a false sense of security, the story develops into that of a war between nations. So instead of harem filled romance you can expect bloody battle after battle, in an ever developing storyline. Sure it would have been better if more thought was put into how to kick start this warfare plot but as a whole, the series did prove to be very exciting to watch. If only it remained that way throughout however in the last batch of episodes you’ll witness one of the most thoughtless plot developments ever, which did a good enough job in ruining whatever impression I had of the series.The male protagonist did suffer from this drastic change but before that he was a really interesting and mysterious character. It’s a great thing seeing him develop from a nameless nobody to a charismatic figure and the other characters that gravitate towards him certainly have their own appeal or role in the story. Not to forget the female characters, who are what make it this an obvious adaptation from a visual novel but that isn’t really a bad thing. The only negative aspect is the few really stupid and annoying characters (the Emperors) that stifle the quality of this anime.The quality of the animation is really good as there’s a fair amount of detail put into the characters and environments with some good water, fire & smoke effects. Yet a lot of corners were cut, like when it came to animating the fight scenes. At times it just looked cheap, with a lot of recycled scenes and who could forget the poorly implemented CGI character models in the armies. At least the music is truly special as it manages to go well with the anime, especially during the battles or when it is building up to something epic and I am particularly fond of the ending theme (R.I.P Eri Kawai).Overall Utawarerumono turned out to be a great Fantasy, Action, Adventure that pulled off a tale about one man and his journey onto greatness.

 in all honesty i would have given it a 9.5 however that is not possible on this site.  it deserves a 9 because while the animation is awesome a few animated sequences are repeated.  not enough to ruin the show but enough to slightly obvious. nevertheless i wish i could shake the hands of the animators for such quality work(i know how hard it is to animate combat so full battles deserves serious credit).sound:10/10the quality of sound is great in this anime.  it has a great soundtrack which seriously sets the mood for the series.  timing is perfect throughout(steel clashes when it should and lip snch is right on).  the opening theme and ending theme are specially tailored for the show and as such are not cheesey j-pop singles.  they fit the show and are catchy.  often i find myself humming them at random times.  i feel the need to get the OST(if i can find it).  the voice acting is simply amazing.  all of the voice actors fit their respective characters perfectly and bring out the personality and emotion very well.  all in all the selection of the cast was great.the english dubbed version was a different story enirely.  the dub sucked...badly. it was on par with the naruto dub(maybe worse) believe it!  i couldnt even make it through the first episode. watch it in japanese(with subs) or not at all. the dub is that bad.character:10/10the character set for this show is explained quite deeply throughout the show.  each character has their own distinct personality(except dori and gura, they share) and background.  as such when certain characters die(not telling who) the viewer is feeling every bit of the emotion and grief rolling off the screen by the characters.  since the show is based of a eroge(harem themed) there is the stereotypical female cast(shy, tomboyish, innocent, sisterlike, etc.) as well as the shounen cast(warriors all, nuff said)  while some characters are obviously designed to be the object of hatred from the viewers and others are your run of the mill expendable characters(*cough* soldiers), many are unforgettable characters whose personalities are things to be desired in other anime.enjoyement:10/10i personaly enjoyed this anime a lot.  so much so im going to buy the DVD when i get the chance.  i like shoujo anime(yes im a romance junkie) and i enjoy shounen(battle and blood woohoo) and i must say this anime is my cup of tea.  everything i like sitting before me like a buffet.  i loved it.overall:10/10it is as i said before, a crowd pleaser.  if you like comedy, romance, drama, harem, war.  give this one a shot. eroge game the  plot reflects the harem it was created after and adds romance to the story.  however as war and combat are just as prevailant it is my decision not to characterise this as a shounen or a shoujo anime.  it is both.  the fact that it managed to pull off such a feat so masterfuilly has earned it a 10 in my book.Art:9/10the art is one of the best qualities of this anime.  all the characters are drawn consistantly well with no mistakes throughout the series.  character emotions are very vivid as are the landscapes.  the true beauty of this anime is the battle sequences though.  in most anime the animators will show still images depicting large scale combat.  this anime however went all out and animated entire battle scenes with hundreds of soldiers(with extremely few art flaws) without lagging.  this in itself was a feat of epic proportions.  now you may be wondering...why did it only get a 9?

The thing is, it will touch you in ways your emotions have never been touched before, or ways that will surprise you. Some of you might have heard of this show from the game of the same name released in 2002. The game is listed as an ‘adult tactical role-playing visual novel’ (that’s a mouthful of itself) by a company called Leaf. For those not into gaming lingo, a tactical role-playing game is a type of video game where you have role-playing and strategy into one game. I believe ‘Final Fantasy Tactics’ falls...down that same sort of line if I was to use a more well known title. Visual Novels on the other hand have a game play that is more based on amazing graphics and almost a ‘choose your own adventure’ aspect. And if we are going to break apart the genre even more, Adult really means that there are some rather ‘erotic’ points or that it is full of violence. The reason why I am breaking this down for you is because Utawarerumono was based off this really interesting genre and though I have not played the game, I feel that from what little I have seen, it sticks rather close to the idea of it.The whole story is based around a man named Hakuoro, or at least that’s the name they call him. He is a man who lost his memory and can’t even remember who he is or why he has a mask on his face that will not come off. I know what you’re thinking, ‘She calls everything a stereotype so she probably will call this a stereotype as well’. The truth is your right. I will call this a stereotype but in this case, I think it actually works rather well to a point. There are major spoilers that will help answer why he lost them and it’s not just a bump on the head, but for the reasons they do give us it just does work for this type of story line. Since it’s based off of a game series, the main character is normally the one we play as. For this, it seems logical to have that character not know anything about his past in order to explain why he would select an answer to a question in the way he does. It also helps you learn more of his past through his eyes. I do understand why people use it, but it is over used.Going back to Hakuoro, his personality is sort of bland. Sure he acts like a true leader, someone clothed in mystery and experience beyond his years, but sadly that seems to be the only thing that he has. That is sort of the ‘point’ where the stereotype point doesn’t seem to want to work. You can give a person amnesia and have him still have a personality, but here he just seems like a cardboard cut out with how serious he takes things all the time… until a point. You see, this show has a strange way of making everything that happens as a spoiler so it’s hard to talk about. I can say though that at that point you really do see the layers of Hakuoro that are really in depth. Where up until that point, he seems as though he is the perfect person in the world and then it makes you think he might not be that perfect after all.The next characters are the two sisters that act as his adopted family. It doesn’t seem right introducing them separate as they are so close. We will start with the youngest first I think. Aruru is a rather fun loving girl although we start out with her being rather timid. She has a really shy personality that makes me smile whenever I see her acting so curious. There really isn’t much else about her except that she acts her age. She is a really believable little girl who I think might be around 6 or 7 years old. Eruru on the other hand is a very motherly figure. She cares not only for Aruru but for everyone around her. She is so many things that its surprising such a young girl can do all the things she does. She’s not only a big sister to Aruru but she consoles Haruoro whenever he is torn between his discussions, calms those that need to be calmed, heals those who are sick both inside her group of friends and outside in the town, and somehow is still able to manage herself. I am surprised she doesn’t break, making what she proclaims in the first episode ‘country girls are strong’ make a lot of sense.Now there are so many characters in this show that it is really hard to talk about every single one of them. Most of them are even spoilers for parts of the show which makes this review a living nightmare to try to do without spoiling anything. So instead of talking about the rest of the characters, I guess I will use this area to talk about the setting of the show. The show is based loosely around an indigenous people from Japan known as the Ainu (Aynu). Think of them as the Native American’s of Japan (in a very very loose based way). They hunted and gathered their food, lived in small communities, and had a culture that was very based on the land. If you look at Haruoro’s name, it actually is an Ainu word that I believe loosely means “White Emperor” (I am not an Ainu nor do I know how to speak Ainu, it’s something I found online). They mixed the Ainu culture with a Feudal Japan culture in order to make a rather interesting war torn country, much like in historic times. The only difference is that in the show, everyone (except for Haruoro it seems) is an anthropomorphic creature. They have the bodies of humans with ears and tails (or wings) of an animal. Many of the strange things seem to point to it being an alternate timeline to our own but every once in a while, they sneak in a bit of technology that doesn’t seem to make any sense. It just adds to the mystery.This show has a strange way of jumping up and down a lot. As was stated many times before now, this is a show based on the rise and fall of nations doing battle. As such, there are many different battles that are fought through the course of the series. Between each battle however, we are given a couple small breaks between the actions. These can be as boring as political debates on the next course of action to a slice of life following the lovable antics of Aruru and her friends. I think part of this is to show exactly how war is carried out, but also I just think it’s partly for our psychological relief. This show is 26 episodes long; if we had a battle that lasted that whole time, we would be up in arms the whole time wanting our side to win. We wouldn’t have time to get into the characters heads, no time for us to become emotionally connected to them, to hear the story of their past, to understand why they are fighting. These breaks do give us that time to get to know them, and sometimes to introduce new characters.The animation is so beautiful at times, and then we will get points that just seem rather standard. Backgrounds are always so detailed and colored so amazing that it’s hard to notice the little things that don’t look quite right though. There are small times that the show used CG to show off some of the action scenes but I don’t blame them. The fact that this is a battle heavy anime means that there are a ton of extras that would have to be drawn over and over again. CG helps cut the corners of this and if done right, it looks really good. I could barely see the differences for the most part between the CG and the animation so I think that is a win on their side. The times they didn’t use the CG stuff was actually rather good as well, with characters movements being rather fluid and not many hiccups in design. I love how for most of the comedy, they kept to the same style as the rest of the show instead of trying to go chibi all the time. One of the main things I found so attractive of this show is the colors they work with. The colors are so vibrant and beautiful but they change the brightness to fit the mood. It can be so bright with fun colors and then suddenly have rather dark deep colors to show a very serious mood.The music has this sort of haunting tone to it that seems to be sad but also a little mysterious. I am not sure if they were trying to match the concept of Hakuoro or just a sort of haunting nature of the people but it worked rather well. Pretty much all of the music besides the opening and the ending song were only instrumental, and captured the mood nicely. I do not know how close it is to Ainu music but it felt like it could be part of it. The English Voice acting I think was right on the mark with a lot of the characters. I sort of fell for Hakuoro’s rather soft and yet forceful voice for some reason. Jogn Gremillian did such a beautiful job making Hakuoro sound like a caring man but also a man who can take charge when it was needed. For what little lines Aruru had, Sasha Paysinger did a very good job with the rather cute voice that actually didn’t get on my nerves at all. For real, it wasn’t a high pitched moe character that normal people do, but a more sweet style that I love. Kira Vincent-Davis did the voice for Eruru, and though it was rather good, I somehow feel a little disappointed in that the character sounds close to others she has done. Also, big props on Vic Mignogna who actually for once in his life played a character that was most of the time serious and didn’t freak out all the time! (Ok, so that might not be exactly true on this being the only character he played like that, but most of his characters do tend to freak out.)This show had very few flaws to it in my opinion, and had to be one of my favorite shows to jump into. You could feel the great chemistry between the characters, the amazing look of the battles, and the rather calming moments of the breaks. down that same sort of line if I was to use a more well known title.

The story follows Hakuoro, who after being found and rescued by a small village he becomes the leader of a rebellion, emperor of a country and then spends his time fight wars with every other country around.A major plot twist happens near the end that was so unexpected and weird that my initial reaction was ""I am just going to pretend that didn\'t happen...""and even when it gets explained...in the end and you no longer have to pretend it didn\'t happen, I was still thinking, ""it could have been better.""Because there were so many ""mini-wars"" they all ultimately blended together because they weren\'t very memorable.

There are some parts of this series that are completely boring as sin.The character designs are pretty enough, but this series, which is based on war, didn\'t have any memorable fight scenes of bad-assery. Seriously, even with the flat characters this would be more entertaining to watch if the characters at least could kick some ass in awesome fights. But the fights were boring and predictable. On the other hand, the characters being completely flat doesn\'t help. It\'s hard to get excited about a fight if you simply don\'t care whether or not a character dies.I always believed that good, well developed characters can carry a plot no matter how contrived it is, but in this case the characters are so bad, you\'re just sitting there thinking ""Who cares?""Honestly, I really liked the opening song for this anime, so it was my favourite part of watching. in the end and you no longer have to pretend it didn\'t happen, I was still thinking, ""it could have been better.""Because there were so many ""mini-wars"" they all ultimately blended together because they weren\'t very memorable.

I know this would seem kind of shallow-minded to anyone that may like this series. But considering mostly every prominent character in this series has some sort of animal ears and tail plus look ridiculously cute or physically attractive (along with this anime being an eroge strategy game adaptation), I rest my case with these two words being uttered.For the most part, Utawarerumono\'s characters and plot developments are pretty formulaic and straight-forward. The series runs into several arcs with Hakuoro and his...allies running into some hostile enemy threat trying to either halt his revolt or take over his kingdom, Hakuoro coming up with a clever plan to halt said threat, gaining new allies from offing said threat and then a breather episode with comedy highlights coming from the quirks of the characters or everyday scenes with Hakuoro, Eruru and Aruru. While the first arc was okay with Hakuoro leading the commoners to revolt against their corrupt glutton of a ruler, the later arcs do get monotonous with their developments with every country in sight seemingly wanting a piece of Hakuoro and his kingdom for shallow reasons.Character development with new characters in these arcs is limited to their appearances in said arcs and once they become one of Hakuoro\'s allies, their roles become mostly downplayed to being loyal soldiers to Hakuoro when they participate in a battle. Other than Hakuoro and a few major characters, you don\'t get to see too many developments with these ass-kicking characters after they become one of his comrades, which is kind of a shame as a couple of them had their interesting traits and backgrounds during their debut arcs, mainly Oboro and Touka. A number of the major villains confronted in these arcs are so over-the-top and ridiculous with their appearance, behavior and/or mannerisms that they are laughable, especially Hauenkua who reminds me enough of how nuts Escaflowne\'s Dilandau was.The other prominent focus of the series is on Hakuoro\'s mysterious past which the series drops hints of in the not-so-entertaining later arcs of the show. Amnesiac hero storylines normally have a good amount of potential in unveiling some interesting developments for said main hero and a show\'s plot. But while Hakuoro\'s character is an interesting and likeable one, what I come to learn of his origins and background comes across as quite a big contradiction to the type of world Utawarerumono had set up throughout its run.Visually, the series does sport good looking scenery and characters (despite the latter\'s clear ""appeal"") with vivid colors and a decent amount of detail applied to them. The show\'s animation is average at many points with occasional use of shortcuts and some bad use of CG animation in the rendering of armies during battle scenes.While I did get some enjoyment out of seeing Hakuoro and some other characters in their struggles throughout Utawarerumono, the show\'s cliched plot setup, weak focus on other prominent characters and ridiculous reveal on Hakuoro\'s origins greatly weakened the quality of the series in my eyes.

While the first arc was okay with Hakuoro leading the commoners to revolt against their corrupt glutton of a ruler, the later arcs do get monotonous with their developments with every country in sight seemingly wanting a piece of Hakuoro and his kingdom for shallow reasons.Character development with new characters in these arcs is limited to their appearances in said arcs and once they become one of Hakuoro\'s allies, their roles become mostly downplayed to being loyal soldiers to Hakuoro when they participate in a battle. Other than Hakuoro and a few major characters, you don\'t get to see too many developments with these ass-kicking characters after they become one of his comrades, which is kind of a shame as a couple of them had their interesting traits and backgrounds during their debut arcs, mainly Oboro and Touka.

This explanation as an answer to the mystery that surrounds the anime until about a half is somewhat disappointing, in my opinion. E gives rise to a final ultra-romantic, and so very unpleasant.However, the idea made me reflect. It was another anime that I felt sick to finish. Not as much as X, but almost. It\'s a sad ending (after all, it\'s ultra-romantic), in which many are hit and confirms that a destination of suffering for one of the main characters. Something forceful means to an anime that will gradually captivating, at least until the...middle of the plot. Once captivated, feel more impacts with those fictitious persons.The reflection reminded me a bit of Nietzsche, the Greek philosophers of antiquity and also Milan Kundera, in his novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being A concept I never studied law: the eternal return.The idea that I could infer the eternal return, which may be distorted with respect to the above references conceived, but I built up here has the following premise: we carry our past. The drama of Hakuoro, the anime, is precisely that of not remembering his past, not knowing what he carries. A drama that becomes more painful to the extent that he suspects not to remember his past. But how to get rid of it?How Karura says, ""it is impossible to completely disconnect from the past."" As it becomes worse for a god who returns to experience several lives forever? The hidden horror of the anime Utawarerumono is something that resembles the curse of Dracula in Bram Stoker\'s novel. It is the inescapable destiny to live forever, forever come back to life.Milan Kundera says in his most famous novel by celebrated and that is the French Revolution, for example, how would react if we were to repeat it forever, always cutting heads, an eternal return? What would be the weight of it? Einmal ist keinmal, says the German adage (""once is never""). There is a mystique around binarity, and very curious. It is as if there were only two numbers, where one equals zero, and the rest reaches infinity. The light would live once, only once, so that the experience would equal to nothing, perhaps because it is something finite in an infinite time. Interestingly, I remember having spoken about equality of existence and nonexistence. I ended up dropping it again somehow. The heavy, in turn, would live forever, forever returning to live. Again, I remember having mentioned the question of ""whether or not a story to an end."" The target heavy does not give us that chance.In Utawarerumono, does not explain how these gods were born. They may have arisen from mere humans. It is possible that they, the gods are nothing but ourselves. It is possible that we humans, for which accumulate more knowledge, nothing more than able to awaken the consciousness of the eternal return which we are stuck.If it\'s terrible for a man found in the woods, injured, not remembering his days until then, how terrible it would be for us to be in the same situation? Assuming then that there is something like an afterlife, or something that brings us back to an experience ... how terrible it would be to ignore the past that pervaded by several lifetimes? Worse, how terrible would not realize that we are beginning to remember that?Although the chance of revival can not be disputed, we need not go that far. Simply we exchange of god. Just think that the god in question is not a human being, but humanity itself. As a member of humanity, can we, each of us, off the streets, watching the sky, hit the ground and even see how we treat each other and still say that what others have done before us has nothing to see us?Assume then that humanity is the god who is destined to fight with himself, guiding other beings with their power. God attached to the eternal return. Coincidence or not, Hakuoro is the only fully human person, ie, does not have ears or tails of animals like all other characters. The difference is that Hakuoro has a mask that can not get out. The question is if that mask is the hallmark of the link between apes and humans or whether technological remnant of an advanced civilization that perished - we do not have the answer to the curse which it represents (not sure if Benawi also not human, what would the only odd exception, as I remember). When this god despair, crushed by his fate, would be annihilated. But not even the black winged angel, created by him, Mutsumi, can do it.Assuming then that we, all of us, this god. What do you think? It is a god that is divided in two because it indulges in his wrath, and will pay for this act forever as the eternal return will bring back the anger. Every act is heavy.

What shall we do with the sins of mankind? What awaits us?If everything was light ... live with ease. Eruru not carry the suffering that comes from the Mikoto, Hakuoro could live without mask. Bastaríamos live with and hope our story will end. So would fly over our destinies. And we would be so light and so scattered, like cirrus clouds.

Anyone that seriously has a passion for action/adventure anime will be fooled and disappointed with the ratings and genre.Concept: 8/10If there is anything good about this anime, it is the concept of the plot....The story briefly is about an injured man with a wierd mask that is saved by the people of a small village, that man suffers with amnesia and that village quickly becomes his home. Because of his wisdom and kindness, he quickly becomes the leader and then his forgotten past begins to haunt him. The anime involves many war sequences, some strategies involved, loyalties, betrayals and violence. Sounds like a good concept for a action/adventure lover.Enjoyment/Characters: 5/10The director of the anime did come up with a good concept, but failed miserably in translating a good concept to enjoyment. I thought the potential of a very good concept was totally wasted.The main character in the anime suits perfectly for this kind of story, the major problem is some of the characters that surround him. There is very little character development and everyone else just pops out of the blue, you will know very little about every major character of the anime by the time you finish.The plot is purely for simpleminded people, trust me, there is NOTHING genius about this anime. It had little to no twists and turns in the plot, everything seemed predictable. There are NO scenes where you will be amazed, there are NO scenes where you will get fired up. The whole concept of war is made a joke.There is no humor in the anime, some will say there is some, but that is for simpleminded ones. There is absolutely NO humor in the anime and the very little efforts of humor add to the problems.Be prepared for some very annoying characters that are sadly major characters in the anime, a female girl named Eruru and her little sister Aruru. The main character of the series (Hakuoro) is looked upon as father by the little sister Aruru while the older sister Eruru loves him. In one of the middle episodes of the anime, Hakuoro tells  publicly that Eruru is like his sister, yet Eruru continues to love him. There is excessive romance between Hakuoro and Eruru, by romance I mean situations that involve Eruru showing her love, but Hakuoro showing indifference to her love. I personally could not take a pseudo incest relationship, every episode will have some.Then you have moronic scenes that do not make any sense. Eruru and Aruru care a lot about Hakuoro and will insist on accompanying him to the wars and he agrees. I am talking about roughly a 17 year old girl with no fighting skills that wants to stay close to her lover at any cost and a 8 year old girl that just does not want to stay away from her dad even for few hours. They both accompany him to wars where there is massive killing happening around them, hardcore I mean. These kind of situations will make you feel ""I could have done a better job directing this"".The art was good for the most part, but the fight sequences could have been better.By end of the day I did not learn anything from this anime, dropped watching a couple of times in middle and still picked up because I had nothing else to watch, ultimately repented for the time I invested.

After the first episode I sought myself wanting more and more and then before i realized it i had finished all 26 episodes.-The story was quite interesting as well. I thought to myself why the heck would i want to watch an anime about a guy who cant remember his past and is unable to take off a mask that had no meaning throughout the story?(minor spoiler) Anyways when I continued on through the anime I was gaining more and more knowledge about what the meaning of his...mask and his life overall and what had happened to him in the past. Its kind of hard for me to explain exactly what i liked about the story without giving you a spoiler. All i can say is dont judge a book by its cover. This show is very entertaining and will have you wanting more just like it did me.-The art was the probably the best thing about this show. I was very intrigued by the art form that made up the anime. The characters and setting were all very very well done. My favorite aspect of the art was that it really brought out old and modern Japanese culture. Watch this anime and you will be amazed by how astonishing the artwork is.-The sound was well done as well. I cannot compare it to the subbed version because i only watched the dubbed. If i do get around to rewatching this show i will watch it in the subbed version and then update this post. Anyways theres not much to say about the sound because it was really good the actors did a good job and  the songs that were played  were very suited to be in this anime.-The characters were all great. I loved all of them. They were very well designed and brought something new to the table whenever there was a new character introduced. They were all very skilled warriors and made the battles very entertaining.-My enjoyment as you can tell by the rating its pretty high. I never saw myself losing interest in this show. Everything from the action to the melo drama that was introduced kept me very entertained. If you give this show a shot you will not be disappointed!!-Overall. As you can tell my ratings and statements you can see that i love this show. Everything came together nicely and concluded with a good ending that i was very satisfied with.Thanks for reading this review I hope this somewhat helps you decide to give this show a shot. mask and his life overall and what had happened to him in the past.

However the story can be fully understand by watching the anime, but for truly understand every character i suggest to play the videogame wich is fan translated in english.ART: The animation is quite good, nothing outstanding, the computer graphic animation are crappy and seem to be out of place.SOUND: the sound is quite good too, Op and Ed are nice, sound effect are good, and the insert song are realy sweetCHARACTER: Nekomiki's heaven! if you like this kind of character then Utawarerumono...will be an Harem for you, anyway every character is portrayed very well, but because of the summarized story, some character tend to be rather vagueENJOYMENT: Utawarerumono will glue you on your chair, the story go on in a fast pace, sad and funny moments will kept the tension on good levelsOVERALL: Utawarerumono is a good anime, addictive and fun to watch, some defect however ruin the overall quality, otherwise Utawarerumono would be a masterpiece will be an Harem for you, anyway every character is portrayed very well, but because of the summarized story, some character tend to be rather vagueENJOYMENT: Utawarerumono will glue you on your chair, the story go on in a fast pace, sad and funny moments will kept the tension on good levelsOVERALL: Utawarerumono is a good anime, addictive and fun to watch, some defect however ruin the overall quality, otherwise Utawarerumono would be a masterpiece"", ""This is such an awesome show...I really was not expecting this show to be  as good as it was but maybe by everyone saying it was 'so good' you might pick up this series thinking it's this EPIC masterpiece of an anime like a ROBOTECH, Cowboy Bebop or Fullmetal Alchemist....when it really isn't. So I don't think you should let you expectations go overboard either.  I'm just saying that if maybe you see the cute dog-boys and cat-girls and bird people and that's not your thing or you think “great this is one of those shows!” where everything is all cutesy lovely, then...yes you will be surprised.....because this show is definitely not cutesy and lovely.The art is very good. This show offers some nice-looking characters and there is great use of colors. They did reuse some of the fight scenes, especially the one where the lead character, Haruko, does this killer move with his fan/weapon...which kind of felt like deja vu. But scene looping and stuff doesn't annoy me unless they really over do it and I don't think it will bother you either unless that's your pet peeve. There is good animation movement in this series and you can tell that there was some CG work used as well because the way some of the battle scenes were laid out and how the camera panned or the way the lizard-horses were moving. It was all very cool.This show seems to have an all star cast when it comes the voice actors, I see a lot of names from a lot of other series. I really am not good with voices and names except for a very limited few, but these names I have seen the a lot of times from shows like Inuyasha and FullMetal Alchemist. They are all very good actors and they make watched dubbed shows very enjoyable. The music is OK but not really a 'must have' or anything. The best song for me is probably the ending song probably because I don't know if I would classify it as J-POP or Rock or what, but it sounds good though.From the very beginning you will get hooked because it is kind of a mystery, the lead character has amnesia and he does not know who, what or where he is not even his name. Anyway that's how I got hooked, I saw episode one on Anime Channel's VoD and I needed to know how it turned out. I think a lot of people who are into action and military type of anime will also like this one! There are a lot of brutal battle scenes with blood and violence, these are always pluses for me when it comes to selecting anime shows to watch, but you might as well know that it does get pretty gruesome. There is also some comedy in there, so this is really not a really heavy hard-hitting series or anything. One main issue I have with the story though is that there seems to be no essence of time. It could be 5 minutes, 5 years or 5 months the show doesn't really have a firm grasp of depicting time passing. You get the feeling that some time has passed somewhat but then again, just how much time...no one knows.I'm not into cat-bird-people or beast-people too much, I like just plain human looking people, but this was tolerable. It's not like they had complete tiger faces or Minotaurs or anything like that, thank goodness. The were relatively attractively drawn people and they all had nice personalities, especially the core group of characters. Just like how I was talking about the strange “time-warping” issue that occurs with the story narrative, you can really get that sense with some of the characters popping in for a bit then poof they disappear and their side of the story seems unresolved or maybe kinda rushed.I really liked this show though, mainly because it so very much surprised me as to the type of anime I thought it was going to be. I really thought it was just going to be some fluffy nice [shoujo-style] anime and it wound up being this fantastic, gritty and gory series. That really changed my opinion of this show, but maybe it might freak you out if you are not into that kind of show, yes you will be surprised.....because this show is definitely not cutesy and lovely.The art is very good.

The plot may seem to repeat at times but it's just building up to some mind blowing plot twists in the end, I assure you, you won't see it coming. The plot has everything, massive battles won by brilliant strategies, amazing character interaction and a romance plot that you actually care about, I was never once bored and simply hoping that the episode would just finish so like so many animes do. It's so good that I was depressed when the anime was over...simply because it ended.Art: The artwork is simply gorgeous, it really sets the fantasy setting and brings life to the character. I have never seen any other anime with a art style just like this so that is simply a bonus. The characters (at least the important ones) all have a distinctive look that really fits there character. If there is one flaw in this anime is they will repeat animations during battles at times but it is never enough to take away from the enjoyment of watching the animeSound: The sound is incredible, both the music and voice acting is done spectacularly well, I can only say this for the Japanese version for I never watch an anime in English if I can help it. There is no character who whenever they open their mouth you flinch because it's so annoying or and thank god there are no &quot;Believe It&quot;'s to speak of. The voice acting is definitely some of the best I have ever heard and that brings a lot of emotion into the story. The lip syncing is never of an the soundtrack is simply incredible, the music always fits the mood perfectly and it doesn't get old, if I could get the soundtrack I would never stop listening to it.Character: While the plot is amazing, the art is gorgeous and the sound is incredible, what really makes this anime the best anime ever (in my own humble opinion of course) is the characters. Unlike in most animes where I find myself liking only a couple of the characters and just apathy towards the rest of the characters I genuinely care about each and every character. These are characters who, if I met them in real life, I would look up to and want to be friends with. I found myself getting depressed because something bad happened to one of the main characters and happy simply because they were happy. And I'm not one of the people that happens to that often, each character has their own subplots and each is there own character, you don't go yeah, just another sasuke fan girl, except for twins each character is their own character and you won't see characters like Hakuoro in any anime but Utawarerumuno. The character interaction is the best I've seen in any anime and like I said before the romance subplot is the best I've ever seen and one you will genuinely care for.Enjoyment: Well like I said, best anime ever, in fact their is no book, movie or TV show I have enjoyed more than Utawarerumono. The roller coaster of emotions, the beautiful artwork, mind blowing plot and genuine characters will insure you never have a dull moment and will want to rewatch it again, again and again.Overall: Simply put Best Anime Ever simply because it ended.Art: The artwork is simply gorgeous, it really sets the fantasy setting and brings life to the character.

What does…that damn word mean?” Well, after that, the title of the show is translated into English as, “The One Being Sung”, which does describe one of the character’s rise in the series and funny thing about this being based on a videogame and how it was supposed to be a harem, considering I didn’t see the whole harem part in this, but more on that later.A man awakens in an unfamiliar village with no memory of...his past or identity. The only clue: a devil-horned mask which conceals the upper half of his face but cannot be removed. Still recovering from the bad wounds he had when he was found and without any clear direction, the man settles in to village life and soon becomes not only a valued and respected member, but effectively a member of the family of healers – old Tsukuru, young Eruru, and even younger Aruruu – who helped him recover, even taking on the name Hakuoro, which belonged to the long-dead father of the girls. Trouble won’t leave the village alone, however, as a discontented former villager tries to exploit their resources, a tiger-like forest god threatens to rampage, and an unfortunate series of events leads to unintended rebellion. Throughout it all Hakuoro stands as a stoic source of inspiration even though he is deeply troubled by haunting images of his past.I got to say right off the bat; the story does have an interesting plot of an amnesiac main character that probably has a disturbing past of him and he probably does once you get further into the show. There is the aspect of war and how you think everything is going to be fine but it isn’t as worse shit continues to happen to them, deaths that can hit you hard emotionally if you really wanted them to live, and the trials of rebelling against the higher authority. Now, I know this is based on an adventure/role-playing/eroge game (or just Japanese adult visual novel) and I guess like the adaptations of that, you sense no trace of them nor do did I find any typical harem traits aside from the amount of girls there with wolf ears (then again, mostly everybody in the show has either wolf, cat, dog, rabbit, etc. ears) but saying it’s a harem because there’s lots of girls (or guys if it’s a reverse harem) doesn’t exactly make it one (OK: Maybe that one or two times). I will say that it does get too sappy at sometimes but just enough to not be overbearing melodramatic.Characters are 90/10 on the love/hate scale although it is more of an ensemble cast of characters and most of them have these different stories to them, like Hakuoro and his unknown past, why later in the series people thinking he was a murderer and why he can’t take off that mask. I would have like to know more about the sisters Eruru & Aruruu and most of their family life but it was more preoccupied with the long war and all that. Oh yeah, one character that I couldn’t stand in fucking Nuwangi. I just cannot stand that guy and desperately either wanted him easily defeated or killed off. Luckily, he’s not in the show for long but he was still annoying as hell.Animation is actually great here and it’s expected being at the 2006-2007 anime boom year. The show was made by animation studio Oriental Light and Magic, the same studio that did not-so-great animation for a great series (Berserk). Like I said, the show does have a very playful nature to it, but during the battle scenes, expect a lot of bloodshed in there but luckily, it isn’t overly excessive and violence for the sake of being violent. The opening theme is….dangerously catchy to listen to, but you might need to listen to it several times to not forget about it. Overall, the music is fairly decent for what it is.The English dub by ADV Films (later re-licensed by FUNimation) is a great effort done with the script being close to the original source and although there aren’t any standouts, the performances of John Gremillion as Hakuoro and Kira Vincent-Davis as Eruruu deliver some great dialogue.FINAL VERDICT: Utawarerumono is a delightful and ambitious show that has its playful side with the characters and also the more darker-toned and serious side of itself that seems to fit within and since FUNimation rescued it from obscurity, you can easily buy the whole series or watch it on their website if you want.

It’s a watch recommendation from me.', 'To start this off I just want to say that I will attempt to contain any and all spoilers to the ""story"" section of my review.Story: 8/10The story is just as the synopsis states: Utawarerumono is based on a masked man with amnesia who wakes up in a strange new world. Just reading this synopsis may make some people think that Utwarerumono is simply your typical shounen story where the protagonist recovers his memory half way into the story and he broods over his past in which he did something he regrets to a loved one. However, this couldn\'t be farther from the truth. I\'m...going to go out and say that yes, Hakuoro does recover his memory somewhere throughout the story but the main drama surrounding him is him struggling to grasp just who he was. I won\'t go into details here but there are a few twists in which the audience couldn\'t possibly expect surrounding just who Hakuoro is and what he was doing prior to being found by Eruruu. There are some things that aren\'t covered in the anime such as why Kamyu sucked Aruruu\'s blood and honestly you\'re better off not knowing since the answer is strange and may ruin her character for certain people.Right up until the ending there is information that may mess with your view of the world that Utawarerumono has created and about who Hakuoro is.Art: 9/10My view on the art of this series may differ from other reviews as I had watched the Blu-ray version in which animation studios fix mistakes and improve the overall quality of the animation at times.The art in this series looked fantastic all the way through from the backgrounds to the characters in the foreground. There were a few times when a character\'s face wasn\'t directly in view that the face or character looked like a blob of scribbles but the times this happened could be counted on one hand. The animation was smooth however once or twice animation was reused entirely. An example of this is in the later episodes in which Hakuoro is fighting off a few soldiers with his fan and less than five minutes later the exact same fight sequence is played again for whatever reason.Sound: 8/10The music and sound quality for this series was very well done. During battle sequences it felt like you were there and could hear the swords clank next to you. The village scenes felt very serene and calming and the town scenes felt like you were in the center of a bustling street with street vendors talking over one another and everything.One complaint though is that there was only one opening sequence for every episode and it gave several major spoilers including all of the major villains for the entire show.Character: 9/10The characters in this show were varied and didn\'t all follow standard tropes laid out for them. Hakuoro who is normally the calm monotone person has several outbreaks of emotion and character. Of course some characters such as Oboro fit their character tropes to a t. My biggest complaint regarding characters though has to do with Mukkuru. Mukkuru is a white tiger and the pet/friend of Aruruu. However, Mukkuru displays the opposite behaviours that a cat would display. For example, when Mukkuru is happy he may wag his tail similar to a dog; however, when a cat wags it\'s tail that doesn\'t mean ""I\'m happy"" it means more along the lines of ""I\'m angry/annoyed"".Enjoyment: 10/10I\'m honestly a bit mad at myself for watching this show. I enjoyed it so much that I haven\'t been able to enjoy some shows that have been on my backlog as I can\'t help but say ""Utawarerumono did ____ better"". I\'m not even sure how I came across this show but I am glad I found it as it is among my top 10 for sure.Overall: 9/10Utawarerumono is not perfect and thus it does not deserve a perfect score. However, the show is very good and I would recommend it to anyone that likes fantasy or anime about war. going to go out and say that yes, Hakuoro does recover his memory somewhere throughout the story but the main drama surrounding him is him struggling to grasp just who he was.

However, the show is very good and I would recommend it to anyone that likes fantasy or anime about war.', 'Utawarerumono was the progenitor to Kemono Friends; the plot for the famous mobile game franchise is actually near-identical to Leaf\'s iconic visual novel! The fantasy world is massive and is part of a regressive, post-apocalyptic premise. The character\'s have warring tribes, unique cultures/names, etc. Aquaplus delivered every ounce of writing prowess it could muster when creating this phenomenal story!This review of Utawarerumono is spoiler free!—Story/CharactersSynopsis: An injured man is found in the woods by a girl named Erurū, and everything about him is mysterious. Without knowledge of his past nor even his own name, he is welcomed to Erurū\'s home and is given the...name Hakuoro by her grandmother, and younger sister, Arurū. While the inhabitants of the village have large ears and tails, Hakuoro\'s defining physical trait is quite different as he has neither ears nor tail, but only a mask that he cannot remove. Soon after he becomes a part of the villagers\' lives, a revolution against the tyrannical emperor of the land begins, and the conflict finds its way to his new home. Hakuoro must do whatever he can to save the people and the village that he has come to love, all while uncovering the mysteries that shroud his past.Like Texhnolyze, Utawarerumono is a series that I went into, not sure if I was going to like it at the start, but then ended up developing a deep affection for the franchise! I don\'t say this with very many series, the two that come to mind are Urusei Yatsura and Macross Frontier, but I actually love every single character in this series! Even characters that I was iffy about in the beginning! Like Arurū, she came across as a pertinent child when the series first began, but then she was unraveled and it\'s revealed that she\'s an awkward, genius strategist with interpersonal issues.The characters are all flawed and have their weaknesses, but are incredibly likable in one way or another. I have heard critiques leveraged towards the main character, Hakuoro (or just ""Haku""), for being an amnesiac. But—if you watch the series all the way to the end, you discover that he has a big role as a catalyst that permanently altered the world, so there\'s a reason! He isn\'t just an amnesiac for drama; it greatly serves his purpose in the story.I hadn\'t read any spoilers before going into the story, so I was bamboozled at how deep and intricate the plot became! I watched the first few episode and was like, ""cute kemonomimi girls in a tribal village,"" and then towards the end, I was like, ""this is a serious war drama that is deep, meaningful, and philosophical."" The series starts like Kemono no Shōja Erin and ends like Neon Genesis Evangelion!The series emphasizes the importance of family and community, while showing the horror and destruction that war can bring.—TechnicalTomoki Kobayashi (director, storyboard)* Akame ga Kill!* Amagami SS+ Plus* Hundred* Ichigo 100% (OVA)* Infinite Dendrogram* Seiren* Sola* Tears to TiaraCommentary: Despite the hate that it typically gets from disgruntled fans of the manga, I really enjoyed the last half of Akame ga Kill. I liked Hundred, too, and what I\'ve seen of Tears to Tiara. The directing could be a little jumpy in Utawarerumono, but Tomoki Kobayashi was able to preserve the integrity of the source material. Verdict: Mr. Kobayashi should direct more Aquaplus adaptations!Makoto Uezu (script, series composition)* Aa!

She doesn\'t get as much lines while performing as Yuzuha, but in the instances that she does voice her, the character comes off as very saccharine and blissful.Conclusively, I really am completely captivated with Utawarerumono. There are top-tier seiyū, lush designs, a really well-thought out world, beautiful music, and a story that ends in a crescendo. There\'s a reason that this franchise has continued to live on decades after its release. It\'s such a good, wholesome, and often tragic tale of the trials that a village must go through. I give Utawarerumono an 8.5/10, and strongly suggest it to anyone interested in a dystopian fantasy series!Rating: ★★★★★ name Hakuoro by her grandmother, and younger sister, Arurū. While the inhabitants of the village have large ears and tails, Hakuoro\'s defining physical trait is quite different as he has neither ears nor tail, but only a mask that he cannot remove. Soon after he becomes a part of the villagers\' lives, a revolution against the tyrannical emperor of the land begins, and the conflict finds its way to his new home. Hakuoro must do whatever he can to save the people and the village that he has come to love, all while uncovering the mysteries that shroud his past.Like Texhnolyze, Utawarerumono is a series that I went into, not sure if I was going to like it at the start, but then ended up developing a deep affection for the franchise! I don\'t say this with very many series, the two that come to mind are Urusei Yatsura and Macross Frontier, but I actually love every single character in this series! Even characters that I was iffy about in the beginning! Like Arurū, she came across as a pertinent child when the series first began, but then she was unraveled and it\'s revealed that she\'s an awkward, genius strategist with interpersonal issues.The characters are all flawed and have their weaknesses, but are incredibly likable in one way or another. I have heard critiques leveraged towards the main character, Hakuoro (or just ""Haku""), for being an amnesiac. But—if you watch the series all the way to the end, you discover that he has a big role as a catalyst that permanently altered the world, so there\'s a reason! He isn\'t just an amnesiac for drama; it greatly serves his purpose in the story.I hadn\'t read any spoilers before going into the story, so I was bamboozled at how deep and intricate the plot became! I watched the first few episode and was like, ""cute kemonomimi girls in a tribal village,"" and then towards the end, I was like, ""this is a serious war drama that is deep, meaningful, and philosophical."" The series starts like Kemono no Shōja Erin and ends like Neon Genesis Evangelion!The series emphasizes the importance of family and community, while showing the horror and destruction that war can bring.—TechnicalTomoki Kobayashi (director, storyboard)* Akame ga Kill!* Amagami SS+ Plus* Hundred* Ichigo 100% (OVA)* Infinite Dendrogram* Seiren* Sola* Tears to TiaraCommentary: Despite the hate that it typically gets from disgruntled fans of the manga, I really enjoyed the last half of Akame ga Kill. I liked Hundred, too, and what I\'ve seen of Tears to Tiara. The directing could be a little jumpy in Utawarerumono, but Tomoki Kobayashi was able to preserve the integrity of the source material.

I\'m really hyped about him writing the script for the new Yūki Yūna wa Yūsha de Aru series!I watched Utawarerumono subtitled, so I can\'t comment on the English dub.

There\'s a reason that this franchise has continued to live on decades after its release. It\'s such a good, wholesome, and often tragic tale of the trials that a village must go through. I give Utawarerumono an 8.5/10, and strongly suggest it to anyone interested in a dystopian fantasy series!Rating: ★★★★★', 'Utawarerumono is an incredibly long complicated title that took me forever to pronounce correctly, and it translates to: ""the one being sung"".  I would have never found this anime if it weren\'t for a friend of mine, and I have to say that this could have been one of my favorites had it not have such a terrible ending.  It creates an interesting fantasy setting, it has incredibly likable characters, and if the ending didn\'t have such an awkward tonal and directional shift: this could have been a perfect family animated show.  Like seriously, about halfway I was like: ""finally an anime...that could a appeal to a wide audience that doesn\'t have to be dark, super serious and depressing.""  This anime seems to be underrated, and kind of under the radar, which is a shame because there is a lot to like in this show.Story: 7/10 (good)One thing that is very well done (until the last 6 episodes) in this show is pacing.  Something is always happening, whether it is a new conflict, an interesting hint to a mystery, or some funny and enjoyable interactions between the cast.  This show is very entertaining and I found it hard to get bored.  The setting is established really well.  You will be surprised how attached you become to the small little village you start out in, and when the characters feel at home at the palace, so do you.  This is what separates this fantasy show from others: you feel a sense of attachment to characters that feel real, and to a world that you don\'t want to stop visiting.  Strategy, battles, rallying... everything you need to make a medieval-type fantasy work is done very well.  The battles are very engaging and fun to watch, but its because of HOW its done rather than WHAT is done.  There is a great build up to these fights, and the well executed and clever plans by the protagonist will always put a little smile on your face.  Plus there is always a clear goal, none of the fighting is mindless, there is always some cost or conflict to be invested in.  The plot balances humor and dramatic moments very well, which is essential for the main theme of this anime: family.  No matter how hard things are, you\'ll always find a bright spot in life with family and friends which is what makes these moments between characters so strong.  What kills the narrative is the absolutely terrible last 6 episodes (more on that later), watch up to episode 19 and stop.Characters: 9/10 (fantastic)Easily the strength of the show in my opinion.  The main protagonist Hakuoro is very underrated, and is pretty unique to the anime genre.  He is an adult character that makes adult decisions, which is refreshing from the typical high school protagonist (plus he actually has his shit together, unlike many wimpy underdog male characters).  He has amnesia, which has been done before, but isn\'t often done this well.  What makes his character so compelling is that he stands out in this world precisely because he doesn\'t have memories.  He looks at the world from a completely unbiased perspective, he was never brought up with beliefs (the tiger goddess arc at the beginning illustrates this) or was brought up by society to establish morality.  He develops his own morality based on the kindness of the people around him, and becomes an incredibly relatable character that simply wants to protect the ones that he loves.  The most engaging part of the series was his rise to power.  He didn\'t desire power or conflict, but was forced in a situation where he had to adopt a leadership role, because it was necessary to keep the only life he knew and grew to cherish.  He is a natural leader and a brilliant strategist.  It is a joy to see him outwit his opponents and kick ass with a very impractical but awesome unique weapon that he uses.  The side characters are also great, each with a distinct and memorable personality.  Eruru and Aruru are the characters that stick with Hakuoro and are his family.  Eruru is an incredibly likable tomboy character who is supportive and adopts a very motherly role.  Aruru is shy and cute, but is also rebellious and surprisingly energetic when pursuing something she wants.  These three characters make up most of the emotional core of this series.  The soldiers and comrades that serve under Hakuoro are also a joy to watch each having their own colorful personalities and place in the war.  If there is to be some flaw within the characters it could be the villains.  They are kind of one dimensional and are just kind of dicks.  However, they do a good job at making you hate these characters, which makes taking them out so incredibly satisfying.Art/Animation/Sound: 8/10 (very good)Opening songs and ost are great.  They are catchy, and complement the anime very well.  The art and animation isn\'t anything too spectacular there are some copy-paste and awkward 3d models, but it does its job well.Enjoyment: 9/10I really enjoyed this anime... 19 episodes of it.  The ending is what hold me back from completely loving it.  The last 6 episodes is some of the worst coma inducing garbage that I have ever seen.  It takes a turn for the worst and in my opinion contradicts a lot of what the series seemed to be working towards.  It is unnecessarily dark, convoluted would be an understatement, and the more you think about it the worst it gets.  Seriously, I tried to go with it, and I thought about what they were going for.  But the more I tried the more plot holes and inconsistencies I found.  They raise more questions (not in a good way) then it answers.  Additionally, why explain things that really don\'t need to be explained?  Its like scientifically explaining what the force is in the Star Wars prequels, we don\'t really need one.  Plus its devoid of humor, you barely see the side characters you grow to love, and the elements that are introduced feel so incredibly out of place.  It also has easily the most underwhelming and boring final confrontation that I have ever seen (I fell asleep and was forced to see the episode again).  Despite how terrible this last portion is, the journey getting there was worth it, and stopping at episode 15 or 19 in my opinion is already a satisfying enough conclusion.  So please, please, please, I implore you to stop at episode 19 and don\'t go on anymore than that unless you want to try to laugh at the ridiculousness of the whole thing.Overall: 8/10 (very good)If you like fantasy that doesn\'t have to be dark to be good, then I really can\'t see you not liking this.  Give this show a chance, and I am pretty sure you will find a memorable, entertaining and enjoyable experience.  Watching it sub or dub doesn\'t matter too much IMO, either is good.  So as long as your not a sub purist, english dub is an option. that could a appeal to a wide audience that doesn\'t have to be dark, super serious and depressing.""

If there is to be some flaw within the characters it could be the villains.  They are kind of one dimensional and are just kind of dicks.  However, they do a good job at making you hate these characters, which makes taking them out so incredibly satisfying.Art/Animation/Sound: 8/10 (very good)Opening songs and ost are great.  They are catchy, and complement the anime very well.  The art and animation isn\'t anything too spectacular there are some copy-paste and awkward 3d models, but it does its job well.Enjoyment: 9/10I really enjoyed this anime... 19 episodes of it.  The ending is what hold me back from completely loving it.  The last 6 episodes is some of the worst coma inducing garbage that I have ever seen.  It takes a turn for the worst and in my opinion contradicts a lot of what the series seemed to be working towards.  It is unnecessarily dark, convoluted would be an understatement, and the more you think about it the worst it gets.  Seriously, I tried to go with it, and I thought about what they were going for.  But the more I tried the more plot holes and inconsistencies I found.  They raise more questions (not in a good way) then it answers.  Additionally, why explain things that really don\'t need to be explained?  Its like scientifically explaining what the force is in the Star Wars prequels, we don\'t really need one.  Plus its devoid of humor, you barely see the side characters you grow to love, and the elements that are introduced feel so incredibly out of place.  It also has easily the most underwhelming and boring final confrontation that I have ever seen (I fell asleep and was forced to see the episode again).  Despite how terrible this last portion is, the journey getting there was worth it, and stopping at episode 15 or 19 in my opinion is already a satisfying enough conclusion.  So please, please, please, I implore you to stop at episode 19 and don\'t go on anymore than that unless you want to try to laugh at the ridiculousness of the whole thing.Overall: 8/10 (very good)If you like fantasy that doesn\'t have to be dark to be good, then I really can\'t see you not liking this.  Give this show a chance, and I am pretty sure you will find a memorable, entertaining and enjoyable experience.  Watching it sub or dub doesn\'t matter too much IMO, either is good.  So as long as your not a sub purist, english dub is an option.', 'Well been putting it off for quite a while, but now i have finally seen it and let me give you my opinion on it.Series Name: UtawarerumonoStory: The story is rather interesting, for the most part while it has elements of science fiction and fantasy, the majority of the series seems to focus a amenisaic man who becomes an emepror and must defend his nation and people against those who wish to do harm to it so it focuses mostly on war and fighting, at the same time there is background story that focuses on the history of the main lead and the truth of...his origin and his relation with the history of the world.Review: I actually enjoyed this series as i watched it, I would not say that is one of the best anime or has one of the best storied but it is an interesting one and has plenty of action and drama to balance each other out with a little comedic moments in between, did i mention that everybody has animal ears and tails and some wings, now that is interesting to say the least. XD The music was ok i guess..nothing bad but nothing grand either and the animation i would say..it is average...nothing worht while but too bad either.The Only few flaws i found in it..is that it really focuses a bit to much on jumping from situation to the next,,what i mean is that the pacing really starts to get really fast with shifting from one story to the next and maybe the focus on war conflicts and action were a bit to much..they should have given it more breathing room, to develop the characters..dont get me wrong they had plenty of development but i could say they could focused a bit more on there background.Bottom Line i would give it a 8/10...it is a rather interesting story and for those who like a little bit of fantasy, action and war drama i would recommend to give this a shot.I know there is a second season that just recently got released..but i am going to stop for now and wait for the dub to come out....yeah i watched the first season dubbed and i would say it is pretty good,,especially from the time period it was released.Granted i could watch the second season sub only...it wont be the first time...but since i got a little advance that the second season is part 1 of a two parter and that a possible s3 is coming out when the game that it is based on it comes out.i mgiht as well wait a little while...if the s3 starts airing before the dub is out than il just watch it before it does. his origin and his relation with the history of the world.Review: I actually enjoyed this series as i watched it, I would not say that is one of the best anime or has one of the best storied but it is an interesting one and has plenty of action and drama to balance each other out with a little comedic moments in between, did i mention that everybody has animal ears and tails and some wings, now that is interesting to say the least.

I loved all the female characters and i loved when more kept being addedbut its not just a simply harem because their are a lot of male cast too (Benawi, Oboro, the twins)then i love the OP theme (and the ED ones too)and the concept of slowly overcoming difficult hurdles and eventually leading and...building an empire was very satisfying. The abilities of all the characters as well as the main characters background is truly gratifyingthe story was intelligently made and the art is cute and fun (we've got adorable characters, sexy characters, cool characters all the like)i think the best part is the fact the main character becomes an emperor and has many faithful companions.

The story follows the MC on his journey to discover who he truly is and overcome the obstacles that are thrown at this man as he meets new allies and faces his past.2. The character are all lovely and great, they each bring something to the table with their own quirks and personalities. Even the antagonists are well done for the time era that the...world is in.3. The art is brilliant, for being an anime made so long ago, it doesn't bother you at all, it doesn't feel dated in the slightest and manages to make you appreciate everything about it. It does dabble with CG though at some points but it's small bits so it doesn't distract you too much.Overall without giving away too much i'd say give it a try, it's definitely an oldie but a goodie.

', ""This is a show I really enjoyed when it was airing... But I later realized It I didn't retain those feelings.First of all the story is really fun to get into. The setting is a land resembling feudal Japan. So it provokes a cool cultural feeling when it's watched.The character are good, some are cute others are just cool. But it's a shame the show doesn't focus on them heavilly (but apparently the original game does). So yeah the character focus is a bit off and thats sad.The fighting is alright. But nothing special. It's not fast (with some exceptions) but it's well coordinated....And most of the time it's not like the single animation still action shots (most of the fighting is REALLY animated haha)Story is fun. But it's very slow. I didn't realize this at first. But the pacing is very bad. The developments are fun to watch. Especially as the cast becomes bigger.Sound isn't much of a issue. Sword clanging is heard alot but it's not annoying.For Enjoyment. I would say it's enjoyable. But you won't want to rewatch it.Overall.

Together with new director Tomoki Kobayashi (Galaxy Angel Z) they attempted to adapt this eroge strategy game. At first, the product of Utawarerumono started off with an interesting high fantasy with semi-interesting characters and then takes a left-turn along the way.The show begins with a cute wolf-type girl finding an injured man in the woods wearing a mask he cannot remove. She and her family nurse him back to health, but the man still does not...have any memories of his past. Slowly, the audience learns the land, society, and the slow progression to war with strategic battle ensuing.Mostly, Utawarerumono is formulaic in the characters with typical trope characters such as the quiet adorable little sister character. Even the plot is fairly simple from the start with oppressed people fighting back against the tyrants. Over the course of the anime there is little in character development and more towards the main group gathering other character arch-types to join the team. Basically, this anime wanted to be what The Vision of Escaflowne was. This was a show with a compelling premise that pretty much fails in its goal.At one point, the people behind Utawarerumono decided to drop the story they were telling for almost zero reason like something anime fans had seen in something out of Votoms in the 80s as an example. Unlike Votoms though, the characters in Utawarerumono have the personality of either a stone or a carebear. Even the character art and animation does not seem much better than Studio OLM’s past works like Berserk and Pokemon from the 90’s.This is not to say the show is completely terrible. Some scenes of battles and the fantasy world are interesting, but ultimately with predictable characters and a plot that is shallow, the show is just flat. There are plenty of other fantasy shows to recommend like The Vision of Escalflowne over this anime. In the end Utawarerumono should stay as an eroge game and was not a good adaptation. have any memories of his past.

This is probably one of my favorite animes that I have seen to date. I have just started on the second season and it is also phenomenal. The character development is a little slow in my opinion, and some of the episodes might seem disconnected, but I assure you that it is not the case. Solider through the 26 episodes and you will not regret it. I know this isn't a fantastic review but I don't want to put too many details in. Just pick up the show and enjoy. Best wishes! "", ""The One Being Sung tells the story of a man called Hakuoro who finds himself in a sword and sorcery world with no memory of who he is. Soon after being welcomed into the local village, the villagers rally behind Hakuoro against their emperor and the revolution begins.Story 8/10What I really like about the story for this anime is it isn't just action, but also delves into some of the politics and planning of war. For example, after their country is invaded Hakuoro has to make the decision do they retaliate by invading the enemy country or do they first secure their boarders and...recover from the last battle. It's refreshing to see a protagonist like Hakuoro who stops to make a plan and just doesn't attack without thinking.However, don't get the wrong idea, this anime isn't just talking, there's some really good action too like full-scale battles between armies. The battles are definitely the best part of the anime.The anime also has an over-arcing story about Hakuoro learning who he use to be before he lost his memory. Throughout the anime, Hakuoro experiences these flashbacks, but it isn't fully explained how all these different flashes of memory Hakuoro has connect until the end. However, after I watched the final episode, I was still a little confused and had some unanswered questions. I don't want to spoil anything, but I feel like there should've been more exposition.Characters 7/10Hakuoro: Hakuoro's best quality is his leadership skills. Hakuoro really does consider his friends his family and everything he does is to protect them and their country. However, there are a few scenes where Hakuoro does lose his calm attitude, when he begins to question what if the person he was before he lost his memory was some kind of monster.Eruruu: What I like about Eruruu is she's like the mother of the main characters as in she's always worrying about everyone else, but also manages to smile and be so positive all the time which brightens the mood of the show. Furthermore, I admire Eruruu's loyalty to Hakuoro and it shows how much she cares about him.Karura: Hakuoro's my favorite character, but Karuras my second. I love how she fights like the Incredible Hulk as in she just smashes whats ever is in front of her and so effortlessly destroys her enemies.Touka: Touka is the opposite of Karura; first Touka fights with this very graceful and precise fighting style and always has this focused look in her eye. Also, while Karura has a disrespectful, carefree attitude, Touka is the opposite and will do anything for her master and do what she thinks is right. They make an interesting pair to say the least.Benawi: I really like Benawi because he's such a great fighter and like Hakuoro is a great leader too, but I was disappointed nothing about his background is revealed.Art 8/10Something I really like about the character designs is how you really know you're in another world (not just in the past) because most the character aren't purely human. Karura's got cat ears and a tiger tail; Touka has bird wings for ears; and Urtori and Kamyu have angel wings.Overall 8/10I really liked this anime for the action with the epic battles and the characters were all great. It's only the over-arcing story about Hakuoro learning about his past that I found confusing. recover from the last battle.

When he recovers from his wounds his leadership skills become apparent enabling him to lead those around him as events unfold through the story and persuading former enemies and vaious other waifs and strays to join his group.Visually Utawarerumono is very pleasing with very good character design where the fantasy of the...story is enhanced as the characters, with the exception of Hakuwlo, have animal ears and tails or wings. I wouldn't say any of the characters were spectacular individually but individually they all added something to the story.For about 20 episodes I really enjoyed the show with battle scenes and lots of action but then it started to get all trippy. Almost as if the creators rolled up a joint or took something else illegal because all of a sudden we get a modern or futuristic laboratory scenes, fantasy mecha robots and monsters.Personally I felt the laboratory scenes, robots and monsters were unnecessary and kind of ruined the end of the story. The last episode is really an attempt to salvage a decent ending which was done to a certain extent but a lot of damage was done already which was a big shame as if they kept it more simple the ending would have been much better.All in all a very good anime ruined by the bizarre end to the story. story is enhanced as the characters, with the exception of Hakuwlo, have animal ears and tails or wings.

I will explain my thoughts a bit, but there are slight spoilers so I\'ll put some spaces before I begin....*SPOILERS*So the show starts off as a fairly average fantasy show and the main character drives technological and tactical development in a medieval world.  It is nothing special, but enjoyable.  However, halfway or more through, the show goes in a completely different direction.  At first it seems like they\'ve got gundams, but then you realize that they\'re more like the machines from Neon Genesis Evangelion.  The plot suddenly gets very confusing and the show does a poor job explaining what happens.  They touch on human experimentation, reincarnation, sateliite lases, and divinities.The main character has gathered his allies, which include a few good characters, but when they bring in the mobile suits, those characters are basically useless.  All the character development of his allies is essentially wasted.  It was like the first half and second half were done by completely different people.The show has no idea what it wants to be and the viewer has the experience of a fantasy show suddenly changed in direction that was never foreshadowed in the early parts.  It was like if an author wrote an entire book with no magic and no hints of magic, then the ending was solved by the main character with, ""oh yeah I can do magic."" (This is my example of an idea, not what happens in the show.)  When you set up the rules for a fictional world, the author needs to obey those rules, and if they want to change things then foreshadowing is necessary.It\'s tough to pin down my feelings on everything because I really liked a few of th characters, but in my opinion the show really went off the rails.  Too much is unexplained to the viewer.  It is also difficult to figure out what the target audience is, the beginning and ending are just so different.  I took a little while to stew before writing this review, because honestly, I felt a bit mad after the show ended.

While under the care of the local villagers a local ""noble"" causes some...big trouble for the villages which in turn though a series of events helps kick start a massive rebellion against the local emperor with the main character leading this rebellion and eventually he becomes the new emperor with him now Running this country and dealing with the problems of those who bear the role of leader have to deal with.So the story of utawareumomo is basically a slice of life how to run a kingdom/ war drama / harem because this is based of an hentai game.And your now probably asking please explain so  very well I will explain.Now the reason I say slice of life is because about half the time it is basically that.There are literally parts of this show where people are basically doing jack shit nothing except doing paper work, Having meetings, getting drunk and Other madame things.And to me these parts did get a bit tedious at times. But in retrospect it dose help with the setup of the the war drama aspects because when I think about it these nothing really is happening moments are used to make you and the characters drop their  guard and then out of nowhere there is an attack and your like oh crap.The war dama parts are for the most part taken very seriously.Which I can always appreciate when a story take the concept of war with the kind of seriousness it needs.There is tactics involved, there is also lots of death that they actually show you, there are parts where villagers are getting pillaged and burned to the ground.These parts are kind of used to help learn about the world this takes place in and more about the main character past.Where we find out that this isn\'t a fantasy world.  but is in actually a post apocalyptic earth in the future where humanity fuck up to point where thay couldn\'t live on earth any more and that the main character is a God like being.Which begs the question of  how did humans end up in that state like this and how come we have magic in a world that seems it was made by science but at the same time is a fantasy world with I shit you not angel like being that can do magic and the main character who has god like abilities. That make little to no sense of how this all connected.So what I am trying to say in that thay never really expands on it and it\'s just comes out disjointed.Now last and not  least  is the reason why a say there is a harem element in the show.Now some of you are probably going to say or think the that the harem aspect of the story kind of brings down the serious nature of this story.But to my shock  it didn\'t do that really.Because for one it really doesn\'t much of a prescience. its kind of just there for you to enjoy and easy going.Aesthetically it kind of fits because this world that the live in is lightly based of medieval Japan and if you read any history books you would probably know that emperors in history getting harems happen quite a lot So it more of a favoring than any thing else.Also if you where looking for fan service there really isn\'t that much of it.Now the ending kind of came out of nowhere but it was fore shadowed enough that could have it not bother me that much. Even though it did kind of end open.Characters, 5/10The main character haku was some what interesting.he is a  naturally good leader who also likes women  which kind makes interesting a bit.But the problem is that he has amnesia and it kind of makes him a little bland at times. But at the same time it dose lead him to deal with a lot of issues like who he was or what has he done in life and what not.The side characters are pretty one note.Because I can pretty much sum up most of the characters in sentence.Becuse most of the characters are mostly defined though only a few personally trats.For example there one character who I can sum up as the  lawful good warrior type of character.  So yah they can be pretty much be summarized pretty quickly.So the characters are kind of written poorly.But I do believe that the character interaction helps make up with it.Because I did find the character interaction enjoyable to watch.Art, 6/10The animation is kind of average even when I compare it to other shows that came out that same year. But at the Same time it dose add some grit to it which kind of works because this is a show about war so I give it a pass for that.It\'s art style is kind of genericNothing really special here.Now the character designs where Kind of different but still generic.Like it kind of fun to see all these animal people designs.But it still has the problem of being dated.Sound, 5/10Now the op and ending themes were catchy but I am afraid that is all they are is catchy.And the ost is kind of forgettable. Like for the life of me I can\'t really remember much of it.So if your looking for a ost you should definitely pass on this you won\'t get my much out of it.Enjoyment, 6/10Now when it came to the enjoyment of this show I guess I can mention a few things.One thing I quite like about this show is how serious it was and how ambitious it was for a hentai game story.which did find make it a pretty interesting ride over all.Overall, 6/10If your looking a for above average war drama then utawarumono will be a pretty good ride.But if the lack of  characters and art and sound bothers your the you should probably go watch something  else. big trouble for the villages which in turn though a series of events helps kick start a massive rebellion against the local emperor with the main character leading this rebellion and eventually he becomes the new emperor with him now Running this country and dealing with the problems of those who bear the role of leader have to deal with.So the story of utawareumomo is basically a slice of life how to run a kingdom/ war drama / harem because this is based of an hentai game.And your now probably asking please explain so  very well I will explain.Now the reason I say slice of life is because about half the time it is basically that.There are literally parts of this show where people are basically doing jack shit nothing except doing paper work, Having meetings, getting drunk and Other madame things.And to me these parts did get a bit tedious at times.

This anime is a feeble minded kids anime that takes every anime cliche and throws it into one series. Go ahead, read the other reviews and you\'ll see they mention the run of the mill story, and standard anime characteristics. This review will let you know how dumb this anime is. No plot spoilers, but a preview of some crap to come.First you start off with a man who wakes from a coma. So you\'re thinking...cool, now we have to find out who this guy is and why he\'s wearing that mysterious mask. Then we find out he\'s in a feudal time period. All of a sudden there are elf like people and people with cat ears. Ok WAIT!!! now they all ride on dinosaurs?!?!!? Then the protagonist befriends a couple of angels? Now they jumped from fighting bows and arrows to giant mech like robots? Finally the writers say, JUST KIDDING and hit you with a bunch of Sci-Fi BS and now we know why he wears the mask and.....no one cares. EPIC FAILThis anime is clearly a children\'s anime. Whoever recommended this to Berserk fans should be shot in the face. The characters are flat. To have a ""deep"" character there must be conflict within the character, these characters are the same from start to finish. Some reviews say there is something in this anime that everyone could like, and it\'s true because this anime THREW EVERYTHING INTO ONE STORY AND TRIED TO MAKE YOU TAKE IT SERIOUSLY. I only finished the anime hoping to find some redeeming attribute but as other reviews say the ending let them down. The whole series will let you down.I felt it was necessary to create an account on this site and inform people about how truly horrible this anime is. Maybe my expectations are skewed because I only watch good anime filtered through word of mouth, so if you like watching horrible anime to have a greater appreciation of the animes that are truly great, then this is a must see. If you don\'t want to soil your eyes and mind and stick to just watching good anime, then definitely skip this one. cool, now we have to find out who this guy is and why he\'s wearing that mysterious mask.

Someone who loves the games might love this show.I expected 26 episodes to be epic but every arc felt the same, war. There are machinations and the theme of endless conflict does have it's purpose in the shows direction. However, I got board with every arc being about war and feel the show could have accomplished the same in fewer episodes. And, maybe that was the goal, to tire out the viewer in the way war would wear on those impacted by it. The show often feels like a fantasy period...drama, with the action being from the endless war. However, there are reason it's labeled Sci-fi.I watched this due to the high reviews and my interest in this series as a whole. However, I'm walking away from this doubtful that the other two seasons are worth the time. drama, with the action being from the endless war.

Thats kinda what I got...The anime starts out fairly calm and seems to be a fantasy slice-of-life anime but around ep 5 the anime flips, now I am trying not to spoil anything but its hard to talk about everything without spoilers... Anyways the anime suprisingly takes its turn into a war anime wich it perfectly fits, the characters have been build up so it makes sence with their relations and it makes sence for them to akt the...way they do.The moments in this anime are real... There are a couple of sad moments and I almost found  myself crying to one of the scenes wich says a lot since I stood through Clannad without crying once. Sadly the one really sad moment felt a bit rushed but thats the only thing I have to complain, the sadness luckily also wore of fast so there wasn't that sad after-effect (If I know what I mean).Now lets get to the criteriaStory: 9/10Now the story is actually not bad but it gets a bit confusing around the end, the story is based around Hakuroro who has lost all his memory and is building a new life with his new family, like I said before the story kinda turns around so I can't say anything about that but I can say that the family part stays... Its entertaining and has sad moments, its a rollercoaster of emotionsArt: 8/10The Art for its time is pretty good but sadly they resued many clips of for example things running but they did put other background behind them so its not that bad but its pretty obvious sometimesSound: 9/10The sound is nothing special, the voice acting is well done and the music is goodCharacter: 10/10The Characters are very well done, every character is unique and there are almost no sterio types, the characters are very well developed and you can clearly see their relation, all actions characters make make sence and their are fairly understandable.Enjoyment: 10/10I enjoyed this anime a lot and I think it is a lot to underated, every episode was well done and made me want to watch the next one without having to put cliffhangers!Overall: 10/10I know when you add everything up it gives this anime 9.2 points but I would give it more points if I could so I am rating it 10/10, it is very enjoyable and everything is well done!

Since it got high score from MAL, i decided to give a shot at this.Unfortunately, after watching almost half of this series, i can conclude that this story is extremely, overly, overrated. This anime is extremely not interesting. I wonder why it got such high rating. Most probably due to the nostalgia..This anime got almost all characteristics that any weak/terrible anime have.1. Stupid story that make no sense with no background whatsoever plus with stupid, weak story-telling. extremely fast paced, skipping time frame, plus nothing about the world of this anime is explained.All these...makes me feel everything about this anime is dumb and stupid.2. Stupid, annoying, typical trope of characters with weak seiyuu.3. Inconsistent and terrible animation.The only good bout this anime is the music but it is just OK at best. Nothing great.What a waste of anime it could be a bit more interesting if it was executed/done properly. STAY AWAY from this crap.

Mecha, Kaiju, Romance, Comedy, War, Sci-Fi, Magic, and so much more!Utawarerumono is an anime adaptation of a visual novel, with a twist... This is not your usual ""cute school girls"" and ""lovey-dovey"" anime, instead you get an epic. The anime has fantastic opening and ending songs, along side a great OST. The animation is not perfect, but is pretty soothing to watch. The characters are fantastic and you get a unique variety of characters!

A man wakes up with a mask he cannot remove, a beautiful young woman finds him and helps him get back into shape. He then enters a world filled with wars and governmental issues. I enjoyed the series for it\'s intriguing mystery, which keeps throwing twists at you, one after the other. You get a wonderful cast, and I loved each and every one of the main characters. My personal favorite was ""Karura"". This anime has an element which I crave, but is very rare in anime, kaiju. But this isn\'t a tale of Godzilla or a E.G.E. in the creature(s) case(s). It has fantastic re-watchability, I\'m just waiting to get it on DVD.

Supernaturally powerful characters appear who are attributed with devastating strength.  Hmm that's odd, but okay I guess that acceptable ( since the folk here ride raptors instead of horses ),...this isn't too far out of the ordinary.  Then the story line begins to add new enemies into the plot without explaining their background.

But the truth is, at the end of the day, Utawarerumono could still be described as a tale of an amnesiac who would work to the ends of the world to protect his newfound family. Of course, the latter description by itself, sounds like something senseless and unexplained,...which unfortunately, is one of the key flaws of Utawarerumono. However, in a very warped sense, it's as if the director/game developers (for the source material) themselves knew of this flaw, and for whatever conscious reason, decided to keep working on the story with that in mind.Without spoiling too much, the thematic and genre discontinuity as well as the overall illociticy regarding the cause of the characters' interactions are perhaps the greatest downfall of this show, which without these factors, Utawarerumono could have still set up the same degree of mystery that is presumed to be desired. What I mean by that is, in simple words, the motives behind the protagonist's actions seem slightly out of place, as the question of his drive is never truly raised besides the fact that he wants to discover the truth in his past. In this sense, it feels like Utawarerumono doesn't attempt to expand any further beyond the sub-genre specifics involving amnesiac characters.I really do want to discuss the ending a little bit, because like the 2016 sequel to Utawarerumono that I watched before the original, the ambiguity of the ending (which I will not critically tear apart, as I'm still presuming the creators understood the repercussions of attempting such an ambiguous ending) leaves an empty feeling in my stomach. The feeling isn't as if the story is incomplete, or even sad and meant to be empty, but moreso due to the imcomprehensible nature of the story. That, in addition to the fact that not just themes, but entire GENRES are added in the closing episodes of the story, are again, the only reason that I believe this anime is flawed from being considered a great example of what it's attempting to do.It's really hard to word these feelings, but I will say that this anime is quite enjoyable, if one is a fan of the fantasy/adventure genres, especially if you enjoy an occasional plot twist. I think for those of you who have seen this anime, this review is probably a lot easier to understand, but nonetheless, this is a recommended series from me. which unfortunately, is one of the key flaws of Utawarerumono.

Unlike many other anime this one has a story that doesn't feel like a retelling of another story (at least to my knowledge) and comes off as a new fresh experience even when i go back to re-watch it.The story sets you up right away with a mystery that draws your right in. The mystery, in part, is actually a huge underlying plot element that keeps coming back throughout the series. The mystery is of course, the main character's true identity. The story...continues on and you begin to get a feel for the world they live in, which in a nutshell is sort of like a fantasy medieval world with only a handful of things that make it a fantasy world. As the story goes on you slowly become more involved with the main character and those around him, the anime doesn't try to shamelessly get its viewers attention by throwing bigger and bigger battles each episode, it will often will take time to have character development, which is a surprising thing to see as it would be a simple task for them to forgo that in favor of non-stop fighting. However this adds to the overall quality of the story because then you actually begin to care about the characters and it gets you much more involved in the story.As for the characters themselves, honestly originally I was gong to say that while many of the characters are just stereotypes they are done well. However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized, that I couldn't think of a single character that was just a simple stereotype (save a few minor characters), and realized that not only was most every major character in the story unique and real, I also actually liked most of them. as for the main character he is extremely humanistic in the way he carries himself. Everything he does just seems like a natural human reaction from a man in his position, and it really translates well for the story when the main character is so much of a real person.The opening theme song is actually really good and very catchy and even when I would re-watch the series again, I found myself listening to the opening every time. While its no masterpiece, it certainly gets you pumped and excited for the next episode, whether it be action packed or a day where a little more character development is explored, the opening does a great job of hyping you up for the next episode.Overall this anime stands out from the crowd, bringing you a creative and well written story, as well as highly developed and very humanistic characters. Not only is the action awesome and fun to watch the story is extremely thorough and draws you in as well. I'd very highly recommend this anime to most anyone, whether it be someone who wants to see epic action with large scale battles, someone who wants to see a story that stands out from the crowd, or someone who wants a bit more substance in the main characters, nearly everyone would be happy they watched this anime. Creative, well written, and mesmerizing to the very end, this is Utawarerumono. continues on and you begin to get a feel for the world they live in, which in a nutshell is sort of like a fantasy medieval world with only a handful of things that make it a fantasy world.

However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized, that I couldn't think of a single character that was just a simple stereotype (save a few minor characters), and realized that not only was most every major character in the story unique and real, I also actually liked most of them. as for the main character he is extremely humanistic in the way he carries himself. Everything he does just seems like a natural human reaction from a man in his position, and it really translates well for the story when the main character is so much of a real person.The opening theme song is actually really good and very catchy and even when I would re-watch the series again, I found myself listening to the opening every time. While its no masterpiece, it certainly gets you pumped and excited for the next episode, whether it be action packed or a day where a little more character development is explored, the opening does a great job of hyping you up for the next episode.Overall this anime stands out from the crowd, bringing you a creative and well written story, as well as highly developed and very humanistic characters. Not only is the action awesome and fun to watch the story is extremely thorough and draws you in as well. I'd very highly recommend this anime to most anyone, whether it be someone who wants to see epic action with large scale battles, someone who wants to see a story that stands out from the crowd, or someone who wants a bit more substance in the main characters, nearly everyone would be happy they watched this anime. Creative, well written, and mesmerizing to the very end, this is Utawarerumono."", ""Utawarerumono is an amazing anime.The story is intriguing and fun with amazing art and sound. The characters are hilarious with their individual personalities, Hakuoro's calm, wise and gentle demeanor. Elulu's sweet, kind and humble demeanor. Aruru's shy and quiet but brave and blunt attitude is my favorite. The series had lots of funny moments but was also intense during each arc, some people didn't like the last arc but i found it pulled everything together in a sort of confusing way. which is good because it gets you thinking. Bottom line, Amazing anime you should watch. the manga however, isn't as in tune with the...story. or what i've read so far isn't. its more of their little adventures within the anime story. or what i've read so far isn't. its more of their little adventures within the anime"", 'For those who have yet to watch this anime I strongly suggest doing so! and heres why:Storey:The storey is very well put together, which makes it easy to follow and understand. It also has many emotions within it, from sad, to exiting, to action filled, to humor, and finally relaxing. The episodes are divided into two groups: Fighting/War episodes and Peaceful/Relaxing episodes which makes it great for separating the two.I found there was too much non essential fighting like random attacks and giant robotic warriors, this was absolutely stupid, yet essential for the upcoming scenes after them.Art:I liked the designs of the characters. The twin...archers were the most eye catching. I like the setting too, a nice peaceful countryside that can be safely assumed is set in the past. There is a wide use of animal features on the characters like cat tails and ears for example!Sound:The characters voices really suited them. The biggest example of this is Eruru and Yuzuha (their voices were the best for their characters). The background music was carefully chosen and was played at the right moment, such as dramatic music for battles and encounters and sad music for sad or supernatural scenes.The opening scene and its music is one of my favorites too!Character:I really wish i could favorite more than ten characters because i have never loved so many characters from a single anime quite like Utawarerumono.Eruru and Aruru have a strong sisterly bond which is cute. Yuzuha is soft spoken and is kind to others for her current health status which is fitting as it is touching. Benawi is the most epic of the characters, being a master warrior and a great general.Enjoyment:I enjoyed this anime from start to finish. There are no non essential scenes which keeps you entertained forever and wanting to watch more after you finish an episode.Overall:This is a good anime that i loved watching! I think that most readers of this will go ahead and watch it, and write their own positive reviews!

For those of us with similar experience there comes a point where there are just too few anime that interest us anymore.Most of the time it's because of a lack of story, art, characters or some other thing.Or perhaps there's too much ecchi or we're sick of the guy constantly getting smacked around and being subordinate.To be honest I only watched this show as a recommendation from the Overlord anime and I'm glad to say that it was not a waste of time.This show is truly unique. It's true that its art style...is somewhat dated to begin with but halfway through the show it seems to go Hi-def.I watched it in dubbed and I immensely enjoyed the English version.The story was it's most intriguing aspect as it starts of simple but slowly rises to become grander and grander and in the end throws you for an amazing loop if you're not prepared for it.I became attached to the characters and they all had interesting personalities and the series managed to keep them that way without ever falling into the slice of life trope.I cannot recommend this anime to anyone who is only going to watch the first two episodes to see if they like it.I enjoyed it somewhat to begin with but it was only by episode 9 that I began to realize just how good the show had become and from there it just kept on getting better and better.Of course I can only speak for myself but for me this was the kind of show that made me remember that there are some truly epic anime out there to get invested in.Now I'm going to go and start looking for the next one! ;) is somewhat dated to begin with but halfway through the show it seems to go Hi-def.I watched it in dubbed and I immensely enjoyed the English version.The story was it's most intriguing aspect as it starts of simple but slowly rises to become grander and grander and in the end throws you for an amazing loop if you're not prepared for it.I became attached to the characters and they all had interesting personalities and the series managed to keep them that way without ever falling into the slice of life trope.I cannot recommend this anime to anyone who is only going to watch the first two episodes to see if they like it.I enjoyed it somewhat to begin with but it was only by episode 9 that I began to realize just how good the show had become and from there it just kept on getting better and better.Of course I can only speak for myself but for me this was the kind of show that made me remember that there are some truly epic anime out there to get invested in.Now I'm going to go and start looking for the next one! ;)"", ""This anime was really solid with an okay plot.

There is also a tad...bit of comedy from time to time, when they aren't fighting.What's kinda weird about this anime is *SPOILER ALERT* how it goes into a Gundam feel towards the end (if you know what I mean).

Some may see what I'll say next as nitpicking, and I admit that this kind of anime is not my cup of tea, but here goes. Although the characters, or rather showing how they're influenced by the current tragedy is done very well, there certainly are flaws to...this anime.

The second seemed better at first but was only after hakurous demon form, ignoring all of his other affairs, because he wasn\'t interested. Somehow, he commanded his troops to kill groups of civilians with no respite from them like it...was the natural thing to do.

Fortunately, once you\'ve heard it said correctly a time or two and you say it out loud for yourself it\'s not nearly as difficult to say as it may initially appear. Funky title aside, is this anime any good? The short answer is yes, mostly. Here are my thoughts-Perhaps the strongest aspect of Utawarerumono is its pacing. With a meaty 26 episodes, I felt my time was well respected and there was very little filler. There\'s lots of lots of combat, often with lots of blood and...occasionally gore as well, and the plot keeps moving at a brisk pace and throws plenty of twists and turns at you. It\'s action heavy and individual arcs do not overstay their welcome.This show sports a particularly large cast and does as well as it can to develop them all at least somewhat. Of course some characters are more important than others, and yes you could characterize some of them within established tropes and archetypes, but by and large most characters have at least SOME amount of depth and aren\'t completely flat and one-dimensional. Their physical appearances are quite varied as well. It was never difficult to tell main characters apart both in terms of their physical appearance or their voice acting. The voice acting as a whole is strong for the time (2006), though I\'d say the anime fails to appropriately voice a number of its villains, many of which have a serious case of ""bad guy voice"" and lean too often on the stereotypical ""evil laugh"".I wish there was a bit more infighting among the main cast. Though they come from different places, are in some cases of different races, have had different life experiences, have different world views and so on and so forth, by and large everyone gets along save a brief and inconsequential squabble and everyone falls in line and listens to the emperor without ever feeling conflicted about his orders or thinking too hard for themselves. I think more internal disagreement would have likely been more realistic.The plot itself is a bit of a mixed bag. For starters, you may or may not be aware that this is based off of what was originally an adult visual novel. To be clear, it\'s not ""that kind of anime"". There\'s no love-making scenes or nudity and it\'s not one of those ""all the female characters throw themselves at the male lead"" shows. They took the overarching premise of the source material and made it into a fantasy war epic. There\'s plenty of twists, and for the most part the viewer can be reasonably expected to understand what\'s going on, but there\'s definitely a few areas in the end where the plot falls off the rails a bit and suffers from lack of explanation. There is one plot point in one of the later arcs in the show that is laughably, insultingly stupid and absolutely cannot be taken seriously at face value under any circumstances. A character would have to be dumber than the dumbest dumdum from Dummyville in order for it to work. It just doesn\'t.One thing I disliked about the plot was its unwillingness to kill off meaningful characters or take risks as a whole. A small number of low priority characters die throughout the anime, and maybe there\'s a moment or two of sadness, but the entirety on the main cast makes it through the entire show and with the amount of war and conflict they\'re constantly involved in and with the number of casualties they regularly sustain, it\'s not overly believable that none of the important characters would ever be among them along the way. I wish there had been a bit more emotional impact throughout this journey.The music had its moments, but was largely forgettable, very much including the throwaway opening and ending themes. The music is perhaps the weakest aspect of the show. I don\'t think there are any true standout tracks or anything worth adding to a playlist here.With a fondness for and positive bias towards fantasy anime from this era, ultimately I probably enjoyed Utawarerumono more than it is objectively good, but it\'s at least a solid show, even if not an all timer, in the eyes of an objective viewer. It lacks standout, impactful, emotional moments and it plays it a bit too safe with its overall plot, but it\'s a well-paced, action-heavy romp through a unique fantasy world that I quite enjoyed.OBJECTIVE RATING- 7.5~PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 7.75-8 occasionally gore as well, and the plot keeps moving at a brisk pace and throws plenty of twists and turns at you.

Its an impossible task.If possible id recommend the VN first but the adaptation is good enough  Even one of the better although that doesnt say much.First season is the best and ive rated it an 9/10 with the following season 8/10 each. But i do take my live and experience with the games in mind alongside my usual low expectations from adaptations in general. So that might be on the higher end of the scale. 3 anime seasons of around 26 episodes.

So that might be on the higher end of the scale.', 'This is a very minor spoiler review.Utawarerumono is an incredibly unique tale and is my favourite series out of any medium. I\'ve already read the visual novels and now finished the anime. Despite all of the adaptation\'s flaws, I very much enjoyed it. The VN is around 30 hours long which is impossible to adapt properly without many cuts but I believe they did a good job regardless. Also, the anime is, in general, a faithful adaptation with only a few alterations that don\'t change the overall story.What you can expect from getting into this game without spoilers: a story of war, politics, mystery...(Hakuoro and his amnesia), comradery and love (don\'t get the wrong idea though, it\'s not a romance anime but it is essential at certain points). It gets very philosophical at points too. The main point of view is through Hakuoro.Story 8/10:For the VN story, I would give a higher rating. As this is a 26 episode long adaptation, there were many cuts. Overall, most of the cuts were the ""slice-of-life moments"" from the VN which weren\'t necessary but did help establish the main group of characters. Since the anime doesn\'t have this, some of the characters feel a bit emptier. Major characters in the VN feel like side characters in the anime from time to time. HOWEVER, I think the anime handles the relationship between Hakuoro and Eruruu just as good if not better than the VN. The VN has a harem aspect while the anime doesn\'t which I honestly think is better for the plot (won\'t explain further bc major spoilers).Speaking of the plot, it was generally well managed. Despite the VN being 30 hours long, the anime didn\'t feel too rushed overall. HOWEVER, the beginning and towards the ending of the anime felt rushed. The beginning is crucial to the story in establishing a strong relationship between Tuskuru, Eruruu, Aruruu and the villagers before all things break loose. However, there wasn\'t much of that and thus the emotional impacts of many moments were not felt. For example, the spark that ignites the entire story should be very emotional and emotion would certainly be one of the main reasons why it ignites. But I just didn\'t feel it because it was imo too rushed.The same goes for the ending. The Utawarerumono game had an ending that left me in tears but the anime didn\'t feel as emotional. I think this mainly stems from the fact that, as mentioned earlier, many relationship-building moments were cut for the sake of time thus the ending didn\'t feel as grand. I also think the episodes towards the ending and the ending itself were depicted as a bit lacklustre and out of order. But as I mentioned previously, the anime handles the relationship between Eruruu and Hakuoro very well and so one certain moment in the ending was really heartwarming (this moment is different from the VN and it conveys a different emotion but is just as good).I give the story an 8/10. I wished the anime had more episodes to fully convey the VN but for 26 episodes, I think it was handled well in depicting the story as well as the main characters (specifically, Hakuoro and Eruruu).Art and Animation 8/10:I absolutely love the character designs of this tale. All characters (despite having some generic tropes like the purple-haired tomboy) are uniquely designed and the anime depicts them very well, even for its time. The background was pretty nice to look at too. There were some parts where the art was kinda bad but I\'ll somewhat overlook them since it\'s a 2006 anime. Also, I\'m not sure why but the violence really ramped up after the first half which, made it more enjoyable to watch.The animation (even considering the time) was fairly awkward at some points. Like for example, at certain moments, the CGI was just atrocious. I think they reused certain animations from time to time (might be wrong)? However, other than a few moments that were bad, the rest of the show had decent animation. Nothing special but nothing bad either.Sound 8/10:The sound, other than the VAs, wasn\'t anything unique. The VAs are incredible though, every character has a unique voice fitting for their personalities. I really like Hakuoro\'s voice too, I think it\'s perfect for his role. The OST and combat sounds weren\'t anything groundbreaking, nothing is memorable. Though, when the Suara music came through, those were quality moments. For example, in the ending, the song Kimigatame plays and is so perfect for the moment. So, I give sound 8/10 for its mediocre OST and sound effects that are carried by Suara and the voice actors.Character 9/10:Well, I think the Utawarerumono characters are absolutely lovable. Even in the VN, some characters like Touka weren\'t very much developed but even then, all characters are so unique in design and personalities. I honestly think that you could make some kind of personality test with which characters someone prefers the most out of the bunch. As I said before, the anime cuts out a lot of relationship-building moments that aren\'t necessary for the story. Thus, the characters do feel much emptier than in the VN, including the villagers like Teoro. I feel like Aruruu was also mistreated. In the VN, she\'s a main character (she really feels like Hakuoro\'s daughter) while in the anime, she feels more like a supporting/side character. One thing to note too is that in the beginning, I felt that Hakuoro was way too emotionless (I guess because we\'re not constantly hearing his thoughts like in the VN) which I was a bit worried about. Don\'t let that get in the way though, it gets much better as the story/Hakuoro\'s character progresses but the early few episodes might feel a bit off because of it. Overall, I can\'t call these complete flaws. Maybe it could have been depicted differently but for it being only 26 episodes, I consider the characters a job well done.Enjoyment 10/10:As a massive Utawarerumono enjoyer, I couldn\'t be happier. Yea the adaptation has many flaws but it was so fun to watch the characters come alive. I actually watched it through slowly rather than binging it in a few days because I didn\'t want it to end so soon. I think people who like a unique story involving politics and war, as well as unique loveable characters would love this show. The world of Utawarerumono is very distinctive too, with its wonderfully creative lore.This is despite it not being a fantasy world per se (if that sounds ambiguous, it\'s to avoid any spoilers).Overall 9/10:Overall, the adaptation is one I would consider good. Though, I really cherish this adaptation as an Utawarerumono fan. Few but vital areas were rushed but the overall experience is very positive. The aspect about cutting the ""slice of life"" relationship-building moments can be filled by the Omakes and the OVA so be sure to watch those too (I haven\'t watched the OVA yet but if they\'re anything like the Omakes, it should be good).I might be a bit biased but I give the show an overall 9/10. It\'s nowhere near the masterpiece level I consider the VN but for anime standards, it met my expectations. It may be a 2006 anime but don\'t let that stop you from trying it out. If anything, anime nowadays have become a bit predictable and oversaturated in many aspects. It was really refreshing to watch this unique piece, despite having known the story already.

I think I enjoyed the non-action parts of the show a lot more, the character iteraction was enjoyable to watch.The action scenes just got a little bit repetitive at times. But, if war anime is your thing then this is probably one for you, though it doesn't feel like a very adult show. Early on this series flowed very well, most episodes were enjoyable and the mystery of the lead characters past always kept me interested. For me, however, the later part of the series was a little bit underwhelming. A fairly solid ending but nothing special. It...did, at least, bring a proper closure to the series. I personally don't think this series has much replay value in it. It feels like a pretty basic series, looking back at it now and the latter part of the series really does spoil the flow of the series. did, at least, bring a proper closure to the series.

Tenchi Muyou! Ryououki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/539/Tenchi_Muyou_Ryououki,"['The prevalent younger age demographic of today\'s anime viewer may not be familiar with this classic title... but for the slightly older fan this series brings back the memories.Like the many generic"" harem animes"" studios seem to spit out every season... this series too has an unlikely hero who suddenly finds himself surrounded by a multitude of hot babes... but that is the only common factor that this classic shares with its modern brethren of failures.This series is an example of a harem done right with enough story and action to propel it into the category of ""something special."" ', 'I\'m writing this review about episode 1-13 of the original OVAs.The last 7 episodes were written in order to accomodate the GXP storyline and were created over 10 years later, so I personally consider them almost a separate series.This is my favorite anime...period.  I know I\'m not in the majority on this, but it succeeds on every level.  It is the definitive ""harem"" anime, while maintaining a great plot and fascinating universe/backstory.  The fact that each of the women have complex and fascinating pasts and facets to their character is something unique to this genre.  It\'s heartwarming, romantic, raunchy,...funny, dramatic, and even is a mystery at times.Story: The story starts with Tenchi, mischievous grandson of a shrinekeeper, stealing the keys to the shrine from his grandpa.  He then explores a cave that family lore claims to house a ""demon"".  Of course he accidentally frees the demon which sets into motion a complex series events that involves all the great powers of the universe.  As Noike mentions in the 3rd OVA, the Masaki household rates as a galatic superpower by the end of the series.  The interesting question is, how much of this did Grandpa plan out?Art: Done in the mid-90\'s it\'s cel animation.  That being said it\'s beautifully animated though the characters sometimes are simple looking due to the style at the time.  All of them are uniquely animated, wear different outfits and hairstyles which helps show the attention to detail.Sound: Nothing to rock out to, but it all works.  I have to add that the original voice acting english cast was great, and funimation really screwed up with the 3rd OVA and will burn in the fiery pits for the abomination of the GXP crossover.Character:  The main character is Tenchi, high school student and usually studious, courteous, and not very rebellious except for the carefully nutured interest in the cave.  In true anime teen fashion, he acts a perfect gentleman around the ladies and though not oblivious to their charms, he refuses some very blatant offers.Now for the ladies:Ryoko, the demon from the cave and former space pirate.  She\'s linked to her ship/ pet cabbit (rabbit/cat) Ryo-Ohki and has quite the interesting pedigree from both parents.  She\'s the first to fall for Tenchi and is very aggressive in her affection for him.  Washu implies that her aggressive sexuality is a front to protect her sensitive feelings for Tenchi.Ayeka, is the pampered princess of Jurai who arrives on Earth to arrest Ryoko; but instead ends up her primary rival for his affections.  Presenting herself as younger and more proper than Ryoko, it\'s often hinted that her mind isn\'t as chaste as her act.Sasami, is Ayeka\'s younger sister.  Despite being the youngest in the house, she often displays the most maturity.  She bonds quickly with Ryo-Ohki and cooks most of the meals for the household.  All this while holding back a secret that she fears will tear her from the others.Mihoshi, the hapless GXP policeperson.  Referred to by Washu as a ""genius of pure luck"".  She\'s clumsy and not very diligent in her duties but her luck seems to land her in trouble and good fortune simultaneously.  She plays the dumb blond of the group, but her forthright nature wins many over.  She\'s somewhat interested in Tenchi, but isn\'t focused enough to compete with the highly competitive duo of Ryoko and Ayeka.Lastly there is Washu.  Washu is in her own words ""so many things really..."" some of these include being Ryoko\'s mother, the greatest scientific mind in the universe, and the one person who sees all that is going on behind the scenes.  It\'s a measure of her self-confidence and maturity that she does not blow everyone\'s secrets out of the water take control.  She has some designs on Tenchi, even shedding her disguise as a young girl and returning to adult form to offer to bear his child.  Of course he declines, and she remains in her guise from there on.  It\'s never stated, but her interest in Tenchi is mostly scholarly and only acts romantically interested to keep Ryoko and Ayeka on their toes.It\'s clear that the storytellers intended to include some traits of the ideal woman in each of the women, but also included flaws that prevented that.Enjoyment: As I said before, this series strength lies in a great plot and rich world for the characters to interract in.  The story never stagnates and the few times things slow down is to reveal a great deal about one of the characters.  The blend of action and comedy goes well together and the rapidly expanding plot never leaves the viewer bored.Overall: I\'ve yet to see an anime do so much with so little.  The closest I\'ve seen yet is Code Geass, but it\'s apples and oranges to this.  Just when you think you understand everything about a character they reveal a new leaf...well Mihoshi is pretty straightforward and Tenchi\'s dad is pretty much a middle-age perv.  Everyone else though not only reveals their past, but also grow and change during the series.  My fav character is Ryoko, as with many other people.  She displays a depth of character and obviously is head over heels for Tenchi but has a very hard time showing him how she really feels.I would recommend this to anyone!  I will mention that the uncensored version can be risque at times (Ryoko isn\'t familiar with nudity taboos) so I qualify everyone as everyone over 17. funny, dramatic, and even is a mystery at times.Story: The story starts with Tenchi, mischievous grandson of a shrinekeeper, stealing the keys to the shrine from his grandpa.

The jokes hit the mark more often than they don\'t and the way in which it mixes a mock-serious sci-fi story with a bunch of very silly subplots is what makes it stand out.To begin with, the plot. It\'s a somewhat standard ""hopeless boy surrounded by diverse girls embodying different fantasies"" comedy on the surface, although the girls are a more interesting bunch than ""cute one, tsundere, sister figure...etc"" by virtue of also being parodies of sci-fi anime archetypes; alien princess, super-strong killing machine, child genius, futuristic special forces.

The characters are drawn in a style that screams Outlaw Star, which is quite fitting for the sci-fi styling. While it could be considered functional and unremarkable, it is nevertheless fun and, to my mind, distinctive.

It\'s a show of caricatures, and so exaggerated voices are ideal.The characters are all funny and well-developed for what could easily have been one-note jokes, setting the show apart from the competition. Mihoshi manages to quite nicely be a comic homage to characters from Bubblegum Crisis, Outlaw Star and other shows, as an example.In terms of pure fun factor, you can\'t beat this OVA.

That said, let us get on with the review.Focusing on Tenchi Masaki's interactions with several alien girls living at his household, the Tenchi Muyo OVAs are well known among older anime fans for having popularized the harem genre and would go on to spawn a number of spinoff titles throughout the 1990s thanks to its immense popularity with fans. Tenchi Muyo sticks out rather prominently from many titles of the harem genre as...it does things for it that the majority of modern titles utilizing the tropes of the genre are lacking in.The first thing it does effectively is providing fleshing out its world and characters. Many modern harem titles tend to just simply stick an archetype of the genre onto a character and run with it throughout its run without fleshing out the characters in question to be anything more than their archetype. Tenchi Muyo offers a good deal of fleshing out of its cast in exploring what is effecting them and providing background to their origins. A number of them even get gradual character development as characters like Ayeka and Ryoko are shown to undergo noticeable changes to their characters throughout the series as they adjust to life on Earth and their current living conditions. It also offers some creative technologies and sci-fi elements for its time that are used by the alien races in the series such as the tree-powered spaceships used by Juraians, the unique properties of the Souja spaceship used by Kagato and Washu able to create a dimensional portal to her laboratory through a closet in the Masaki household. There are some elements to characters and the series plot that are left unexplored such as development on Mihoshi's character and aspects to Washu and Tsunami's characters that would get more fleshing out a decade later in Tenchi Muyo GXP and the third Tenchi OVA series.The other effective element to Tenchi Muyo that has it stick out from most harem titles is the show's effective use of comedy. Outside of the girls swooning for Tenchi and having moments of perverted humor, the series is very effective in the delivery of comedic timing as it milks character chemistry, ironic moments and surprising developments to convey its humor, this being effective as such where it can cut in during serious moments rather well without being a mood killer. High points of Tenchi Muyo's humor being on display include the group's dealing with enemy threats and members of the Jurai Royal Family coming to Earth in a later episode of the series. The humor is not perfect as there are moments where the show resorting to crass humor can fall flat and the bickering between Ryoko and Ayeka for Tenchi's affections can get obnoxious.Visually, Tenchi Muyo is of above average quality for the time it was made. Scenery and character designs have a great amount of detail and vivid color to go along with the show's mostly light mood. While the animation for it is nowhere on the caliber of early 1990s animated works like Ghibli films or Macross Plus, there is still a noticeable amount of effort put into movement, animated sequences and little details such as the range of facial expressions given off by the characters, Tenchi scrambling away from danger and feats of power demonstrated by characters.Overall, Tenchi Muyo is perhaps one of the best offerings of the harem genre that you are likely to find.  It offers a good deal of depth to its characters that make them more than simple archetypes and offers an effective range of humor that is more than perverted antics and the girls ogling for the male lead. The quality of the series still holds up rather well today considering not too many modern harem titles match up to its depth and comedy quality, and is a definite recommendation if you want more to your harem anime besides perverted humor, T&A shots and the girls of the harem only being defined by their single-minded lusting for the male lead of the series. it does things for it that the majority of modern titles utilizing the tropes of the genre are lacking in.The first thing it does effectively is providing fleshing out its world and characters. Many modern harem titles tend to just simply stick an archetype of the genre onto a character and run with it throughout its run without fleshing out the characters in question to be anything more than their archetype. Tenchi Muyo offers a good deal of fleshing out of its cast in exploring what is effecting them and providing background to their origins. A number of them even get gradual character development as characters like Ayeka and Ryoko are shown to undergo noticeable changes to their characters throughout the series as they adjust to life on Earth and their current living conditions. It also offers some creative technologies and sci-fi elements for its time that are used by the alien races in the series such as the tree-powered spaceships used by Juraians, the unique properties of the Souja spaceship used by Kagato and Washu able to create a dimensional portal to her laboratory through a closet in the Masaki household.

The Grandfather of Harem Anime. And yet There's No Need For Tenchi?Despite the short length of episodes, Tenchi Muyo is a great OVA series for those looking for the sci-fi comedy. Oh there's action and romance but you will stay for ladies.Story: It runs a gambit of many things but sci-fi comedy really is the best description. You'll get a laugh out this crazy bunch and some might even make you cry once you learn more about them.Art: The character design is a superb work for a nineties anime. While some may be a bit more round than what you'd expect, it's...more of minor detail in the grand scheme. The backgrounds do help in establishing where and when things are happening and at time, you do wanna take in the scenery.Sound: Oh my god the OST is beautiful. It just makes you wanna relax and just let it enter your brain. The action ost does well in establishing drama but its the music outside of that that you wanna listen to.Character: As is in harem anime, its mostly about the girls but this is the anime that helped set the standard for the sub genre. The women leave great impressions on you and the male lead is not that bad.Enjoyment: I greatly enjoyed this when it premiered in the US on Toonami and it helped grow my interest in anime at the time.Overall: Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki is a great if short introduction to anime and the harem sub-genre. If you're into something that is a bit more relaxed but still crazy then try it out.9.87/10.

Going back and re-watching it, even though it was a favorite growing up, I have to give it a fair review. This series received a seven in my book.Story: Though it isn't fully explained in these six episodes, Tenchi Muyo! has a very complex story line. There are many back stories that link together, but the stories are hard to tie together until the viewer has learned about most of them. Even to this day I don't know many of the mysteries of Tenchi Muyo! even though I have been watching this series since I was 12-years-old....This particular series though, falls short of having a 9 rating because though the initial story is interesting, a person can't grasp what's going on fully within these six episodes. There's just too much to explain in such a small amount of time. So viewers would be suggested to continue on to watch the other Tenchi Muyo! series despite the change in voice actors, writers, and some changes in story. It's a give and take situation with this series. Either continue on into the other parts of the series and deal with the changes or stop here and not know the complete story.Art: The art is nothing to get excited over, but it's also nothing to turn a nose up at. The artists explored many interesting styles in character, clothing, and architecture designs. The Characters have attributes that makes it easy for people to remember them by. The clothing takes on interesting forms, especially Ryoko's outfits. If you want an idea of an anime character to cosplay as, this would be an awesome series to cosplay from.Sound: Tenchi Muyo! Music is very memorable. I used to get the tunes from this series suck in my head. That's the most I can really say about it. As for character voices, some times they can get annoying, especially Ayeka and Mihoshi's voice in the English version.Character: There are many characters with distinct personalities, but they aren't very dynamic. The personalities are rather predictable in many situations and can become boring some times. There are also some very annoying characters, but remember, this is a harem, so you get those.Enjoyment: If you don't think too much into the story and ignore little loop holes, this can be a very enjoyable series. There will be times where it's hard to understand what exactly is going on, but if you can get past that, it's a good series that you won't soon forget.Overall: The series is good, it has its pros and cons, but it's enjoyable if you don't think too much into things.

Well drawn. Introduces all sorts of new things you can't grasp and you can't take your eyes from, things that are beautiful and which do not follow any kind of anime pattern.The characters are not over exaggerated, even though most of their lines from time to time are forced, they connect with each other as if...they were real.

I had heard of Tenchi Muyou! for decades and finally decided to watch the first two seasons.What a disappointment.  It was just bad...on so many levels.  The only reason I can think of to explain the very high reviews is nostalgia.  But if you\'re watching this for the first time, be forewarned.  The story fails on the most fundamental levels.  The harem aspects are poorly crafted and most of...the screen time is devoted to the girls fighting amongst themselves.It is as if the writers did not understand the basic importance of conflict at the heart of all great stories.  Tenchi is forbidden from entering the family temple by his grandfather but he steals the keys and inadvertently releases a 700 year old demon.  Despite this, he faces no repercussions from his grandfather - not even a lecture.The horrific demon turns into a beautiful woman named Ryouko and begins living in the same house with Tenchi and his grandfather for no reason.  Think of every manga, anime, movie or TV show you ever loved and imagine the protagonist and antagonist living together in the same house.  This destroys any sense of conflict between them.When the other women show up they add little to the drama or the harem.  Space Princess Aeka, is a prudish, overly-formal woman who would make any guy uncomfortable in her presence.  Her little sister, Sasami, is way too young for any appropriate relationship.  Plus, they\'re both related to Tenchi!  Then there\'s Mihoshi, the Space Police Officer who is utterly brainless and Washuu who is even older than the 700 year old Ryouko.  Worst of all, there are very few scenes when they compete for Tenchi\'s affections.The 6 OVA episodes were very tough to get through.  I highly recommend ""El Hazard: The Wanderers"" or ""To LOVE-Ru"" (2008) instead.  Each is 26 episodes of fantasy adventure with beautiful girls, smart and decent boys plus a whole lot of laughs. the screen time is devoted to the girls fighting amongst themselves.It is as if the writers did not understand the basic importance of conflict at the heart of all great stories.

Let\'s find out!Story:Given that this is an OVA and there\'s only like 6 episode, I\'m gonna say that there\'s not much of a story being told, at least not like most other harem animes or sci fi animes youi\'d find nowadays. What\'s the story? 17 year old Tenchi, who is your seemingly normal average high school teen, decides to sneaks into a...cave that his grandpa claims is the sleeping/resting place of an evil demon named Ryoko, and that ""demon"" was sealed away by Tenchi\'s ancestor, Yosho. Of course, like almost all other male protagonists of a harem, Tenchi decides to ignore his grandpa\'s stories and see for himself if they\'re true. In the process, he awakens the demon, Ryoko, who turns out to be a wanted space pirate, and her spaceship in an adorable cat/rabbit hybrid form, Ryo-Ohki. From then on, Ryoko attracts  two alien princesses, Aeka and her sister, Sasami, and a Galaxy Police Officer, Mihoshi. And what\'s worse? All the girls seem to like Tenchi in one way or another and he\'s constantly pressured to choose who he likes.What little story there is within these few episodes are there to more or less introduce the main characters and set up what I consider be some of the best lore of the TM franchise. Did I enjoy the start of the Tenchi Muyo series? Yes, even today, I still find myself laughing at Ryoko\'s antics and her fights with Aeka. And I find myself crying over Aeka\'s sadness over the loss of her older half brother, Yosho.Art:The art, while dated, is still pretty good. Clean, fluid animation, beautiful scenery, great character desgins, everything definitely fits well together.Sound:The opening theme is really epic, from the moment you hear the music start, you get a very intense feeling that something epic and sci-fi-ish will happen, like think of on a Star Wars level. And of course the voice acting is pretty good and the background music always sets the mood. I mostly grew up with the english dub that aired on Toonami so i\'ll mostly be judging the voices and stuff from that. But still, everything still holds up for me in the sound department.Characters:While my review on the story may have made the story seem to be a bit mediocre (which it kinda is), I will say that if anything, the characters are really what made Tenchi Muyo so iconic in the first place. First you have the main protagonist, Tenchi who is the kindhearted and brave hero and of course to me, he kinda goes with the flow (basically if you tell Tenchi that it was his destiny to become a Jedi, he would do just that). Basically Tenchi is a people pleaser, well to the people he cares about, BUT try getting him to choose which of the girls he likes and he is quick to avoid that subject or he becomes very indecisive.Than there\'s Ryoko, who seems to be a highly popular character (and I don\'t blame you). She appears to be flirty yet a bit callous and aloof//cold at first but she quickly warms up to everyone in the show (even to Aeka, even though she won\'t admit it and neither will Aeka). For the longest time, Ryoko was my absolutely favorite character but here lately, I started favoriting Aeka. I think it\'s mostly because people tend to think that Aeka is a spoiled snooty uppity and naggy princess, and i kinda used to think the same thing, too, but as I started to rewatch the entire TM series, I found myself liking and sympathizing with Aeka more and more, and with good reason.Why do I like Aeka? Well, despite her snootiness and her apparent nagginess, Aeka really does have a kind heart. She can and will put aside her dislike for Ryoko to protect Ryoko or to save Tenchi. Hell, she\'ll even put aside her pride as the first crowned Juraian Princess and admit her faults and she\'ll show her softer side towards her loved ones. Of course, Aeka\'s friendship with Ryoko and their rivalry over Tenchi is what makes up a good deal of the comedy in this show.Then there\'s Sasami. Sasami is Aeka\'s younger sister and the apparent responsible one among all the characters. She cooks and cleans the house and wow, I admire this little girl. But despite cooking and doing all the household chores, Sasami remains cheerful and she has a little bit of a mischievous side, which is shown when she sometimes teases Tenchi or Aeka.Of course we can\'t forget Ryo-Ohki, the mascot of the TM series. Ryo-Ohki may not say much (if you can understand constant meows) but she is highly expressive. She is all the time hanging out with Sasami but she often helps Tenchi with the carrot fields, that is if Ryoko or Aeka aren\'t using her in their schemes to win Tenchi over.I absolutely adore Ryo-Ohki, I often wish I had a cabbit of my own when I was a kid.And lastly we have Mihoshi to round out the main cast. Mihoshi is a happy, upbeat cheerful space cop but she\'s also very whiny and clumsy. My god is she clumsy. But Mihoshi is very kind hearted and she tries her best at what she does and a lot of the times she ends up being yelled at by Ryoko or Aeka but like them, she, too, has take a liking to Tenchi. When faced with a dangerous situation, Mihoshi isn\'t very brave, but she tries her best.All the characters have a great dynamic about them and they play off each other really well.Enjoyment:I enjoyed rewatching this OVA or season a lot. Mainly because it was a trip down memory lane. I will say that my nostalgia hasn\'t kept me from seeing the flaws that this OVA has (the biggest flaw is the loose story but I\'m not complaining because the story continues in the next OVA).Overall:I highly recommend this anime if you like the wackier more drama filled harems, and don\'t mind the male protagonist not choosing openly choosing any of the girls. cave that his grandpa claims is the sleeping/resting place of an evil demon named Ryoko, and that ""demon"" was sealed away by Tenchi\'s ancestor, Yosho.

I\'ve been going through some personal issues, as of late. I was in rehab for a couple of months, because I got addicted to soap, but now I\'m clean. HA! You see, that\'s how you start off the new year, son! Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki. My second favorite harem show next to the Monogatari series. At first glance, Tenchi Muyo seems like a trashy harem comedy that just happens to be a sci-fi. However, if you peel back all of the layers and take a deeper look you get...a trashy harem comedy that just happens to be a...sci-fi. In all seriousness, Tenchi Muyo\'s story and lore is so unbelievably dense that you could use it as a weapon and bash the skull of a Puma. There\'s a lot to explore with this one. Let\'s get into it.Many centuries ago, a horrible monster terrorized the planet and brought suffering to the entire world. One day, out of pretty much nowhere, a legendary warrior by the name of Yosho fought the beast and sealed it in a wooden sword and hid it within a deep, deep cave. That story is not inaccurate. Our main lead, Tenchi Masaki, wants to find that sword more than anything. You see, that story was told to Tenchi by his grandfather, and of course, Tenchi finds the sword and releases the dreadful monster. But wait, that monster turned out to be a super hot kawaii desu ne girl. Ryoko, that golden godde- I mean, she\'s okay. I don\'t like her or anything.  Y-yeah. That\'s what I meant. She has caused me to spill more seed than Muhammad Ali punching a birdfeeder. Don\'t fucking judge me.Without her powers, Ryoko is pretty much harmless at that point, so they keep her around the house. She also has a pet/spaceship named Ryo-Ohki, who is just the cutest little thing. After Ryoko becomes part of the main cast, we\'re introduced to a gaggle of new girls who will be a part of the harem. You have Ayeka and Sasami Jurai. These girls are Juraian royalty with Ayeka being the older sister and Sasami being the younger sister. Ayeka is on a personal quest to find her older brother, Yosho. That legendary warrior I mentioned earlier, who was next in line for the Juraian throne. I don\'t know if ""Juraian"" is an actual word, but I\'m keeping it in anyway. Yosho left planet Jurai to defeat Ryoko, since she\'s a space pirate and tried to conquer their home planet. Sasami doesn\'t do much. She typically keeps Ayeka under control when Ryoko pisses her off. She does all of the cleaning and cooking, and is just a genuine sweetheart. She also wants to see her brother, but she doesn\'t care as much as Ayeka. Next we have Mihoshi. Mihoshi is a galaxy police officer who is hunting down Ryoko. Ryoko\'s influence in the story really creates a domino effect for introducing these characters. Many of them would not even be in the story if it weren\'t for her evil doing. Mihoshi is terrible at her job and the only reason why she\'s in the position she\'s in is because she has family connections. She is such a blatant airhead and is probably my least favorite character in the series. If I had to say one positive thing about her, it would be that she\'s kind of cute. A lot of the women in this series are pretty cute, honestly. And finally, we have Washu. She\'s considered to be the greatest scientist in the entire known universe and is thousands of years older than the rest of the cast. OVA Washu is far better than TV Washu. I\'m not sure why they did this, but TV Washu is just insufferable in the TV series, because they changed her personality. They gave TV Washu a very smug and egotistical attitude. She knows she\'s incredible and that\'s all she spouts. It makes her character more shallow compared to her OVA counterpart who\'s a lot more entertaining and humble.I did a surprisingly good job not giving away spoilers. I will admit, a non-spoiler review of a series like this is not very convincing. I\'m fully aware that harem shows have a bad reputation in the anime community. Please trust me, this one is exceptional. Watch season two after this one, it does a better job at explaining the world of Tenchi Muyo and gives more context to the first season. And it even foreshadows some future events later in the series. Sadly, it does go downhill after season two. Season three is the proper conclusion to the OVA\'s, so you have to watch it. Everything after that is a stupid cash grab that you shouldn\'t watch at all. One last thing, the OP for season one is awesome. It\'s just a sweet ass nineties jam session and I love it. I don\'t know who\'s playing that fretless bass in the background, but that person deserves a medal. My scores:Story: 8/10Art: 9/10Sound: 8/10Characters: 7/10Enjoyment: 8/10Overall: 8/10 sci-fi.

Don\'t fucking judge me.Without her powers, Ryoko is pretty much harmless at that point, so they keep her around the house. She also has a pet/spaceship named Ryo-Ohki, who is just the cutest little thing. After Ryoko becomes part of the main cast, we\'re introduced to a gaggle of new girls who will be a part of the harem. You have Ayeka and Sasami Jurai. These girls are Juraian royalty with Ayeka being the older sister and Sasami being the younger sister. Ayeka is on a personal quest to find her older brother, Yosho. That legendary warrior I mentioned earlier, who was next in line for the Juraian throne. I don\'t know if ""Juraian"" is an actual word, but I\'m keeping it in anyway. Yosho left planet Jurai to defeat Ryoko, since she\'s a space pirate and tried to conquer their home planet. Sasami doesn\'t do much. She typically keeps Ayeka under control when Ryoko pisses her off. She does all of the cleaning and cooking, and is just a genuine sweetheart. She also wants to see her brother, but she doesn\'t care as much as Ayeka. Next we have Mihoshi. Mihoshi is a galaxy police officer who is hunting down Ryoko. Ryoko\'s influence in the story really creates a domino effect for introducing these characters. Many of them would not even be in the story if it weren\'t for her evil doing. Mihoshi is terrible at her job and the only reason why she\'s in the position she\'s in is because she has family connections. She is such a blatant airhead and is probably my least favorite character in the series. If I had to say one positive thing about her, it would be that she\'s kind of cute. A lot of the women in this series are pretty cute, honestly. And finally, we have Washu. She\'s considered to be the greatest scientist in the entire known universe and is thousands of years older than the rest of the cast. OVA Washu is far better than TV Washu. I\'m not sure why they did this, but TV Washu is just insufferable in the TV series, because they changed her personality. They gave TV Washu a very smug and egotistical attitude. She knows she\'s incredible and that\'s all she spouts. It makes her character more shallow compared to her OVA counterpart who\'s a lot more entertaining and humble.I did a surprisingly good job not giving away spoilers. I will admit, a non-spoiler review of a series like this is not very convincing. I\'m fully aware that harem shows have a bad reputation in the anime community. Please trust me, this one is exceptional. Watch season two after this one, it does a better job at explaining the world of Tenchi Muyo and gives more context to the first season. And it even foreshadows some future events later in the series. Sadly, it does go downhill after season two. Season three is the proper conclusion to the OVA\'s, so you have to watch it. Everything after that is a stupid cash grab that you shouldn\'t watch at all. One last thing, the OP for season one is awesome. It\'s just a sweet ass nineties jam session and I love it. I don\'t know who\'s playing that fretless bass in the background, but that person deserves a medal.

And best of all--the fanservice is relatively minimal!This bizarre but thoroughly fun Science Fantasy rom-com is sadly not widely known by a lot of young folks nowadays. It\'s definitely not for the kids since there is some nudity, though it feels far more natural and less gratuitous than the cringe-worthy breast physics present in today\'s trope-filled torrent of junk we need to sift through nowadays, plus some dialogue can get EXTREMELY suggestive.

Plus there\'s a heccin\' cute space puppy-kitty that is also a spaceship and can morph into a surprisingly cute girl. Both the smol and huggable kind and and curvy kind. Yeah, I don\'t get it either.It\'s kind of hard to explain this show without revealing any major plot points or ruining the great worldbuilding.

And this is also the first show in this journey where I thought it was quite enjoyable.The girls were great in their own ways (Ryoko especially), although I did think Mihoshi was rather undercooked compared to the other girls. Felt kind of like a third wheel almost, but I digress.This is a shorter series, and its also very story rich. There are times where you NEED to be paying attention as x or y story detail will become relevant later, and if its not fresh in your headspace things...can feel kind of confusing at times.I would say the biggest issue with this series, honestly, is the downsides that came with only having 6 episodes to work with.Some story segments felt like they didn't have much screentime to truly be processed, and sometimes things move quickly to a point keeping up can feel tricky.On the flipside, this series is so story rich that due to only having 6 episodes, so much time has to be spent on story that we don't get nearly as much SoL type stuff with the girls.Some of the relationship developments with Tenchi felt rarther rushed, and I think that is almost entirely due to a lack of screen time towards them just, hanging out, living life, that kind of thing.However, outside of certain things needing more time, I have little complaints honestly. Its a very solid show, all things considered.This is easily an early rendition of the Battle Harem subgenre of harems, and while shows from that subgenre have more time dedicated to fun stuff outside of battle (Sora no Otoshimono does this particularly well), and that is the one aspect this one lacked quite heavily.BUT, I think its made up for, largely due to how good the girls are.Ryoko is a fiesty, teasing women. The kind of girl that wraps you around her finger.Aeka is more laid back, more emotional and sweet. Someone to share a cuddle with as opposed to a pillow fight.Mihoshi is more comic relief than anything, and her development with Tenchi felt like a big nothingburger. But I do like what she adds to the group.Washuu is super interesting, and its honestly a shame she joined so late so we rarely got to see much of her. She kind of reminds me of Yaku from 100 Kanojo. I can easily see her becoming a favorite if she had more time to shine.All in all, if you are a fan of the battle harem genre, it wouldn't hurt to watch this and see the roots. Most of its flaws are simply a result of having a shorter length, and its still got more than enough going for it where that doesn't get in the way nearly as much as with other shows.Solid show. Could be a GREAT show with more meat on its bones. can feel kind of confusing at times.I would say the biggest issue with this series, honestly, is the downsides that came with only having 6 episodes to work with.Some story segments felt like they didn't have much screentime to truly be processed, and sometimes things move quickly to a point keeping up can feel tricky.On the flipside, this series is so story rich that due to only having 6 episodes, so much time has to be spent on story that we don't get nearly as much SoL type stuff with the girls.Some of the relationship developments with Tenchi felt rarther rushed, and I think that is almost entirely due to a lack of screen time towards them just, hanging out, living life, that kind of thing.However, outside of certain things needing more time, I have little complaints honestly.

There`s little to be interested at here besides Ryo-ohki, who is a sweet and cute cat-rabbit animal with a personality and the first episode when compared to the rest of the episodes in the series was okay. This also had some good music, though I disliked the dub, the actors sounded like they were just reading their lines and Ayeka`s voice sounded too old for her physical age. It started off great and interesting until Ryoko came along. I was interested in...what will happen next but once that grouch Ryoko came up, the series started dropping the ball more and more. There is not much of a plot here and all it focuses on is silly comedy and melodrama.Why is everyone all gaga for Tenchi? He`s a bland average Joe character, he`s not that cute or handsome, he is whiny, dense, and an all-around forgettable character. Sure he had an interesting story in the first episode but character-wise, he`s iffy.The animation and designs show their age. Tenchi is supposed to be the guy the girls are hot for, yet he`s not even that hot, he just looks like a boring everyman character. A lot of the animation is excessively goofy and there is a lot of exaggerated facial expressions for the sake of comedy, which I blame the decade it came out in for. I know that it fits the style of the show but I`ve seen some anime that came out around that time that had less stupidly poor goofy animation.Aside from the space element, action, and a little mystery, it`s not much different from your average harem anime. It`s disappointing because there could`ve been more plot and for a series revolving around a bunch of quirky girls living with a guy, I was appalled by how much drama and crying there is in this show. It can jump from being a romantic sitcom to a space opera melodrama and it just didn`t mix well. It`s almost like it didn`t know what it wanted to be.Back to the characters, most of them are just busy fighting over Tenchi and therefore, aren`t that interesting. All of them are either crybabies, dense, bratty or all of the above. Sasami is the nicest one out of the whole cast but even she turned out to be a Mary-Sue with her overly friendly attitude she has towards everyone. There was even one episode where she was crying over Mihoshi leaving but from what I`ve seen, they don`t interact that much, they`re not that close so why is she having such strong feelings about her leaving? She`s like what, 6-9? And she cries too often in the series!This series is so overrated and I don't get the appeal of it.

The iDOLM@STER Movie: Kagayaki no Mukougawa e!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/17437/The_iDOLMSTER_Movie__Kagayaki_no_Mukougawa_e,"[""The latest (and perhaps final) animated offering in the Idolmaster franchise is a somewhat enjoyable, though equally forgettable ride that unfortunately falls into the same trappings as the original series. If you were looking for cute idols doing cute things... well, you will likely fall asleep halfway through.The problem with the Idolmaster movie is that it doesn't quite understand what makes the franchise exciting to so many people. It's well-produced, the characters are fun and unique, the music is great-- exactly what any fan of the games would want-- but as soon as it starts to reach a high point, it just pops like...a balloon, replaced instead with mundane, boring drama that will send you into an hour-long yawning session. Even worse, the drama here is focused on a new group of idols rather than the main characters, so there's even less reason for anyone (save for perhaps the most zealous of fans) to care about anything that occurs in the movie's latter half. At least the girl with the side ponytail is cute, I suppose... ?It's a shame, because the first forty minutes are a ton of fun. As the girls are now all accomplished idols (famous enough to have their own television station or to throw the ceremonial pitch in a professional baseball game), the constant battle to keep 765 Productions afloat is largely a thing of the past, and the girls are now able to simply relax and be themselves for a change. And so they do, joking with each other, participating in silly commercials and occasionally hitting on our ol' pal, the Producer. It's fun. It's cute. Idolmaster is at its best when it doesn't take itself seriously and focuses instead on the positive aspects of the girls, rather than their daddy issues or their ability to scream at one another. As a cute slice-of-life, Idolmaster is excellent, but as a drama, it is trite, boring twaddle that you could find for sale at the dollar store. And unfortunately the movie decides to take the latter approach.That's not to say that the drama in Idolmaster is offensively bad, but it certainly does not offer anything new or interesting for the series. If you have watched even one idol anime before, you've probably experienced everything that the movie's dramatic portions have to offer. Girls struggle to practice in time for the deadline, they have arguments with one another, one threatens to leave the group-- you know how the story goes. It would be a little more interesting if the drama developed one or more of the characters by showing a more complex side to their personality, but nothing of the sort ever happens. The movie isn't even about the main cast in the first place. It's about the B Team. This may have worked if it was in the context of a second season, but developing seven new idols on-top of the main twelve (and then there's still the Producer, and Ritsuko, and...) in a two hour movie is simply impossible. The movie was not their time and place to shine.If you're a fan of Haruka, though, you will find plenty to enjoy here since she is elevated to the role of protagonist, albeit at the cost of all the other idols. She serves as a role-model and a mentor to the other group, encouraging them and helping to resolve their issues. It's a nice change from the main TV series where she was always the underdog, the motivated but naive idol, and it shows that the characters are indeed maturing as time passes.The Producer is also a surprisingly positive presence in the story, just as he was in the main series. The idea of giving the blank Producer from the games a face and a personality was controversial to some because it hinted towards the possibility of another boring, oblivious harem protagonist (hello, Infinite Stratos), but that has never been the case here. He is a genuine character in his own right, as important to the story as any of the idols. He's inexperienced at his job, yes, but his passion is real and it makes sense why the girls would feel attached to him. With his plan to leave Japan temporarily in order to study, he shows that he's willing to change and improve, that he's not content simply being the same person for eternity. The Producer is an honestly dynamic, three-dimensional character and the anime would not be anywhere near as exciting had he simply been a blank face like he was in the games.The music in the Idolmaster movie is outstanding, perhaps even the greatest part of the entire experience, though that should not come as any surprise. There's the occasional montage with one of Idolmaster's iconic songs playing in the background, though it never breaks the pacing as it did in the case of something like A-Channel (... does anyone even remember that show exists?) The performances themselves are excellent and by far some of the best the idol genre has ever seen, although there are just too few of them. It might even be worth watching the movie solely for the five-minute performance at the end. If nothing else, Idolmaster has shown that it's still the leader of the idol genre with regards to music.The animation also bears a mention for how natural and fluid it feels. There's a few short scenes that are even rotoscoped (and no, not the kind of rotoscoping found in Aku no Hana) which look incredibly lifelike. And whereas most idol anime opt to resort to CG when animating their performances, Idolmaster is drawn almost fully by hand. It's certainly a good looking anime- at least when it matters the most.Should you watch the Idolmaster movie? If you are desperately craving for more of the characters and don't mind sitting through an hour of boredom, sure. But do keep in mind that the amount of screen-time for any non-Haruka or B-Team idol is pretty much nil. If you're the type of person who watches Idolmaster primarily or even solely to see one or two of your favourite idols (and provided that idol isn't Haruka), there really isn't a whole lot to look forward to here. There's no Mami, Ami, Takane, Makoto, Chihaya-- just a few scenes of them sitting mindlessly in the background with the occasional line of dialogue of every now and then. The movie is barely even a story about 765 Productions, anyway.It's a nice sleeping aid, but if you're looking for a better idol anime, Aikatsu and Love Live 2 are duly recommended. a balloon, replaced instead with mundane, boring drama that will send you into an hour-long yawning session.

It was an unexpected round trip due to my checkered history with this franchise, not being terribly enamored with the original TV series--let’s save time and call it “Classic”--falling in love with the Cinderella Girls TV series, trying to get into the SideM TV series to no effect, and peeking back to the closing chapter of Classic out of curiosityPerhaps my on and off relationship with this franchise disqualifies me from quantifying this film’s place among its...co-branded relatives. I know not whether I can speak for iDOLM@STER fans, idol fans in general, or even anime fans. I can only speak for myself, but the disparity between Classic and Beyond the Brilliant Future! despite sharing the same ensemble, makes for an emotional core that eludes descriptionBut to be honest, my first impression with this film was rather pedestrian; simultaneously enjoyable while starved for a sign of incoming narrative catharsis. But as the curtain fell on the film’s first act, I realized what this film was about, and from there I knew I was in for something a little specialBeyond the Brilliant Future! is a film dealing in experience, walking side by side with enthusiastic aspirations and tangling with tangible insecurity. At the center of it all is Haruka Amami, thrust into the role of leader as she guides her peers to their first arena concert. Along the way, a group of aspiring idols is taken under Haruka and co’s tutelage. Though the gap in on-stage performance ability between the established idols and the idols in training is obvious, it’s soon clear the established idols, and especially Haruka herself, still have a lot to learn themselvesThis is Haruka’s story through and through. Her bestowment of experience and the experience she gains is the canvas through which her character is expressed, painted by scene and song alike. Rain or shine, there are many moments where a certain frankness permeates her feelings. The whimsical fluttering in the early morning sun beyond her cheerful demeanor in the everyday. Her emotional maturity in confiding with her closest friend despite her role as leader, the only visible expressions mere reflections off a nearby window. To the very songs themselves, encapsulating everything from when she was a new idol herself, to the heights she’s reached and the triumph’s she’s hadBut where Haruka’s character is most realized is through her relationship with a certain idol in training named Kana Yabuki. The plucky Kana adores the idol Haruka, her nervousness and fervor apparent but never a caricature of either shyness or admiration. At the same time, Haruka’s response to Kana’s intensity never elevates her to being above Kana, but sets them as equals from the outside looking in. At once, Haruka is elated and embarrassed, flattered and flustered, happy to be mentor and nervous -as- mentor, learning as much as Kana is along the way. The balance of humors between them perfectly grounds their relationship. The story understands what being starstruck is while the film understands how admiration actsThrough it all, Haruka runs through an emotional gauntlet as she juggles leading her peers while guiding Kana and the new idols. Throughout the film, the story slowly builds an escalation of tension on palpable worries and fears. But rarely does the story overstep anything it ever establishes; it’s clear their problems are a major obstacle for them, but the film scarcely draws attention to it with manufactured musical moments, instead preferring to punctuate high drama with low ambience. The film has -confidence- in itself enough to let the writing quality of its story come through in its deliberate pacing, to let the character writing express its depth for itself than to cue in for when it’s being expressedBut in committing so heavily to one main character from a cast of characters that was a true ensemble, the film runs afoul of having too many characters that contribute nary a much to the story. Remember how I said I might be disqualified from quantifying this film? I wasn’t terribly enamored with Classic in the first place, so where the film would go in terms of its focal point would be irrelevant to me. It might be safe of me to assume you’d really like movie this if Haruka was your favorite character from Classic, but Kana is the deuteragonist. I’d feel a bit dishonest if I didn’t disclose where I’m approaching this film fromThat isn’t to say all of the characters got lost in the shuffle from Classic to movie. Chihaya Kisaragi has the same role to Haruka as before, being a close friend to confide in and be open with. The Producer and Ritsuko Akizuki are also more or less intact, but now distancing themselves from Haruka and her peers as they become the mentors for Kana and the new idols. Most pleasantly surprising, however, is Iori Minase, who imparts a few words of wisdom for the competitive Shiho KitazawaWhile Shiho felt like an antagonist who only expedited what would’ve happened eventually, she’s at least understandable, owing much to the preamble set in the early parts of the film that build to more drama as the story goes on. But the biggest problem with Shiho’s storyline, and Kana’s by extension, is the disconnect between what underlies their aspirations and the cinematography of the arena concert. The story is focused on Haruka and Kana, but the arena concert emphasizes Haruka and her peers. I know this is likely due to what The iDOLM@STER is as a franchise, but the disconnect between them is still noticeableThat’s my biggest issue with that storyline, but it’s overall just a nitpick that’s amplified because of how much I bought into that thread in the first place. Putting that aside, the arena concert song itself, M@STERPIECE, is, well, worthy of its title. It’s a tour de force of the Classic ensemble, as each of their voices stand out when they need to before harmonizing to perfection. The overall feel is nothing if not triumphant, emblematic of their accomplishments. Some of the insert songs are also nice callbacks to when Classic was the only anime The iDOLM@STER had. Definitely a nice touch of the past to accentuate the story-driven songs of the film’s presentBut what I found more pleasing than the music were the visuals, and not solely for how good they look in and of themselves--high polish and budget can fade over time--but the direction within them. The film has a knack for communicating in juxtaposition between characters where dialog would be redundant, from the idols in training to Haruka to Miki Hoshii to Chihaya to Iori. And at its best, the film expresses some emphatically poignant epiphanies with nary a line of confirmation. This is part of why the film is often so confident to let the character and story writing express itself, because it can still speak volumes without uttering a word. And I just realized how ironic that is for a franchise rooted to characters who dance and -sing-Regardless of what the core of the franchise is, I’m glad the original iDOLM@STER anime had this chapter and I’m highly satisfied I checked this out. This was the entry the original series needed, and the film the first face of the franchise in Haruka Amami deserved. Beyond the Brilliant Future! isn’t quite the M@STERPIECE to end a Classic, but if subsequent entries in the franchise can stick to this level of care, then that’s just one more step to a Brilliant Future co-branded relatives. I know not whether I can speak for iDOLM@STER fans, idol fans in general, or even anime fans. I can only speak for myself, but the disparity between Classic and Beyond the Brilliant Future! despite sharing the same ensemble, makes for an emotional core that eludes descriptionBut to be honest, my first impression with this film was rather pedestrian; simultaneously enjoyable while starved for a sign of incoming narrative catharsis. But as the curtain fell on the film’s first act, I realized what this film was about, and from there I knew I was in for something a little specialBeyond the Brilliant Future! is a film dealing in experience, walking side by side with enthusiastic aspirations and tangling with tangible insecurity. At the center of it all is Haruka Amami, thrust into the role of leader as she guides her peers to their first arena concert. Along the way, a group of aspiring idols is taken under Haruka and co’s tutelage. Though the gap in on-stage performance ability between the established idols and the idols in training is obvious, it’s soon clear the established idols, and especially Haruka herself, still have a lot to learn themselvesThis is Haruka’s story through and through. Her bestowment of experience and the experience she gains is the canvas through which her character is expressed, painted by scene and song alike. Rain or shine, there are many moments where a certain frankness permeates her feelings. The whimsical fluttering in the early morning sun beyond her cheerful demeanor in the everyday. Her emotional maturity in confiding with her closest friend despite her role as leader, the only visible expressions mere reflections off a nearby window. To the very songs themselves, encapsulating everything from when she was a new idol herself, to the heights she’s reached and the triumph’s she’s hadBut where Haruka’s character is most realized is through her relationship with a certain idol in training named Kana Yabuki. The plucky Kana adores the idol Haruka, her nervousness and fervor apparent but never a caricature of either shyness or admiration. At the same time, Haruka’s response to Kana’s intensity never elevates her to being above Kana, but sets them as equals from the outside looking in. At once, Haruka is elated and embarrassed, flattered and flustered, happy to be mentor and nervous -as- mentor, learning as much as Kana is along the way. The balance of humors between them perfectly grounds their relationship. The story understands what being starstruck is while the film understands how admiration actsThrough it all, Haruka runs through an emotional gauntlet as she juggles leading her peers while guiding Kana and the new idols. Throughout the film, the story slowly builds an escalation of tension on palpable worries and fears. But rarely does the story overstep anything it ever establishes; it’s clear their problems are a major obstacle for them, but the film scarcely draws attention to it with manufactured musical moments, instead preferring to punctuate high drama with low ambience. The film has -confidence- in itself enough to let the writing quality of its story come through in its deliberate pacing, to let the character writing express its depth for itself than to cue in for when it’s being expressedBut in committing so heavily to one main character from a cast of characters that was a true ensemble, the film runs afoul of having too many characters that contribute nary a much to the story. Remember how I said I might be disqualified from quantifying this film? I wasn’t terribly enamored with Classic in the first place, so where the film would go in terms of its focal point would be irrelevant to me. It might be safe of me to assume you’d really like movie this if Haruka was your favorite character from Classic, but Kana is the deuteragonist. I’d feel a bit dishonest if I didn’t disclose where I’m approaching this film fromThat isn’t to say all of the characters got lost in the shuffle from Classic to movie. Chihaya Kisaragi has the same role to Haruka as before, being a close friend to confide in and be open with. The Producer and Ritsuko Akizuki are also more or less intact, but now distancing themselves from Haruka and her peers as they become the mentors for Kana and the new idols. Most pleasantly surprising, however, is Iori Minase, who imparts a few words of wisdom for the competitive Shiho KitazawaWhile Shiho felt like an antagonist who only expedited what would’ve happened eventually, she’s at least understandable, owing much to the preamble set in the early parts of the film that build to more drama as the story goes on. But the biggest problem with Shiho’s storyline, and Kana’s by extension, is the disconnect between what underlies their aspirations and the cinematography of the arena concert. The story is focused on Haruka and Kana, but the arena concert emphasizes Haruka and her peers. I know this is likely due to what The iDOLM@STER is as a franchise, but the disconnect between them is still noticeableThat’s my biggest issue with that storyline, but it’s overall just a nitpick that’s amplified because of how much I bought into that thread in the first place. Putting that aside, the arena concert song itself, M@STERPIECE, is, well, worthy of its title. It’s a tour de force of the Classic ensemble, as each of their voices stand out when they need to before harmonizing to perfection. The overall feel is nothing if not triumphant, emblematic of their accomplishments. Some of the insert songs are also nice callbacks to when Classic was the only anime The iDOLM@STER had. Definitely a nice touch of the past to accentuate the story-driven songs of the film’s presentBut what I found more pleasing than the music were the visuals, and not solely for how good they look in and of themselves--high polish and budget can fade over time--but the direction within them. The film has a knack for communicating in juxtaposition between characters where dialog would be redundant, from the idols in training to Haruka to Miki Hoshii to Chihaya to Iori. And at its best, the film expresses some emphatically poignant epiphanies with nary a line of confirmation. This is part of why the film is often so confident to let the character and story writing express itself, because it can still speak volumes without uttering a word. And I just realized how ironic that is for a franchise rooted to characters who dance and -sing-Regardless of what the core of the franchise is, I’m glad the original iDOLM@STER anime had this chapter and I’m highly satisfied I checked this out. This was the entry the original series needed, and the film the first face of the franchise in Haruka Amami deserved. Beyond the Brilliant Future! isn’t quite the M@STERPIECE to end a Classic, but if subsequent entries in the franchise can stick to this level of care, then that’s just one more step to a Brilliant Future', 'I absolutely love love love idolmaster, but this movie is really bad. I have to give it credit, it is bad in a way where you will be very invested and be yelling at the screen. But yes, this movie is bad to the point that I have no idea that they didn’t realize that it was a bad idea. Basically, the plot revolves around 7 new characters who are introduced as backup dancers for the classic original 13 imas characters. The drama is that, well, the backup dancers can’t dance. So they just sulk around cause they aren’t getting any better and they’re disappointing...everyone. One of these backup dancers is particularly mean and is always getting onto the others for how bad they are at dancing, even though she can’t dance either. Another of the backup dancers is so affected by the mean one that she quits. (Honestly I don’t know why they don’t all quit or get fired since they can’t do the only thing they were hired to do.) And then everyone has to go and convince her to come back and try again. After that, (when there is 5 minutes left in the movie) the dancers finally get it together apparently and all is well.So yes, the main conflict has nothing to do with the characters who are actually on the movie poster and who you would assume that it’s about. Now this on its own isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but the characters it does revolve around are just going around being terrible at their jobs and fighting all the time. These backup dancer characters would go on to become Idolmaster Million Live, and I have no clue how the writers of this movie thought that this would be a good introduction to them. The original 13 characters are barely in the movie, Haruka plays mediator between the fighting dancers but doesn’t do much else. And then the others all just have one or two lines throughout the whole thing. Interestingly, Chihaya (who has a very bad relationship with her family) has a line where she says that she’s going to reach out to her mom and invite her to their concert. We see her put the letter in the mail, and then it never gets followed up on. They never show if her mom responded or if she came to the concert or what. I have no idea why they put this in here? Did they just forget they did or what?Now onto a positive, the music is amazing. And I think it might have something to do with the fact that the music sequences for the most part don’t include the dancer characters. But the soundtrack is great and the little music video type things are fun. NOW HOWEVER, the final musical number, Masterpiece. It’s a great song, no doubt. An iconic idolmaster song that always makes me a little bit emotional. But, in the scene where they are finally performing the big concert and they sing this song, we get to see the backup dancers dance. And….they just clap. Their dance is just clapping to the beat. I was so mad lollllll. The entire drama was how they just could not dance and they just could not improve….and all they had to do was clap on beat??!?! I absolutely cannot fathom why they didn’t give them a complex and impressive dance when it was literally the entire point of the movie. They’re getting outdanced by the original 13 characters (or I guess 12 cause Ritsuko isn’t on stage) and they at no point in the story had any trouble with dancing.This movie is so bizarre…I can’t even begin to comprehend how none of the people working on it noticed the giant faults. everyone.

The TV series was generally a fun watch and this movie basically feels like more of the show. While I liked this overall, I'd be lying if I didn't say it was kinda lackluster. And I'll keep this spoiler-free as can be.The movie starts off pretty well introducing us to the girls following the end of the show. They're all accomplished, experienced, and established idols to the point where they're basically superstars landing all sorts of big gigs. The beginning of this movie has everyone unite once...again to prep for a huge gig the producer lands them and that first 40 minutes or so until time for the ending performance was this series doing what I feel it does best, and that's being casual.iDOLM@STER hasn't necessarily been great when it comes to being dramatic, but it's had some situations that were handled better than others. And the entire movie past that first 40 minutes until that last performance has everyone suddenly hit with two big cases: Producer revealing bad news to the 765 girls and then 765 being tossed into the turmoil of another group's struggles. I actually think Producer has earned the right to act as a plot device in this final showing of the 765 branch of the iDOLM@STER series as he's been developed into a notable figure through the anime who keeps the girls afloat as idols as well as striving to do a good job in his role for everyone else's sake opposed to his cookie cutter portrayal in the games. But then the main issue with this movie lies in that other group I mentioned. I didn't really mind their presence per se, but they introduce a degree of tension that you could say isn't enough to carry basically an entire movie on it's own, and then it's not entirely something we hadn't seen already.Now onto the second group. They kinda squander the potential screentime members of 765 could've gotten because they're given a bit too much focus IMO. I actually like their inclusion in general because I thought we'd be getting some kind of passing a torch kinda moment with 765 to them, but we're thrown too deep into their issues and it affects everyone because a good part of the movie becomes more about them than 765. Don't forget, 765 already consists of 14 main members (15 if you count Kotori), so it doesn't help that they added 7 more people for them to share a screen with so a lot of characters still get screen time but their presence is subdued. I was definitely disappointed that the majority of the 765 girls didn't really have any individual moments to look back on.Of everyone thrown into the shuffle here, Haruka gets elevated as she's put in an important role that sees her bearing the most responsibility on behalf of everyone, so if you're a fan of her or like her you'll be pleased there just as I was. It felt like an appropriate role for her because it challenges her to make decisions for problems that other members would've either had less difficulty dealing with or couldn't have done so with the same degree of tact. I also liked her interactions with another member of the other group as Haruka is seen as a role model for her but the two are very similar in many ways.When it comes to general aspects such as animation and music this movie does just as well in those areas as it did in the show. Guess my only small complaint for music would be the execution as I would've liked it if there were more moments where entire songs were performed rather than used for brief transitions.Overall I'd say I liked this movie, and if you were a fan of the main show or the series in general you'll probably be content with this. It does unfortunately have a lot of the same issues as the show though. The drama is…considerably typical for an idol series and it felt more like a side story for the show than a plot to carry a movie that would've been better served as a farewell for 765 given this is the last main anime entry. Wouldn't say this is a must watch entry, but it's a decent conclusion to their story even if it isn't actually satisfyingly conclusive enough. again to prep for a huge gig the producer lands them and that first 40 minutes or so until time for the ending performance was this series doing what I feel it does best, and that's being casual.iDOLM@STER hasn't necessarily been great when it comes to being dramatic, but it's had some situations that were handled better than others.

The Cambridge Dictionary describes it as such: ""a person who is not expected to succeed in or unexpectedly wins an election, race, or other competition"", or how the Mirriam-Webster Dictionary worded the definition even better: a usually little-known contender (such as a racehorse) that makes an unexpectedly good showing"". And in this season, get ready for a wild goose chase of a show...that will have you constantly be duped, bamboozled, bait-and-switched, especially for fans of this VERY specific theme in all of the history of its genre: Yuuki Bakuhatsu Bang Bravern a.k.a Brave Bang Bravern!, in collaboration with Cygames and produced by their in-house studio, and directed by the man, not the myth, but THE legend himself: Masami Oobari. The good ol\' fashioned Super Robot show is NOT dead yet, and it makes a triumphant return into relevancy! Who, if not ANYONE, saw this coming, if any AT ALL!?""When I was a kid, I wanted to be a hero. What I really wanted to be...was a Titanostrider pilot."" This is the life calling of the man who belonged in the US Marine Corps\'s 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force: 2nd Lieutentant Lewis Smith. He is part of a joint AD-RIMPAC military exercise between the Americans and Japanese, of which he meets a close buddy that will fight alongside him for the rest of the series: 2nd Lieutentant Isami Ao of Japan\'s Ground Self-Defense Forces\'s Special Armoured Group. The two brothers who are working together, are met by fate...because out of nowhere, mysterious enemies start invading their military ground in Oahu, Hawaii, and causing everyone to burst into panic mode. You see, the normal Real Robots that both forces have, are the standard Titanostrider a.k.a TS robots, mechs that are only good from invasions to exercises in say, reconnaissance missions and the like. And these mysterious enemies? They\'re Deathdrives, Super Robots who rely on the power of humans to pilot them. And why do they know this? Because there is only one entity that knows this, and it\'s their biggest ally ever *cue Isami\'s ""Where is that music coming from!?"" Pikachu moment*: Bravern, the Superhero Robot who will be their salvation to defeating the Deathdrives.It\'s incredibly creative how this show has managed to hook, line and sinker everyone by being secretive until its eventual reveal. To give some context, the Brave series was a Japanese-only old school mainstream franchise which was once produced by Sunrise, made from the remnants of the failed marketing of Transformers (yes, that Michael Bay movie franchise) in Japan, which didn\'t really resonate all that much with its people. Instead, at the time, the toy company Takara (now Takara Tomy) and Sunrise decided to develop a new franchise, which would spawn new toy lines and a soon-astounding anime series, with the common theme being ""Bravery"", the interaction between the robot ""Brave"", who has a heart and the boy who enters its heart and bears the will of the mecha, the union of the robots, and other unique themes. There is also no direct relationship between each series in terms of world view or time, so therefore, almost all the works are different to each other in terms of themes and motif. Bear in mind that the Brave series would go on to inspire and spawn big-name franchises like Gundam with Sunrise at the helm from the 1980s to today.So then, where does the legendary director Masami Oobari stand in all of this? First of all, he\'s actually more known as the mecha and character designer, who\'s worked on shows like Ashi Production\'s 1983-1984 Special Armored Battalion Dorvack, the Japanese translation of Transformers (outsourced by Toei Animation to them sometimes), and Studio Pierrot\'s 1984-1985 Star Musketeer Bismarck as an animation director, with the big break at the age of 19 when he got his first major break of landing the role of mecha designer on the same studio (Ashi Production)\'s 1985 Dancougar – Super Beast Machine God series. His signature mech designs basically carried his name throughout the mid-1980s and onwards from said Dancougar series to the various Brave series: Sunrise\'s 1991 series The Brave of Sun Fighbird, 1994 series The Brave Police J-Decker, and the most recent up to that point, Gonzo\'s 2002 to 2004 Gravion serie, which he personally created and directed the series alongside renowned mecha designer Kunio Okawara, the FIRST man in the Japanese industry to be credited as one. So, for mecha fans all around the world who are well-acquainted with the Masari Oobari name, it shouldn\'t really come as a surprise...or is it?When you put Masami Oobari and the spiritual Brave successor in the hands of Cygames (the company who brought you Granblue Fantasy and Princess Connect! Re:Dive to name a few), the surprises don\'t stop there. Even the Teaser PV released was as vague as it would get for everyone both suspecting and unsuspecting that we would be getting a new mecha project series, and just about the only clue would be the way that the title is stylized in the old-school Brave series logo of all things. But this original show does one thing and one thing only: be the biggest liar that it has ever been. Cygames has always been the company to do unorthodox things, and when the main PV dropped nearer to the anime\'s release, it was NOTHING of the sort, leaving people to think that it\'s a Real Robot show. The kicker comes when Episode 1 dropped, it BLEW up the entire social internet commentary that the show IS indeed the old-fashioned Super Robot show that Masari Oobari has been known for.At this point, you\'re probably wondering: ""Is this it, is this all it is?"", to which I say from the point of Cygames and Masami Oobari: ""Do you think that our collaboration together on this original show will be as predictable as it is?"" The bait-and-switch will continue, right after this.The two brothers fated for each other, Isami and Lewis Smith, parallel as they may be, they both have different ambitions as fellow military mech pilots, trying to name a name for themselves. But all of this changes when Bravern comes out of nowhere to defend the humans from the Deathdrives, and for every attack he does, he has to shout his name in the most jovial manner. The kicker is that after he saves the humans, he only acknowledges Isami and warrants him to become his pilot. Suddenly, you\'re being bamboozled again: this is NOT just a Super Robot, but a Super REAL Robot! The thing is, Isami is a rather reserved man who wants to deal as much damage as possible, at the cusp of as less casualties as possible, and even the most minute of the Death Stranding vibes will force him into turmoil. On the other hand, Lewis Smith embodies the fight of any typical loyal American citizen, and wants to offer himself in exchange for Isami to pilot Bravern, which he gets rejected, saying that the fusion between human and robot will be unstable...NOT knowing that his nightmares with Bravern will become a pivotal point in the series to come.Bravern himself has a fair few enemies of the Deathdrives, the one closest would have to be Superbia, the Super Robot who has been dealt by his hands and wants a re-match against him to prove supremacy. I did mention earlier that in every beating heart of the Brave, there is an entity who bears that will, and in Superbia\'s case, comes across a mysterious alien girl who only knows the words ""Ga-ga-pi!"" whom Lewis had the rather unfortunate way of getting to know her. With the help of Isami and the military\'s help, the young girl is deduced for not just her constant child-like annoyance, but her real intentions as Lulu, for which every Super Robot as a ""Lulu"" to pilot them. That alone, makes the Brave connection between mecha and pilot even more of an importance when it comes to the overarching unpredictable plot, which will keep you pumped from start to finish. Also, like every other old-school mecha series, you\'d be unwise to NOT pair attacks while calling out your name, each and EVERY time, and Bravern does this to great effect.When it comes to the production, you know that when Cygames are given free rein to do whatever they want to do, they REALLY mean every single nitpick of the word, especially when it\'s with someone like Masari Oobari. I have long since awaited their in-house studio CygamesPictures\'s next work with this show, based on the fact that\'s proven with the anime adaptation of one of my favourite mobage games of all time: Princess Connect! Re:Dive. Anyone that has watched the series will know the bombastic, nonsense nature of the show with balls-to-the-wall striking action and beautiful animation to boot, and Brave Bang Bravern! is exactly just that and more, just splendid.Old-school mecha fans, ARISE, for your old-school opening song is dutifully respected, beautifully composed and well-crafted as a love letter to a whole genre. The feeling of anticipation when you hear Bravern\'s VA Kenichi Suzumura, the titular mech just singing his own song out with brilliance and gusto, singing ""Bang Bang, Bang Bang, Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang, BBRRRRAAAAAVVVVEEERRRRNNNNN!!!"", along with the inclusion of the SFX, which IS essential to any old-school mecha show to get its full unadulterated vibes. Bravern\'s OP is a banger of a song that is both the epitome of a sing-along karaoke song, and legitimately one of (if not) the best and memorable OP songs of the season. Think about how Bravern would feel if he found out that you skipped his theme song!?For the ED, it\'s a whole lot of close-up interactions between the VAs of Isami and Lewis, but I heavily implore you that the emotionally musical song is part of the entire story plot in and of itself, with the fact that ""Is it gay to be shirtless in the rain with your homie while you both sing about your intense feelings for each other as you delicately hold hands? YES."" The inherent gay-ness is on full display, but there\'s meaning to it and not done without reason.If you had told me that I was going to get a honest-to-good old school mecha anime in 2024, I would have thought you were INSANE. But this is THE reality, and I have nothing but praises for both Cygames and Masami Oobari in unironically creating one of the best underrated and ignored/underestimated surprise shows of the Winter 2024 season, WITHOUT A DOUBT. Literally NO ONE saw this coming, and for all its worth, I\'m glad that I got to experience a childhood that I never had with the Brave series, now with its spiritual successor, thanks to Masami Oobari. Also, Crunchyroll, you may have goofed up almost missing this show out by a week, but you\'ve redeemed yourself to let everyone watch this magnificent show about gay men expressing their feelings for one another, be it by mecha or just pure human interaction.If you\'re intending to watch the masterpiece that is Yuuki Bakuhatsu Bang Bravern a.k.a Brave Bang Bravern!, it\'s one of those anime that works best if you just jump into it with as little foreknowledge as possible. And if you do, I promise you with my 2 hands that this show will be one hell of an unforgettable ride: a literate Abridged take of the Mecha genre.""Are we ready to rock? Ga-ga-pi!Welcome to the Super Robot franchise, my friends, time to expand your catalogue with Hard Work, the Power of Friendship, and BRAVERY!""Bang Bang, Bang Bang, Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang, BBRRRRAAAAAVVVVEEERRRRNNNNN!!!"" *Explosion SFX* that will have you constantly be duped, bamboozled, bait-and-switched, especially for fans of this VERY specific theme in all of the history of its genre: Yuuki Bakuhatsu Bang Bravern a.k.a Brave Bang Bravern!, in collaboration with Cygames and produced by their in-house studio, and directed by the man, not the myth, but THE legend himself: Masami Oobari. The good ol\' fashioned Super Robot show is NOT dead yet, and it makes a triumphant return into relevancy! Who, if not ANYONE, saw this coming, if any AT ALL!?""When I was a kid, I wanted to be a hero. What I really wanted to be...was a Titanostrider pilot."" This is the life calling of the man who belonged in the US Marine Corps\'s 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force: 2nd Lieutentant Lewis Smith. He is part of a joint AD-RIMPAC military exercise between the Americans and Japanese, of which he meets a close buddy that will fight alongside him for the rest of the series: 2nd Lieutentant Isami Ao of Japan\'s Ground Self-Defense Forces\'s Special Armoured Group. The two brothers who are working together, are met by fate...because out of nowhere, mysterious enemies start invading their military ground in Oahu, Hawaii, and causing everyone to burst into panic mode. You see, the normal Real Robots that both forces have, are the standard Titanostrider a.k.a TS robots, mechs that are only good from invasions to exercises in say, reconnaissance missions and the like. And these mysterious enemies? They\'re Deathdrives, Super Robots who rely on the power of humans to pilot them. And why do they know this? Because there is only one entity that knows this, and it\'s their biggest ally ever *cue Isami\'s ""Where is that music coming from!?"" Pikachu moment*: Bravern, the Superhero Robot who will be their salvation to defeating the Deathdrives.It\'s incredibly creative how this show has managed to hook, line and sinker everyone by being secretive until its eventual reveal. To give some context, the Brave series was a Japanese-only old school mainstream franchise which was once produced by Sunrise, made from the remnants of the failed marketing of Transformers (yes, that Michael Bay movie franchise) in Japan, which didn\'t really resonate all that much with its people. Instead, at the time, the toy company Takara (now Takara Tomy) and Sunrise decided to develop a new franchise, which would spawn new toy lines and a soon-astounding anime series, with the common theme being ""Bravery"", the interaction between the robot ""Brave"", who has a heart and the boy who enters its heart and bears the will of the mecha, the union of the robots, and other unique themes. There is also no direct relationship between each series in terms of world view or time, so therefore, almost all the works are different to each other in terms of themes and motif. Bear in mind that the Brave series would go on to inspire and spawn big-name franchises like Gundam with Sunrise at the helm from the 1980s to today.So then, where does the legendary director Masami Oobari stand in all of this? First of all, he\'s actually more known as the mecha and character designer, who\'s worked on shows like Ashi Production\'s 1983-1984 Special Armored Battalion Dorvack, the Japanese translation of Transformers (outsourced by Toei Animation to them sometimes), and Studio Pierrot\'s 1984-1985 Star Musketeer Bismarck as an animation director, with the big break at the age of 19 when he got his first major break of landing the role of mecha designer on the same studio (Ashi Production)\'s 1985 Dancougar – Super Beast Machine God series. His signature mech designs basically carried his name throughout the mid-1980s and onwards from said Dancougar series to the various Brave series: Sunrise\'s 1991 series The Brave of Sun Fighbird, 1994 series The Brave Police J-Decker, and the most recent up to that point, Gonzo\'s 2002 to 2004 Gravion serie, which he personally created and directed the series alongside renowned mecha designer Kunio Okawara, the FIRST man in the Japanese industry to be credited as one. So, for mecha fans all around the world who are well-acquainted with the Masari Oobari name, it shouldn\'t really come as a surprise...or is it?When you put Masami Oobari and the spiritual Brave successor in the hands of Cygames (the company who brought you Granblue Fantasy and Princess Connect! Re:Dive to name a few), the surprises don\'t stop there. Even the Teaser PV released was as vague as it would get for everyone both suspecting and unsuspecting that we would be getting a new mecha project series, and just about the only clue would be the way that the title is stylized in the old-school Brave series logo of all things. But this original show does one thing and one thing only: be the biggest liar that it has ever been. Cygames has always been the company to do unorthodox things, and when the main PV dropped nearer to the anime\'s release, it was NOTHING of the sort, leaving people to think that it\'s a Real Robot show. The kicker comes when Episode 1 dropped, it BLEW up the entire social internet commentary that the show IS indeed the old-fashioned Super Robot show that Masari Oobari has been known for.At this point, you\'re probably wondering: ""Is this it, is this all it is?"", to which I say from the point of Cygames and Masami Oobari: ""Do you think that our collaboration together on this original show will be as predictable as it is?"" The bait-and-switch will continue, right after this.The two brothers fated for each other, Isami and Lewis Smith, parallel as they may be, they both have different ambitions as fellow military mech pilots, trying to name a name for themselves. But all of this changes when Bravern comes out of nowhere to defend the humans from the Deathdrives, and for every attack he does, he has to shout his name in the most jovial manner. The kicker is that after he saves the humans, he only acknowledges Isami and warrants him to become his pilot. Suddenly, you\'re being bamboozled again: this is NOT just a Super Robot, but a Super REAL Robot! The thing is, Isami is a rather reserved man who wants to deal as much damage as possible, at the cusp of as less casualties as possible, and even the most minute of the Death Stranding vibes will force him into turmoil. On the other hand, Lewis Smith embodies the fight of any typical loyal American citizen, and wants to offer himself in exchange for Isami to pilot Bravern, which he gets rejected, saying that the fusion between human and robot will be unstable...NOT knowing that his nightmares with Bravern will become a pivotal point in the series to come.Bravern himself has a fair few enemies of the Deathdrives, the one closest would have to be Superbia, the Super Robot who has been dealt by his hands and wants a re-match against him to prove supremacy. I did mention earlier that in every beating heart of the Brave, there is an entity who bears that will, and in Superbia\'s case, comes across a mysterious alien girl who only knows the words ""Ga-ga-pi!"" whom Lewis had the rather unfortunate way of getting to know her. With the help of Isami and the military\'s help, the young girl is deduced for not just her constant child-like annoyance, but her real intentions as Lulu, for which every Super Robot as a ""Lulu"" to pilot them. That alone, makes the Brave connection between mecha and pilot even more of an importance when it comes to the overarching unpredictable plot, which will keep you pumped from start to finish. Also, like every other old-school mecha series, you\'d be unwise to NOT pair attacks while calling out your name, each and EVERY time, and Bravern does this to great effect.When it comes to the production, you know that when Cygames are given free rein to do whatever they want to do, they REALLY mean every single nitpick of the word, especially when it\'s with someone like Masari Oobari. I have long since awaited their in-house studio CygamesPictures\'s next work with this show, based on the fact that\'s proven with the anime adaptation of one of my favourite mobage games of all time: Princess Connect! Re:Dive. Anyone that has watched the series will know the bombastic, nonsense nature of the show with balls-to-the-wall striking action and beautiful animation to boot, and Brave Bang Bravern! is exactly just that and more, just splendid.Old-school mecha fans, ARISE, for your old-school opening song is dutifully respected, beautifully composed and well-crafted as a love letter to a whole genre. The feeling of anticipation when you hear Bravern\'s VA Kenichi Suzumura, the titular mech just singing his own song out with brilliance and gusto, singing ""Bang Bang, Bang Bang, Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang, BBRRRRAAAAAVVVVEEERRRRNNNNN!!!"", along with the inclusion of the SFX, which IS essential to any old-school mecha show to get its full unadulterated vibes. Bravern\'s OP is a banger of a song that is both the epitome of a sing-along karaoke song, and legitimately one of (if not) the best and memorable OP songs of the season. Think about how Bravern would feel if he found out that you skipped his theme song!?For the ED, it\'s a whole lot of close-up interactions between the VAs of Isami and Lewis, but I heavily implore you that the emotionally musical song is part of the entire story plot in and of itself, with the fact that ""Is it gay to be shirtless in the rain with your homie while you both sing about your intense feelings for each other as you delicately hold hands? YES."" The inherent gay-ness is on full display, but there\'s meaning to it and not done without reason.If you had told me that I was going to get a honest-to-good old school mecha anime in 2024, I would have thought you were INSANE.

I found myself loving this one for a variety of reasons, but first, I’ve got to talk about that premise:Top Gun with aliens invading a la Independence Day but giant robot Kamina from Gurren Lagann comes to save the day.That sounds like a mess, and while it kind of is, this is a show that revels in the mess. It leans in hard as the robot Bravern diagetically blasts his theme music from its cockpit (projecting his opening animation background behind him like a boss), proclaims that his pilot Isami is its soul mate,...and proceeds to devastate Death Drive alien robots (all of whom have personalities that are some variation of absurd in the best way) with abandon. It helps that Isami and many of the characters in this series are very unlike those in Gurren Lagann – they have no idea what the fuck is going on and they (aside from Lewis Smith) are not anime protagonists by nature. A small touch I love: they don’t wait for an opponent to monologue or have a problem using their full power from the get-go. The series does not let you get fully comfortable with its premise, either, as Bravern and gang face down an array of increasingly ridiculous robot foes. The number of ways this series goes sideways consistently surprises and delights.And oh man, is this show homoerotic as all hell. Those Top Gun feels come through in spades in the early parts of this series, but when that ED kicks on (easily one of the best EDs of the season), it rocks the house with two shirtless bros singing their feelings. There are so many moments where Isami and Lewis or Isami and Bravern are just having the best bro moments or, in some cases, going quite a bit further. These are some of my favorite relationships of the season, whether they’re just being bros or something more.As for the narrative, it does have direction and momentum to it, though it’s probably the most basic aspect of the series… if you can call it that. The crazy anime nonsense is on full display in some of these episodes, some of which feels over the top even for the more bombastic series. And yes, it gets dour in places, though the series never stays in the doldrums too long. Hell, even when things seem at their darkest, the only solution is to fire on all cylinders and become the impossible source of light in the darkness.Yes, this series was absolutely fine being as absurd as it could be as it kept going, and that’s as it should be. We needed some Spirit Bomb/color change/power-of-friendship/multi-fusion nonsense, and anyone who says differently just doesn't appreciate good fun. Like with similar series, it would have been pretty easy from the start to guess how this one would end, but I'd be shocked if anyone could guess what kind of wild ride it would take to get there.

Impeccable action with intense thrill and emotional desperation, Rated R extremely, EXTREMELY hilarious comedy, and... steamy romance? Such chaotic energy, but with wonderful delivery- one of the best 3 first episodes among all genre of anime that I've ever watched for sure! 10/10]Bang Brave Bang Bravern is looking up to be one of the most iconic anime of all time, for sure. From every aspect possible, it is so well-made, despite having so much potential still.Among all of its qualities, what stands out to me the most is the drawing, for sure! The expressions, the shading, everything sets up the mood...for each scenes SO well that viewers can't help but get invested in the story and in everything that's going on. It's the base of the intense emotions that I felt while watching these first episodes. Ambition, sadness, desperation, confusion, shock, trauma, relaxedness, ease, even just smug- they're only among the emotions that are conveyed SO well making viewers truly fall deep down into its world and its story! Oh, and the characters are sexily well-drawn, if that's what you're into...Built upon said fantastic foundation is of course the storyline with just the perfect amount of dynamics and jumps between different moods (and genre even, I'd say) cultivating such wonderful balance that persists throughout the episodes. The worldbuilding seems awesome, but since it's still only the first 3 episodes, not much is elaborated or explained, only enough for a human to take in as they are.. attacked, as the synopsis says, and it is definitely adequate. Relating to that, the flow of the story truly makes a lot of sense realistically (in the standard of fictional anime, of course) and it just describes how on fire the writing is so far.The characters also *seem* like they all have unique personalities and backgrounds but this aspect is what I'd consider the biggest 'potential' that this anime has yet to fulfill. They aren't delved deep enough yet, but we'll see how they're done in future episodes, and according to that, it could be the anime's biggest weakness or it can ascend the quality further.More about the visual and the graphics, it's top notch, honestly, with beautiful non-action scenes and VERY dynamic action scenes. The detail is no joke, and I assure you there is no scene that gets let down so far. The background, the people, the robots, the weapons, the attacks, and, I have said this in previous paragraphs, the facial expressions, the body language- everything's SO well drawn.In conclusion, there is no reason to not give this show a chance and to not invest your whole being into the story because it does not disappoint (so far).

I do wish they still do originals like they used to where two cours gives the show enough room to breath and expand on the world, the characters, and so much more. The final episode of Bravern felt like watching 5 episodes straight in a row, despite the pacing of prior episodes being paced normally to the point you\'d expect a surprise second cour announcement (there wasn\'t).As a consequence of this I do feel a lot of the character development is rushed. I love Smith, Bravern, and Lulu, but I\'ve never really warmed up to Isami. Again, I feel like having more episodes to flesh him out would have been better, since all you get in the show is him being stuck in a rut for the majority of it only to go through a whole season\'s worth of character development right at the very end. The side characters were cute (including the most ""Literally Me"" self insert I have ever seen in a show in the form of Miyu), but they do not amount to much apart from contributing to the comedic scenes in this.That\'s one major strength of the show (and other Cygames Originals). The comedy is superb in this, from the timing, to the execution of the lines, to the direction, just everything is done as well as it can get. Even The Marginal Service, for how mediocre it was, had some stellar moments to it at times. However, this comes at a cost of having a paper thin plot to work around with. What starts out as a ""Save The World"" type deal just turns into some time travel plot with no warning, and the whole ""Save the World"" aspect is just dumped when you realize most of the show just takes place in Hawaii to begin with. That\'s not counting the final asspull of a finale.I may sound a little harsh in this, but believe me when I say it is the most enjoyable show this season by a decent margin. Every episode just seems to one up each other and the twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat. I\'m not a fujo but the fujo-pandering is really good up until the very end. Honestly, what is it with shows like these having so much homoerotic undertones (in not only the show itself, but also the merch) only to not commit at the very end. I just personally hate stuff like that (*cough*Nanoha*cough*WfM*Alice Gear Aegis*), and so that\'s one point docked from my score.But if you\'re looking for a good time, and want to relieve what it means to hold bravery in your own heart, and you\'ve already rewatched TTGL for the 15th time, you can\'t go wrong with Bravern.8/10 a rushed ending.

I passed on this show multiple times before I saw someone review it on youtube - and barely a minute into that review I knew I had to watch it.This is a mecha anime that isn't actually about mecha.  Yes, one of the main characters is a giant robot, and there is plenty of robot on robot combat in every episode, but that isn't what this show is actually about.  It's hard to describe what the story actually is about without spoiling anything or being somewhat misleading.  Just know that...it tries damn hard at being both serious and completely nuts at the same time.  A few tweaks to the script could change the tone drastically in either direction.Bravern is definitely in my top 5 for the year so far.  This is a unique story that is told completely in its 12 episodes, with an ending that is completely over the top, but somehow perfectly fitting given everything else that happens prior to it and actually satisfying.  I highly recommend going in blind - do not look up ANYTHING about the story and enjoy the ride. it tries damn hard at being both serious and completely nuts at the same time.

If you can\'t take the cheesyness then you will probably dislike it, if you don\'t want self-aware comedy in your mecha anime then you will probably dislike it and if the ""bromance"" is too much for you to handle then you might also...

Perfect use of mecha tropes in a totally different way and expanding the genre.[7] Lulu is cute but weird. Good to have a plot to follow now, but it could get bizarre w...the nationalism. The characters are super interesting tho, nothing shakes that yet.[7] It's just too fun. I worry for Lulu's VA's voice tho, screaming like that.[7] They manage to build and destroy tension super easy, making both the military and comedy parts be awesome w great characters to boot. The many distinctly colored and designed human mechas are weird tho.[8] Robot waterboarding, new mechas, a further solidifying of the goals and new allies. Pure anime greatness.[8] Truly surprising, i didn't see this coming at all. Manages to start of funny, be super threatening and end tragic meanwhile setting some stuff for the next missions and the operation of the robots. The idea of them doing everything in search of a glorious death is fascinating for villains.[9] Mecha anime can be so corny, but if you allow it into your heart the emotions you feel will be unparalleled. ABSOLUTE CINEMA![8] Awesome emotional resolution for Smith's death & Superbia's conflict, also great to have Lulu taking agency & becoming  real character. The sequence w Lulu & Superbia bonding was a lot of fun, but a lil weird considering the circumstances.[8] We truly are in meta modern times, the way they can play w our emotions flipping between doing things ironically and unironically but still reaching pretty close to the peaks of both poles. The gag villain had a great design & a funny gimmick, the fight was cool and funny & the end hit, again.[9] The thing i watch anime for. Not afraid to be weird, it embraces the true emotions and gives us something to laugh at and root for simultaneously, hitting just the right spots.Aggregate Score: 7.84The OP and ED are phenomenal, the way they play with your expectations are amazing and all the references (of which i could only get a very limited number of myself, have to get a more extensive mecha scholarship) always made me smile and like it even more, to the point that i believe it would be a disservice to the show and staff tho make anything lower than a 7/10 the nationalism.

Go watch it now.Like a hot piece of meat off the grill, the more you stare at it before digging in the worse it gets. Do yourself a favor, watch an episode or two and then come back if you still want to see others\' opinions.Trust me, you\'ll thank me later.Or you\'ll need bleach for your eyes. Same difference but clearly this show wasn\'t your cup of tea if you couldn\'t handle what is essentially pure MANLINESS distilled into anime form.Only weak men, and women, can\'t handle the pure unadulterated love and passion shared by two men and a robot....So if you are weak, you should probably not watch this show and instead go watch some isekai harem fantasy show to fill your scrawny-armed needs.From this point onward, only those who also believe anime needs to start having nipples drawn on men being a common practice are allowed to continue reading my (rant) review.No exceptions.Now why is Bravern a good show? Everything, literally everything. If you grew up watching shows and anime from the 90s and early 2000s, this show feels like a throwback to those days. But now with homoeroticism and Zoomer-Humor. Main characters shout special attack names, friendship and love solves all problems, and the opening has sound effects twice as loud as the song playing underneath. Every aspect of the show shouts ""We love anime and giant robots"" and I cannot properly put into words how awesome the show feels because of it. The whole staff knew exactly the kind of show they wanted to make and what fans of anime and 90s weeb culture as a whole loved and pander to your every expectation.Even the attention to detail is there. For example, the show starts in Hawaii, and when the characters are ordering a beer, they actually order an honest to god real-life Hawaiian Beer with the logo ambiguosly slapped on. That scene encompasses the entire vibe of the show, which is it\'s made for adults, and the more you know and pay attention the more you\'ll enjoy it.Characters and interactions can be a bit one note and simple, and side characters are side characters. But let\'s be honest the show is called Bang Bravern Bang, you aren\'t watching to see what happens to miss Air Controller in an AWACS with 2min of total screen time. You\'re watching for the big explosions, giant robots, and big explosions. And that is all you really need to care about from this show. Though you can tell there is nuance to the world and side characters that isn\'t being fleshed out as big homo robot with his own theme song is more entertaining. Personally I think this is a fine choice since the show keeps it simple and refines that simplicity to a high quality.For recommending this one, absolutely--- if you don\'t mind having people question what the hell you are watching. This is such an underrated gemstone of a show that I almost hope it remains small and niche to preserve the fanbase. But recommend it to your friends since this is such a fun show to watch with your friends.8 out of 10 with a B for Bravern.TL;DR - Watch an episode first, then read reviews.

It initially presents as though it\'s going to have real-robot tone, but then swerves hard into classic Super Robot territory and makes it gay, and that\'s an A+ in my book. The humor, while a little crude, is hilarious. The drama had me tearing up at a couple points. If you\'re already a fan of mecha, and aren\'t afraid of a good, humorous time, you will love this show.Frankly the show defies description. It plays a lot of the usual ""super robot"" tropes pretty straight a lot of the time, what with evil aliens,...combining the hearts of sentient robot and pilot (except this time with a lot of innuendo), etc. What it does with those tropes is give us a show that is filled to the brim (eheh) with raw (heh) emotion. Not once does the show act self-aware of how bizarre it gets, or bashes itself over the situations that occur. It\'s a show with a robot who is gay for the pilot, and it knows that, and embraces it fully. The plot is tightly woven, and the show manages to do a lot in its 12 episodes. I will be awaiting the Bandai Bravern Model kit. combining the hearts of sentient robot and pilot (except this time with a lot of innuendo), etc. What it does with those tropes is give us a show that is filled to the brim (eheh) with raw (heh) emotion.

The humor, by the way, relies mostly on homoerotic jokes, so if you don\'t think gay men = funny,...there might not be much in there for you. Personally, I did laugh at some of the double entendres (lots of uses of the word ""ride""), although, now that the shows is over, I feel mostly foolish and disappointed in what amounts to lots of queerbaiting.In terms of story and characters, there\'s some good to be found in the relationships of the main trio (no one else matters at all, if we\'re being honest) and how they interact and care for each other. Other than that, the narrative is pretty bare bones.As for the animation, it\'s slick and pleasing to the eye. The fights are colorful, which gives you some level of distraction from the fact that you don\'t really care about what happens to the people in it. The character design feels fresh and modern, but with a retro, late 90s/early 00s, vibe.All in all, I do not recommend you watch Yuuki Bakuhatsu Bang Bravern.

The story is about a Japanese Elite Special Forces guy name Isami Ao who while in Hawaii during joint American-Japanese military exercises suddenly Alien looking beings attack the base his squad almost destroyed all hope seems lost, and a mysterious talking robot appear out of nowhere named Bravern asks Isami to get inside his cockpit to pilot him into battle (hidden gay joke) using the power of manly energy from Isami Ao he defeated these Alien beings. Later on the next episode Bravern tells the joint military leaders about the threat of the ""Deathdrives""....While Isami is being interrogated and tortured which made no sense the Military decided to use Bravern in their Military operations to Japan.

The animation was a bit slow on some parts others were fast considering they were using 3D cel shading animation for the Mecha fights more like you watching Transformers Energon from 2004 which reminds me of that style of animation. The Mecha Designs by MORUGA and Mizuki Sakura doing a bit more research found out Misuki Sakura known to do mostly Gundam side story manga this is the first attempt from a person doing a anime such as this I got to say some of the designs were not bad.MusicI got to say Kenichi Suzumura opening theme Babang to Suisan!

As for the Ending song  by Ryōta Suzuki and Yōhei Azakami the song Sōen no Shōzō was cheese on top of the cake funny.OverallI really don\'t hate the Super Gay Giant Robot Bravern its a interesting character had some great moments in the Anime. The problem is LGBTQ2+ won\'t accept this as representation and pretend it doesn\'t exist. It\'s not a perfect anime with a perfect story. I can\'t help but laugh at this anime for its funny moments.

Now imagine that, in addition to the usual Bay staples (explosions, lots of military vehicles, Christian references, oversexualization of female characters), this movie is light-hearted, self-referential, and intensely homoerotic. Such is Bang Bravern, the first TV anime directed by legendary animator Masami Obari in over a decade.Without a doubt, Bravern is one of the better seasonal anime in recent memory -- probably the best one since Reconguista in G from a decade ago. However, like a lot of the better seasonal anime, Bravern\'s story is more suited to a...1-2 hour OVA, which is evident in the sheer amount of filler in the anime. There are episodes where slideshow animation abounds and a lot of meaningless conversation is had. Filler character interactions don\'t have to be a bad thing, but in Bravern, they are, and that\'s because the characters are neither pleasant nor complex. An attempt was clearly made to make the characters seem complex to engage more ""mature"" audiences, which means that the characters all fall into basic anime tropes -- Smith is a Gary Stu, Isami is a self-insert, all the female characters are moe, and the Deathdrives\' personalities are over-the-top and centred around one trait. The most fleshed-out, likeable characters are Bravern and Superbia, but their interactions are too few to support the show.The story of Bravern is very silly -- Earth is being invaded by alien robots who love death, and the last hope of humanity is another alien robot who loves being a hero. It\'s the type of pulpy silly that could have worked in a 90s OVA, and it still works here. However, the story is certainly not remarkable enough to justify sitting through all the filler and otherwise grating moments in this anime. The anime is not even nice to look at. The 2D animation is eye-burning and feels like cheap plastic. In addition, all the mecha animation is done in CG, which is especially egregious since Masami Obari is one of the few animators able to direct hand-drawn mecha animation in the current anime industry. The mecha designs, save for Bravern, Superbia, Cupiridas, and a few of the military mecha, tend to feel overdesigned, uninspired, and thrown-together, as if they were designed by an AI. The only thing that makes this anime stand out are its explicitly male homoerotic moments, which are notable for being in a mainstream sci-fi/mecha anime and for involving masculine, muscular men rather than the typical yaoi soft bois who look no different from actual women.Overall, Bravern is a typical disposable seasonal anime, with nothing to make it particularly notable except its particular brand of homoeroticism. One would be better served watching an actual Yuusha series since they have everything Bravern lacks -- good animation, engrossing stories, and likeable characters/character interactions. However, if you want to watch a gay sci-fi anime that\'s non-pornographic, Bravern will serve you well. 1-2 hour OVA, which is evident in the sheer amount of filler in the anime.

In addition, all the mecha animation is done in CG, which is especially egregious since Masami Obari is one of the few animators able to direct hand-drawn mecha animation in the current anime industry. The mecha designs, save for Bravern, Superbia, Cupiridas, and a few of the military mecha, tend to feel overdesigned, uninspired, and thrown-together, as if they were designed by an AI. The only thing that makes this anime stand out are its explicitly male homoerotic moments, which are notable for being in a mainstream sci-fi/mecha anime and for involving masculine, muscular men rather than the typical yaoi soft bois who look no different from actual women.Overall, Bravern is a typical disposable seasonal anime, with nothing to make it particularly notable except its particular brand of homoeroticism. One would be better served watching an actual Yuusha series since they have everything Bravern lacks -- good animation, engrossing stories, and likeable characters/character interactions. However, if you want to watch a gay sci-fi anime that\'s non-pornographic, Bravern will serve you well.']"

Digimon Adventure tri. 3: Kokuhaku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32551/Digimon_Adventure_tri_3__Kokuhaku,"['When producing continuations of popular anime, the creators are often accused of milking the franchise. While this might be true in some cases, there is a large number of counter-examples. One of them is the sequel to the Digimon Adventure franchise, Digimon Adventure tri. The first two films have already been no disappointment and the third one, Kokuhaku, is another case of a successful sequel.Kokuhaku’s atmosphere is much darker than that of tri’s previous instalments and it manages to convey a dull, melancholic feeling from the very beginning. This is supported by the absence of an opening in the first part of the film whose...presence would have cheered the viewer up. Of course, this film is not entirely dark as there is a good amount of comic relief to see. However, one cannot deny that the events of the previous films have affected the cast’s – and, therefore, the film’s – mood immensely. Nevertheless, Kokuhaku feels natural as the tone shift is not unexpected, even though the story could also have progressed in a different direction which, thankfully, it did not.Another difference from Saikai and Ketsui, the films which preceded this one, is the length: Kokuhaku is approximately 20 minutes longer. While one could be thankful for this, it also comes with a number of problems since, for example, the film’s pacing suffers greatly from this. Toei Animation could have compressed the story into a shorter film and not much would have been lost. The way it is now, some scenes feel a bit too long, even though they are important. Additionally, the animation quality and the consistency of the character designs have decreased in quality, albeit not having been extraordinarily great in the other two films either. Had the film been shorter, aforementioned aspects would probably not have suffered as much as they have now.That being said, this film is in no way boring. The viewer experiences amazing and surprisingly complex world building which does not contradict anything that has already been established. One might argue that it is a bit too complex for its own good but even then, it does not disrupt the film’s flow.As different as Kokuhaku might be, it still stays true to the franchise to which it belongs. It communicates important themes such as departure or loss in true Digimon fashion and does not disappoint when it comes to nostalgic moments either. It shows how a story can continue without conveying a feeling of a franchise being milked.Other than the other two films, Kokuhaku does not focus on two characters. While Koushirou and Takeru are a bit more important than the rest of the cast, the plot does not revolve around them as it did with Mimi and Jou in Ketsui. Thanks to this, one is able to see how the events in the previous films helped developing the personality of certain characters, especially Jou. Moreover, this film revolves more around the Digimon than the other two did. While before, they were shown side-to-side with their partners, this time we can see them interact with one another without the children being nearby. These scenes show how much personality the Digimon have, which is a fact that is often forgotten.Action scenes are, on the one hand, handled rather well. The battles’ choreographies are more complex than in the TV series, where fights usually ended with Digimon using their respective special move. Here, much more thought has been put into the action and the result is undeniably satisfactory. On the other hand, aforementioned animation issues dull the experience a bit and, moreover, it feels as though the camera is zoomed in during important clashes, making it hard to find out what exactly happens on screen.Kokuhaku is unexpectedly emotional. Digimon has always been a bit cheesy and this film is no exception. However, the execution is on point and underlined by a beautiful soundtrack. Moreover, due to the aforementioned atmosphere, emotional scenes are much more believable and relatable. In this aspect, Kokuhaku surpasses the two other films and to a certain extent also the TV series.In my opinion, this film is the best tri-film so far. It has less weaknesses than the other two and manages to surprise its audience with compelling twists, even though it is basically targeted at children. It might not be entirely perfect and the usual production quality of Toei Animation is not its only fault. However, Kokuhaku is a must-watch for Digimon fans and I personally cannot wait for the next film to air. presence would have cheered the viewer up.

The only reason I keep watching this is because I wanna know what the hell is the plot, because it has been 3 movies already an I still don't know whats going on.Literally 3 movies to show that Ken is up to no good and that digimon are infected, that is literally what happened so far, no more no less, plot-wise.They focus too much on normal day to day scenes like going for baths or school festivals, which would be fine if they had decent character development going...on, which for the most part they didn't, just trivial quarrels and whatnot, some seemed to come out of the blue with no apparent reason.The only good thing I have to say about this one is that it was pretty emotional, and on that I do agree they did a good job, brought me some tears to my eyes.But the rest? Especially the plot, they advanced next to nothing, so there's really not much to spoil even if I wanted to do so, the show is just moving that slow, if their pacing is terrible or if they're just bad at story telling.. well I really dont know, but so far this has been quite mediocre at best. on, which for the most part they didn't, just trivial quarrels and whatnot, some seemed to come out of the blue with no apparent reason.The only good thing I have to say about this one is that it was pretty emotional, and on that I do agree they did a good job, brought me some tears to my eyes.But the rest?

Saikai was pure fanservice (characters, all the fucking evolutions...), dissapointing and rushed. Ketsui was better but it lost so many time in high school things so typical and cliche in anime nowadays. I was afraid for this anime taking that way. Thank god it finally didn't.Kokuhaku takes a big step up in the rather neglected plot in the first two parts. The character development is still present but in a more subversive way. The pacing is nice and the climax is very emotional, been a...while since i didn't feel like that with Digimon.However, i have a big problem and question with kokuhaku: why they can't digivolve to a better level freely? it has no sense facing Meicoomon in champion level. I guess they can't control it anymore like 02, but with a couple of digivolutions more, all that happens next could be avoided perfectly, feeling like some kind of plot device. Anyways, although the situation was somewhat confusing, Tentomon manages to hit me right in the feels. God, that episode.I can notice some greek tragedy influence in Kokuhaku, specially the oracle's prediction (Hikari's Homeostasis) and the dramatic irony. For those who don't know about dramatic irony, it's a literary device by which the audience's understanding of events or individuals in a work surpasses that of its characters. In Kokuhaku, we know what is happening but not the kids, so this way we know they're gonna suffer so bad at some point, which increases the impact of the climax.Nothing to say about art and animation, It's a good work by Toei, but it's still Toei. And Toei is shit, so tha animation while decent it has some flaws. Soundtrack as epic as ever, well choiced and put.Overall, Kokuhaku is starting to carry Adventure Tri. to  an enjoyable point. Still has flaws, but the setting andits identity have improved a lot in this one. Digimon is not an action kid show anymore. Now it's a mature show that explores the characters that grew with us. It's a product made for us and not for the new generation, lacking action to work on the characters we knew as children, and taking the plot to a different level.I hope the next parts keep and improve the level.

I don\'t think there has been anything as sad or heartbreaking in digimon history. This really gave me the impression that Digimon Adventure tri was heading towards a mature path, compared to their childish origins in season 1.That said, I think the movie suffered from its horrible pacing. I felt that the film wasn\'t really moving until after two thirds of the movie. That said, I do appreciate how they try to build the sad an desperate atmosphere with the scenes with the digidestines and their digimon. But because the movie spent...so much time on dialouge and day to day events, I felt that the action was robbed. All the action in the movie is condensed to 20 minutes, and the whole movie is 100 minutes. I wish I was exaggerating, but that\'s the truth. Especially tentomon.Tentomon should\'ve have been the main focus of the movie considering that he was on the movie poster, yet he didn\'t appear all that much. During the main battle, I was annoyed at the way they rushed the fight. We only got to see Kabuterimon for a few seconds. I really wanted the directors to spend a little more time on the action, maybe have tentomon struggle in each evolution before resorting to Herculeskabuterimon. Because of the rushed battle, I just couldn\'t enjoy the ""should have been"" epic moment of the appearance of herculeskabuterimon because he just digivolved without much fighting in between.There is nothing to write home about the art. I find the art for the humans to be adequate. However, I felt that they did a sloppier job on the digimon during the action scenes. Some of the scenes just looked lazy and lacked a lot of detail. The sound was on par. I don\'t really have any other comments. it was just clear and concise and got the point across.I am a major digimon fan. I watched all the seasons and I still am very hyped for tri. I certainly liked this movie better than the second one, as the second movie only had like ten minutes of fighting. Even though it sounds like I should have gave a lower score for this movie, I actually did somewhat appreciate the movie. I looked the new take and the ending really surprised me. They finally went back to the digital world. I am so hyped for the next movie because I\'m sure there would be more action. I mean, for crying out loud, they are in the digital world where!

The first movie was okay the second not so well and this... this movie disappointed me so much, I can\'t describe my anger.First, the stupid animation I can\'t stand. It is like every other ""kawaii"" anime (eg Kyoto animation animes), it losts his charmness.When I think back to the old season, the adults looked like adults and not like kids. You can see, that they are low...in budget and this is fine, but an anime lost his seriousness, when adults looking like childrens.Second, the new character doesn\'t make me angry, but the fact that she has the same name as her digimon, makes me cringe. Evertime Mimi calls her makes me cringe.Third, Mimi isn\'t the same anymore. She was charming and friendly, but in this movie Mimi just want to pick up a fight with Izzy for no reason. I know that the author wants Love drama, but you can\'t just put drama in a scene where it doesn\'t belong.Fourth, there isn\'t a real plot now. It takes to long. This and the last movie dropped the niveau of Digimon completly.Fifth, whats up with Sora and Yamato? In the last Digimon Adventure episodes Sora told Yamato that she loves her, and when the Digimon attacked the human world, you can see, how Yamato protects Sora. In the movie you can not tell if they are a pair, or if Sora has feelings for Tai.The only thing I enjoyed is, that they keep their old soundtracks and opening theme.All in all the characters aren\'t as charming as they where in the first movie and in the old seasons, but I am looking forward and I hope that it will be better.Story: 5Art: 3Sound: 5Character: 4Enjoyment: 5Overall: 5*excuse my mistakes, I am from germany. in budget and this is fine, but an anime lost his seriousness, when adults looking like childrens.Second, the new character doesn\'t make me angry, but the fact that she has the same name as her digimon, makes me cringe.

Getting the bad stuff out of the way first, I was not a fan of the english voice acting. I hadn't watched Digimon since I was a kid, so the 4-Kids level of quality hit me like a truck. That's not to say that every voice was awful. Yamato and T.K. sounded pretty good. But most of the cast, especially the digimon, had pretty distracting voices that took you out of the experience. Most of the animation was fine, but whenever the...characters were falling, it was obvious that the animator had just drawn one frame and was shaking it back and forth. On a character level, I found Mimi very annoying, making the same self-pitying speech over and over again. Ty telling her to shut up was probably the most satisfying scene in this whole movie. I was surprised to find myself laughing multiple times during this movie. Each character's personality was distinct and enjoyable. Most jokes hit the exact right points and kept me engaged. Similarly, this movie is also very good at making dramatic scenes engaging through the character's emotional dialogue and animation. The message this movie has about the concept of growing up and a person changing over time was really well thought out. The movie is aware of their target audience; the now young adults who experienced the Digimon franchise as children, and really speaks to them with this general theme.

The story works the drama between the characters, but not all the characters have managed to have enough screen time for a well-developed (or exciting) drama.

Doupo Cangqiong: Yuanqi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/51038/Doupo_Cangqiong__Yuanqi,"[""This will be a 3-part review: I will review this as a stand-alone work, as a replacement for Season 1, and as an adaptation of the original material.The main purpose of this piece is to introduce the main antagonist of BTTH Season 5. The opening features the teacher and the conflict that led him to become a soul. Therefore, this special is meant to introduce a bit of the teacher's past and recap the most important parts of season 1 (and unify the character designs). For this purpose, it is very well done, and deserves a score of 8. The character designs are the same...as seen previously, it recaps all the main points (with some plot changes to cram it into 3 episodes) and there aren't really any major plot holes allowing for a quick recap/remake of season 1 and allowing a smooth transition into season 5.Which brings me to the next part of the review: the score for it being a replacement.As a replacement for Season 1, I would give this a score of 6/10. They simply cut too much out for it to completely replace the original. There are 3 major things that were cut that I think were important to have: Ya Fei and the alchemy (though the extensively showed that in Season 4), the entrance exam for the academy (and it's fight which I would have liked to see), and parts leading to Xiao Yi Xian and the conflict it sparked (like getting the wings). If it was given another 3 appropriate length episodes, I think the original season 1 could have been completely replaced. Unfortunately, it was a bit too short and this felt a bit too incomplete to be a complete remake. I know that the ending song/credits showed a variety of stills that covered the meeting with Xiao Yi Xian, but if you don't know what happened, they are meaningless.Season 1 replacement score: 6/10Now finally, as an adaptation, it was faithful enough to the original text for it's length. Much of the fluff and needless drama was cut to reduce the runtime, but all the important core plot points were there. While I personally would have preferred it to be longer and cover things more thoroughly, as an adaptation of another work, it does a good enough job.Adaptation score (how faithful to source): 7/10 as seen previously, it recaps all the main points (with some plot changes to cram it into 3 episodes) and there aren't really any major plot holes allowing for a quick recap/remake of season 1 and allowing a smooth transition into season 5.Which brings me to the next part of the review: the score for it being a replacement.As a replacement for Season 1, I would give this a score of 6/10.

But I assure you, this wasn\'t a complete waste of time because this remake does reveal a bit of Yao Chen that didn\'t get revealed in the original season one.This remake also probably served to remind us Xun\'er exists in this harem and her terrifying power (Can you imagine if Xun\'er meets Yun Yun? Someone get me out of that room). Other than that, it is a very concise summary of Season one. Do note that this by itself won\'t serve a full...introduction to the series, so you probably will have to endure the original season one regardless or look up a few facts if you get confused in future season.There is an ending sequence in the last episode that you probably shouldn\'t skip if you are one of those people who likes to skip all OP/ED. I usually skip every one of these OP/ED, but the ED of episode 3 is somewhat important if you are transitioning straight into season 2.Overall, very enjoyable.PS: I am upset that my 雅妃姐姐 didn\'t get an introduction like she did in the original.

Chrno Crusade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/60/Chrno_Crusade,"['Reviewer&rsquo;s Brief Notables:  I know that most people often don&rsquo;t trust or are a little skeptical about a Perfect 10 review, but that is, without any exaggeration, how I feel about Chrno Crusade.______________________________________________________________Story:I first watched Chrno Crusade without any expectations for it whatsoever. After completing the first episode (weeks before I completed the series), I wasn&rsquo;t really fascinated with it at all. For the time, I just thought this anime was pretty generic and somewhat dull.I was wrong.After a few weeks, I was led to completing the series. To make the most general and the most appropriate statement: It was captivating! The story behind...Chrno Crusade is very intricate with numerous characters, subplots and details.  The story is brilliantly put together with no holes in the story and also a very complete ending (sniffles). Chrno Crusade is full of action, comedy and romance; the key ingredients of a great production. The general plot is nothing unordinary and is usually played out as other anime have, but there is just something about this anime that I thought really set this one apart from the others. Unfortunately, I am unsure of the reason myself; or am not able to explain it in words. As you watch Chrno Crusade, I am sure you will understand what I mean.  &ndash;and I apologize for the slightly unclear story briefing.______________________________________________________________Art:As for the art in Chrno Crusade, it would have to say that it is brilliant! The art gave me a very strong sense of familiarity. The animation is very similar to many series&rsquo; such as Full Metal Panic and Kaze no Stigma because they&rsquo;re from the same animators. The kind of animation that Gonzo offers is my all time favorite. Everything is greatly detailed accurate lighting and shading. Skin tones look very natural and give the characters physical depth (they don&rsquo;t look so 2-demensional), and best of all, the character&rsquo;s eyes aren&rsquo;t the size of my monitor. In the series, there are barely any CG and most of the time, it&rsquo;s very unnoticeable.______________________________________________________________Sound:Most of the time, I prefer subtitles over dubbing because usually the English voice actors talk like they&rsquo;ve been deprived from their souls; emotionless and doubtable. In the case of Chrno Crusade, I very much enjoyed the English dubbing. One, because the voice actor for Rosette talked very fast and her pitch was very high (much like Excel from Excel Saga). Second, because my favorite English seiyuu, Hilary Haag (Teletha &ldquo;Tessa&rdquo; Testarossa from Full Metal Panic) was acting for Rosette. And lastly, because the series is set in America it would make more sense for it to be in English. The dubbing included uses of slang back in the late 1920&rsquo;s which was when the series takes place. As for the opening song, it was very enjoyable and blended well with the opening animation that also suited the anime flawlessly. And the ending song&hellip;well, quickly became one of my favorites (it is actually playing on repeat as I write this review). Entitled &ldquo;Sayonara Solitaire&rdquo;, the song expresses feelings of sadness, loneliness and hope. The animation for the ending was beautiful too. The ambience of the ripples gave an awkward feeling of loneliness and at the end of the credits; the animation showed the watch that Rosette bore as a drop of water ran down from it while the ending song was closing with a small string orchestra. Having thought of that drop was a tear and by the knowledge of what that watch really represented in addition to the sad music made it easy for the viewer to cry. That short section at the end also gave a hint of foreshadowing that was just even sadder to accept. SAD but not depressing; which is all I can say.______________________________________________________________Character:What I thought while watching Chrno Crusade was that the real essence of this series were the characters. Character development is a strongpoint in this anime and the process of it takes on most of the series itself. Each character is unique in their own way; even for the supporting characters. They all have their own personality and individuality. That effort from the producers made a real difference for me. The cast in Chrno Crusade are all affable; even the villain. Rosette (awkwardly) reminds me of Naruto. They are optimistic, earnest, hard-working, and both have the drive and potential to reach their ambitions. Rosette was just so lively and full of energy which made watching the series more or less pleasant. Chrono is depicted to be a very modest, kind and selfless character though he is a devil. Rosette and Chrono&rsquo;s relationship are like of best friends if not more. They are both very close to each other, not hesitating a second to protect one another. Their partnering gives off such a deep feeling of fulfillment in your heart. They are both lovable and enjoyable to watch which makes the ending of the series even more melancholic.______________________________________________________________Enjoyment:Chrno Crusade has quickly and easily made it into my top anime list. At first, as I&rsquo;ve stated, I wasn&rsquo;t really fascinated with it. Until a few weeks later, I found myself completing the whole series in less than a day. Every episode was captivating as I watched one right after another. There were a few episodes where it felt as if it were a filler, but I thought it was good to have a few fillers here and there to take a break from the story. Character development was not something I expected from Chrno Crusade, but it turned out to be my favorite point of the series. The rating I gave for Chrno Crusade went from an Eight out of Ten to a Ten out of Ten during the last two episodes. These two episodes are notorious for making viewers cry. Honestly, I cried for about 10 minutes straight; coming from a guy who hasn&rsquo;t cried like that in over 5 years. The last episode had such an astounding impact and because of that, Chrno Crusade had earned the right to be on my favorites. This series has been very memorable and also very rewatchable.  It is PERFECT.______________________________________________________________Overall:I recommend anyone to watch Chrno Crusade. From the average otaku to an early anime watcher, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with this series. If you plan to watch it, at least watch the first 3 episodes. Do not do the same mistake I have and nearly dropped it on the first episode; which I deeply regret doing. Give it a try.

Give it a try.', 'Originally written by Daisuke Moriyama, Chrno Crusade (sometimes translated to Chrono) is an excellent action anime, that is possibly the saddest one I\'ve ever seen.I created this review, because unlike the one other CC review, I\'ve seen the whole thing, and I appreciate it. Sooo, here\'s my opinion.StoryRosette Christopher, and her little brother, Joshua, two little orphan children, are exploring, when they come across a mysterious cave. Within, a devil named Chrno was living, but the two young children befriend Chrno easily.One day, Joshua is driven insane by the powers he had already had, and the horns on Chrno, given to him by Aion,...and puts all the other children of the orphange into a temporal stasis, where they are frozen for four years. Aion than takes Joshua away, as one of the 7 apostiles.Rosette, devestated by the loss of her brother, makes a contract with Chrno. She is given a mysterious time-piece, where when she opens it, Chrno feeds off her soul to gain power.As Rosette and Chrno try to find her brother again, Rosettes life is ticking away from her pack with the devil.AnimationThere is something I love about this animation, I can\' even explain it. Unlike a lot of other action anime, this one does not cut corners with the shakey-screen effect. It\'s beautifully designed, with vibrant colours, and flows so nicely. I can\'t even explain it, as I said earlier. The best animation is definitly in the opening sequence, though.SoundAgain, I just love the music. It\'s hard to explain. The ending and opening fit the series so well, it\'s perfect. The music within the series is awesome, with it fitting every scene perfectly. I especially love one of the songs, that usually occurs after commerical breaks in the first few episodes. It gives off a very mystery/horror sound, which I feel the series has a bit of, deep down.CharacterI love the characters. All but one.Chrno was my personal favourite. He is a cute little devil, but can change into his awesome true form. He is such a nice little thing, and I can\'t possibly see anyone not liking him.Rosette, while being a typical annoying female, I still loved. She is emotional, yes, but she\'s not helpless like so many other leads. For the first few episodes, she is doing the majority of the fighting. Of course, towards the end, she gets a bit helpless, but it\'s not like she didn\'t try!I like Azmaria, for some odd reason. Just a cute little girl that admires Rosette. And I swear, that song she sings, I\'ve hear somewhere... Joshua was so adorable as a child, and just cool as a nut-job.Aoin was pretty neat, having more layers than the ""I want to destory the world"" thing.The only character I wasn\'t fond of Satella, and it was probably because I watched it in English, and I could barely understand her accent. It hurt.EnjoymentI watched this series in 3 days. I couldn\'t pull away. When I wasn\'t watching it, I was thinking about it. I was obsessed. I was Chrno Crusade sick. When I finished it, I cried. The ending was sad, and it was over, so I cried. Than I went to work, and I told everyone about this awesome anime I discovered. I proudly told them all I cried. I hummed the theme, until I went home. I am listening to the theme now.I think that could qualify as I enjoyed greatly.Overall / My Comments / My FeelingsI love this series, and I\'ve owned it for 4 days, so far. I am a sad, sad girl. The ending was such a depressingly happy ending, that I cried. Sure, they... umm..Anyways, I highly recommend this series. I love it for reasons unknown (maybe just Chrno? He is named after a game I love...) but anyways, I suck terribly at explaining the story, but believe me, it was awesome. Awesome, I say. Go out and buy this series, don\'t just download it. It needs to be enjoyed from your cozy couch, where you can cry into some blankets. and puts all the other children of the orphange into a temporal stasis, where they are frozen for four years.

This is basically a very driven girl trying to save her brother from being manipulated by the forces of hell. She is a sister in a branch of a military-church sort of deal, and her best friend is a devil. The plot is very interesting, including the questions towards God's involvement, death, and devils, and you can tell that every episode is somehow relating to the overall picture. My only qualm with this amazing anime would be the accent for the &quot;Jewel Witch&quot; (Satella). Being a German and speaking fluent German, and knowing my parents' accents with English... i'd have...to say that she's actually closer to Transylvania and Hungarian than German. But that's only the English dubbed. I saw the SUBBED version, too, and enjoyed the Japanese actress's pronunciation of most of the German words.STORY- 10Because of the originality (in a sense) and the religious undertones that make you question things intently, and because the character development is very, very intrepid. This has one of the most meaningful story arcs that i have ever come across. Every single episode means something. Making you empathize with a character, understand them, or even pity them. Even though there are flashback sequences that can sometimes be confusing, as long as you pay to the subbed dates, you will enjoy this series more than any other 24 episode anime, i guarantee it.ART- 10Beautiful. The action sequences use the &quot;shaky camera&quot; effect, but not to an overdose such as certain animes i have watched. The colors are always fitting for each of the episodes, and the blood is all the more gruesome with the contrast between the scenesSOUND - 8I LOVED the music. The openings and endings were amazing, i watched each and every one (i usually skip), but the music was captivating and well suited for the genre. The ending theme (for the last ep) was utterly perfect, too. Well-sung.CHARACTER - 9The contrast of character personalities makes this an a-typical anime. The main protagonist being a female with a very outspoken and agressive personality, the main male protagonist being very drawn back and selfless, and side characters that make you believe that there's either faith in humanity or lose your faith in humanity. The development is amazing too, you see between each episode a character grow stronger, or weaker, and the comparison is there.ENJOYMENT - 10This is one of those animes you can't stop watching. Just looking at the preview for the next episode makes you want to say &quot;Eh... i'll go to bed at 11:30pm tonight.&quot; Then, the next previews make you watch another episode, etc. By the time you've pulled an all-nighter you're still fulfilled and energized to watch the next, and call in a sick day to work.Overall - 10I have finally completed the entire series, and i have to say, this has the most meaningful ending and perfect flow that makes Chrno Crusade one of the only animes that has PERFECT length and timing. This has amazing art, amazing characters, and an amazing message. One of the things lacking from most anime now is the artistic value and philosophical value. Sure, it's nice to have a good laugh every now and then, but if you're looking for a great series with characters that are funny, deep and intriguing, look no further. Chrno Crusade is a great series.Enjoy!TIP!!!!!I enjoyed watched the subbed versions better, and have all together stopped watching the dubbed versions. There are too many scenes where the laughable accent of Satella has gotten in my way. Though i do love Rosette's dubbed voice,  i had to part ways with it. to say that she's actually closer to Transylvania and Hungarian than German. But that's only the English dubbed. I saw the SUBBED version, too, and enjoyed the Japanese actress's pronunciation of most of the German words.STORY- 10Because of the originality (in a sense) and the religious undertones that make you question things intently, and because the character development is very, very intrepid. This has one of the most meaningful story arcs that i have ever come across. Every single episode means something. Making you empathize with a character, understand them, or even pity them. Even though there are flashback sequences that can sometimes be confusing, as long as you pay to the subbed dates, you will enjoy this series more than any other 24 episode anime, i guarantee it.ART- 10Beautiful. The action sequences use the &quot;shaky camera&quot; effect, but not to an overdose such as certain animes i have watched. The colors are always fitting for each of the episodes, and the blood is all the more gruesome with the contrast between the scenesSOUND - 8I LOVED the music. The openings and endings were amazing, i watched each and every one (i usually skip), but the music was captivating and well suited for the genre. The ending theme (for the last ep) was utterly perfect, too. Well-sung.CHARACTER - 9The contrast of character personalities makes this an a-typical anime. The main protagonist being a female with a very outspoken and agressive personality, the main male protagonist being very drawn back and selfless, and side characters that make you believe that there's either faith in humanity or lose your faith in humanity. The development is amazing too, you see between each episode a character grow stronger, or weaker, and the comparison is there.ENJOYMENT - 10This is one of those animes you can't stop watching. Just looking at the preview for the next episode makes you want to say &quot;Eh... i'll go to bed at 11:30pm tonight.&quot; Then, the next previews make you watch another episode, etc. By the time you've pulled an all-nighter you're still fulfilled and energized to watch the next, and call in a sick day to work.Overall - 10I have finally completed the entire series, and i have to say, this has the most meaningful ending and perfect flow that makes Chrno Crusade one of the only animes that has PERFECT length and timing.

I am appalled at how much I get wrong impressions, but then again it&rsquo;s fun to be pleasantly surprised when I find out that the anime I thought was going to be bad, ends up to be something spectacular and memorable.My first impression was that the show is too serious, and since I don&rsquo;t like serious themes, I probably won&rsquo;t like it. I was wrong &ndash; I LOVE IT! I even overlooked the blasphemy since it rocked. It was funny when it needed to be funny, it was cute when I needed to go &ldquo;awww&hellip;&rdquo; It had high energy...when I looked for some action. Thank God (no pun intended) my first impression was so wrong.I love the characters. Rosette was cool &ndash; she was so brave and a bit inspiring. She didn&rsquo;t waste her time at all, and she was always trying to help out. Then there&rsquo;s Chrno. What a cutie. I love how hard he tries to be accepted. The Chrno &ndash; Rosette love match was weird at first, because a) Chrno&rsquo;s a demon. b) The height difference. c) The age difference (Although at first I was going for a Chrno &ndash; Azmaria love match.. I have a sick mind, I know). Despite that, it worked out in the end, since their love for each other was at a different level. I also like Azmaria. She&rsquo;s just so adorable, and so pretty and well designed too. And then there&rsquo;s Joshua &ndash; woah! Hottie alert. Too bad he&rsquo;s under age and a bit of a retard.The drawing style was ok. It wasn&rsquo;t bad, it wasn&rsquo;t great. It was acceptable. There was nothing new about it but it was just alright. Chrno&rsquo;s design was ok, but something about him wasn&rsquo;t right. He&rsquo;s still cute though. The villains looked cool too &ndash; they were well designed. Speaking of the villains, generally the fight scenes are ok and actually quite exciting.I like the colors &ndash; but sometimes too much blue and brown just sickens me. I know it&rsquo;s in the 1920s and I guess they didn&rsquo;t have much color then (Did that last comment make sense at all?) but more or less the colors were balanced. I also like how they used CG effects. It made it look more interesting and modern. It complemented the high energy of the story.The music had a western feel to it, at least for the BGM. That was another reason why I hesitated watching it because I hate western themes. It grew on me after a few episodes since I realized that the music did match the feel of the scenes, and it really improved the scenes. I really like the opening scene too &ndash; again, it matched the anime. I think it was called pleasure line or something like that. It was really well made, it even had violins to complement it. The ending song was just touching. It kinda hinted that the series was going to end in a really sad way, but it was still beautiful and delicate (remind me never to use the word delicate again)I am just so happy to have watched a really good anime. I know it isn&rsquo;t perfect, it&rsquo;s not as popular as other series out there (And I would personally liked it better with less unecessary fan service - she's a nun you know), but what I got out of it is just so special. It really touched my heart (I&rsquo;m a sap, I know) and it&rsquo;s definitely one of my favorites now. when I looked for some action.

It's a good enough series to watch if you are bored....or you have the type of job where you could watch this to while away the hours.ART/ANIMATIONArt/Animation was done by a big budget company, Gonzo, which usually means there isn't going to be anything lacking by way of animation. I would assume this would be considered a period piece [since it takes place in the 1920s] and as such, a lot of the artistic design was from or inspired from that era: the...cars, civilian clothing, scenery and buildings. Movements and high-tension moments, like, car chases and fight scenes were all very smooth and realistic. The only thing I really liked animationwise was the ending sequence.SOUNDSThe ending song I really liked it. It was very beautiful and melacholy at the same time. The OP was not to bad either. However Azamaria's singing....tho quite lovely, totally annoyed me for some reason, it just didn't look real or that it would come from her. Why is there an echo coming from her voice like she is singing in a great hall.....eventho she's outside? Other than that I have no complaints, the voice acting was great as was the sound effects.STORYThe storyline was not put together well, this could have really been one of those 12 ep. shows. The basic premise of this show is that of a young, reckless and impetuous nun her cute sidekicks, a meek, angelic apostle and a once powerful but now somewhat inhibited demon, go searching for her missing brother battling all sorts of evil along the way.......hilarity supposedly ensues. Yet, I never find this show as funny they maybe wanted it to be and most jokes seem to fall flat and fizzle. With some of the earlier episodes, it was such a yawnfest, at times I found it so boring that I found other projects to do, such as begin writing this review and scrubbing my toilet. It's not as if I was totally lost on what the creators were trying to achieve with this story and the whole church aspect but somehow, in this series, the whole idea/concept of gun-toting nuns and demon-banishing clergymen seem forced or just overall silly with a lot of religious catholic symbolitry being tossed about with no real meaning behind it. It did make for one heckuva battle scene in the later episodes, however. But it just didn't make sense, the story could have been the same...if not better in my opinion if they were regular clerics instead of warrior-nuns. Religious animes are a tricky affair but sometimes they work out really well like for example Trinity Blood or having a rogue monk like Saiyuki's Sanzo, it seemed &ldquo;believable&rdquo; or to at least fit neatly within the storyline as opposed to just being thrown into the mix.CHARACTERSI had no particular affinity for any of the characters in this show, which is a rare thing to happen for me, I usually get bonded to at least ONE character very quickly. However with this show, I found these characters so insincere, unreal and even cookie-cutter[ish]. I can't place my finger on one singular reason why they appeared that way to me but one reason could be the randomness of their emotions..... one minute she's teary-eyed then the next minute she's yelling and the scene is supposed to be funny. The Demon-kid seems emotionless for the most part&mdash;and I don't think it was supposed to be intentional, and Angel/Apostle-girl seemed too cutesy and 2-Dimentional personalitywise..With Character Design, again nothing too unique and a lot of the clothing of the principal characters seemed out of touch with the times [what grown woman wears a giant yellow bow at the end of her hair?] also modding a nun's gear and habit for battle with humongous splits running down the sides and garters seemed......NOT right.ENJOYMENTI don't know how to feel about this show. I want to say that it was bad....that it sucked and maybe overall it kinda did. However, it does have it's awesome moments like the Demon Battle scene, which was out of this world. But a few good scenes can't carry a show. And there were just too much conflict and contradictions: Biblical facts v. Science Fiction and then you have the past [the 1920s] mixed with futuristic elements. The creators bit off more than they could chew with this story I think or maybe too many random ideas...I'm surprized someone didn't throw in a headless Indian running around with a tomahawk.It isn't something I'd watch again if I had the choice and I can't recommend it without letting the viewer know what they are in for. cars, civilian clothing, scenery and buildings.

Considering that this anime has a huge following it seems to illustrate either the appeal of nun T&A to the general anime audience or Chrono Trigger fans not giving two shits about whether the show is related at all to the video game. Though both seem to share the common indifference over the misspelling of “Chrono” in the title (though I hear that it was...intentional I still think it’s stupid).It’s the roaring 1920s and in this supposedly kick-ass anime the jail-bait-D-cup nun Rosette with her younger demon assistant Chrono (hey second time’s the charm I guess) are on a quest to hunt down demons that are causing pain and suffering because of the general lack of morality in the world or some such BS.Rosette who operates on two settings: 5-year-old and full-blown Fran Drescher is the theoretical comic relief to the series. Though she comes off as more annoying, as the writers no doubt deluded themselves into thinking they had channeled Rosette to the character of Auska Langley Soryu, but forgot to carry over the catharsis.Chrono, the demon, who carries a laughably huge rotary phone on his back seems slightly more competent than his female counterpart but, always seems to suffer constant verbal abuse from Rosette. I can’t help but think that the only reason he sticks with her besides the contract that binds them is the hope that he’ll be able to eat her out before the series ends. However, she’ll have to start taking her crazy pills and shut up for five-fucking-seconds to make that happen.Though there is a story-line to this show, there is a possible ninety-percent chance that you’re motivation to watch this is for the hot nuns. Yeah, they all have suspiciously huge breasts which can only mean that the Vatican is fronting the cash for the boob jobs. It kind of makes sense since the church is always hurting for more money and followers. Not that those breasts do the poor nuns any good since they’ve sworn a life of celibacy and can only wait for the return of Jesus to give him a nice tit-fuck (which gives the phrase “second coming” a whole new meaning).In conclusion, skip this anime, watch Full Metal Alchemist instead. intentional I still think it’s stupid).It’s the roaring 1920s and in this supposedly kick-ass anime the jail-bait-D-cup nun Rosette with her younger demon assistant Chrono (hey second time’s the charm I guess) are on a quest to hunt down demons that are causing pain and suffering because of the general lack of morality in the world or some such BS.Rosette who operates on two settings: 5-year-old and full-blown Fran Drescher is the theoretical comic relief to the series.

Rosette works with a church as...a demon exorcist but has Chrno, a demon himself, as her partner. Generally, the church looks down upon this, but since Chrno is an exceptionally sweet guy and Rosette will not part with him, he is allowed to be around.From the outside Chrno Crusade just appears to be a story about a girl, her demon partner and them hunting down demons, but the story inside of that is much deeper and an epic 'crusade' through time, through Heaven and Hell, across the land and with amazing and interesting characters laced into everything.The story overall is one of my favorites - I love everything about it from the setting - the early 1900s and revolving around the Catholic Church and their obsessions with demons and artifacts, the clothes they wore, the weapons they use, the different demons and devils they encounter to the actual story itself, with Rosette, Chrno and her missing brother that she loves dearly.The villain is overall one of the most evil villains in anything and has a plan that would destroy most of the world and he cares not for who he uses, hurts, and kills in the process, as long as he gets his way.The main characters, Chrno and Rosette are among my favorites - Chrno is my favorite guy. His normal form, a 12 year old demon, is absolutely adorable and sweet, who is extremely caring and loving, but when in his true form, a sinning devil, he is the most amazing character, ever. He is loyal, loving and would do anything for Rosette and you know this from the beginning of the entire story.A lot of people call Rosette whiny, but like a lot of other shows, she often makes light of things that would otherwise be viewed as extremely dark and dismal because you need some relief in your life, when you're living the way they do.The voices in Japanese are amazing, too - Chrno's voice actor became my favorite of all time due to Chrno and still is to this day. Rosette makes me giddy, too, since she does a voice of a special character in my favorite anime of all time, as well as Chrno Crusade. The music is exceptional, too, fitting very well into the time period, but mixing in the fantasy and demonic attributes, as well.Chrno Crusade is an outrageous story of love and loyalty, Heaven and Hell and should not be missed by anyone that wants to be moved as much as any show can move you, and who wants to experience a truly deep and meaningful storyline, with wonderful and real characters. a demon exorcist but has Chrno, a demon himself, as her partner.

Some are focused more on their interpretations of the Divine Mission, some more on action and some more on the supernatural.The focus of Chrono Crusade is on its characters and the relationships they share. Of course there\'s action, too, and supernatural elements, and a touch of the Divine Mission... but mostly it\'s about its memorable characters. Rosette Christopher, a nun in the Magdalene Order, has a contract with a devil named Chrono, meaning his power comes from her very soul. The more...he uses, the shorter her life becomes. But Chrono is a good devil (excuse the oxymoron) with a sad past who only entered into this contract because of extreme circumstances, and is actually doing everything he can not to use her soul up. The two have a long history together and are very close, though at times Rosette\'s somewhat abrasive personality gets the better of him, leading the two to argue. Whatever conflicts they have, however, they truly love one another, and it is this love and how slowly it comes to the forefront that serves as one of Chrono Crusade\'s great strengths.The anime series, based on the manga series of the same title, starts off essentially the same as its source material, but partway in begins to deviate into an alternate storyline. Even in episodes where it takes inspiration from the manga by including certain locations or events, the anime does its own take, and leads us towards a very, very different ending; it is so different, in fact, that by the last episode it feels as though we\'ve experienced an entirely different story, and in many ways, we have.While I would say the manga has the superior story to tell, the anime series tells its own story very well. You would have to have a heart of stone to not come to care about Rosette, Chrono, Azmaria and Satella and the adventures they share. Other areas in which the anime excels are its animation, which is absolutely gorgeous; its music, which is also gorgeous (especially ""Sayonara Solitaire,"" the closing theme); its voice acting (though I\'m speaking of the Japanese cast; I have not watched the English dub); and its good balance of humor, action and plot. If the anime has any real weaknesses, they would be the fact that it reveals certain secrets way too soon, and that its final battle is surprisingly underwhelming (to be fair, however, the anime\'s intent in the final episodes is to focus on Rosette and Chrono\'s relationship rather than the battle they are fighting). The villains, especially Aion and Fiore, are very well-portrayed and behave exactly the way anyone familiar with the manga would expect them to. Their stories are, of course, also altered, as is Joshua Christopher\'s; his story ends up petering out towards the conclusion, whereas in the manga he remained important right up to the end. This isn\'t the jarring change you might expect, but it doesn\'t exactly carry as much weight, either.As mentioned before, it\'s the love between Rosette and Chrono that really makes this series strong, and their most tender moments together are the series\' most powerful. Episodes 18 and 24 in particular moved me greatly and brought tears to my eyes. Special praise should go to Tomoko Kawakami, who plays Rosette. She brings the character to life in ways that even the animation couldn\'t. There is not a single flaw anywhere in her performance. Whether she is expressing happiness, anger, sadness or any other emotion, we believe her completely.Don\'t allow the religious imagery or elements keep you from giving this series a try. There is a lot here to recommend, from a good, moving story to beautiful, cinema-quality animation. Of course, I would also recommend reading the manga as well; the story, as I said, is different and the manga\'s ending is so powerful it is certain to bring a lump to the throat at the very least. I had to wait a long time to watch the anime, but I must say: the wait was worth it. he uses, the shorter her life becomes.

She brings the character to life in ways that even the animation couldn\'t. There is not a single flaw anywhere in her performance. Whether she is expressing happiness, anger, sadness or any other emotion, we believe her completely.Don\'t allow the religious imagery or elements keep you from giving this series a try. There is a lot here to recommend, from a good, moving story to beautiful, cinema-quality animation. Of course, I would also recommend reading the manga as well; the story, as I said, is different and the manga\'s ending is so powerful it is certain to bring a lump to the throat at the very least. I had to wait a long time to watch the anime, but I must say: the wait was worth it.', ""Welcome to my Review of Chrono Crusade, this is definitely one of my top 5 rated anime's. I remember the first time I came across this anime was when I was in a anime club where I got free dvd's sent through the mail. I think I checked out a few episodes. They were dubbed though. Viewers beware if you watch this anime, definitely do not watch it dubbed. Its WAY better if you watch this series subbed. I tried giving it a chance until I heard Satala's Dubbed English voice. Her screams were just damaging to the ears lol.Story:Chrono Crusade talks about a demon...that has lost his powers due to his horn being taken away, and has a contract with a sister called Rosette. In order for Chrono to turn back into his true form (demon), he requires Rosette to give him her life force. The longer he stays in that form, the shorter Rosette's life becomes. Rosette tries to find his missing brother, and Chrono helps her out along this journey.The story is really captivating and keeps the audience looking forward for the next episode. The story stays intact from the beginning until the end, there's almost no made up episodes which are unrelated with the actual plot. Let me reword that, absolutely NO FILLERS. The plot continues its pace through out the anime. The ending is very very sad. Be prepared!Characters:The characters are indeed captivating and eye catching, especially the girls. Rosetta Christopher the Heroine is a Nun whom I highly enjoy. She is beautiful, hot, short tempered, does stuff her own way, and can be really selfish at times, clumsy, and never listens to anyone! Azumaria, the sidekick of their group is one cutie pie, her voice is like an Angel's. Not to mention that she sings so gracefully and magnificent.  Its hard for me choose which is my favorite characters, both Chrono and Rosette's play just perfect roles in the plot. The character development is clearly presented,  and you get to know about the character's past, as well as the history to what has been the cause of the present situation. The main villain is way to cool. He doesn't have a bunch of corny lines either like most evil villains do on some anime shows.Music:Despite having the same opening and ending being played again and again for the entire 24 episodes, the songs were very nice and pleasant to listen to. The lyrics and music are well versed and suitable for the anime. Nothing to complain here, I just love the music. The audio sounds with in the series are perfect and match every moment rather if its a hilarious funny scene or a very emotional sad part. You know something is going to happen when you here the BG music play.Art:Not much to say bout the art. The art is just brilliant with beautiful colors, the animation is just spectacular.Enjoyment:You will definitely enjoy this series, it starts out kind of slow during the first few episodes but after you watch through a few of the episodes and get to understand the plot, you will be hooked, take my word for it. The first time i watched this series from beginning to end. I watched it all in just two days, stayed up late and kept watching it. I actually worked in the morning during this time and I tried to put the series away, but then i just kept watching it. I should of called in sick that day lol.Overall:This is a great anime to own and worth your time. However, this anime might not be suitable for audiences who are sensitive towards their religion as they might find it disturbing. It does deal with a bit of Christianity, if this doesn't bother you, then you have nothing to worry bout. I would recommend Chrno Crusade to anyone and looking for something different. This series is kind of similar to hellsing in away in that deals with demons and satanic rituals. I have watched alot of Demon type anime's to name a few, hellsing, Dn Angel, Devil Lady. Other series just don't catch my attention as much as this anime does. The characters are so lovable and memorable, seriously after finishing this anime because of the sad ending, its quite hard to just go right to another series and start watching it. I hope you guys and girls out there would enjoy this series as much as I did.10/10 that has lost his powers due to his horn being taken away, and has a contract with a sister called Rosette.

The concept was so intriguing at first..) and with very absurd depictions of said organization. I saw it to the end and deleted it whole afterwards.The end was also badly ploted and executed.And do not mistake me for any religious ascet. I...am not. Animes like Trinity Blood work far better using the catholic organization and its truculent side than this one...In the religious ideas use for instance Demon Lord Dante has a real interesting plot, using the catholic ethos with much more attention and hability than what was used in this series.That anime is one of my favorites!It is sad, for the characters could have been a lot better, and the overall idea was really interesting...It was a waste of good art and animation style am not.

I have never been more wrong. In a nut shell this series had lame comedy, lame fan service, a lame story loosely based on Christianity and various mythologies and lame animation.Animation - You can clearly see the cheapness of the animation from the start. The action uses a lot of choppy fighting (still frame action or a few cells of animation) and the character/monster models are clearly reused with just minor differences. This is ok if its 20 years old. Not for something made...in 2003.Sound - It's just not memorable at all.Story - I have one word to describe the story. Lame. The way it blends christianity with mythology and mixes contradiction along side factual history is ludicrous. It's not even interesting.Characters - Chrno becomes Super Saiyan, screaming and all, when he gets mad but will lose it immediately if someone says &quot;dont please.&quot;Enjoyment -  I started to fall asleep during episode 7. Thats never a good sign.  I wouldnt recommend this to anyone. in 2003.Sound - It's just not memorable at all.Story - I have one word to describe the story. Lame.

But once the plot starts to move, it just becomes stupid.The main story was really bad. Aion makes this extremely convoluted and unnecessary complicated plan to do something, and just ends up dying anticlimactically at the end. After watching the entire series, i honestly can't tell you what Aion was trying to do, or why he was doing it.The last 12 episodes are so bad it brings this down to a 3. Characters do things for no reason. Nothing is explained. By the...end, i didn't care the slightest bit about any of the characters. I didn't care it they lived or died, or what happened to them. The last episode had more characters doing inexplicable and random things that make more sense, but there is one scene where Rose and Chrono die. It's actually the only decent scene that makes sense in the last half of the show. It's actually a great scene, one might say beautiful, but I didn't care about the characters so i felt absolutely no emotion in that scene. What a waste. I felt this scene was good enough to raise my rating to a 4.I didn't really like the art. It wasn't bad, it just didn't fit the series. It seems too cartoony and happy for something trying(and failing) to be deep and dark. Chrono in his true form looks goofy and stupid.It should also be noted that the author of this has no understanding of christianity. I don't understand why animes keep doing this. If you're going to butcher chistianity, just make up a fake religion instead of trying to be clever. end, i didn't care the slightest bit about any of the characters.

In my humble opinion, one of the best of the supernatural genre. Well, let the review:Story (9/10)Well, as I already mentioned above, the story followed a completely different route from the manga. The story in the anime, it was a little hard to understand and some events were cut from the anime. But does not have much to complain about the story, the story in the anime even not following much of the manga, it was great. I do not know what happened, but the end of...the anime is something that leaves most of the people who did not follow the manga confused. When I watched the first time, I also was very confused. It\'s something you can not understand very well without reading the manga, but once understood, the story gets really interesting. In the manga happens pretty much the same things, but differently. The story just did not get a 10 because of several things cut from the anime and that most of the events had a bad explanation, especially at the end.Art (9/10)I found it very interesting animation for that time. Even if it is not the best animation in the world, we have to consider the time it was released. I generally do not like the animations of Gonzo, had several I\'ve ever seen with a deplorable art. I do not have much to talk about the art of Chrno Crusade. It was one of the few good animations of Gonzo.Sound (10/10)I really liked the songs presented in the anime, it was very well chosen. The ending is something I can not explain. Music is more than perfect, and the way the music is similar with the history of anime is awesome. I think that\'s one of the things that make this anime is so good.Character (10/10)I think are lacking in today\'s anime characters with personalities that you find in Chrno Crusade. My favorite character is Rosette. But I like almost all the characters. The only one I can hate the anime is the Aion (I wonder why?). Chrno has a unique personality. It\'s hard to watch this anime and do not like it. Azmaria is very cute, she is in charge of leaving the funny anime. Satella is the typical antagonist that we see in various animes out there, but with the course of the story it becomes a great character. Rosette is complete. She is very clumsy, also has a great nose when the business is to find problems in the beginning it is very cold compared to Chrno. What she likes most is to help others. This is not cute? The reason for my hatred for Aion is simple and short, ""I will destroy the world"" and many other things like that, did this character come all my hate. But I must admit it was well spent.Enjoyment (10/10)I enjoyed the anime. The end made me very perplexed, I was very thoughtful and I did not think so good at the time. Soon I tried the manga and then I could understand the events. I remember after finishing, I stopped to see some anime. I cried a lot after the end, ahh we skip that part, it is too painful for me.Overall (10/10)Honestly, it\'s almost impossible not to like this anime. The anime has few flaws and many are not remarkable for someone who does not know the series. Chrno Crusade was one of my first anime, anime is hard to review, not the end in itself, but to know that will not be more when it\'s over those 24 episodes. If you are looking for a comedy, romance, and a bit of action, Chrno Crusade is the anime. the anime is something that leaves most of the people who did not follow the manga confused.

The show itself should not be missed. You will love it!"", ""Chrno Crusade\xa0is an early 2000s anime based off of a manga by Moriyama Daisuke. The anime version was handled by the folks at Gonzo. Yes, the Bakuretsu Tenshi, Final Fantasy Unlimited & Trinity Blood studio.Story:We open with representatives of the Magdalene order, a religious order that hunts demons, going into action. These are our main characters, Sister Rosette and her daemonic partner Chrno. We quickly learn that Rosette's younger brother, Joshua, was taken to a twisted version of Shibuya to play a reaper's game. I mean, he was kidnapped by a demon named Aion. To search for him, she's formed a pact with her friend,...Chrno. The price being her very life force.I have to give Moriyama a lot of credit here. The writing is brilliant. It's one of those series where the premise has potential but only if it's handled very well. Which it is. The theme of time is a powerful one and it's handled immaculately. The way the series builds up to big events is superbly done as well. It's very good at giving escalating hints at what's coming and of having worthy pay off.This series is also excellent at mixing some more light-hearted comedic elements with its more serious, dramatic moments. Which is one of those things that most media can't manage. But this series handles it by making the comedy more subdued and never going too far with its dramatic elements. Even the most serious moments contain a strong spark of hope and even the most comedic moment has some serious undertone playing out. As a consequence, the shifts are a lot more natural.I can also credit the series with having fantastic world building. It doesn't just throw back stories and fantastical terms at you. It eases you into them gradually so, when some aspect actually gets explained, you're able to easily grasp it as part of the world and see where it fits in with the rest. It helps that the visions of heaven, earth and hell in this series are really compelling.The ending is absolutely perfect. I won't spoil it, but I will point out that a lesser writer would not have gone with the ending this series has. They would have seen it as too risky or not marketable enough. But it is also the ending that works best with all the build up and events of the series.This series also deserves some credit in being one of those rare anime that makes me tear up. There are two scenes in particular where I had to dry my eyes. And I don't cry at that many pieces of media. Especially not after multiple viewings but I re-watched this series for a third time for this review and it still got to me.Characters:My minor complaint here is that Chrno Crusade has one of those comedic dirty old man characters. To its credit, there is more to the elder than you would usually get with that type of character. He does have some complexity. But it's still a tired and kind of shit archetype to work off of.That gripe aside, the characters in this are excellent. Rosette starts out seeming like one of those more brash, action girl heroines. But as the story progresses she gains more complexity and you learn that a lot of her more reckless behaviours tie into her wanting to live every day to its utmost due to her more limited time.Every major character is like that. They start with some, simple archetype and elevate it to something unique, complex and interesting. Which also leads to some superb character dynamics and interactions. Chrno and Rosette in particular have a superb bond. The minor characters may not be as perfectly developed and fleshed out, but they have enough complexity to come across as actual people.I also have to credit the series for its antagonists. The villains, Aion especially, are complex characters with clear and compelling motivations. Aion makes such an excellent villain because he is very blatantly villainous but he's also got his own twisted reasons behind everything he does and he excels at manipulating others into doing what he needs them to do. He doesn't come across as the most physically intimidating but he doesn't need to because his powers of persuasion and manipulation make him a terrifying opponent.Art:My minor gripe here is that there are points where Rosette or Satella will have their clothes torn in battle in a fashion that borders on sexualised. To the series' credit, it never crosses that line but it does come uncomfortably close.Aside from that, the artwork is very strong. The demon designs are great. The various technical devices the Magdalene order uses have interesting designs. Steeped in religious imagery, obviously, but that just adds to the aesthetic. Gonzo deserves a lot of credit for framing their important scenes very effectively. For instance, there's a scene towards the end where Rosette is going out and helping people but its framed in such a way that it comes across as very unsettling. And a lot of that comes down to the art since she isn't moving right and there's something just a bit off about her face.The action sequences are fairly strong as well. There's a lot of creativity behind them and they're very effectively animated for the tone that the series is going for. The more light-hearted scenes come with more high energy, fun action scenes while the more serious scenes have heavier sequences.Sound:The performances in this are superlative. Ishida Akira, Kawakami Tomoko, Chiba Saeko and Neya Michiko are all excellent. I don't even care that Neya Michiko's Deutsch isn't quite natural. And you can't fault Inoue Kazuhiko's performance as Aion. The music is excellent as well. Amazing theme tunes with Tsubasa wa Pleasure Line & Sayonara Solitaire\xa0and perfectly fashioned in episode music. Which includes some lovely song performances by Saeko Chiba.Ho-yay:There are moments in Chrno's shown back story that make it seem like maybe he and Aion were more than friends but it's not a lot and there's nothing definitive.Areas of Improvement:Give the elder a different comedic attribute. Yeah, I admit that I just personally can't stand the dirty old man trope. But even putting that aside, you could definitely do something more unique here.Less attire tearing during fights.Show a little more of Joshua's fate in the ending. After the effort put in on his behalf, it would be nice to know a bit more about what happens with him.Final Thoughts:This series is excellent. In terms of writing, acting and animation it's really exemplary. I did struggle a bit with whether to give it a 9 or a 10 since I do have two gripes with it that somewhat affected my enjoyment but given how stellar the whole thing is and how minor they are by comparison to everything it does right, I'm going with a rare 10/10.

Chrno Crusade was simply an alright series. While it has issues, I enjoyed the series somewhat and if it's on your watchlist and you have nothing else you want to watch, go ahead and give it a go. It's not bad but it isn't great either.The art was acceptable but I couldn't get over that Kids-WB-saturday-morning-cartoon look. Most animations were crisp and clean but there were corners cut, especially with flying characters (ever flying scene was a static character moving around the screen), and the awkward animations of some side characters.The story was decent and did suffer...from pacing issues. At the start it's entertaining and fast paced (but not too quick) but about a dozen episodes in, the pacing slows to a crawl. Episodes go by with little to nothing of importance happening. There is lots of entertainment to be had in the first few episodes but it's somewhat sporadic after that.The characters spend too much time being tongue-in-cheek to allow themselves to be taken seriously later on. That being said, the chemistry between the protagonists is some of what helps the series go from being mediocre to just 'okay'. The characters each have their own goal and they work toward their goals as a group and the teamwork aspect was something I enjoyed quite a bit.My biggest complaint is the latter part of the series. The anime release outpaced the manga release and it shows. Despite the pacing issues, the anime was progressing fine up until a certain point and the story  Some aspects of the ending are decent and fulfilling but others just don't make sense and you will end up scratching your head (I'm looking at you, final scene) as they rely on information that we aren't ever shown. The climactic battle upset me as it was quick with no tension. Many events within the series are shown to be meaningless to the overall plot and I found that frustrating. from pacing issues.

Chrno Crusade had surprised all my expectations, and I'm not talking about the overall art, sound, the quality of the story (not that it's not important), but I'm talking about the enjoyment. After the few couple lagging episodes, you get dragged into some enjoyable moments. Action packed, fast paced, emotional, dramatic, serious, and funny moments characterize the greatness of Chrno Crusade.The story was good, but not great. The struggles and dark conflicts with demons and mankind may seem interesting..., but while watching the series, you may find yourself a little detached from the plot and more adhered to other aspects. The story revolves around the two heroes who are suppose to destroy other demons threatening mankind and also with rosette's own personal quest to find her brother. But all things considered, the plot is not that strong and the storyline I described is more like a facade for the action and other side events.The dark animation art is not bad, not eye popping either. I'm actually very impressed with sound esp. with voice acting and the soundtrack. The soundtrack music during the dark moments and during the very emotional scenes had a profound effect including the various piano pieces. The opening is fine but the ending song is very very memorable and fits how the anime ends.Character development and likeness is alright but the only character that stands out for me was Rosette. Displaying humorous, reckless, &amp;  juvenile traits in the beginning, then revealing her emotional and assertive side later on. A very strong and likeable character from start to finish.The enjoyment gets a high score because of simply the wide range of aspects in this anime that just made it so fun and memorable to watch. The raw action and emotion are at their peak from the middle to the end. It just doesn't receive the perfect 10 for enjoyment because there sadly are those episodes that have dull fights and fastforwarding moments.I believe the strongest point in this anime was the ending. I think that if I typed this review up right after I finished the end, I would give it a 10 overall, riding on my emotions. There are times in this anime where you'll have to think and draw upon the events of the time but otherwise, it's all guns and demons from there on.

I have never seen anything like it.It inculcates many elements such as supernatural,romance(suttle),comedy,historical,drama. Though the romance that occurs between the characters is not very dramatic it is one of the rare &quot;versions&quot; that is also quite romantic in its own way. I loved the story for how it was able to incorporate the supernatural element into such a life-like story,as if the story itself is...real as they do follow real events in history. The story is also very deep containing many themes such as the despair and suffereing during the time as well as questioning christianity itself.so if you are a devout christian who hates being discriminated or to see an alternative i suggest you don't watch this, but i feel this theme is what makes the story very interesting as well. The story also has a good deal of action to keep you glued to the screen.The art is nothing special, it can be a bit cartoony at times to portray the comedy but besides that it is of a good standard.I loved the opening and closing songs, i felt that they were very suited for a drama anime like this. Also, the songs that are sung during the show are quite soothing and the choices were good.The characters were another spectacular feat.

That is why I can walk straight ahead. That is why I never stop.""Chrono Crusade is an anime adaptation of Daisuke Moriyama\'s manga, from the ever controversial and bold studio Gonzo, the series made quite a stir back when it aired in 2003 due to elements such as a taboo romance between a nun and a demon, Christian lore integrated into the plot, religious themes and a tragic finale that still...to this day is pretty rare to occur in shounen anime. Both the manga and the anime series are among my favorites, but I tend to give special attention to the anime, because it is the version of Chrono Crusade that tends to get the most criticism, either from manga purists who automatically call anything that isn\'t an exact panel-to-panel adaptation of the source material garbage, or because of criticisms such as ""the whole plot is pointless because everything was for naught"" or ""the second half has an inconsistent tone and gets too convoluted"" and other things commonly said by those plebs who got caught in the filter. In fact, I disagree with the vast majority of the criticism the Chrono Crusade anime receives, as the points tend to be either straight up wrong or only partially right, and I\'ll discuss some of them in this review when it\'s relevant to talk about them.Anyway... Yup, the Chrono Crusade anime diverges from the manga, even in the first half that adapts the manga storyline, it\'s still a fairly loose adaptation: Some of the manga-adapted stories play out differently, some chapters of the manga got cut out because they\'re not relevant to the anime\'s storyline, several episodes are exclusive to the anime, and the plot in general for the second half is radically different from the source material. However, I don\'t care if a series follows its source material faithfully or not, as long as it\'s still a good story, I\'m more than willing to accept it for what it is and recommend to anyone else, as I do with the 2003 version of Fullmetal Alchemist and Bokurano, another controversial Gonzo manga adaptation that gets flak for not following the manga. Maybe I\'ll write a Bokurano review too once I stop being a lazy bastard, but not today.Sadly, though, Chrono Crusade is barely discussed nowadays, as older anime tend to fade into obscurity after everyone has already discussed everything about them, unless they\'re either famous long running shounen or provide quality shitposting material for weebs to keep on making memes and/or waifu wars for eternity, like Evangelion, Code Geass and Darling in the FranXX managed to do. Fortunately, I\'m one of those guys who remember Chrono Crusade and still think it\'s a masterpiece of a series, and since my opinion is the only objectively correct one in the entire internet, you either agree with me, or you\'re simply wrong. Now, let\'s properly dive into this series as I try my best to explain what makes it so great.Set in America fresh out of World War I and all the prosperity of the roaring 20s, Chrono Crusade tells the story of a nun called Rosette Christopher and her demon partner Chrono as they work for the Order of Magdalene, an organization created to combat the demonic threats that started to mysteriously pop up all over the country. Rosette and Chrono aren\'t just fighting demons for the sake of it, however, they\'re after Rosette\'s brother, Joshua Christopher, who was taken away by a mysterious demon called Aion and his group called the Sinners, all of which seem to share a bit of a history with Chrono.The way Chrono Crusade plays out during its first half is somewhat akin to early Fullmetal Alchemist in a sense that it\'s an action shounen with dark undertones and some comedy thrown in there so the series doesn\'t get way too gloomy... Often bad and poorly-timed comedy that honestly the series would have been better off without it. But hey, if Fullmetal Alchemist (especially Brotherhood) can get away with that shit, then so can Chrono Crusade. Regardless, the first quarter of Chrono Crusade mostly revolves around Chrono and Rosette taking up demon-hunting missions for the Order as their personalities and relationship get fleshed out and we\'re introduced to other characters, the most important ones being: Azmaria Hendric, a portuguese soprano singer who\'s also one of the seven apostles blessed with God\'s holy power, and Satella Harvenheit, a pair of breasts who\'s able to summon magical stands with her jewels, called a ""jewel witch"" in the series.One of Chrono Crusade\'s strengths is precisely the interactions between its characters, striking a perfect balance between lighthearted fun, genuinely heartwarming and sad. Chrono and Rosette are at odds with each other in many ways, her being a hot-headed energetic girl who gets in trouble easily while he\'s calm, composed and passive to a fault, the way they play off of each other and have all this bantz is pretty fun. The series does a fantastic job at showing how different their personalities are, yet at the same time how deep their borderline-romantic bond goes and how much this contract between then hurts on both sides, it\'s easy to see how important they truly are to each other despite their silly antics as they both grow as characters. Azmaria and Satella, while not having as much focus as the leading pair, still get their fair share of moments, moreso Azmaria than Satella, who unfortunately is a bit underdeveloped in here.That\'s not to say they\'re not good characters individually, each one of them develops and the character arcs they go through are very satisfying... Mostly. As I mentioned before, Satella leaves a bit to be desired due to her having significantly less screen time than the other three, but it\'s good enough to be acceptable nonetheless. The character arcs are mostly tied to the central themes of the series: Mortality, faith, loss, family, stuggling with the past, and last but not least, the concept of ""good"" and ""evil"" and how the line between those two opposites is blurrier than we believe, and all of these are more or less incorporated into the main protagonist, Rosette.The way Rosette is handled is a brilliant example of subtle characterization and development, she\'s presented as this idealistic headstrong girl who, despite having a tragic past that caused her to essentially miss out on enjoying childhood and adolescence, as well as making a contract that\'s cut her life short and will prevent her from making up for that in the future, is still very optimistic, passionate and caring towards the people around her. But Rosette isn\'t quite the shounen hero she appears to be at the start of the series, that\'s more like an image she puts up in order to convince Chrono and the others, as well as herself, that she\'s fine and it\'ll all turn well in the end. Rosette isn\'t really fine, though, her traumatic past and the fact that most of her short life was spent fighting and looking for her brother are taking a toll on her, emotionally she\'s far weaker than she lets it show and fears that she might die before saving Joshua.The series starts to show this around episode 8, when one of the Sinners, Rizelle, mentions Joshua and actually succeeds in convincing Rosette to board a train with her under the promise that she will see her brother if she goes with them. Rosette was actually willing to abandon everyone that was on her side just for a slight chance at getting to Joshua, not even caring if she could be walking alone into a trap or anything, and if Minister Remington hadn\'t stopped her at the last second, she would probably be in a much worse situation. From that episode onwards, Rosette still retains her lighthearted personality, but at the same time she also slowly starts to get gloomier, she gets visibly disturbed by seeing people die because she, more than anybody, knows how valuable life is. Around episode 16 Rosette doesn\'t resemble her earlier self all that much, she\'s more fearful of what will happen to her, especially because of the holy stigmata that started to appear on her body.The last time we see Rosette being lighthearted and having fun with her friends is on episode 18 during the festival, but even that episode has a really sad undertone as Rosette and Chrono talk about how important they are to each other and Chrono states that he does not intend to live longer than her. If this was Rosette from the earlier episodes, she would get angry at Chrono for being overdramatic and wanting to throw his life away for her, but now that she has even less time than before and got considerably less certain of her future, she reluctantly accepts his wish of dying together with her. It\'s one of my favorite scenes and shows how far they are now from the goofy pair we saw in the first couple of episodes.Then things go to hell right at the end of that episode and never go back to being lighthearted fun again... It all culminates in one of the most powerful and gut-wrenching final episodes I\'ve seen in any anime, probably the most well-known episode from this series too. However, as much as I love the final episode and have it as my favorite, I disagree with the notion of some people that it\'s ""by far"" the best episode and the rest of the series doesn\'t compare. No, the final episode is only as good as it is because of how the rest of the series built up to that conclusion, if you detach it from the rest it becomes just another tear-jerking moment and loses its impact.Final episode aside, the other characters receive quite a bit of development too, but they don\'t have as much focus as Rosette, not even Chrono. I mean, Chrono is a very good character here and has a well done arc exploring the trauma he suffers from his own past way before he met Rosette and Joshua and how it affects him in the present, but I always thought he played second fiddle to Rosette way too much. Aside from when he transforms into his true form and uses the full extent of his demon powers to fight at the cost of Rosette\'s lifespan, he\'s kind of weak and gets his ass kicked around quite a bit, and I feel it would have been more interesting to have him fight in his sealed form too instead of just being some kind of support while Rosette does the fighting. Nevertheless, it is a minor complaint, he\'s still a well-written character for the most part, my only gripe is that I wish his past with Aion, the Sinners and Mary Magdalene wasn\'t explored in just one episode, it came off as a bit rushed.Azmaria\'s character arc, unlike what people usually assume, is not about her becoming a badass fighter who can take on demons like Rosette, people often call her useless because of her fear of demons during combat, but that\'s not really the point. I mean, she does say she wants to get stronger, but she\'s still just a 12 year old girl who\'s been through a lot of grief and has zero combat experience, you don\'t just become an amazing demon hunter overnight. Azmaria\'s story is about her finding her place in the world after losing her parents to WWI at a very young age and her status as an Apostle blessed with God\'s power causing her to become a target of people who want to use her powers for their own gain, leading her to be adopted by Ricardo Hendric, one of the early villains in the series, and the band of singers with whom she traveled around the country to get killed by demons.After being Rescued by Chrono and Rosette and joining the Order, Azmaria is shown to be submissive and have an incredibly low self-esteem as she blames herself for all the tragedy that\'s happened with those around her and does not believe her own worth. Inspired by Rosette, she becomes determined to change into a better and stronger person, but of course, this is a tough road for such a young girl, so she still shows more than a few signs of weakness until later in the series when she\'s matured, so much that when Chrono is at his lowest point moping about how he\'s taken Rosette\'s life away, she\'s the one who reminds him that there\'s much more to their relationship than just him draining her life away, which puts him back on track. I just love Azmaria\'s growth from a girl who believes he\'s worthless due to only bringing misfortune to those around her to realizing she deserves to be happy, and most importantly, she is capable of bringing happines to those important to her, the Christmas episode focused on her is one of my favorite episodes because of this.Satella... Is the weakest of the main characters. Not because she\'s a bad character herself, but she\'s mostly separated from the other three doing her own business, and her arc is a bit cookie-cutter: She holds a grudge against demons because her family was slaughtered by a mysterious hornless demon who\'s taken away her older sister and is totally not Aion, and she thinks Chrono might be the one since he also doesn\'t have horns, but starts to warm up to him later and becomes friendlier towards Rosette and Azmaria too as she begins to trust them more. She\'s pretty likeable, though, and there are a couple interesting aspects to her, the parallels between her and Rosette are nice and episode 11 (one of the weaker episodes, unfortunately) at least does a good job at portraying how different their views on life and sacrifice are despite their similar struggle.A few minor characters also get some development as the series goes on, mainly Sister Kate, the leader of the Order\'s NY branch who\'s not very happy with Chrono being Rosette\'s partner in the ranks of the Order as she, along with pretty much everyone else, views demons as pure evil. Sister Kate gets a bit of Rosette\'s optimism rubbed on her and starts to appreciate Chrono as well, which leads to her defending him as an important member of the Order later in a discussion with the higher-ups when they were offered to join forces with the demons in order to fight the Sinners, who are a common enemy. I find it interesting that Sister Kate did not back off from defending Chrono and suggesting that they take this offer, even though everyone was criticizing her for it, and this experience changed quite a bit about her faith, she started to question some of the things God apparently planned for everyone, even though she still keeps believing.I wish more was done with other characters who had potential and ended up playing a relatively minor role, like Joshua, Fiore and Remington. I mean, Remington does a handful of stuff in the story, but I feel the twist regarding his actual status later in the series could have been better used. Regardless, I don\'t think there\'s any bad character to speak of here at least, just some that could have been done better and a few others that are just mediocre or forgettable.As the series goes on, it introduces a handful of plot elements: The Prophecies of Fatima, the seven Apostles, the Astral Line, which is more or less the Lifestream from Final Fantasy VII, the demons\' source of power being their horns which draw energy from the Astral Line and Chrono\'s lack of horns forcing him into using Rosette\'s life as a substitute source, we get some glimpses of the demon world Pandemonium, the mother of all demons who\'s also called Pandemonium. All of this stuff gets properly explained in the series, but I wish we got more of Pandemonium... Both Pandemoniums, since details about the demon society and how Pandemonium was ruled are pretty scarce, but what\'s been shown is at least enough for me to get what was going on: The Sinners killed Pandemonium and stole its head, throwing their society into chaos and causing them to be branded as traitors by the other demons who are still hunting them to this day.And this leads us to Aion... Who is a fairly difficult character to talk about, actually. In a sense, I guess you could say that superficially he\'s evil for the sake of being evil and embodies the most despicable aspects of any living being, but he\'s a much more nuanced take on this type of villain. Aion seems to be inspired by the prophecized Antichrist especially in the final stretch of the series, his goal is to collect the Apostles and use their power along with the head of Pandemonium to get rid of God and the system he binds the demons to, essentially using them as tools to test people\'s faith, increasing his authority as a result. Through Aion, the series puts God in a more negative perspective, as the big bad does some horrible things to everyone and asks why doesn\'t God show up to stop him if he\'s able to do so, constantly mocking and blaming God for everything. With time, you start to question the same thing, like... Yes, why doesn\'t God do something about Aion? Does he not care about what\'s happening on the Earth? Does he think humanity deserves to be tormented by Aion like that? What\'s his deal anyway? I\'m pretty sure everyone has asked questions like these before, it\'s natural that we expect an all-powerful benevolent being who created us to be able to do something about the bad things that happen.Chrono Crusade\'s portrayal of God is not necessarily that he\'s evil or that he\'s uncaring of his creations, after all he gave humanity the means to fight the demons off and even blessed a few among us with a fraction of his own power in order to assist us. But God also gave us free will, we can use the gifts he gave us in any way we want, and unfortunately cases like Azmaria\'s power being used by terrible people for their own gain happen. Even in the real world we see things like pastors using God\'s name and performing ""miracles"" just to get money out of people who are too blinded by their faith to realize that they\'re being deceived. But in Chrono Crusade\'s case, you can argue that God was actually watching all along and only decided to act when it was most convenient to him, not by personally showing up and stopping Aion, but by giving Azmaria a power boost when things got out of hand at episode 7, or giving Rosette the holy stigmata. It\'s like God is still manipulating everyone into acting according to his plan, even Aion who fails to realize it and still believes he\'s doing something that will bring an end to God.Basically, what Chrono Crusade has to say about religion and God isn\'t that they\'re bad, but that God is a mysterious figure, we don\'t know who exactly God is or what he wants, so we shouldn\'t be blinded by our faith like so many people out there end up becoming. And religion, while having many good people attached to it, can also bring out the bad aspects of other people, the final stretch of the series even shows how easily people who fell into despair can be manipulated by someone who poses themselves as some kind of holy savior to them, becoming completely oblivious to this person\'s true intentions. It\'s a much smarter way to tackle this subject than the cynical ""naw man religion bad"" message that\'s often present in japanese and even a handful of western works.The writers certainly did their homework, the way Christian lore and symbolism are incorporated into Chrono Crusade\'s plot doesn\'t feel like it was done by people who don\'t know what they\'re talking about. Even if certain liberties were taken, like demons being capable of being good and working with humans while in actual Christianity they\'re just pure unadulterated evil, but that\'s part of the themes here. Due to how they were created, demons and humans are different in nature, the former leaning towards evil and the latter towards good, but much like humans are capable of going against their nature and doing bad things, demons can do the same and perform good acts... Because, you know... Things aren\'t black and white. During the final episode, it is implied that after Rosette and Chrono died together, her soul definitely won\'t be damned to hell by God for dealing with a demon, and I think this moment makes it very clear that God also does not view things in black and white either.In any case... Chrono Crusade is still an action shounen series at heart, which makes it easy for some people to just write the more complex aspects of the plot off, because apparently a fun action shounen can\'t possibly have anything profound to say. A common criticism is that the series suffers from tonal shifts, which I agree, but they\'re not nearly as bad as they\'re made out to be. The poorly-timed bad comedy certainly helps with the tonal shifts and I\'d rather not have pervy old man boob jookes, as well as the (thankfully few) fanservice moments feel out of place. But when I see people saying the series ""suddenly"" becomes very dark in the final quarter which is supposed to be totally inconsistent with the rest of it being a lighthearted action shounen, I have to ask... What series were you watching? Because it\'s definitely not Chrono Crusade.It\'s true that the final quarter of the series is much darker than the rest, but it\'s simply not a case of a fun action series that suddenly became an apocalyptic tragedy. The dark and tragic elements of Chrono Crusade were always there since the beginning: Chrono and Rosette\'s contract slowly killing her, characters like Azmaria and Ricardo were victims of tragedy from World War I, Satella\'s family was murdered right in front of her, the story of how Rosette and Joshua met Chrono, how he was taken away by Aion and how the contract between Chrono and Rosette was form was anything but happy, there\'s the entirety of episode 7... I could go on, but I think you get what I\'m saying. As much as the series presented itself as an action shounen with some lightearted moments and episodes, it always had a dark atmosphere as well, it just didn\'t take the center stage completely until the climax from episode 18 onwards, but the progression towards a darker tone was always visible.Regardless, Chrono Crusade is a well-paced series for the most part. There\'s one episode in particular, that being episode 14, that I feel could have been cut off because it doesn\'t really offer anything of significance despite being cute and all. And really, I think the time spent in this episode could have been used instead to add more time to the events in episodes 21 to 23, because they do feel like they\'re unfolding a little too quickly, and an extra episode to cover what happens in them would certainly help. But aside from that one episode, all of the others contribute to the narrative of the series, the ones that don\'t advance the plot all that much give more insight on the characters and the setting. Speaking of setting... Yes, I think there are some historical inaccuracies, but I don\'t really care much for that kind of thing. I usually accept this kind of stuff as alternate pasts, and as long as they at least capture the feeling of whatever period in the past they\'re trying to go for I\'m fine with it, and Chrono Crusade captures the atmosphere of 1920s America very well.Production-wise... Well... It\'s a Gonzo series, which means the series can look very good for most of the time, but then in some episodes it decides to look like complete shit with off-model characters and awkward animation. Fortunately, the badly-animated episodes are a minority, and while the art and character designs may very much be a product of 2000s, they\'re all colorful and distinct, so it\'s pleasing to the eyes at least, and the scenery is fantastic, with lots of details and vivid colors to look at. Action scenes are pretty solid, demons (especially the Sinners) are pretty threatening in a sense that they seem to be invulnerable to a lot of the weaponry Rosette has and can require a bit of brains to be dealt with, I just don\'t get why they chose the demon aura color to be yellow, it doesn\'t really match them very well, but alright then.To make up for the standard Gonzo production, there\'s a gorgeous soundtrack to listen to as you watch the series unfold, the opening theme is good but standard for anime, and the ending is just amazing in its melancholy, Sayonara Solitia is one of my favorite ending tracks ever... But aside from that, the music is pretty good, it\'s largely orchestral stuff with some jazzy tracks, and my favorites being the ones that play during the sadder moments of the series, especially the one that plays in Chrono and Rosette\'s final moments, it\'s just so beautiful it hurts.This write-up has already been way longer than necessary, so I guess I should stop. I just wanted to express how much I love Chrono Crusade, it\'s not very common for me to feel touched by an anime series the same way I did with this one. I\'m not one to cry to stuff like anime, games or even movies, but the final episode of Chrono Crusade is one of the few things that made me almost shed a tear. Despite the rough edges, this is a fantastic series that manages to be fun, heartwarming, tragic and genuinely meaningful in one package. Maybe the religous elements won\'t be for everyone and I understand that, but it is what elevated Chrono Crusade from simply a good action shounen to something greater and more unique to me. Gonzo may be a hit-and-miss studio overall, but this is one of their shows that will always have a special place in my heart, I hope I\'m able to convince more people to give it a shot. to this day is pretty rare to occur in shounen anime. Both the manga and the anime series are among my favorites, but I tend to give special attention to the anime, because it is the version of Chrono Crusade that tends to get the most criticism, either from manga purists who automatically call anything that isn\'t an exact panel-to-panel adaptation of the source material garbage, or because of criticisms such as ""the whole plot is pointless because everything was for naught"" or ""the second half has an inconsistent tone and gets too convoluted"" and other things commonly said by those plebs who got caught in the filter. In fact, I disagree with the vast majority of the criticism the Chrono Crusade anime receives, as the points tend to be either straight up wrong or only partially right, and I\'ll discuss some of them in this review when it\'s relevant to talk about them.Anyway... Yup, the Chrono Crusade anime diverges from the manga, even in the first half that adapts the manga storyline, it\'s still a fairly loose adaptation: Some of the manga-adapted stories play out differently, some chapters of the manga got cut out because they\'re not relevant to the anime\'s storyline, several episodes are exclusive to the anime, and the plot in general for the second half is radically different from the source material. However, I don\'t care if a series follows its source material faithfully or not, as long as it\'s still a good story, I\'m more than willing to accept it for what it is and recommend to anyone else, as I do with the 2003 version of Fullmetal Alchemist and Bokurano, another controversial Gonzo manga adaptation that gets flak for not following the manga. Maybe I\'ll write a Bokurano review too once I stop being a lazy bastard, but not today.Sadly, though, Chrono Crusade is barely discussed nowadays, as older anime tend to fade into obscurity after everyone has already discussed everything about them, unless they\'re either famous long running shounen or provide quality shitposting material for weebs to keep on making memes and/or waifu wars for eternity, like Evangelion, Code Geass and Darling in the FranXX managed to do. Fortunately, I\'m one of those guys who remember Chrono Crusade and still think it\'s a masterpiece of a series, and since my opinion is the only objectively correct one in the entire internet, you either agree with me, or you\'re simply wrong. Now, let\'s properly dive into this series as I try my best to explain what makes it so great.Set in America fresh out of World War I and all the prosperity of the roaring 20s, Chrono Crusade tells the story of a nun called Rosette Christopher and her demon partner Chrono as they work for the Order of Magdalene, an organization created to combat the demonic threats that started to mysteriously pop up all over the country. Rosette and Chrono aren\'t just fighting demons for the sake of it, however, they\'re after Rosette\'s brother, Joshua Christopher, who was taken away by a mysterious demon called Aion and his group called the Sinners, all of which seem to share a bit of a history with Chrono.The way Chrono Crusade plays out during its first half is somewhat akin to early Fullmetal Alchemist in a sense that it\'s an action shounen with dark undertones and some comedy thrown in there so the series doesn\'t get way too gloomy... Often bad and poorly-timed comedy that honestly the series would have been better off without it. But hey, if Fullmetal Alchemist (especially Brotherhood) can get away with that shit, then so can Chrono Crusade. Regardless, the first quarter of Chrono Crusade mostly revolves around Chrono and Rosette taking up demon-hunting missions for the Order as their personalities and relationship get fleshed out and we\'re introduced to other characters, the most important ones being: Azmaria Hendric, a portuguese soprano singer who\'s also one of the seven apostles blessed with God\'s holy power, and Satella Harvenheit, a pair of breasts who\'s able to summon magical stands with her jewels, called a ""jewel witch"" in the series.One of Chrono Crusade\'s strengths is precisely the interactions between its characters, striking a perfect balance between lighthearted fun, genuinely heartwarming and sad. Chrono and Rosette are at odds with each other in many ways, her being a hot-headed energetic girl who gets in trouble easily while he\'s calm, composed and passive to a fault, the way they play off of each other and have all this bantz is pretty fun. The series does a fantastic job at showing how different their personalities are, yet at the same time how deep their borderline-romantic bond goes and how much this contract between then hurts on both sides, it\'s easy to see how important they truly are to each other despite their silly antics as they both grow as characters. Azmaria and Satella, while not having as much focus as the leading pair, still get their fair share of moments, moreso Azmaria than Satella, who unfortunately is a bit underdeveloped in here.That\'s not to say they\'re not good characters individually, each one of them develops and the character arcs they go through are very satisfying... Mostly. As I mentioned before, Satella leaves a bit to be desired due to her having significantly less screen time than the other three, but it\'s good enough to be acceptable nonetheless. The character arcs are mostly tied to the central themes of the series: Mortality, faith, loss, family, stuggling with the past, and last but not least, the concept of ""good"" and ""evil"" and how the line between those two opposites is blurrier than we believe, and all of these are more or less incorporated into the main protagonist, Rosette.The way Rosette is handled is a brilliant example of subtle characterization and development, she\'s presented as this idealistic headstrong girl who, despite having a tragic past that caused her to essentially miss out on enjoying childhood and adolescence, as well as making a contract that\'s cut her life short and will prevent her from making up for that in the future, is still very optimistic, passionate and caring towards the people around her. But Rosette isn\'t quite the shounen hero she appears to be at the start of the series, that\'s more like an image she puts up in order to convince Chrono and the others, as well as herself, that she\'s fine and it\'ll all turn well in the end. Rosette isn\'t really fine, though, her traumatic past and the fact that most of her short life was spent fighting and looking for her brother are taking a toll on her, emotionally she\'s far weaker than she lets it show and fears that she might die before saving Joshua.The series starts to show this around episode 8, when one of the Sinners, Rizelle, mentions Joshua and actually succeeds in convincing Rosette to board a train with her under the promise that she will see her brother if she goes with them. Rosette was actually willing to abandon everyone that was on her side just for a slight chance at getting to Joshua, not even caring if she could be walking alone into a trap or anything, and if Minister Remington hadn\'t stopped her at the last second, she would probably be in a much worse situation. From that episode onwards, Rosette still retains her lighthearted personality, but at the same time she also slowly starts to get gloomier, she gets visibly disturbed by seeing people die because she, more than anybody, knows how valuable life is. Around episode 16 Rosette doesn\'t resemble her earlier self all that much, she\'s more fearful of what will happen to her, especially because of the holy stigmata that started to appear on her body.The last time we see Rosette being lighthearted and having fun with her friends is on episode 18 during the festival, but even that episode has a really sad undertone as Rosette and Chrono talk about how important they are to each other and Chrono states that he does not intend to live longer than her. If this was Rosette from the earlier episodes, she would get angry at Chrono for being overdramatic and wanting to throw his life away for her, but now that she has even less time than before and got considerably less certain of her future, she reluctantly accepts his wish of dying together with her. It\'s one of my favorite scenes and shows how far they are now from the goofy pair we saw in the first couple of episodes.Then things go to hell right at the end of that episode and never go back to being lighthearted fun again... It all culminates in one of the most powerful and gut-wrenching final episodes I\'ve seen in any anime, probably the most well-known episode from this series too. However, as much as I love the final episode and have it as my favorite, I disagree with the notion of some people that it\'s ""by far"" the best episode and the rest of the series doesn\'t compare. No, the final episode is only as good as it is because of how the rest of the series built up to that conclusion, if you detach it from the rest it becomes just another tear-jerking moment and loses its impact.Final episode aside, the other characters receive quite a bit of development too, but they don\'t have as much focus as Rosette, not even Chrono. I mean, Chrono is a very good character here and has a well done arc exploring the trauma he suffers from his own past way before he met Rosette and Joshua and how it affects him in the present, but I always thought he played second fiddle to Rosette way too much. Aside from when he transforms into his true form and uses the full extent of his demon powers to fight at the cost of Rosette\'s lifespan, he\'s kind of weak and gets his ass kicked around quite a bit, and I feel it would have been more interesting to have him fight in his sealed form too instead of just being some kind of support while Rosette does the fighting. Nevertheless, it is a minor complaint, he\'s still a well-written character for the most part, my only gripe is that I wish his past with Aion, the Sinners and Mary Magdalene wasn\'t explored in just one episode, it came off as a bit rushed.Azmaria\'s character arc, unlike what people usually assume, is not about her becoming a badass fighter who can take on demons like Rosette, people often call her useless because of her fear of demons during combat, but that\'s not really the point. I mean, she does say she wants to get stronger, but she\'s still just a 12 year old girl who\'s been through a lot of grief and has zero combat experience, you don\'t just become an amazing demon hunter overnight. Azmaria\'s story is about her finding her place in the world after losing her parents to WWI at a very young age and her status as an Apostle blessed with God\'s power causing her to become a target of people who want to use her powers for their own gain, leading her to be adopted by Ricardo Hendric, one of the early villains in the series, and the band of singers with whom she traveled around the country to get killed by demons.After being Rescued by Chrono and Rosette and joining the Order, Azmaria is shown to be submissive and have an incredibly low self-esteem as she blames herself for all the tragedy that\'s happened with those around her and does not believe her own worth. Inspired by Rosette, she becomes determined to change into a better and stronger person, but of course, this is a tough road for such a young girl, so she still shows more than a few signs of weakness until later in the series when she\'s matured, so much that when Chrono is at his lowest point moping about how he\'s taken Rosette\'s life away, she\'s the one who reminds him that there\'s much more to their relationship than just him draining her life away, which puts him back on track. I just love Azmaria\'s growth from a girl who believes he\'s worthless due to only bringing misfortune to those around her to realizing she deserves to be happy, and most importantly, she is capable of bringing happines to those important to her, the Christmas episode focused on her is one of my favorite episodes because of this.Satella... Is the weakest of the main characters. Not because she\'s a bad character herself, but she\'s mostly separated from the other three doing her own business, and her arc is a bit cookie-cutter: She holds a grudge against demons because her family was slaughtered by a mysterious hornless demon who\'s taken away her older sister and is totally not Aion, and she thinks Chrono might be the one since he also doesn\'t have horns, but starts to warm up to him later and becomes friendlier towards Rosette and Azmaria too as she begins to trust them more. She\'s pretty likeable, though, and there are a couple interesting aspects to her, the parallels between her and Rosette are nice and episode 11 (one of the weaker episodes, unfortunately) at least does a good job at portraying how different their views on life and sacrifice are despite their similar struggle.A few minor characters also get some development as the series goes on, mainly Sister Kate, the leader of the Order\'s NY branch who\'s not very happy with Chrono being Rosette\'s partner in the ranks of the Order as she, along with pretty much everyone else, views demons as pure evil. Sister Kate gets a bit of Rosette\'s optimism rubbed on her and starts to appreciate Chrono as well, which leads to her defending him as an important member of the Order later in a discussion with the higher-ups when they were offered to join forces with the demons in order to fight the Sinners, who are a common enemy. I find it interesting that Sister Kate did not back off from defending Chrono and suggesting that they take this offer, even though everyone was criticizing her for it, and this experience changed quite a bit about her faith, she started to question some of the things God apparently planned for everyone, even though she still keeps believing.I wish more was done with other characters who had potential and ended up playing a relatively minor role, like Joshua, Fiore and Remington. I mean, Remington does a handful of stuff in the story, but I feel the twist regarding his actual status later in the series could have been better used. Regardless, I don\'t think there\'s any bad character to speak of here at least, just some that could have been done better and a few others that are just mediocre or forgettable.As the series goes on, it introduces a handful of plot elements: The Prophecies of Fatima, the seven Apostles, the Astral Line, which is more or less the Lifestream from Final Fantasy VII, the demons\' source of power being their horns which draw energy from the Astral Line and Chrono\'s lack of horns forcing him into using Rosette\'s life as a substitute source, we get some glimpses of the demon world Pandemonium, the mother of all demons who\'s also called Pandemonium. All of this stuff gets properly explained in the series, but I wish we got more of Pandemonium... Both Pandemoniums, since details about the demon society and how Pandemonium was ruled are pretty scarce, but what\'s been shown is at least enough for me to get what was going on: The Sinners killed Pandemonium and stole its head, throwing their society into chaos and causing them to be branded as traitors by the other demons who are still hunting them to this day.And this leads us to Aion... Who is a fairly difficult character to talk about, actually. In a sense, I guess you could say that superficially he\'s evil for the sake of being evil and embodies the most despicable aspects of any living being, but he\'s a much more nuanced take on this type of villain. Aion seems to be inspired by the prophecized Antichrist especially in the final stretch of the series, his goal is to collect the Apostles and use their power along with the head of Pandemonium to get rid of God and the system he binds the demons to, essentially using them as tools to test people\'s faith, increasing his authority as a result. Through Aion, the series puts God in a more negative perspective, as the big bad does some horrible things to everyone and asks why doesn\'t God show up to stop him if he\'s able to do so, constantly mocking and blaming God for everything. With time, you start to question the same thing, like... Yes, why doesn\'t God do something about Aion? Does he not care about what\'s happening on the Earth? Does he think humanity deserves to be tormented by Aion like that? What\'s his deal anyway? I\'m pretty sure everyone has asked questions like these before, it\'s natural that we expect an all-powerful benevolent being who created us to be able to do something about the bad things that happen.Chrono Crusade\'s portrayal of God is not necessarily that he\'s evil or that he\'s uncaring of his creations, after all he gave humanity the means to fight the demons off and even blessed a few among us with a fraction of his own power in order to assist us. But God also gave us free will, we can use the gifts he gave us in any way we want, and unfortunately cases like Azmaria\'s power being used by terrible people for their own gain happen. Even in the real world we see things like pastors using God\'s name and performing ""miracles"" just to get money out of people who are too blinded by their faith to realize that they\'re being deceived. But in Chrono Crusade\'s case, you can argue that God was actually watching all along and only decided to act when it was most convenient to him, not by personally showing up and stopping Aion, but by giving Azmaria a power boost when things got out of hand at episode 7, or giving Rosette the holy stigmata. It\'s like God is still manipulating everyone into acting according to his plan, even Aion who fails to realize it and still believes he\'s doing something that will bring an end to God.Basically, what Chrono Crusade has to say about religion and God isn\'t that they\'re bad, but that God is a mysterious figure, we don\'t know who exactly God is or what he wants, so we shouldn\'t be blinded by our faith like so many people out there end up becoming. And religion, while having many good people attached to it, can also bring out the bad aspects of other people, the final stretch of the series even shows how easily people who fell into despair can be manipulated by someone who poses themselves as some kind of holy savior to them, becoming completely oblivious to this person\'s true intentions. It\'s a much smarter way to tackle this subject than the cynical ""naw man religion bad"" message that\'s often present in japanese and even a handful of western works.The writers certainly did their homework, the way Christian lore and symbolism are incorporated into Chrono Crusade\'s plot doesn\'t feel like it was done by people who don\'t know what they\'re talking about. Even if certain liberties were taken, like demons being capable of being good and working with humans while in actual Christianity they\'re just pure unadulterated evil, but that\'s part of the themes here. Due to how they were created, demons and humans are different in nature, the former leaning towards evil and the latter towards good, but much like humans are capable of going against their nature and doing bad things, demons can do the same and perform good acts... Because, you know... Things aren\'t black and white. During the final episode, it is implied that after Rosette and Chrono died together, her soul definitely won\'t be damned to hell by God for dealing with a demon, and I think this moment makes it very clear that God also does not view things in black and white either.In any case... Chrono Crusade is still an action shounen series at heart, which makes it easy for some people to just write the more complex aspects of the plot off, because apparently a fun action shounen can\'t possibly have anything profound to say. A common criticism is that the series suffers from tonal shifts, which I agree, but they\'re not nearly as bad as they\'re made out to be. The poorly-timed bad comedy certainly helps with the tonal shifts and I\'d rather not have pervy old man boob jookes, as well as the (thankfully few) fanservice moments feel out of place. But when I see people saying the series ""suddenly"" becomes very dark in the final quarter which is supposed to be totally inconsistent with the rest of it being a lighthearted action shounen, I have to ask... What series were you watching? Because it\'s definitely not Chrono Crusade.It\'s true that the final quarter of the series is much darker than the rest, but it\'s simply not a case of a fun action series that suddenly became an apocalyptic tragedy. The dark and tragic elements of Chrono Crusade were always there since the beginning: Chrono and Rosette\'s contract slowly killing her, characters like Azmaria and Ricardo were victims of tragedy from World War I, Satella\'s family was murdered right in front of her, the story of how Rosette and Joshua met Chrono, how he was taken away by Aion and how the contract between Chrono and Rosette was form was anything but happy, there\'s the entirety of episode 7... I could go on, but I think you get what I\'m saying. As much as the series presented itself as an action shounen with some lightearted moments and episodes, it always had a dark atmosphere as well, it just didn\'t take the center stage completely until the climax from episode 18 onwards, but the progression towards a darker tone was always visible.Regardless, Chrono Crusade is a well-paced series for the most part. There\'s one episode in particular, that being episode 14, that I feel could have been cut off because it doesn\'t really offer anything of significance despite being cute and all. And really, I think the time spent in this episode could have been used instead to add more time to the events in episodes 21 to 23, because they do feel like they\'re unfolding a little too quickly, and an extra episode to cover what happens in them would certainly help. But aside from that one episode, all of the others contribute to the narrative of the series, the ones that don\'t advance the plot all that much give more insight on the characters and the setting. Speaking of setting... Yes, I think there are some historical inaccuracies, but I don\'t really care much for that kind of thing. I usually accept this kind of stuff as alternate pasts, and as long as they at least capture the feeling of whatever period in the past they\'re trying to go for I\'m fine with it, and Chrono Crusade captures the atmosphere of 1920s America very well.Production-wise...

Chrono is the back-up and the ace, Satella is the frontier.. Rosette how can I put this errr.. maybe fighting side-by-side Chrno.. It's kinda ironic because an exorcist who exterminate demons has a partner a demon.. And Chrno is the only demon I saw who pray to God.Enjoyment(10/10)Well throughout the episodes it's interesting and curiosity will run down through your veins..

Then show ends with you know who is still alive just cause and the end of the main characters story felt rushed, forced and just odd all around. This thing have so many holes in the the plot it looks like Swiss cheese. I thought I was liking this anime (even with the plot holes) to just it all ripped away in the last 4 episodes.I...can see how some people might like this but it for me just destroyed a good story and had me give it a 4/10I'd like people to watch it cause I do think some can enjoy it but this was sadly a horrible end to a great anime and destroyed it for meTo be honest it's hard to write a good review on this anime cause of the fact I loved and hated it.

Covered by the main stream horror and action anime this has its own place from almost the beginning in a way.The story is what i would call an emotional rollercoaster at times the feelings you get from watching and listening to whats happening in it is crazy coming from an anime thats got demons , exorists and what not. The original and new spin on the struggle in hell and the feelings of revenge that comes from it unleashed upon our world. Strangely if i say that about...this anime you might expect action scenes in every episode or something like it but thats were your wrong. This anime takes time to give you the story and not just the characters. There will rarely be a time for anyone to question whats happening because there is a big chance that answer will be answered through the story faster than you might think.The music captures and shows greatly how this anime is filled with a religious feel yet a demonic feel. It gives the watcher that extra edge when they listen to the fights between and hear the story comming from the different characters.The character are made to fit this anime greatly.There is never a time there i think that character doesnt fit in with the rest. From everything to the dual Main characters to the different bad guys springing forth.When i first watched this anime i got addicted from the first episode but it also gave me the hint of the emotional feelings i will always have when i revisit it.The overall joy and sadness that comes from this anime is something not found in many newer anime and this makes it its own and this anime gives you what you need. So it deserves 9/10 this anime you might expect action scenes in every episode or something like it but thats were your wrong. This anime takes time to give you the story and not just the characters.

From everything to the dual Main characters to the different bad guys springing forth.When i first watched this anime i got addicted from the first episode but it also gave me the hint of the emotional feelings i will always have when i revisit it.The overall joy and sadness that comes from this anime is something not found in many newer anime and this makes it its own and this anime gives you what you need. So it deserves 9/10', 'This is a really fun anime. I would have to say it’s like Soul Eater if it was more of a real vibe to it. I love how the language was brought back into the roaring 20’s, the English actors did a fine job working on getting the language right even if sometimes I don’t get the language. I don’t like how some of the extras sound a bit like they are in England or Scotland instead of America. This is supposed to be set in America, but I can only understand it if they were immigrants, not police or authority figures.I fell in...love with Chrono and Rosette, their fun antics and personality playing off one another sometimes makes the funniest scenes!Their outfits feel a lot like the outfits in Trinity Blood, and I think some of them look like rip offs though I don’t know if that was supposed to happen. The animation is really good, though once in a while, it does get weak once in a while. The whole show has this grungy look to it which feels like it was made to be that way with the time frame. The whole story just seems to fit with the whole story.The music is wonderful, and the opening song just gets stuck in my head with how beautiful it is. It’s a really touching song that makes me want to watch more. The ending is alright, not capturing my mind as much though. The music in the show fits the mood well, giving the comical parts an addition as well as the more serious parts. The Voice acting is nice and as I said before, they really did take the time to learn the language that was used then. I don’t care much for Sister Kate though. It just seems too whiny a lot. love with Chrono and Rosette, their fun antics and personality playing off one another sometimes makes the funniest scenes!Their outfits feel a lot like the outfits in Trinity Blood, and I think some of them look like rip offs though I don’t know if that was supposed to happen.

She's not really an original character, as with the most girls, she's very protective and thinks first about...others than herself. But I don't think the characters are bad or something, 'cause they're good, but it could have been better.I really enjoyed this serie, (not all the time, some moments were very sad) but it's easy to watch at it.

An anime that\'ll take memory for the rest of my life', '""Chrono Crusade"" is an anime with an interesting and engaging story. The series follows the adventures of exorcist Rosette Christopher and Chrono, her demonic working partner, as they try to defeat demons that infest the world. The story is set in the 1920s and skillfully blends historical, religious, and fantasy elements.One of the strengths of the anime is definitely its atmosphere. The series has a strong emotional and dramatic charge, with moments of action, suspense, and sadness.Another strength of the anime is its ability to create a coherent and believable world. The series is set in the 1920s in the U.S.A., in an America where...demons are a threat to humanity. This setting has been well-crafted and enriched with historical details. These elements give the series a realistic tone, making it more engaging for the viewer.The characters are also well-developed and characterized. Rosette Christopher, the protagonist, is an exorcist belonging to the Order of Magdalene, an organization that deals with fighting demons. Rosette is a very charismatic and fascinating character, with a strong sense of justice and a lot of emotions. Chrono, her demonic partner, is an intriguing character who shows a dark side of his personality, but also great loyalty and affection for Rosette.In the first part of the series, the tone is lighthearted and fun, with numerous comedic inserts and light moments. The comical situations and gags are often used to lighten the tension and sense of anguish that pervade the series.In the second part, however, the tone becomes more serious and dark, with a more dramatic and oppressive atmosphere. The series focuses more and more on the fight against demons and the sacrifices that the characters must face to achieve their goals, with greater attention to the plot and the characters\' stories.The contrast between the two parts of the series may seem a bit abrupt or surprising to some viewers, as the transition from a cheerful tone to a darker one is rather sudden. However, this contrast contributes to emphasizing the importance of the themes addressed in the series and to giving greater emotional weight to the characters\' stories.Unfortunately, due to the time elapsed, I do not have a precise memory of the soundtrack of the work, however, the opening of the series is undoubtedly one of its strengths, able to immediately capture the viewer\'s attention.However, the plot can be confusing in some points, and the story has some holes and unclear moments that can cause confusion and hinder a full understanding of the plot.Overall, ""Chrono Crusade"" is a well-made anime with an engaging story and fascinating characters. Although it is not perfect, it has a unique atmosphere that makes the viewing experience very satisfying. I recommend this series to those looking for an anime with a dramatic plot and a strong emotional component.It should be noted, however, that the representation of Christianity in the work is obviously not accurate or realistic. As Christianity is an important theme of the work, some representations and interpretations may be offensive to more conservative Christian believers. Therefore, if you are a very devoted and sensitive person on these topics, you should avoid watching ""Chrono Crusade"". demons are a threat to humanity.

It is not what you expect at first. It’s very hard to describe, but it has this subtle brilliance to it that you notice here and there while watching it, but you really only understand it fully in the last episode when it’s already over, and then you start to cry. But there is more than just this to Chrno Crusade for me personally as I have an interesting relationship with this anime, so I also have a special emotional attachment to this series that I don’t have to many other anime. I will start off...the review by explaining my relationship with Chrno Crusade. You can skip that part if you want to, but personally I feel that it is important as to why I like this anime so much.So, the year is 2014, the location is Härjedalen, Sweden, close to the Norwegian border. I’m around 10 years old and we’re on skiing vacation. We’re at our cabin and I’m browsing youtube on my iPad when suddenly I see this cool-looking AMV for the song “Hard Rock Hallelujah” by Lordi, so I clicked it. Now of course the song is good, but what really struck me as amazing was the visuals. I was seeing these badass angel/demon-looking beings and “battle nuns” shooting guns and all. I was completely mesmerized, it was one of the most amazing pieces of media I had ever seen. It felt as if it was made just for me. I made it a point in my head to watch these movies/tv-series. I looked at the description to see if they mentioned the used anime, and there it said: Animes: Chrono Crusade, Trinity Blood, Black Heaven. But, at the time I didn’t watch anime or any tv-series really, so I had no idea where to watch any of these series, and not yet smart enough to find out where I could, so I put it on my memory and moved on with my life.Fast forward to 2020, I’m sitting at home with over 80 anime under my belt and several years of active watching. I suddenly remember the badass AMV I saw all those years ago and decided to finally watch some anime from it. I however didn’t remember any of the anime mentioned in the video, so I had to find it again, which fortunately was very easy and one of the top results on youtube when searching “Hard Rock Hallelujah AMV”. I clicked it and looked at the description where, just as before, three anime were listed. I looked them all up on MAL and found Chrno Crusade the most appealing and thus decided to watch it. Starting to watch it gave me a strange feeling, almost divine, but I didn’t really know what to make of the feeling, so I just kept on watching.Now I’m finished explaining my interesting relationship to Chrno Crusade, so after this will be the review part:The story is a 9 in my opinion, it’s pretty good and an important part of what makes Chrno Crusade Chrno crusade, but not the biggest part. It’s enough to captivate you and make you pay attention to the series, and it carries with it part of the subtle brilliance of Chrno Crusade that really makes it so special.Animation gets a 7. It’s nothing special really. I don’t know how animation was in 2003 since I didn’t exist back then, but judging from other series from that time I’d say it’s average. It never bothered me so I have really no reason to complainSound gets an 8. I like the OST, and the Opening and Ending themes are pretty solid too. The overall sound in the series is average. Nothing really special about the voice acting, but nothing bad either, so no complaints there either, just nothing special.The characters is one part where this anime excels. I give it a 10 in terms of characters. All characters are there for a reason and even the supporting characters catch your attention and makes you think. The series is also really good at explaining and building the relationships between all the characters and how they work together to make the story work. I’m not going to spoil anything here, so I’ll just say that the characters and the way they are built up works together with the story to really make this anime something special.Enjoyment is probably a 8, since it’s very interesting to watch. It’s kinda hard to explain, but watching the series gives off a special vibe, that keeps you watching. It has cool characters and cool symbolism that works really well to make this an enjoyable watch.But, here’s the thing: the only ones of these above that really matters are the story and characters. Animation, sounds and enjoyment makes only a very small difference in a series like this as long as they are average or good enough, which they are.What really makes Chrno Crusade so good is Characters, Story, but most of all its subtle brilliance. Chrno Crusade is one of those anime that as I’ve said before drops small hints about its brilliance now and then, and in the end it all adds up and you finally understand it, the brilliance of the work of art that is Chrno Crusade. The final episode just wraps everything up so smoothly and beautifully, you suddenly fully understand the whole story, all the characters and its core message, and then the tears come. You now finally know what this anime wanted to tell you and what everything in it means. Your mind gets run over by these realizations, and you get the importance and sheer beauty of every small detail in the series, and it’s first now that you notice how close you’ve grown to the story and how important it is to you, and be wary, it WILL make you cry. A lot. It simply is a pure work of art by someone who knows what they are doing. I’d say its brilliance is similar to that of “Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu”, but not the same.  This together with my emotional attachment to this series that comes from it being one of the things that very early in my life gave me the interest that I have for the supernatural and such, this anime personally really is something special. There’s also how good this anime tackles religion and society, which I really enjoyed watching and reflecting over. I really like anime that tackles advanced subjects like this that make you think and reflect upon what you’ve seen. It’s a really good experience watching if you, like me, think a lot. The way you see society change because of the deed of a devil that can only be stopped by God but at the same time is part of God really makes your mind pin and think in new ways it hasn’t thought in before about a complicated subject like this.All in all, this anime really fit me well. It fell right into my mind and really resonated well with how I work as a person. So if you are like me: Eccentric, have an overactive mind and slightly schizophrenic, chances are that you’ll love this anime just as much as I do.Overall rating: 9. the review by explaining my relationship with Chrno Crusade.

It is now November, a few weeks after finishing this anime, and I feel as though I must urge potential viewers not to make the same mistake I did all those months ago, lest you miss out on an outstanding anime.Don't judge it by the first episode.The first episode pales in comparison to the next 23. I finished Chrno Crusade and for a while all I could do was stare at the screen in awe.I'm putting on a big dramatic air here, but I really did feel as though this was what a perfect...anime felt like.The story. The characters. The stakes.It was done perfectly.Rosette is a STRONG character. She might come off as being erratic and irresponsible at first glance, but throughout the series I really came to understand just how deep her feelings of dedication, duty and loyalty towards finding her brother were. And when mixed with the bittersweet story of how she and Chrno ended up being intimately linked with each other made for an anime that you know is only going to end with tragedy.If you love this anime, you will cry.Some people might not think that Chrno's backstory was covered enough for the story to make sense. Sometimes it might seem like he's just a plot-convenient piece to be moved when it fits. But I think that enough was mentioned for me to get the overall picture without the story suddenly revolving around his angsty backstory. Certainly, his motivations about how he came to work with Rosette and the Magdalene Order are important, but this is a story about Rosette, her personal mission, and the short amount of time that she had in order to accomplish it.If you've come here looking for romance, then take a pass. There *are* moments that pass between Rosette and Chrno, but it most certainly isn't the focus of this anime (at least from my perspective). It is subtle at times, but very sweet. Just thought I'd mention it, in case you were wondering. The moments that did pass were very bittersweet and there is one image in particular in the last episode that I just can't get out of my head.The other characters, Azmaria and Satella make for an interesting pair. Azmaria gives strong Wendy (Fairy Tail) vibes but she's very sweet when she isn't getting in the way. Satella also has someone she wants to find, and she bonds with Rosette over this throughout the episodes.Action is good, the suspense is good. There are even comedy parts to lighten the mood when needed. Chrno Crusade's strongest point is its dramatic side.Some people have complained about how it ended, but I suspect that is only because it wasn't the happy ending 'all the bad guys are dead so let's move on now' that they wanted and expected. I thought it was satisfying and again, bittersweet. That word is how I would describe the entire series.I was fascinated by the impact that religion has on the overall plot which continued to intrigue me as time went on.Again, I must stress the point. Don't give this up if the first episode bores you - it has much more to offer if you let it.I went from watching one episode in 5 months, to watching all of them in one day. It is a hidden gem that deserves to be in my top anime list. anime felt like.The story. The characters. The stakes.It was done perfectly.Rosette is a STRONG character.

And, also, one of those few that I simply wanted to scream.... not of joy but of despair!The story starts to follow the main manga plot, some small changes here and there, but mostly understandable... But when it came to the end...That's when all hell brakes loose! A real disappointment. IF you've read the manga, please don't waist your time seeing the last few episodes.The only good thing must have been the opening music, a real treat. "", 'My quick review: Extremely good show! Would recommend. If you get into it you will cry.But I\'m not writing this review solely about the show.Here is a youtube comment I found from a dude named ""Joe Xephon"" about the ed that needs more attention:In my Opinion Sayonara Solitaire Is one of the most Beautiful songs ever written and I think It Fits so perfect with this scene and This entire Anime series. The entire scene itself hits the feels hard and makes you so sad you cry, then when it shows Rosette and Chrno Smiling on the bench swing at the very...end, The Nature of what you were originally feeling just seems to shift into something much different and beautiful then sadness. It makes you realize just how short life actually is. So much so that you need to make the most of not just everyday, but every hour you have Even if you live to a ripe old age. However it also tries to instill (and this is my opinion) how much more important our relationships and our impact on those we form these relationships with are, more then how long you actually live. To me personally it is so much more important to find a companion, that one person we all want to find and be found by, to join us on this twisting, turning, roller-coaster that\'s called life. (After all, it\'s always more fun to ride a roller-coaster with a companion than riding alone is it not?) Again This is just my personal opinion and the feels of this video got me wanting to comment. I love this series. end, The Nature of what you were originally feeling just seems to shift into something much different and beautiful then sadness.

However it also tries to instill (and this is my opinion) how much more important our relationships and our impact on those we form these relationships with are, more then how long you actually live. To me personally it is so much more important to find a companion, that one person we all want to find and be found by, to join us on this twisting, turning, roller-coaster that\'s called life. (After all, it\'s always more fun to ride a roller-coaster with a companion than riding alone is it not?) Again This is just my personal opinion and the feels of this video got me wanting to comment. I love this series.', ""STORY (8)Although I though the story was pretty unique, I found that most of it was highly predictable. If not that, it was a bit confusing. It almost seemed like the anime had skipped scenes, because it didn't have an easy flow to follow. It felt rather choppy to me at times. The superb ending to this anime was its saving grace.ART (7)Nothing special, but it was appealing visually. The art was not compelling, but it also wasn't cheaply or poorly done. It was solid animation.SOUND (8)Now... I watched the English dub. Many people would murder me for this, but I actually enjoy not...having to read my shows every once in a while. I can focus more on the animation and action this way. I really loved the fact that accents were involved, mainly Satella's great German accent. I loved Chrono's voice actor as well. My only complaint is that Rosette's voice was pretty annoying.CHARACTER (9)Most of the characters were wonderful and developed. Although I simply could not stand Joshua. I became very bored and annoyed with scenes centered on him. Overall, seemed like a nearly useless character. I loved Chrono and Rosette, though. Satella topped as my favorite, hoever.OVERALL (7)Definitely a good anime. I would give it a 7.5 if I could. ALMOST an 8, if it weren't for the confusion I mentioned before. I'm really glad I stuck with this anime until the ending, because it was wonderfully executed. I would recommend Chrono Crusade. having to read my shows every once in a while.

I won't be in romance with most of the series, because I've seen them years ago; including this one.Chrno or Chrono Crusade is a Christian tale about a demon (Chrno) and a pact he makes with the heroine (Rosette Christopher).  Rosette and company is in the business of busting demons, until she falls in love with one.It's a well written narrative, being comedic at times.  It has some off color humor, and hints at corruption within religions.  The series shines in its comedy, heart, and the...relationships between the characters.  This tale takes the stance that time is of the essence and to make the most of the time we have.It's an older anime and from sometimes unpraised Studio Gonzo (they deserve more praise).

The Anime follows Chrono a demon and Rosette a nun around on their journey trying to find Rosette's brother Joshua. The adventure take them to new characters, like Azmaria, and Satella. The final six episodes are truly some of the best anime you'll ever see. The pure emotion put into the last six episodes was amazing, and the...final episode was just so sad to watch.

Let's start off with the review of the story. Don't let the christian connotations put you off, Chrno Crusade just skims the most intriging parts of the religion. Good for some, but not others, Chrno Crusade doesn't emphasise too strongly at the romantic connection between Chrno and Rosette until near the end of the series; but even then the writeers expertly twists their relations to bring tension and awe to the viewers.The art: very effective. Although there are killing and blood, the gore is not too explicit (again, good for some, not...others). A large variety of facial expressions used effectively on each characters. Very nice landscape art too, especially ones of the lake... There's just the right amounts of darkness and holyness in the anime (i meant it in terms of art, not content)Definately my favorite anime opening song. OSTs are also used very well in the anime to perfecly suit each scene.Character. Can't really talk too much about them without giving away spoilers. Protangonists are not overly holy.

I only just remembered its existence only recently because of the main theme song ""Tsubasa wa Pleasure Line"" being a favorite of mine.What had me discover this little gem was way back in the day when the ""Sci-Fi Network"" had an actual anime block called, ""Ani-Mondays"". This was long before Crunchyroll was really a well known service so most of the shows I\'d ever watch would be on television.  The block itself consisted of other titles like ""Gundam...00"", ""Gurren Lagann"", and even ""Rave Master"". Thinking back, putting the words ""Sci-Fi Network"" and ""Anime"" together was truly a weird thing to behold.What had me so attached to this particular show on the block was one specific reason: the writing holds no fear. Trying to even remotely compare the beginning to the end will have you absolutely stunned at how the script progresses into a bitter sweet web of reality.  It has a weird similarity to that of ""Cowboy Bebop"" where you have so many fun loving plot threads within that  makes you completely forget about how serious the story actually is.And let me tell you..Chrono Crusade works great in such a format.  It  broke my heart to see the main leads ""Chrono"" and ""Rosette"" specifically go from such a wacky goofy duo to devoted partners with an honest acceptance of what may be in their world.  They both do something that can be a rarity sometimes  in current anime: grow up psychologically together.  I never felt like either one of them was left behind for the sake of making the opposite protagonist look better.  By the end, all I had was endless tears with a nod of acceptance on what the Author was aiming for. I got the message right before the last heart warming scene played.Do keep in mind, the manga and anime share completely different endings as they drift apart after roughly volume 4.  However.. both have an interesting reflection from one another that is worth checking out.Overall: Chrono Crusade will forever rest in my heart as a show that gave me a better understanding on why life can be so difficult. Its a series that really stands a heavy message on facing the worst that reality can offer but still finding a stepping stone through it.  It gives an excellent perspective that nothing can be perfect but it doesn\'t mean we can\'t try to find something at least close to it. 00"", ""Gurren Lagann"", and even ""Rave Master"".

One positive mentioned about this anime was regarding the historical events that it portrayed. As a reminder, Chrono Crusade is set in the 1920s in New York. The writers took care to add historical events to this anime, and that was appreciated. To go along with that, the group found it interesting to see the Japanese take on Western culture and religion. Another positive was regarding the magic system in the anime. It was an intriguing system for some of the group. Lastly, the finale of the series was greatly seen as a positive by the group. I will not give it away, but it was the consensus that the ending was appropriate.The main negative review was regarding the slow progression of the story. It was mentioned that the story could have been told in 12 episodes, but was instead extended to 24 episodes. That being said, for somebody that truly enjoys the story, the more episodes the better. However, the slow progression seemed to impact the group’s interest in the anime negatively. Another negative was regarding a lack of interest in many of the characters. There were many characters in the show, but many of them lacked development, being one dimensional throughout the series. Being a 24 episode series, there was plenty of time to develop and add backstory to the characters. By the end of the series, there were simply few characters that we were invested in.There were mixed feelings regarding the use of religion in the series. Some group members found it to be overdone while others found the use of historical references in religion fascinating.Overall, Chrono Crusade was fairly polarizing for the group.

It's very solid with some unique aspects.Story: 8/10Well, you start with a nun, that also works as an exorcist at the Magdalene Order and her assistant,  a demon called Chrno. In the beginning the story seems funny and has a comedic touch on it. however, as you progress with the show, Rosette gets more companies and you'll see more and more of the sad story, some nice flashbacks, interesting subplots and an unique ending.Animation: 8/10We are in the 1920s, so the people, clothing and scenerys are like then. The...people wear hats and suits, the cars seem very old and the houses have this typical gothic-style, you know. The only thing, that disappointed me, were the main characters. Sometimes they just looked too shiny to be in the 1920s.Sound: 7/10The themes fitted in every situation, but it was nothing memorable. The OP was fine and ED just fitted too well. It was happy, but on the same time it was melancholic. Only Azmaria's singing was a bit annoying. Everytime she sang, her voice just seemed to change suddenly.Character: 8/10The characters are fine, like they are. Some of them are more, some are less deeper. However, almost every single character develops in it's own way. The canon pairings are fine and the characters don't overact. The twists of the characters were nice, though.Enjoyment: 7/10It was hard to go through the first episodes, but then, the story gets very enjoyable. In almost every episode you get answers and new questions. That works very fine, it's the same with the twists.Overall: 8/10It takes time for the story, but if you are over the first episodes, it gets only better. people wear hats and suits, the cars seem very old and the houses have this typical gothic-style, you know.

The art is not something very beautiful, but it's probably my favourite one. I love the characters, Chrono, Rosette and Azmaria most.

Never thought I would say that.  I discovered this show one night at like 2 in the morning on the syfy channel.  I thought it looked pretty cool, so I decided to look it up.  I was not expecting it to be what it was though.  The first couple episodes make it seem like it's not going to take itself very seriously.  It seemed like just a fun anime.  If you can get past the beginning, though, man things get real.  The story is very grounded in...religion which I really like.  I really liked all of the main characters and thought they were really well done.  This one will also bring a surprising amount of feels to the surface too.  So, if you think a strong, plot driven, religious based anime sounds interesting you should definitely check this one out. religion which I really like.

"", ""O.K so this will probably be my only review for an anime.  But what I say from Chrno Crusade is something I could barely comprehend.  I was enjoying the first 10 episode, then from 11-18 i was extremly bored.  From 18+ it was very enjoyable again, but for an anime like this to have an ending like that.  It was too much, i believe that the creator should have put a little more thought.  I realize I should not write about spoilers but it is hard when the part i feel most strongly about will be a spoiler.  I...can understand the ending but on the other hand it terrifys me.  To think that you could go through 24 episodes just to end on a crappy note.  I have yet to like an animes ending partially because I don't want to see it end, and partially because I believe it can be fixed.  Chrno Crusade is no exception, from my perspective the ending was poorly done.  Before all you haters who obviously gunna hate tell me, what was so amazing about it?  Why would you make that choice?  I will give you an answer to why I am right. can understand the ending but on the other hand it terrifys me.  To think that you could go through 24 episodes just to end on a crappy note.

When I finished watching Chrno Crusade a began thinking about Christian religion, and about god.And it also made me realize how importent life is and every moment we spend with our love one's. And it show's that every love story can't have a happy ending.Rosette reminded me a lot of Naruto. She has a sorten glow to her that changes other people opinion on her and they begin to care about her. And she never gives up and never go's back on her word, and she could be very stupid sometimes. She was a strong woman,...and that made me as a viewer care what happened to her.

It was kind of interesting to watch how other people would react to him, because he was a demon between humans.At first the story was very normal for me, like every other anime, but it was still...enjoyable to watch. But even though I already enjoyed it quite a bit, it became just more and more interesting as I watched the episodes. I didn't think that there would be a story like that behind it, and I really liked the story they came up with.The art was kind of good, I really liked how the characters looked and I liked their personalities. I actually almost liked everyone, and that doesn't happen that often. Well, I admit that I once again didn't like everyone, but I liked the most of them. Their voices were good and they didn't annoy me. I actually really liked it when Azmaria screamed, because she has a scream that you actually wouldn't really expect.

I actually almost liked everyone, and that doesn't happen that often. Well, I admit that I once again didn't like everyone, but I liked the most of them.

I won't say much because I don't wanna spoil anyone's fun here, but don't be fooled by the first episodes, it will get better. A lot. "", ""Chrno Crusade is a story filled with supernatural battles featured around Heaven, Earth, and the Devils. The story goes as far as philosophizing doubts of Heaven and the sins of Devils. This in turn either empowers your faith in the Almighty or otherwise. Needless to say, faith always prevails.The story follows a young girl in the Magdalan order. An order of sisters who dish out punishment to Devils. The story is kind of playful in this concept and can lead to intense battles and situations with these Devils. Obviously, Devils are powerful and bloodthirsty and not easy to take down.As the episodes progress, the...plot line does as well and certain elements of the story fall into place.

Without giving too much away, the story revolves around a headstrong Order Sister, named Rosette, who seeks her missing sibling. She does this alongside her companion, Chrono. Honestly, characters are a strong point in this anime. They and the supporting characters each have their own unique aspects, and only grow more dimensional as the series continues.The story initially seems serious, but it's so much more. It's a perfect mix of comedy/shounen/drama. You'll smile in its lighthearted moments, sit on the edge of...your seat during battle, and tear up (if you're emotional) in the more dramatic moments.Overall, it's fast paced but captivating.

I'll just say that it doesn't deviate much from the manga (which I personally judged negatively) and presents the same problems. However, this doesn't persist throughout the entire work.Here and there, in the first approximately 17 episodes, some modifications have been made, but more or less the story remains the same. Towards the end, however, the work changes completely compared to the original piece, starting to conclude some subplots much earlier than in the manga, which continue until the end, and then taking a completely different direction.The characters do undergo some...development, nothing impressive, but it's actually there. But the most interesting thing is another.In the path the work takes, it uses its components to address the theme of the danger associated with using religion as a tool for one's own purposes, and it succeeds reasonably well in its intent.I can say I was also slightly satisfied with the ending, which manages to be melancholic and unsettling, but at the same time, in its own way, heartwarming. development, nothing impressive, but it's actually there.

I enjoyed it mostly for that. I think the author had a thing for nuns. Mixing religious themes with countless suggestive scenes and Edward's inappropriate behavior, which was borderline molestation, was amusing to watch. I also liked the themes of angels and demons.In terms of the story and excitement, it is clear that this anime is dated. Like many anime from the early 2000s, it is largely unremarkable and doesn't leave you with a burning desire to watch the next episode right away. While it may not have many...innovative elements from today's perspective, there are some surprising twists and an ending that I couldn't predict - both of which are pluses for the story. I appreciate the basic idea of good and evil working together, which is executed well in this anime.I enjoyed the drawing style, especially considering the age of the anime. There isn't anything particularly bad about it, but it doesn't stand out either.After 24 episodes, the soundtrack becomes repetitive, as only three pieces of music are used for three different types of scenes. However, the opening and ending theme songs are among the better ones. Having an outstanding opening song is always a plus for any show, in my opinion.The main character, Rosette, was why I stayed with the series. She is likable, undergoes understandable development, and has a significant character arc despite the relatively short length of the series. I also appreciated seeing Rosette in little clothing during and after battles, and I understand that this is a matter of personal preference.

I personally dropped it 2-3 times before episode 12 and decided to come back and finish it out of the blue one day.Animation: Holds up really well if you excuse the 4:3 aspect ratio.Characters: They're actually pretty good and likable.Story: The story is pretty good for the first 8-10 episodes and maybe a few more in the middle. Sadly though around episode 16-19 the story begins to drag heavily feeling similar to One Piece. The last episodes get worse becoming even slower and more drawn out but if...you manage to hold out until the last episode you'll realize it was 100% NOT worth it in the slightest.Many of the fights are very anticlimactic and poorly paced, and the ending feels very shoe-horned and odd (in a bad way) leaving you with a very bitter taste in your mouth knowing so much could have been done and that this probably wasn't the intended ending.This sentence is now obsolete due to very strict spoiler criteria: Due to the ending, explaining why it's so bad without spoiling it is incredibly difficult (for me at least) so you'll either have to watch it or trust me (one of the few who didn't like it).

Eikoku Koi Monogatari Emma,https://myanimelist.net/anime/345/Eikoku_Koi_Monogatari_Emma,"[""Title: Victorian Romance EmmaManga/Novels: Victorian Romance Emma began as a manga by self-professed Anglophile Kaori Mori, and ran in Monthly Comic Beam from August 30th, 2002 to April 12th, 2006.  The manga won an Excellence Prize at the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2005.  CMX has licensed the manga Stateside, and the fourth of eight volumes was released June 20th of this year.  The manga has ended its run in Japan, but Kaoru Mori continues to publish side stories (known as Emma Bangaihen), and is set at eleven side stories, the ninth of which was released recently.  The manga is known...to have something of a cult following and apparently has an Emma-inspired/themed caf&Atilde;&copy; in Shibuya to it's name.Saori Kumi has also done novel adaptations of the manga, and two volumes were released in 2005.The anime was done by Studio Perrot (famous for Bleach, Midori no Hibi and Blood+) and directed by Tsuneo Kobayashi (who also directed The Twelve Kingdoms), and ran on TV from April 2nd, 2005 to June 18th, 2005.  The Right Stuf International announced its Stateside licensing of Emma and it's second season (Victorian Romance Emma: The Second Act, which is not covered in this review) on June 30th, and plans to release it solely with subs and in a box set; a release date has not been announced at this time.Story: The story kicks off with William Jones, a member of the gentry, visiting his old governess unexpectedly.  Because he stands almost right in front of the door, he gets knocked off his feet (literally and figuratively) by the governess' maid, Emma, when she opens the door.  And I'm betting that you can probably guess what happens based on the series' title, albeit with some added angles.But one of the many things that makes this series stand out is the slow pacing of the romance.  For some, it's going to be agonizingly slow (it takes William half the series to offer to take her out somewhere, and just over that for him to actually do so and kiss her while he's at it, which, at that point, is considered leaps and bounds), but for me, it's just right, especially with the sweetness and fluffiness of it all.  I guarantee that you will be grinning like an idiot as you watch it develop.With regards to faithfulness to its manga source: I've only got the first volume of the series to my name at this point in time, but from what I saw, the series was extremely faithful to the source, down to the angles of certain scenes.Another thing that makes me absolutely adore this series is the way that the series invests you in every single one of the characters.  It's a rare series that actually makes you feel - really, honestly care -- for characters that are clearly supposed to be &quot;in the way&quot;.  One of the best examples of this is Elanor, a girl of the gentry who is clearly meant to be &quot;the other woman&quot;, and one of the the odd ones out in the triangle... square... thingy.  But you honestly feel sorry for her, because she's just as much in love with William as he and Emma are with each other, and it's her first love, and it just absolutely sucks that it's unrequited on her end, and that she's clearly wasting her time with William.  And the way that it does Emma's past would have seemed Sue-ish and annoying in any other show, but doesn't here.But the thing that makes this series absolutely shine is the historical accuracy.  Apparently, Kaoru Mori hired a historical consultant (Rico Murakami) from the third volume of the manga on to ensure accuracy; Murakami was also hired for the anime, and it shows.  The subs I watched also included little historical notes at the end of each episode to explain unfamiliar/obscure things to the average viewer.  Murakami and Mori released a companion guide (Emma Victorian Guide) that does the same thing.And this historical accuracy holds, even in the resolution of the show.  Shoujo diehards are probably going to absolutely hate the ending (don't worry; there's the second season if you dislike the ending that much), because it doesn't hold to shoujo standards.  But you know what?  After how historically accurate the series was, it wouldn't have seemed right for things to turn out any other way.Art: This is one of the places where faithfulness to the manga holds.  Pierrot's animation, which is beautiful in and of itself, is barely different at all from the art style that Kaoru Mori used in the manga.  As such, it's just like watching the manga come to life in front of your eyes.  Even details down to the angle of certain scenes from the manga hold, which makes seeing your favorite scenes from the manga that much more awesome.Music: Emma has a unique OP and ED, in that none of them have any vocals to them; it's all just instrumentals.  But the thing is that they're still very memorable, even without lyrics.  I prefer the OP (which is so calming that I've been using to get to sleep lately) over the ED (which sounds fairly circus-y).The music for the series itself consists of a lot of variations on the OP and ED, but has its share of original music, too.  And every bit of it is beautiful, especially in the way that it uses strings and piano.  And I'd be willing to bet that every bit of it could easily fit in the Victorian Period.Seiyuu: There aren't any particular standout roles in this series, but on the other hand, there aren't any that suck terribly.  Just a fairly standard set of voices.  No problems on my end.Dub: N/ALength: Twelve episodes seems like a perfect length for this series.  There's not any push to rush the series along, and it doesn't plod along, even though the story goes at a slower pace than most series.  It's at just the right pace.For those who didn't like the ending, or want more Emma, there is the second season that I've mentioned throughout this review (Victorian Romance Emma: The Second Act).  However, know going into it that subs only go up to the ninth episode, because of its licensing.Overall: This is far from your standard shoujo series.  The historical accuracy, which adds in a defiance of typical shoujo standards, and the way it invests you in every one of its characters make it shine.  The slower pacing of the episodes and the romance feels just right, and the faithfulness to the manga source in story and art style are a real treat.  The music and seiyuu add the icing on the cake.This is one of my top five recommended series.  See it.

Forbidden love is nothing new, but that doesn't mean this series is bland in any respect, there are plenty of dealings to keep the story lively.

But I can safely say of the few romance animes I've watched so far, Victorian Romance Emma is my favorite of them all.Story: 9The story is really simple it reminded me of Cinderella with just some alterations. Rich young man meets beautiful maid, falls in love with her and goes after her. Due to the difference in their statuses, various problems arise. One thing I liked about the story is that it didn't feel like your typical japanese anime. I felt that...it had a more western feel to it which was refreshing. The situations in the story are not far-fetched and are believable that it can happen.Art: 9Since I'm fascinated with culture, this anime impressed me because its depictions of London during its time were accurate. For its kind of anime, the creator did a good job of depicting Victorian London.Sound: 9The music suits the anime well. Nothing too fancy about it. Just like the laid back atmosphere of the anime, the music is also laid back and supports the scenes well.Character: 9The characters are the foundation of a great story. The 2 main characters are what made this story great because its a romance story. The reason that I said earlier in my review that this had a western feel to it is that in this anime, the man courts and asks the woman out. So far, in most of the romance animes I've watched, the girl confesses to the guy she likes (which I think is very wrong). In my opinion, a guy should be the first to make the move to a girl he's interested in. The male main character did this and this is why I admire him.Enjoyment: 10I really enjoyed this anime. It's unlike any other animes I've seen so far. Even with its simple premise, it was still interesting for me. Another factor that made me enjoy this anime was the accurate and detailed depiction of Victorian London. It gave me an idea of what life was like during the Victorian era. One of my favorite scenes in the anime was when they went to the beach (I forgot if it happened in this season or in the sequel). It was a learning experience to see what nobles usually do during their era when they went to the beach.Overall: 10I gave it a 10 because this anime was worth watching and was memorable. I highly recommend it for a change of pace of what you normally watch.I'm too lazy to write another review for its sequel so here's a short review. The sequel was also very good and a little better than its predecessor because new characters were introduced. Since its a sequel, you must watch it to conclude the story.

However, that didn't last long. The romance seemed a little dragged out, and although I did enjoy it, I think it moved to slow to keep the interests of the majority of the anime-watching population.The art, I actually became fond of it after a couple episodes. The faces seemed a bit too round for my tastes, and sometimes looked a bit big, but after a while it seems perfectly fine. I do have to say, I've never seen so many...blonds in a show before.The beginning theme was very intriguing. It was soothing, almost like a lullaby, but something that lifted your spirits rather than making you drowsy. I think it was very well composed.Once again, it moved slowly, even with only 12 episodes. You get a feel for who the characters are, but they don't change very much. Static characters aren't necessarily bad, but I prefer characters who go through ordeals that noticeably change them. The protaganists to change some what, but I don't think they made it obvious enough to emphasize the amount of emotion involved. And on the subject of emotion, Emma seemed completely void of them sometimes. I don't want her to be a whiny little baby, but I certainly don't want her going around with such a usual serious face when supposedly she's gotten her heart broken for the first time. blonds in a show before.The beginning theme was very intriguing.

Spoilers shall be avoided! English is not my native language - mistakes in grammar shall be made!*I love history - especially the European, and Victorian history! I love romance - presumed it\'s done with passion, care and interest! That being said, Monogatari Emma should\'ve been almost perfect watch for me, but sadly... the ever-so short twelve-episodes seasons are just the tip of the iceberg, in what this anime seemingly refused to do right for me!Story (4)The story is... well, it\'s not good! It is actually so bland, unimaginative and uninspired, that I could easily call it the Twilight-level of horribleness,...and wouldn\'t blink an eye, while saying so! If I would give some random 15-year-old girl a book about Victorian era, told her to read it, then write a love story that takes place on that said era, Monogatari Emma would be exactly what I would get! And what saddens me even more is that... this is almost exactly the same story, that I would\'ve writen myself... with the atmost miserable ending, of course!The romances taking place in Victorian era were all pretty much all the same - triangle-dramas, deceat, debauchery, strickt laws an norms of class society between those who got it all, and those who have nothing are all the traits that are just as common now, as they were back then, thus very little room or space to develope is been given. It\'s all put in line with one of the most restricted formulas for a romance that you could ever think of, because the choises according to such stories, are always the same - either skip the historical accurasies (Pocahontas II) and give people what they want, or keep the facts, and... suck at romance, because God knows Victorians were bland as paint with that!Monogatari Emma has nothing in it\'s story, that stands out from any other romance or love story, that takes place in this certain era, or that handles such themes like class society, ""we who are all, and those who are nothing""- consept, prejudice and accepting the norms and expectations of the sociaty, that pretty much tells you everyday, how to live your live accordingly. It\'s a cute little window to the world that\'s - mostly! - already long gone, both in cultural and social sence, but other than that... it\'s not worth of my interest. I\'ve seen better Victorian romances from... anywhere, and if Monogatari Emma\'s story is what I should use as a comparison, I shall continue doing so in the future as well.Art (7)The artstyle of Monogatari Emma is cute... it\'s pretty, and it\'s... well, not the most liveliest, but it does it\'s job, looking like a old photo, or an oil-painting, almost, in some parts. It holds little to no splashes of color, which makes it really monotonous and bland... much like the story and the characters. It\'s still somewhat nice to look at, but sadly... evenn though being it\'s saving grace, it\'s just not enough to ""save"" this anime.In romance, I need something to feel - not something to look at!Sound (6)The voice actors do decent job while playing their characters, but none of them truly standed out for me. They\'re all pretty generic - easy to listen, and easy to forget - and the less I\'ll be saying about the music, the better! This is just... the most awful Victorian music, right here! It has no life nor soul in it... nothing, that would hold my interest over a bland story, and even blander characters... and it really pisses me off, because Victorian music is not this... bland! It shouldn\'t be!Characters (4)...or the lack of the characters, more likely.Let\'s keep it short and sweet, shall we. These characters... are cut-outs! Bland and boring cut-outs, every single one of them! We have our idiot-boy-in-love, his quirky best friend... with a indian harem, and an elephant... and our leading lady is a blander-than-blander twat, that somehow charms the Indian prince to courtship her... and she barely says a freaking word to anyone!Ironically, main heroine Emma, is my biggest gripe against this anime, and for a good reason, might I say! She\'s supposed to be this ""poor, unfortunate but sweet soul"", picked and raised from the utmost poverty and misery, that falls in love with a handsome nobleman, but... despite of what I just told about her, she\'s really not that interesting as a character! Much like the art style, she\'s just a decent painting, with no color - no shades, no shadows, and seemingly no flaws to speak of! She never speaks, she never shares her emotions to anyone, neither does she show them - I\'m starting to doubt that she even has any of those! - and even when she\'s being separated from her love, only to find herself a new one - because, apparently, glasses and stone-like expressions are sooo attractive! - she just seems to think herself ""Duuuu...."" and move along with the story, like a mindless puppet... not wanting anything, not saying anything... doing nothing!I hate heroines like Emma, and when this whole story is pretty much about just her and her ""struggles"" with forbidden love... I just can\'t believe that I didn\'t drop this anime all together, thanks to her!Enjoyment (5)The best word to describe Monogatari Emma, is generic... or mediocre, if you like. It has nothing look at, nothing to feel for, and nothing to remember right after the first watching. Anyone who knows anything about romances knows, how this story\'s gonna end, and even without the historical accurasies, it was pretty ludicrous to look at, even for me!This is the basic of the basics - the absolute bare-boned sceleton of a standard romance-formula, that was blooming even in the earliest Victorian era\'s novels, poetry, arts and writings. Monogatari Emmas\' consept may\'ve been new and innovative... maybe even naughty and dangerous for those times, but after seeing so many other better love stories than this, I really can\'t see the overall appeal. It wasn\'t enjoyable to watch, and I shall not waste my time with it anymore, ever again.Overall (5)Monogatari Emma, is just some sweet, innocent, rose-tinted but never too deep or dirty fluff, that\'s trying to imitate an actual, well-developed and memorable romace-story... while failing miserably.It\'s not something that I would recommend to anyone, but... if you like romances, are a fan of the Victorian era, or if you just happen to have some time to kill, and don\'t really care, what you\'re going to see...

OK, not the most original premise, but combine Mori-sensei's lovely artwork, a good sense of atmosphere, a thorough lack of pretentiousness, and general lack of melodrama and we just might have an anime thats worth a watch.'Emma' is licensed by Nozomi Entertainment and can be watched for free on their YouTube channel. Nozomi also produced a 2-part US DVD release.-Story-It's 1890's Victorian Britain. Class divisions are so rigid that...the various levels of the social order are practically different worlds. So when the son of a prosperous merchant falls in love with a maid the road is bound to be rocky. The story is full well-known tropes, it's hardly a genre-buster. But these tropes are played so earnestly straight that it's hard to hate them, even if the next event isn't exactly unpredictable. It's simple, it's sweet, and it doesn't pretend to be anything more than that. ( The series even lampshades its well-worn formula during one scene in a bookshop when a couple of background characters talk about a book telling the story of a maid and a noble who fall in love- as if to subtly acknowledge how long the basic plot has been around ). Most importantly, the central conflict of the series is very believable, rooted in the main characters' personalities and the world they inhabit- that's not always a given in this genre.-Art-Karou Mori excels at drawing two things: 1) Beautiful women 2) Historically accurate and highly detailed costumes. You'll see plenty of both here. Emma's design is particularly pleasing (although I must confess a preference for meganekkos, so my bias is likely at work). The aesthetic is pleasant to look at, using lots of lighter pastel colors to create a relaxing atmosphere. The animation quality is good, but nothing particularly special. This isn't an action series, so it doesn't have to be.-Sound-Little to say here. The soundtrack is relaxing, never overbearing, using lots of flutes. It goes for a period-appropriate sound and sets the mood, but none of the tracks made me want to look it up on YouTube. The show is English sub only, and the Japanese voice actors do their jobs fine without standing out. Emma's voice was above average, as her actress managed to convey her shy, quiet personality. Sound does its job with no significant problems.-Characters-Again, the show sticks pretty close to formula here. Shy female lead, shy male lead, male lead has an outgoing best friend, etc. What most impressed me were the antagonist characters, nearly all of them behaved in a believable way and had reasonable motivations to inhibit the romance given what they knew (and they knew as much as they could reasonably be expected to know- no convenient ignorance just for the sake of drama). There is one antagonist who isn't exactly subtle, but he shows up fairly rarely and never goes to full-scale 'Rose of Versailles' melodrama, so it's bearable.-Enjoyment-An anime to watch if you want something sweet that isn't saccharine, while also being pleasant and relaxing. Each episode is fairly light without feeling empty and pointless, meaning you're probably going to want to watch several episodes in a row. What else can I say? It's enjoyable.-Overall-This anime knew it was a straight-forward old-fashioned romance and didn't pretend to be anything else. It came, it did what it meant to do, did it well, and it left before the audience got tired. There's no shame in that, especially in a genre with no shortage of shows that sink into melodrama and pretentiousness in a failed attempt to do too much. the various levels of the social order are practically different worlds.

I can agree with some that say that the show is VERY slow, but that was sort of the point in my opinion. Love is rarely a fast affair, it takes time to blossom. I agree that with the ending it left a little to be desired, but for a two season series it couldn't have ended better.One thing I loved about the show was it captured Industrial Revolution Era London so well. The landscapes were great, the culture and population were diverse. It really put you in the time...period.The music was pretty solid in my opinion, I liked the opening. The animation looks a little dated for over 10 years old, but I was not bothered by this.All in all, a great romance anime and a true hidden gem.

There's no ecchi, no randomness, no sweat drops, and no high school shenanigans. It is a serious romance-drama, which is a welcome change from the usual anime subject matter. It is set in a realistic interpretation of Victorian Britain, with many historical allusions that only add to the depth of the world. Overall it feels like a bit of a mash-up of Romeo and Juliet, Cinderella and Pride and Prejudice: typical forbidden love plot between members of opposite social classes.

That was not the case. The entire anime was over all bland. A lot of that comes down to how quiet the show is. There really isn\'t a lot of background music to emphasize scenes so you have to use your best judgment on certain parts of the show. It also doesn\'t help that there is little to no inside thoughts happening from any of the characters, so as a watcher I felt very disconnected from the progression of...this story as well as the characters. Furthermore, the development between Mr. Jones and Emma was really lacking. So much so that it left me confused as to how they got from acquaintances to in love. That could be in part to not getting the insight of their internal monologues.As for the historical aspect of the show, it took place at the end of the 19th century, otherwise known as the late victorian age. Casual watchers might not care but due to the lack of plot going on the historical aspect shows quite immensely and needs to be analyzed  I personally believe it would have been a better choice to make it during the early to middle 19th century as that is where most recognizable parts of the victorian era, to even a non history nerd, are held . The fashion as well as the decor of Mrs. Kelly Stowner\'s home felt a little out of touch for the times. For example, it\'s references many times that Mrs. Stowner\'s home is out of date and rather old yet there is no effort made towards the iconic arsenic filled green wall paper and decor that was extremely popular in the early to mid victorian era: when she would have bought the house. There is even a scene were Al comes over and helps them fix the wall paper and it would have been a great place to emphasize that iconic green. As for the fashion choices, there were a couple references to what would have been popular at the time but it just wasn\'t presented well enough on screen. There were some fashion myths that have already been debunked that were referenced throughout the show. The most iconic part of the victorian era is the fashion of the time. The frills, the extremely small waists, the ideal long neck and the animation just did not give it justice. One of the myths I mentioned comes down to the corsets. It might not be well known, but the corsets of the olden days were actually quite comfortable and did not cause discomfort. So when the scene where Ms. Campbell is telling her maid to tighten the corset more and she shows obvious discomfort would not have been a likely situation. Especially because corsets, at the time, weren’t used the same way they are in modern times. Their intended purpose was to be a bra and support the breasts and back. They were not used to enhance figures, even though they had that effect as well. The famous victorian tiny waist that we know of today has been shown to be altered. Photo editing is not a new thing.Another thing I think is important to note is the way they show different cultures. One of the characters happens to be a prince from India. I think a lot of woke watchers will take offense to how they depict him as well as his harem of women. The thing I kept in mind for the harem, is that  this is an older anime so the usage of the copy paste person was quite common and they are background characters. Regardless, Prince Hakim is my favorite character. I thought he had a lot more personality than Mr. Jones and the way he holds himself was really appealing, especially in regard to his culture. Even more so ,the anime did a great job of presenting him on equal footing to the english gentry even though there is curiosity  to his culture and ways of life.As far as Emma is concerned, I feel as though she fits the wattpad stereotype of ""I\'m just a normal girl with subpar looks"" archetype. There really isn\'t anything about her that sets her apart from others. As the leading lady she just wasn\'t interesting at all.If you got this far, my overall opinion is that this show had sooooo much potential. It had a really good plot idea, especially considering it came out in 2005! This means that the maid getting with aristocrat genre hadn\'t been overdone yet. Unfortunately, the ball was just dropped on this one. But it does have a season two and considering the show does end on a cliffhanger I will be watching it as I am hoping that season 2 shows more progression of the love interests. If you\'re interested in that review and you like what I have to say, feel free to go check out my page. Anyway all the best in your viewing journey <3 this story as well as the characters. Furthermore, the development between Mr. Jones and Emma was really lacking. So much so that it left me confused as to how they got from acquaintances to in love. That could be in part to not getting the insight of their internal monologues.As for the historical aspect of the show, it took place at the end of the 19th century, otherwise known as the late victorian age. Casual watchers might not care but due to the lack of plot going on the historical aspect shows quite immensely and needs to be analyzed  I personally believe it would have been a better choice to make it during the early to middle 19th century as that is where most recognizable parts of the victorian era, to even a non history nerd, are held . The fashion as well as the decor of Mrs. Kelly Stowner\'s home felt a little out of touch for the times. For example, it\'s references many times that Mrs. Stowner\'s home is out of date and rather old yet there is no effort made towards the iconic arsenic filled green wall paper and decor that was extremely popular in the early to mid victorian era: when she would have bought the house. There is even a scene were Al comes over and helps them fix the wall paper and it would have been a great place to emphasize that iconic green. As for the fashion choices, there were a couple references to what would have been popular at the time but it just wasn\'t presented well enough on screen. There were some fashion myths that have already been debunked that were referenced throughout the show. The most iconic part of the victorian era is the fashion of the time. The frills, the extremely small waists, the ideal long neck and the animation just did not give it justice. One of the myths I mentioned comes down to the corsets. It might not be well known, but the corsets of the olden days were actually quite comfortable and did not cause discomfort. So when the scene where Ms. Campbell is telling her maid to tighten the corset more and she shows obvious discomfort would not have been a likely situation. Especially because corsets, at the time, weren’t used the same way they are in modern times. Their intended purpose was to be a bra and support the breasts and back. They were not used to enhance figures, even though they had that effect as well. The famous victorian tiny waist that we know of today has been shown to be altered. Photo editing is not a new thing.Another thing I think is important to note is the way they show different cultures. One of the characters happens to be a prince from India. I think a lot of woke watchers will take offense to how they depict him as well as his harem of women. The thing I kept in mind for the harem, is that  this is an older anime so the usage of the copy paste person was quite common and they are background characters. Regardless, Prince Hakim is my favorite character. I thought he had a lot more personality than Mr. Jones and the way he holds himself was really appealing, especially in regard to his culture. Even more so ,the anime did a great job of presenting him on equal footing to the english gentry even though there is curiosity  to his culture and ways of life.As far as Emma is concerned, I feel as though she fits the wattpad stereotype of ""I\'m just a normal girl with subpar looks"" archetype. There really isn\'t anything about her that sets her apart from others. As the leading lady she just wasn\'t interesting at all.If you got this far, my overall opinion is that this show had sooooo much potential. It had a really good plot idea, especially considering it came out in 2005! This means that the maid getting with aristocrat genre hadn\'t been overdone yet.

The title of the anime speaks for itself. This anime is in fact an anime about romance blossoming in the Victorian age. Or the reign of Queen Victoria to be more specific.As said already, this anime\'s title is literally the summary of everything this anime has to offer. If you do not understand then allow me to explain :In the reign of Queen Victoria. Rich people are only allowed to marry with rich people. And poor people are only allowed to marry with poor people. All British people unite under one country, England. However, England is separated into two...sub-countries. The rich and the poor.^ So following that. The story is about a rich man falling in love with a maid. Will their love ever bloom so much that it\'ll overcome the cruel laws & obstructions of the world? Find out by watching, lmao.I...I don\'t really have a comment for this anime.. Other than the fact that watching this show feels like I\'m watching an animated reality romance from the 80s.Because it feels like reality. Sometimes it just feels bland and doesn\'t really give you the ""Ooh!"" reaction. Be that as it may, I never got tired from watching this anime. It was uniquely tranquil in its own way like Kino no Tabi. But better of course. If it wasn\'t then I would\'ve not given this anime 10/10!For those seeking for a romance drama anime that doesn\'t really have any climax but is still outstanding.

Before moving to the core, I want to convey this, ""Emma - Victorian Romance is not for those who love action or comedy. The story moves like a gentle breeze but it have enough stuff to bring to the edge of your seat while watching"". Let me describe one by one.First, the character designs are exceptionally well. Particularly, Emma, Eleanor, Vivi, William and Hakim and their expressions. Apart from that, the designers perfectly re-created the Victorian era.Second, the narration and...dialogue are simply awesome. The dialogues like ""He didn\'t ask simple yes-no questions like others, but just seems to enjoy talking"" and ""I\'ll be waiting. Even if it isn\'t today nor tomorrow, I don\'t mind that"". The story tells about the man-made classification between people based on their possessions and what\'ll happen, if someone dares to cross. The story starts with the visit of William Jones to his Governess Mrs.Stowner residence where he met Emma, maid to his governess and gets attracted to her then the rest are follows. Finally, an incident occurred which separated Emma and William.Finally, the most important thing, background score does well its part. Especially, the tracks, Emma, Menuet for Emma and the piano versions of Emma, Menuet for Emma, Silhouette of a Breeze are irresistible. Emma is one such anime that I recommend everyone must watch at-least once and feel the happiness and pain in love. dialogue are simply awesome.

', ""Sigh, Now, that's how you make a romance anime, I'm sick and tired of the crappy cliché high school romance stories, this one is gold, It was painful to see them part ways, I literally loved the show, I don't know what took me so much to start watching this, It was on my 'To watch list' for ages now that it collected dirt,-Story 9/10As simple as it sounds, a love story between two people from totally different social classes in a world where states matter the most, the story stayed true to itself all the way long, the comedy was on point and not...too forced, and that's where most of the romance anime fail.-Art 8/10The art style was weird at the beginning, but now I don't know if it was changed in these last episodes or I just got used to it,-Characters 9/10So many good characters, and of course annoying little brats (VIVI), there are lots of variety of different people, like Stevens, for example, although he's (what most people would say) a side character, I didn't view him as such, he stood out to be a great character, one of my favourites, lots of character development happened to all our main and support characters, the back stories were as tragic as they come,-Music 10/10Wow, just wow, never would have thought I'd ever enjoy Music from the Victorian era, appropriate music for it fitting scenes, the emotions were so true and relatableOverall, It's a golden solid 9/10, I'm curious what the second season has in store, I hope It stands out for an eligible sequel, too forced, and that's where most of the romance anime fail.-Art 8/10The art style was weird at the beginning, but now I don't know if it was changed in these last episodes or I just got used to it,-Characters 9/10So many good characters, and of course annoying little brats (VIVI), there are lots of variety of different people, like Stevens, for example, although he's (what most people would say) a side character, I didn't view him as such, he stood out to be a great character, one of my favourites, lots of character development happened to all our main and support characters, the back stories were as tragic as they come,-Music 10/10Wow, just wow, never would have thought I'd ever enjoy Music from the Victorian era, appropriate music for it fitting scenes, the emotions were so true and relatableOverall, It's a golden solid 9/10, I'm curious what the second season has in store, I hope It stands out for an eligible sequel,"", 'First things first. My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryWhat can I say. Victorian era London lovestory of clash between social classes. Workers and aristocrats. It was a sweet but tragic story, mainly as usual, because of a stupid cultural growth where Aristocrats think of themselves so much that worker class are disgrace. And thus the whole drama of this series. An aristocrat and maid fall in love with each other, but because of how world is built and how different classes relationships are frowned upon, their love story becomes challenged.This season felt somewhat of a...introduction and growth for characters. We learned about various characters, world and as well a little bit of their love story. It was a very sweet and classy path, but sadly enough in the end, didn\'t lead or branch as much as I hoped for.✦Art & SoundArt and animation was good enough, but gotta say faces did look a bit odd. But on the other hand, I really did enjoy soundtrack in this Anime, it has presence, weight on emotions and simply well put. It was quite good, but nothing too amazing.✦CharacterMain guy, the Aristocrat who is quite kind, but whipped to traditions and slowly struggles with them and attempts to change things. He is a kind character, but his kindness is also  a bit of a problem at times.Main girl, the Maid who is as well kind, caring and generally quite a good woman. But on the other side, she is a bit too caring about everyone good will and should be a bit more selfish for her own happiness.Aside that, we have bunch of caring, supporting and in general quite nice characters. Including Hakim, who is oddly enough like some sort of a old wise sage that gives small push towards his friend.As well we have bunch of more stoic stereotypes, selfish aristocrats, greedy people and so on. So in a sense most of the characters very pretty enjoyable, fitting and almost all of them gave you sense of emotions and eventually as plot progressed, weight of emotions.✦Enjoyment & OverallI did like it, sweet, sad, romantic and hopefully story will end well. Biggest complaint would probably be a bit odd art and a little bit annoying setting. Not been ever fan of selfish Aristocrats, but they are useful as plot device. As well I felt that a bit more romance and less slice-of-life would been much more enjoyable thing to have. But in the end, it was very good Anime, that I binge watched in one go with only 1 break inbetween.I really struggled whenever give it 7 or 8, but as usual, I have weak spot for romance and Anime. Thus I gave it higher praise.Point being, story is pretty emotional, calm, sad and sweet. It\'s a enjoyable ride of slice-of-life romance.

It's historical because you'll see how gentry society worked in the old England. The plot is easy to follow. It's about two people from vastly different social classes fall in love with one another, but this kind of romance is forbidden in a wealthy society. What I liked the most is the slow pace of the story. In a slow paced romance, you'll see the how the characters develop, and this series invests you in every single one of the characters. It's great watching the characters change throughout the story while dealing with their feelings...and society. Everything is just done right, it's not over the top or lacking at all. Overall its a very enjoyable anime. and society. Everything is just done right, it's not over the top or lacking at all. Overall its a very enjoyable anime."", 'Having had a moment to compose myself after an ending that apparently everyone in my watch group but me already saw coming, I thought this was a very (jolly?) good show and would award it an 8/10.Starting with things I liked, the writing in terms of characterization is some of the best I\'ve seen in fiction. Everyone involved had defined characters that were three-dimensional and behaved just like real people would given the events unfolding around them. None of them are perfect nor evil (although Daddy Jones comes close), and everyone\'s motivations were clear.I also feel that the writing did an incredible job of tying...threads together, both setting things up that would pay off much later AND hinting at things that would occur within the same episode. The reeds/elms conversation and the pocket watch stand out as some of the best examples of this.Last thing here is that the comedy was genuinely funny. So many shows try to go over the top and come nowhere close to sticking the landing (which was painfully obvious when I watched an episode of 100 Girlfriends right after finishing this), but the subtlety of the comedy here was good for a laugh. Do I have a British sense of humor now?I rarely comment on music in anime but Emma does a great job here as well. The OP always set me up for the day\'s adventure, and you knew things were getting real when it would play during other scenes. It never really stuck out, which is what background music is meant to do.On to my negatives.As much as I loved how different this show felt than 99% of anime I\'ve seen in terms of grounding, writing, and realism, it went a bit too heavy on some tropes. Did we really, for example, need a drama injection by way of the ""one lover unilaterally decides that leaving the other is best for both of them"" event? I was already all-in on this before you made that the climax, now I feel betrayed!This moment also made me realize that the ""lovers from different worlds"" thing has been done a million times as well, but I didn\'t mind it nearly as much since it was so well done.I also didn\'t particularly care for the tragic backstory that felt wedged into the final episodes. I already felt plenty of empathy and pain for Emma throughout her time as an adult on the show, so all of that felt a bit like heavy-handed tearjerker-bait.And last but not least, the ending! I had Emma being a 9/10 for several episodes going into the closing shot, and, no joke, I nearly dropped it to a 6/10 when the credits rolled. If not for my cat sleeping on my lap (insert ""aww"" here) during the train chasing scene, I probably would\'ve audibly yelled some words that no one in the show would dare say. I get that there\'s a Season 2 that may or may not have a satisfying conclusion, but I didn\'t need this ""twist"" to make for a good show. I recognize now that the realism I love is a bit of a double-edged sword, as this is sadly the most realistic conclusion possible.In short, I am so glad that my group selected Emma for our discussion! The writing was some of the best I\'ve seen in a long time, but it couldn\'t quite avoid some of the standard beats associated with the genre. 8/10 for me, as it is a very good show that nearly made it into ""great"" territory. I will be watching Season 2 and trying to convince my wife to watch Season 1 with me.

With a setting and characters more akin to a Jane Austen novel than to a typical shoujo manga, the first season of the Emma anime is a charming adaptation of the beginning of Kaoru Mori's beautiful manga.Being very faithful to the manga, the anime follows the same beginnings. We are introduced to Emma, a beautiful and polite maid to the retired governess Kelly Stownar. Her introduction is slightly expanded upon in the anime, setting the mood and atmosphere of Emma's surroundings and lifestyle with...Mrs. Stownar. Her first fated meeting with the enthusiastic yet naive William Jones is extremely charming and romantic, their subsequent interactions are also far better represented in the anime with some additional scenes and dialogue. With awkward yet heartwarming interactions, William's infatuation with Emma is very endearing.The side characters, namely William's father, siblings and prince Hakim, are also given additional scenes and dialogue. Their peculiar personalities and character, especially of the eccentric Hakim, make the characters and their interactions with William fun and interesting. Their divergent opinions about Emma and William's romance also communicate the themes of classicism and social disparity that the main couple will start to encounter.Eleanor, a young woman of aristocratic lineage who's romantically interested in William, is also introduced during the first half of the series and a key character to the main conflict in the relationship. Given that William's family hopes he will establish a relationship with Eleanor to upgrade their societal status, his love for Emma is immediately frowned upon. Unlike in other series and dramas with similar premises, Eleanor is portrayed as a sheltered and fragile woman with pure feelings, making her character and unrequited feelings relatable.While Emma's and William's relationship is very charming, Emma's introverted personality and mysterious past makes her character and personality feel underdeveloped at times. The relationship doesn't feel forced but if Emma's personality was less dull, it might have been easier to understand William's strong feelings for her.Regarding the technical aspects of the anime, Kaoru Mori's artstyle is faithfully reproduced, her attention for detail and historical accuracy of the era's aspect (clothes, transportation, technology) are represented within the animation. While sometimes the characters may look off model, the details are polished enough to convey the feeling and atmosphere of the original work. The wonderful English dub, with a cast of British voice actors, is full with brilliant performances with accurate accents and dialogue corresponding to Victorian England, immersing the viewer completely into the setting and plot. The music is also extremely fitting, with beautiful instrumental tracks according to the mood and scene.The first half of Emma, A Victorian Romance is definitely a great watch for fans of period dramas and classic romantic stories alike.

Some of them are good, other not that good.Japan also has a lot of stories that are set in this period of time. This is one of my favorite anime and manga and I want to share my opinion to you.Talking about the character development we can meet the main cast in this first season. What they do for the living and the environment they are: family, social status, etc. All characterrs are important and they are for something, no filler.This story develops in some point in XIX century, where customs, social...labels and even religion are very strict. If you weren’t born with money, at an early age you have to work, and if you are a woman… well, you know. Emma was very lucky to escape to this fate. Thanks to her guardian, Kelly, Emma can work and dedicate her life being a maid. Also, Kelly teach Emma how to read and write.The anime takes its time to develop the story and the characters in order to know each other and what they want. With the music and the good animation this anime is a piece of art. a hidden jewel you have to watch at least one time.Based in the manga of Kaoru Mori, the manga was animated by studio Pierrot. And the work made is really perfect talking about the setting of time, costumes, political and religious context, etc. Talking about the political and religious it isn’t that obvious but its not coincidence that we are talking about England of 19th century that is named after the queen Victoria.This anime is perfect if you like romance stories in this period of time. I won’t lie, the story is predictable about how the main couple will end. This first season ends in a really sad point, but a second season that promises us a continuation of the story of William and Emma will have a happy end. labels and even religion are very strict.

It gets a little annoying where the story doesn't progress unless Shino goes traveling to another village or townIn the second season, the series focus a...little more on the plot and detail and brings the characters together Shino met from Season 1. They do still have to go to another town or village but it was a little more in depth. One thing that appeals a little more in Season 2 is a little more focus on the characters. They spent two episodes each for Daikaku and Yana and surprisingly two and a half to three episodes focused on Shinobu.But after that, they rushed the ending in two episodes. There was so much information and stuff thrown at you that it's hard to swallow it all in one gulp.However, the overall concept of the story is unique with the Eight Dogs of the East and the different gems/beads.Art 10/10The art is absolutely amazing. The depth and detail on each character is quite unique. A lot of time was spent on the characters with each character being different even including the characters that only show up once or twice. The landscape and environment is always breathtaking. Even the small house of Daikaku out in the mountain was pretty well done. The Imperial Capital in which the series likes to focus around is always elegant. The detail putted into the city was quite superb. I could babble on and on about it but you won't see how beautiful it is until you watch and pay attention to it.Character 8/10Like I said about the story, there was a much better improvement on the characters themselves from Season 1. They bring all the previous characters together at the Capital which was interesting. The characters also show a bit of emotion towards one another and at times it can be amusing and funny when they meet each other at the Imperial Capital. One thing I liked is that they spent three episodes on Shinobu. It allowed us to understand Shinobu's past and how he feels. I wish they did that with the other characters such as Dousetsu for example. They only introduced him in one episode in Season 1 and brought him back by bringing him to the capital in another episode. Hamaji didn't make much of a debut and there wasn't a lot of development even though she was essential to Sosuke and Shino. I wished they did more cameo on her.Enjoyment 9/10Despite the small flaws in the story and character, I always looked forward to a new episode every Monday on Crunchyroll. It makes my Monday always better after school. The blend of different supernatural allowed a large variety of imagination. Each character has there own unique powers and 'abilities' making them unique. **I'm gonna list some examples so if you haven't watched it, I recommend moving to the next paragraph. Shino has Murasame which is a crow that can turn into a sword giving Shino some special powers like rain. Shinobu is a tengu who has these beautiful white wings that allows him to make wings and fly. Daikaku has this amusing eye on his forehead that can destroy any spirits or demons like. And what's amusing is that both Shino and Shinobu look young but chronologically, they're 18 and 22. So it was nice to see something different from the norm.**Overall, I would give it a high 7 or low 8. But since I can't do that, I gave it an 8 because there was a lot of potential in the series. I just wished it wasn't very rushed since the anime is based off the manga. I really wished they would focus a little more on the characters that didn't get the spotlight.If you read the manga, the anime does leave quite a bit of detail and hints that I find significant. So I recommend reading the manga if you can.And for the last episode. I'm really upset at the rushed ending. I normally have these 'feels' at the end of most anime but this one, it wasn't as impact-fully because it was rushed so much. You kind of expect for a rushed series especially after watching Episode 4 from Season 1. The ending was kind of predictable to in my eyes. However, there was a lot of cliffhangers and mysterious questions that allows Hakkenden: Touhou Hakken Ibun to go for a third season. Despite a 'The End' in Episode 13, the ending they left allows a possibility for a third season if they desire. I don't think the manga has actually 'ended' thus another positive side for those who want a Season 3.Other than the rushed ending, it was still a comforting and warmth ending. Everyone seems very happy and I loved that they did scenes of each character. Even the characters that only made a small debut made a cameo.In the end, it was a nice series with a unique turn on supernatural like genre. I loved the protagonist Shino as he is a very cute boy.

While the first season introduced the main cast, this season expands on their stories and answers some of the unanswered questions posed initially.So far we haven't found all of the 8 holders of the jewels but are getting pretty damm close. It's kinda weird that looking for them is kinda like a side-thing but this doesn't hurt the story at all. I am very happy that we get to find out more about the characters' past. It makes the story seem more complex, like the characters are all linked...to something bigger. They have also introduced some very nice side stories that featured minor characters, some recurring, some not.I am very happy to say that there has not been a single dull episode so far. The story is a little hard to predict but it's very engaging and makes you wish you had more. Overall I'm very existed to see how this anime progresses. to something bigger.

In this season Shino and his group continue to search for all eight of the marbles. The new character Ao becomes slightly more present in the second season, but not as much as I would have liked him to. Although I did enjoy this season, I found the second season to not be as ""good"" as the first season in terms of episode quality consistency. I expected the plot to be...more in depth, but it felt extremely rushed. A lot of the episode were wasted on side-plots that did not relate to the original main plot. If this were a longer anime it\'d be more understandable, but with only 13 episodes left the plot should have been more focused. Some episodes were simply awesome, while others were dull. What I did like though, was how well the tone switched so subtly, whether is was from happy to sad, or sad to funny. All the tones were well done, sad moments were truly meaningful, and the funny moments were actually funny. The anime did pick up in progression towards the end pleasantly.Character: 8There is not as much character development as I hoped to be, and there seems to be a lack of consistency in episode quality. Some episodes are very interesting, while others are irrelevant to the plot, or simply just dull and not entertaining. Coincidence is a key word, the characters with marbles seem to randomly gather together. The story even mocks itself by mentioning how coincidental all of these events are. What the story does do though is, create a strong ""family"" bond between all the characters that come into the story. Each character is given a back story and a defined personality.Art: 10The art is exemplary, it\'s evident that a lot of time and focus was spent on the colors and details. This anime would not be worth watching if it were not for the simple eye candy of how pretty everything is. The colors are soothing to look at and the characters are well drawn.Sound:8The OP is okay, the ED is better than the OP and provides a great end to each episode.Overall:8I\'d still definitely recommend watching the second season if you enjoyed the first season.

We...followed the main characters around several places in the world they live in, and they helped out many people they met on their path.I must say that some of the people they encounter had a fate that I didn't expect to see. Another emotional point, unlike the first season, this one had episodes that ended in unexpected and sad ways, tragic, nonetheless.It felt though as if the last episode got a bit hasty, finishing the story and all and I would've liked to see a longer fight and a more dramatic ending perhaps.Art:I love every single bit about the art, so beautiful.There were so many details in everything, and more specific, the hair and eyes of each character.Very detailed and they were all unique.The landscape was just as beautiful and overall, this art style will always remain as one of my favourites.(A bonus is the beautiful young men)Sound:Nice sound and the voice actors did one amazing job.The ending song though, I could cry over and over because of how emotional it is.All of the scenes there were shown in it, worked well with the song.(SPOILER: The song and clips used all pointed towards Ao's feelings about Shino and Sousuke together, that was emotional. It hit me like a bus, that's how emotionally attached I've become to that ending song, and to Ao as well.)Character:All of the main characters are unique and has their own stories to tell.Once again, Shino and Sousuke are the ones I wanted to know more about. Over time, more things were revealed about each character. I enjoy reading into stuff and pointing out details although there wasn't much to point out here.They all have unique powers and prove to be strong, some individually strong, and other characters, not so much.Overall:It took me two days to watch the season from start to finish while trying to save episodes so that they may last longer but that simply did not work. That's how attached I got to it, unlike the first season that took me a week to finish because it was easy to save the episodes a bit.This season was the one that hit me the hardest in the feels and the entertainment overall.Some episode endings did leave me a bit in the dark but it wasn't 'impossible' to figure out what the story we were left with was.Of course, this anime surprised me like most of the anime I've written a review for has.I took a strong liking to Shino, Sousuke and Ao and they'll always be my favorite characters of this anime.The anime ended without many questions left to ask so that's good.I wouldn't mind a new season of Hakkenden but it probably won't be happening anytime soon since the release of this season was a pretty long time ago.Overall 8/10 followed the main characters around several places in the world they live in, and they helped out many people they met on their path.I must say that some of the people they encounter had a fate that I didn't expect to see.

There was the 2 demon guys and some other people was all I  remember because of how poor character development. True I never finished the serious but It was because how boring it was getting, the only thing that kept me going for episodes 4-8 was the music and the mystery of their enemy, but even that wasn't enough.

Will, there be a season 3? , I'm still looking forward to it up until now... The anime and the fights scenes were all great itsa really an outstanding anime.

Well, whatever it sounds like to you, this is one helluva awesome show :DThe story is dark, sad and action-packed. I like how they present everything with a sad setting; it\'s not like it\'s just one big brawl after another; it is emotions and resolve-strengthening, it\'s battles which have a reason other than just being yet another battle.

The plot somehow manages to stay incredibly strong throughout all of the 50 episodes, showcasing many different types of characters, from the most comical to the most radically serious. The animation has a very unique style, which somewhat surprised me early on, but then I realized that it simply made the show more unique.What every viewer must realize first off is that this is NOT just an anime about vampires. The fact that the characters often require blood to survive is used as an effective plot device,...but it is not the entire focus of the show. What this means is that it appeals to both those who love vampire animes and those who do not, creating, as a whole, an extremely balanced, well crafted anime.The anime will be a joy for anyone who watches it. The storyline ranges from romance, to comedy, to intrigue, to detailed pseudo-history, innocence and experience, violence and peace, and then circles around again to the vague but omnipresent romance that insinuates itself, not as the main focus, but as a continuing theme throughout.I thoroughly enjoyed watching the anime, and I invite all who read this to do the same.Rating: 10/10 but it is not the entire focus of the show.

It is unrelated to the 1-10 grading that a lot of people seem to solely apply, without thinking of what it means.So. Blood+Originally an offshoot of an earlier movie, Blood+ combines both existing elements present in anime and new ones, to create a somewhat unique shonen (yes, shonen, because that\'s what this is, don\'t be fooled by the R+ rating)...title. The original premise, that of cute girl with big sword fighting large monsters has been done many times before, but it is the encompassing plot and character designs that make this title stand out.The fact that that the writers obviously wanted this series to stand out compared to a lot of other drab that comes out nowadays is evident. Sharp character designs (lack of moe characters) are the norm, and the plot line aims to be as realistic as possible, including many existing locations throughout the modern world. from Japan to Russia to France, it becomes evident that the animators have at least glanced at existing sceneries before sketching the locations where the story takes place.We can understand the actions of certain characters (if the motifs have been revealed), and often the distinction between good and evil becomes blurred, something which lacks in a lot of series nowadays, where differences are usually black and white, with not much repose in between.Then, you may ask "" Why give it a 7?"".First note that a 7 to me means "" Good"", it holds no numerical value. Blood+ is a good show, but it doesn\'t have any factors that make it stand out to the point where, maybe a year later, you think ""wow, that was quite a memorable show"".It is the same factor that makes it unique, that drags it down. The score is pulled down because of the lack of realism in a show that aims to include many elements pulled straight out of the 21st century world for the sake of appearing realistic and well thought through.There is a scene where a protagonist is being pursued. He flees into a park, filled with happy picnickers. He rests momentarily on a bench, when suddenly his pursuer appears again. He runs through the  park, but to our surprise, all those picnickers have disappeared. Is the director implying that in the few seconds that the camera pans away, all those men and women decided to pack up and leave? This incident is not standalone, and quite often outsiders (to the plot) seem to act illogically, or simply disappear solely for the sake of furthering a plot line and making the actions of characters seem logical.Another small, annoying factor is that all characters seem to be able to speak to anyone on the globe. Now honestly, I don\'t believe that the entire world has started speaking Japanese overnight. This can be overlooked to a certain extent however, since such reasoning seems to be prevalent in many shonen titles.Another factor pulling down an otherwise very good show, is the seemingly low budget of Blood+. It affects many of the most dominant factors determining the success of a show, plot, animation and sound. Firstly, the plot seems to suffer because directors and producers felt it necessary to include a lot of tangents, which lead nowhere. The entire series could have been done in 3/4ths of the 50 episodes that it runs for or less. Secondly, the lack of CG animation and lanky movements at times takes away from a series that includes a lot of fight scenes. Although it does give it some sort of visual appeal, it would have been much better executed with a larger animation budget.Sound is another factor pulling it down. Although there are some good tracks in the OST, which are nice to the ear, the repetition and overuse of them is simply irritating, especially for a longer anime like Blood+. The OP and ED are of the common staple, including well known (at least, for us anime fans) J-Rock bands such as UVERworld and Hyde. Certainly not bad, but not very original either. Voice acting isn\'t terribly great either, although the actors can convey different emotions, it is not entirely convincing either.Lastly, personally I found the lack of a deeper "" meaningful"" plot line distasteful. Although certainly not needed, it would have brought the enjoyment factor up quite a bit. Simply following the story of the main protagonist, Saya, can be a bore at times, especially when it becomes overly melodramatic.Pushing my criticism aside, Blood+ certainly isn\'t a bad series. Even with these somewhat irritating flaws, it is still much better than a lot of Shonen titles nowadays, and for anyone simply wanting some enjoyment without a too much engrossing plot, i\'d certainly recommend this. However, for anyone looking for something deeper, something with, say, moralistic or idealistic principles, i\'d tell you to look further, because this wouldn\'t be for you.Recommended for: (more serious) Shonen fans, those looking for something different than average.Not recommended for: Fans of moe character designs, serious Seinen fans. title.

Now honestly, I don\'t believe that the entire world has started speaking Japanese overnight. This can be overlooked to a certain extent however, since such reasoning seems to be prevalent in many shonen titles.Another factor pulling down an otherwise very good show, is the seemingly low budget of Blood+. It affects many of the most dominant factors determining the success of a show, plot, animation and sound. Firstly, the plot seems to suffer because directors and producers felt it necessary to include a lot of tangents, which lead nowhere. The entire series could have been done in 3/4ths of the 50 episodes that it runs for or less. Secondly, the lack of CG animation and lanky movements at times takes away from a series that includes a lot of fight scenes. Although it does give it some sort of visual appeal, it would have been much better executed with a larger animation budget.Sound is another factor pulling it down. Although there are some good tracks in the OST, which are nice to the ear, the repetition and overuse of them is simply irritating, especially for a longer anime like Blood+. The OP and ED are of the common staple, including well known (at least, for us anime fans) J-Rock bands such as UVERworld and Hyde. Certainly not bad, but not very original either. Voice acting isn\'t terribly great either, although the actors can convey different emotions, it is not entirely convincing either.Lastly, personally I found the lack of a deeper "" meaningful"" plot line distasteful. Although certainly not needed, it would have brought the enjoyment factor up quite a bit. Simply following the story of the main protagonist, Saya, can be a bore at times, especially when it becomes overly melodramatic.Pushing my criticism aside, Blood+ certainly isn\'t a bad series. Even with these somewhat irritating flaws, it is still much better than a lot of Shonen titles nowadays, and for anyone simply wanting some enjoyment without a too much engrossing plot, i\'d certainly recommend this. However, for anyone looking for something deeper, something with, say, moralistic or idealistic principles, i\'d tell you to look further, because this wouldn\'t be for you.Recommended for: (more serious) Shonen fans, those looking for something different than average.Not recommended for: Fans of moe character designs, serious Seinen fans.', ""I used to watch a fair amount of anime, but over the past few years, my interest in it had been gradually waning, partly because of the decreasing number of good shows being produced, and partly because of lack of time due to my heavy workload.However, this trend was reversed when I had the good fortune of coming across Blood+. I had never heard of it before, but the premise seemed interesting enough, though not particularly original or unique. I decided to give it a shot, expecting at least a decent and entertaining show but not...much more than that.But what I got was much, much more I had dared to hoped for. What starts out as a fairly conventional storyline gradually unravels, revealing a vastly more complex and intricate narrative tapestry. Its deliberate pacing may be misconstrued by some as being &quot;slow&quot;, but as the story progresses, all the puzzle pieces that are uncovered early on start to fall into place, and things that once seemed insignificant or nonsensical begin to make sense.As for the technical merits of this show, other people have already discussed its superb animation and hauntingly evocative soundtrack, so I won't go into too much detail on them. Suffice it to say that they complement the mood of the series exceptionally well.However, what really won me over was the exceptional character development displayed here. Without giving too much away, I can say that these characters actually felt like real, living, breathing people and not just 2-D images on the TV screen. They change and evolve as time goes by, and after a particular event occurs, don't be surprised if you find yourself regarding certain characters in a totally different light.To make a long story short, Blood+ is one of only a handful of shows that transcends the boundaries of its genre, and one of the best animes I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. In fact, it practically single-handedly revived my passion for anime and spurred me on to seek many other great shows, which I probably would not have bothered to watch otherwise.

The original work, Blood: The Last Vampire, screamed for a longer storyline that showed some development. And while Blood+ was to take place in a separate universe, if it managed to construct a decent story around the beautiful aesthetics of the film, then we would have had a definite winner. Sadly, Blood+ is, to put it bluntly, a bit of a mess.Blood+ starts off decent enough. Saya, our protagonist, is revealed to be the only one capable of killing the human killing, blood sucking chiropterans. Early on, a...bit os a standard ""mysterious past"" is established, although over the course of 50 episodes, it\'s never explained as well as it probably should have banned. Those hoping for a one woman show, like Blood: The Last Vampire, may also find it interesting that Blood+ sort of becomes a band of travelers movie with Saya\'s close friends, Riku and Kai, and her guardian of sort, the mysterious cello playing Hagi.One of the biggest problems of this show is that so many of its elements are very, very conventional. Saya is an amnesia sufferer who has ""forgotten"" about her past as a bloody killer. The American military is interfering in the role of vampires, which would have made for a decent little conspiracy story, if predictable, if it was fully explored. We are also treated to a bevy of corny ""live your life for today"" speeches from the likes of Saya\'s friends. It\'s all very standard fare.This wouldn\'t have been too bad, and would have been saved in part by the decently exciting action, if the series wasn\'t so arbitrary. New rules and twists are introduced haphazardly to the plot at seemingly unfit times. The Schiff, who are basically manufactured vampires, are tossed into the mix lazily, and their new set of rules and characters pops up and then is sort of left behind as the series progresses. This is how a lot of the second half of the show works. As Saya pursues Diva, the head honcho of the bad guys, all kinds of unexplored sub-plots are layered on; besides the aforementioned Schiff, we have some conflict between Diva\'s guardians (they\'re the bad guy equivalent of Hagi, basically), and political dealings with the American military, but they all feel terribly unimportant and underdeveloped, because the show ends up basically becoming one long, protracted chase scene, with Saya desperately trying to locate Diva and defeat her once and for all. This is extended by a relentless number of fight scenes that begin to lose their importance as we realize they are basically just delaying the final showdown.The show becomes simultaneously bogged down by the unneeded subplots, as well as too narrow-minded in how it chooses to be ""mysterious"" about all the characters and backgrounds. No, a show needn\'t spell out everything for the viewer, but we\'re never really given much to go on, if anything, from Saya, Hagi, and Diva and her cronies. Even as one of the antagonists essentially falls in love with Saya, it all feels very rushed and heavy-handed. While the pacing manages to keep the show watchable, it becomes so repetitive and predictable that it fails to stand out.The ending itself is something pretty much any viewer will be able to see from a mile away (and it has to do with another weird arbitrary rule that seems to be heaped on just to attempt to make it sad). Because of this, the emotional punch it is supposed to provide is more like an emotional feather dusting.There are some positives, the animation is good, even if it lacks the dark appeal of The Last Vampire. The various world locations we get to see manage to help keep things varied.  Kai becomes an interesting character with a soft-side to go along with his rambunctious one, that we can really empathize with. The action is generally pretty exciting at first. But the show just wears out its welcome with the arbitrary introduction of new ideas and characters that are often abandoned simply to fit the plot. It makes you wonder why they were needed in the first place.Ultimately, this all leaves Blood+ as a watchable, but simplistic and by-the-numbers vampire flick.3/10 bit os a standard ""mysterious past"" is established, although over the course of 50 episodes, it\'s never explained as well as it probably should have banned.

Ah, accessibility...Art was average. Sound was cool. I like the ED theme song where it sounds like an old lady is being strangled.Characters were balls. The brother was freaking annoying. I hated him, ruined the damn series. However, most other people were fine.I didn't enjoy this series so much as I enjoy getting an enema.You...looking for a continuation of that cool OVA thing? Then keep looking, vampire weeabos! Unless you like it or something... looking for a continuation of that cool OVA thing? Then keep looking, vampire weeabos! Unless you like it or something..."", 'Blood+ offers up an alternate take of the events from Blood: The Last Vampire featuring Saya\'s hunt of the Chiropteran creature threat. Being at 50 episodes of length, this gives the series plenty of time to build up on events with its plot and explore the causes that led to the Chiropteran threat being as serious as it did. It also expands on Saya\'s character and the mysterious organization (Red Shield) aiding her in thwarting the Chiropteran threat.In terms of characterization, the series does enough to flesh out prominent characters that influence Saya\'s decisions from those who serve to allow her to retain the normalcy...she seeks with her adoptive brothers Kai and Riku to those in Red Shield in need of her to those who remind her of her Chiropteran roots in the form of Hagi. The series does enough to have you believe that she cherishes said relationships and even those that she comes to newly establish as she learns more of her origins and the nature of the Chiropteran threat. It also does a decent job at exploring the inner conflict that Saya\'s character experiences as she comes to grips with her origins as a Chiroptera and determining what she desires despite being different from her adoptive human family.In terms of the plot, Blood+ does get fairly complex as it introduces several factions with differing motivations concerning the Chiropteran threat that involve its dominance, elimination or using the threat for personal gain. The first half is focused on slowly unveiling these factions and their motivations, as well as elements to Saya\'s past that she finds herself having to come to terms with. The unveiling of these elements lead to some foreign locales outside of Japan such as Vietnam and New York City. The second half is where events begin to build up where some prominent characters are killed off and characters gradually change as a result of the Chiropteran. This becomes prominent in a time skip which features some of the major characters having changed in personality and personal beliefs as a result of the events that took place from earlier episodes in the series.Blood+ does some from some major issues for me though. While enough is fleshed out with Saya and some prominent characters on her side, I felt that anything involving Diva and her Chevaliers were quite underdeveloped as we don\'t get much dimension or depth about their motivations with some of the Chevaliers seemingly being around just to serve as obstacles in Saya\'s hunt for Diva and to expand the cast. It also got in the habit of going into some sub-plots that did little to develop major elements of the series; particularly Mao and the reporter\'s quest to catch up with Kai, Saya and the Red Shield agents.In terms of visual presentation, Blood+ does sport clean details with its settings and character designs with a subdued color palette that do well at painting the show\'s dark mood. The series does well at visually depicting a variety of different settings thanks to the different locations that Saya and others travel to from the beaches of Okinawa to the barren tropical forests of Vietnam to the vast city landscape of New York City. The designs for the Chiropterans are diverse and make for a great treat to see on the screen. However for a series seemingly hyping itself on its monster-slaughtering action, Blood+ is hit-or-miss in animation. The series does have its moments in depicting some good scenes such as some aerial battles and close combat confrontations, but I did spot some prominent shortcuts with animation which include still-shots within moving backgrounds to simulate movement and the use of blur effects to depict fast movements coming from the Chiropteran characters.For the show\'s soundtrack, Blood+ often makes use of piano and classical musical pieces for insert music to depict its dramatic situations which fit perfectly with the drama seen frequently throughout the show. The show\'s various OP and ED sequences tended to be hit-or-miss for me with how I enjoyed them and quite often being either too gentle or intense in fitting with Blood+\'s mood. The only one that caught my interest was the 2nd OP from Hyde\'s ""Season\'s Call"" which fit well with the mood in which the series was conveying.Overall, Blood+ was a decent supernatural action/ drama that did enough at slowly fleshing out elements to its series and exploring how the prominent characters come to grips with knowing more about the Chiropteran, especially as Saya comes to grips with her own connections to it. However, the lack of fleshing out on many prominent characters among the antagonists does make it tough to connect with them without such developments and the focus on some irrelevant sub-plots does hamper the quality of the show\'s plotting. Still, the series does make for a decent watch and it beats the original movie in terms of delivering a quality plot and fleshed-out characters with its supernatural action. she seeks with her adoptive brothers Kai and Riku to those in Red Shield in need of her to those who remind her of her Chiropteran roots in the form of Hagi.

After being briefed on the basic plotline by her I was less than impressed to say the least, after all, one girl fighting the forces of evil (Or in this case Chiroptera) with her band of merry men, it was an idea done many a time before (Just look at Buffy the Vampire Slayer!) Yet I decided to give it a go regardless. I was delighted to find myself proved wrong however after finishing the anime just a few weeks later. I’ve since re-watched it twice and would definitely recommend it to anyone...with brilliant taste in anime!The story of Blood+ is one filled with compelling fight scenes, tension and mystery right until the very final episode. One of the greatest things about this anime is that the storyline constantly has the viewer guessing what will happen next without the plotline becoming predictable. Every small detail links in perfectly with the story, resulting in a perfectly rounded off anime that will delight even those who don’t usually enjoy anime of the vampire genre.Yet another great thing about Blood+ is the amazing cast of characters. Unlike some anime (Not mentioning any names here!) the characters actually have development, and a lot of it at that! As you progress through the show the characters will undergo some kind of hardship or test and blossom before your very eyes as a result of it, making them real easy to get attached to! The interactions between the different characters are ingenious and not always lacking in humour despite the dark tone of the anime! Not only do the characters develop themselves but develop their relationships with the other characters as well! Saya, the main character herself is interesting, adorably naive and fairly easy to relate to, which can rarely be said for the main hero/heroine of a genre such as this so I feel as though this is a real achievement!Out of the many anime I’ve seen in my time Blood+ has one of the most unique animation styles out there! The characters are interesting to look at and well in proportion throughout the entire series. Not once did I glance at a character and think, hang on a minute! I swear he had a larger nose in that last shot! The backgrounds are beautifully laid out and detailed and the shading is done at the level of a pro! Perfection!Even the music is perfect! The underlining score fits in well with the sad and dark tone of the anime, sometimes all it took for me to start balling like a baby at a sad scene was for this particular theme to start playing softly in the background. So yeah, the music just adds to the brilliance of this amazing anime! The OP/Ed themes were pretty much flawless as well! Okay, admittedly I preferred some more than other but everyone is entitled to their own opinion, right?So Perhaps one of my favourite things about the show Blood+ is that despite it being an anime chock-a-bloc with deep, meaningful life lessons it never becomes too cheesy. I myself don’t seem to recall any big emotional speeches on the power of friendship, or believing in oneself which to be honest is a welcome relief! Despite the story-line having a fair amount of plot-twists and unexpected happenings the anime never becomes too complicated either, as I was soon to learn, everything happens for a reason!So that’s that then! Now you know of the wonder that is Blood+ At least, I hope you do, this is my first review you see so I hope I’ve done the show some ruddy justice! It’s the least it deserves for keeping me entertained and on the edge of my seat for three damn weeks!

So go watch it already, I promise you won’t be disappointed!', 'Blood+ was truly an interesting anime - it requires patience but once one starts to get accustomed with the pace and characters, it is an amazing anime.Story wise Blood+ starts slow. It takes time to develop, to let the elements of the story, for the characters to interact naturally rather than forcing them into a swirling bog to just push the story ahead. And it starts with the basic anime form: The basic elements are put forth - Chiropteran and Saya. One can assume that with the progression of stronger foes and conflicting feelings, there is nothing more to the anime than the main character...who is initially weak growing stronger to face all foes.However as the story progresses one finds out that it is not so. There will be additional elements which do not appear as a new boss might when the previous one dies. They actually develop a very intricate plot. And it\'s approach is slow. It takes four  to five episodes to let the character figure his/her own weakness and then stabilize as they would in a real world scenario. Claymore on the other hand (ignoring how its story progresses) manages to do all that in the first episode. Gantz takes up to three episodes for that.While this progression initially feels slow in contrast to animes like Mirai Nikki or Sword Art Online it becomes a positive because unnecessary character development and huge increments in power is avoided and there is time for small plot details to be handled. The story starts taking proper shape around the tenth episode and for a fifty episode anime that isn\'t too slow. There are various side stories and endeavors that combine together and connect (sometimes too big a coincidence) and keep the viewer up to date with all the characters. It is also a clever way of telling parts of the story from another perspective.So all in all it has a very complex and well thought story and yes - if I want I can sit down and find faults like ""did they close the gate or not"" but it is a good thing that in the entire anime such frivolous events are taken for granted. Meaning thinking about the guards changing shift is not our business.The art style isn\'t that bad for its time. The backgrounds are good and at times rather beautiful in terms of vibrant colors in contrast to dull underground moments. There isn\'t a fixed atmosphere, one will be able to see light slice of life like moments and one will see bloody sequences. And neither feel out of place.The character designs are mixed - Saya and Haji and Solomon (regardless of his stereotypical prince look) are drawn well - they have their physical traits that show detail in their art work. However there are a few characters (Kai for instance) that just seem like a few lines under a scruff of hair at times. It isn\'t that distracting but at times I feel Kai lose expressions or originality other than his hair. However this is being critical - the characters are more or less consistent with real-life proportions and we have one piece as well in which some character faces are very basic (ignoring the unrealistic proportions they at times have).The soundtracks in Blood+ Mostly left a positive impression on me - they had a nice gist to them and they were timed well. Emotions and scenario\'s are well expressed through suitable sound tracks. Fighting sequences were well complimented and so were the slice of life moments - much like the art they managed both sides well.Character development was a big positive for me in this anime. Yes, we do have the hero that at times is swayed and needs memories and friends n family to go through tough times but there is quite some work put in the development of different characters - some subtle characteristics that one notices afterwards and also traits that make them less predictable in the anime realm.Saya - as an instance did portray the typical shounen main hero (Ichigo for example) in which they are people who preach justice all the time and are against fighting (a better example would be Yuuto from Omamori Himari) however as the story progresses she gets stronger and mentally more mature and sees the situation from a different light - something that doesn\'t happen in a day or so.Kai, as much as I find his art style in the start not too good - is a good character, impulsive and daring however he isn\'t the guy you would always expect to go haywire due to his personality, who butts into everything for the sake of protecting everyone. Wow... that kind of reminds me of Kato in Gantz... although he was also properly crafted, a little less multi faceted as he was.Enjoyment wise it will take the anime about ten episodes to kick in - but then the believable characters, the complex plot, all of these elements combine to give what I\'d say is one of the best animes I have seen. It is well balanced - not diving into a world of needless action, nor is it slow enough to bore you.Thank you for reading and feedback is always appreciated. who is initially weak growing stronger to face all foes.However as the story progresses one finds out that it is not so.

However there are a few characters (Kai for instance) that just seem like a few lines under a scruff of hair at times. It isn\'t that distracting but at times I feel Kai lose expressions or originality other than his hair. However this is being critical - the characters are more or less consistent with real-life proportions and we have one piece as well in which some character faces are very basic (ignoring the unrealistic proportions they at times have).The soundtracks in Blood+ Mostly left a positive impression on me - they had a nice gist to them and they were timed well. Emotions and scenario\'s are well expressed through suitable sound tracks. Fighting sequences were well complimented and so were the slice of life moments - much like the art they managed both sides well.Character development was a big positive for me in this anime. Yes, we do have the hero that at times is swayed and needs memories and friends n family to go through tough times but there is quite some work put in the development of different characters - some subtle characteristics that one notices afterwards and also traits that make them less predictable in the anime realm.Saya - as an instance did portray the typical shounen main hero (Ichigo for example) in which they are people who preach justice all the time and are against fighting (a better example would be Yuuto from Omamori Himari) however as the story progresses she gets stronger and mentally more mature and sees the situation from a different light - something that doesn\'t happen in a day or so.Kai, as much as I find his art style in the start not too good - is a good character, impulsive and daring however he isn\'t the guy you would always expect to go haywire due to his personality, who butts into everything for the sake of protecting everyone. Wow... that kind of reminds me of Kato in Gantz... although he was also properly crafted, a little less multi faceted as he was.Enjoyment wise it will take the anime about ten episodes to kick in - but then the believable characters, the complex plot, all of these elements combine to give what I\'d say is one of the best animes I have seen. It is well balanced - not diving into a world of needless action, nor is it slow enough to bore you.Thank you for reading and feedback is always appreciated.', ""Story: Any vampire fans would appreciate the story; the ever-reusable (and reused) vampire legend gets a new spin here. From the very first episode, the main character Saya is unwittingly thrown into a fight for humanity that only she can put an end to. Accompanied by her (sexy) cellist guardian who has some link to her, she sets out to rid the world of the vampire-like chiropterans plaguing the earth. Fortunately for us, the story is quite a bit more complex than that. Very soon into the series, the story becomes deeper, with many twists revealed about Saya and her dark past.Art: From what...I have seen, this has a very unique art style, especially in that all the characters actually look unique. I'm referring to many other series where the characters all look ridiculously similar since they were designed by the same person. Also, the show has a decidedly dark atmosphere which is wonderfully presented in the animation. If you are a fan of much blood, also take comfort in knowing you'll find a lot here. It is in the title, after all.Sound: Personally I'm not a fan of any of the opening or closing themes, but the soundtrack is one of my favorites from any anime. Mark Mancina composed the score for Blood+ (turning him into an anime fan in the process) and was helped by Hans Zimmer, so it's the first anime I've seen where the music was written by someone not actually Japanese. Mancina's rich score is perfect for the show. The voice actors did wonderfully as well. Noteworthy is Kari Wahlgren as Saya (though I didn't approve of using her for Diva, too, whom she rather botched) and Crispin Freeman as Haji (for some reason, the mysterious and seemingly emotionless characters suit him).Character: Character development is great here, thanks mostly to Saya, who must grow from the timid amnesiac she begins the show as to a strong female warrior, and it is interesting to watch how this transformation really takes a toll on her personality. The other supporting characters also help contribute to the character development, to a certain extent. After my own heart, the show's creators let the audience in on the villain's side many times, allowing us to see their plans before the other characters do. Hooray for dramatic irony and moving forward of plotlines!Enjoyment: As I mentioned earlier, vampire fans who are sick of the &quot;same ol&rsquo;, same ol&rsquo;&quot; vampire stories will love this one. Really, the only similarity between &quot;traditional&quot; vampires and the ones in Blood+ are that they drink blood. Speaking of blood, if you are squeamish at the sight of cartoon blood, keep away from this for obvious reasons, as it would inhibit your enjoyment of the series tremendously. Anyone else would like Blood+ since it has a good amount of action, but doesn't deviate from the main plotline, which is surprisingly complex.Overall: Unless you don't like really violent anime, I would recommend this to anyone who likes vampires, action, drama, romance, and a good plot.

If you want to enjoy an anime with a dark tune, complex story and really great charakter development, Blood+ would be a good choice! But beware if you get too close to certain charakters, your heart might get broken!If you are looking for a fun and happy anime series, don't watch it. As I said before the anime is rather dark and as the name says bloody. There are some scenes that can be considered cruel (not only in a physical way).And one more warning, before the praise: If you're expecting tons...of action filled scenes, there will be some, but not as many as you might expect. Don't watch it if you get easily bored if there is no fight every five minutes.Very short summary: Saya needs to fight vampirelike creatures called Chiropteran, only she can kill. At her side are her friends, that support her and whom she wishes to protect. Her enemies on the other hand wish to create a world filled with Chiropterans and try to persuade Saya, that she should support them.Of course there is as usual a good side and a bad side. However Sayas enemies are not all pictured pure evil. There is no absolute black and white sight. Neither is Saya pictured as a flawless heroine. At some point you might even find yourself to be a little repelled.There are many episodes that follow a rather slow tune and can look like filler episodes at first glance. I still enjoyed them, because they showed how the characters changed as a response to all the traumatic things happening to them. It makes them all the more believable and helped me to get attached to them.I watched Blood+ two times now. The first time I was much younger than now. The second time I found myself beeing drawn to different characters than the first time. So this might be a sign that there is someone to like for younger and older people ;)And last but not least, soundtrack and art are amazing!

Enjoy watching!"", ""The plot had great potential but for many reasons the anime just couldn't keep me hooked for more than a few episodes.Never had I encountered such awkward voice acting. Equally awkward was the music throughout-lackluster, dry, and often inserted at the wrong moments.And the characters frustrated me(this is just a personal pet peeve.) They were dimensionless, although I can't say much about the main character, Saya, since I never finished the series.The biggest con for me is that the anime is incredibly SLOW. Again, this is just me, but I like my anime to have unrealistic timelines that doesn't bore me into multitasking while...watching an episode.Disclaimer: I realize that I have not seen all the episodes so my opinion is partial, but an important criteria when judging a show, to me, is that it captures the viewers into anticipating the next episode. The above was what I got from the first few (5 or 6) episodes.Verdict: good plot, terrible delivery. 2/10 watching an episode.Disclaimer: I realize that I have not seen all the episodes so my opinion is partial, but an important criteria when judging a show, to me, is that it captures the viewers into anticipating the next episode.

It has been a while since I saw it but now, after all this time, I feel I can really reflect on it. It's your typical vampire story with a twist. The beginning was extremely interesting, but after a while, it just got kinda boring, and in the end, I felt as if I had wasted a lot of my time. It could have ended a lot earlier instead of making it 50 episodes.The emphasis is more on the characters than the action, and all the fights are pretty much the same. Nothing that would really amaze me. This would have been alright if...it weren't for the fact that most of the characters were just annoying. I really couldn't stand Kai, especially considering how his relationship with Mao turned out. Saya was still unlikeable even after she seemed to have matured after the one year time skip.

I highly recommend this anime, as long as you don't mind some (a lot of) animated blood."", ""Way back in October I talked about the anime, Blood-C. In that review I briefly touched on my feelings towards its predecessor, Blood+. Well, apparently that snippet caused some curiosity and I got a request to review it. Blood+ was inspired by a film, Blood: The last Vampire. Now, I can't really tell you what I thought of that film since I've never seen it. This anime, from Production I.G, the same company that produced the film by the way, was my introduction to the series. Now, it has been a while since I watched this, so, because I care about giving you all the...most informed opinion possible, I'm going to re-watch the entire thing for review purposes. Let's take a look at Blood+.The story is pretty basic. There's a girl named Saya who gets attacked by a blood drinking monster. She's rescued by a mysterious stranger named Haji who gives her a sword and feeds her his blood. This causes something to awaken within her that she doesn't understand. The first half of the story follows Saya's quest to learn about her power and her past. The second half is about her previously forgotten mission. Sorry for being vague but, as usual, I'm trying to refrain from spoiling anything. One thing I do like about Blood+ is the pacing. It gives you enough time to acclimate to the characters and circumstances while keeping things moving at a good pace. There's very little that feels superfluous or like it drags. That being said, there are some unnecessary flashbacks that really only serve to go over information you already know or that they've already given you huge hints about. To be fair, most of the flashbacks are used to hint at information they haven't revealed yet and may, arguably, work but there are some that do act to the detriment of the series since you already know what happened or have a really good idea from the not so subtle hints they like to drop. One major issue I have with the story is at the very end. I won't go into details but there's a complete deus ex moment. They try to justify it through exposition after it happens but it really doesn't work since it comes out of nowhere. Which is odd coming from a series that likes to repeat important plot points and give lots of hints before they happen.My major issues with Blood+ come from the characters. I've mentioned this before, but Saya annoys me. She spends virtually the entire series being mopey and depressed even when her immediate circumstances are pretty happy. She's even kind of mopey before her circumstances start to get tragic. Admittedly, she does go through a lot of pain and heartache but it doesn't make for an interesting protagonist when she's perpetually gloomy. It might work in a twelve or thirteen episode anime, but it gets really grating when you have to deal with it for fifty episodes. The antagonists aren't any better. Most of them have really lazy motivations like just being jerks or being complete nutters. There is one antagonistic character who moves beyond that but he's typical in a different way. I don't want to spoil anything, but let's say he's a chivalrous gentleman. The main antagonist is the worst. She starts out fine with a backstory that gives her the potential to be a sympathetic character, but then she gets one of those turning irredeemably evil scenes. They try to pull away from that towards the end and make her sympathetic, but it doesn't work since the method they use is really stupid and she's already pole vaulted over the point of no return. Frankly, trying to make her sympathetic after that is pretty gross. I'd tell you what she does, but it would be a huge spoiler. Some of the supporting cast are interesting, particularly Kai, but most of them just lack depth.The art in this is really strong. The characters are well designed with the only major issue being that their eyes frequently go crossed for no reason. The backgrounds are well constructed and the action scenes have a good level of intensity while being well constructed. Although the amount of blood that breaks the laws of physics to gush out of wounds can be pretty ridiculous. Oh and, like Black Lagoon, there's a character in this who inexplicably never removes his sunglasses even when it's dark. I can kind of understand it in this case since they aren't good at drawing eyes, but that just makes you wonder why they only do it with one character.The voice acting is pretty good. The biggest issue is that most of the characters don't have a lot of emotional range so the seiyu tend to use the same general tone for most of the anime. They still do well though. Particularly Yoshino Hiroyuki and Saito Chiwa since they do get to demonstrate quite a bit of emotional range. The music varies. Some of it is kind of bland and some of it is really good. To give some examples, the music they use for victorious moments is excellent and the music they use for suspenseful scenes is overdone. It sounds more suitable for action scenes than suspense.The yuri factor is a 3/10. Saya and Kaori's relationship seems to go beyond friendship, but their relationship is only really explored in the first few episodes. They do get to interact a few times after that but there's not a lot of it. It would probably earn a higher rating if Kaori had a bigger role, but she doesn't.Now we move to the final rating. There are some interesting ideas here, the story is good, albeit flawed and the art is really well done. On the downside the characters aren't very well done, most of them are just lackluster, Saya is kind of obnoxious and the story does end rather weakly. My final rating is going to be a 6/10.

I said it was boring and dull, with some nice fighting scenes once in a while. After another 10-15 episodes, another friend asked me for my opinion on Blood+. I said it was one of the best anime series I saw this year. How do I feel after finishing the whole 50 chapters? Lets start from the beginning.Blood+ revolves around a story of a &quot;young&quot; girl who is the only person on the planet able to fight vampire-like monsters, called Chiropterans, and wants to find out about her troubled...past. But my biggest &quot;wow&quot; is not going to the plot (which sounds a little familiar to all of us). I have two big &quot;wows,&quot; actually. One is for graphics and one is for sound. Beautifully pictured landscapes across the world, pleasant characters and intense, realistic fight scenes will give your eyes a definite present. And what better way to complete this piece of art than adding an elegant soundtrack (Haji playing J.S. Bach on his cello is now in my top 10 anime moments ever) which polishes the sophistication and intelligence of this series. These are the things that keep you loyal to Blood+ and gives you a feeling that it is not an ordinary story.Of course, we have to be fair and talk a little about the downside of this series. Firstly, even if the story sounds kind of old, it is actually very complicated at times. You have to follow the conspiracies behind politics, the stories of Saya and other main characters, understand the importance of some individuals who don't really look important and so on. At one point I have to confess, I was tired of listening to story lines about Red Shield and Cinq Fleches organizations and all the problems they had when I just knew it was all about Saya, she is the one who can end this and she should be the main point of discussion. Therefore, prepare yourself for long conversations that could sometimes seem meaningless and if you are an &quot;action guy/girl&quot; you could be a bit disappointed.So, what is my final judgment? Well, I said to myself earlier in the series that the ending will probably decide the true quality of Blood+. However, although it wasn't as predictable as I thought it would be, I can't say that it left me unsatisfied. Actually, for some reason, I felt that I respect this anime series even more than I did in the beginning (especially after I saw the movie that this series evolved from, yuck). Do I recommend Blood+? Absolutely. There will be at least few moments when you will adore the characters and enjoy the story that we sometimes fantasize of being a part of.P.S. IF YOU DID NOT WATCHED BLOOD+ YET, DO NOT READ THIS!A part of me is still screaming for an ending where Saya falls asleep at the last moment of the fight against Diva, leaving the world domination to the Chiropterans.

There was a nice blend of humor mixed in with plenty of supernatural drama and action.  The story only gets better as the anime goes on, and the characters are all entrancing.  It is not your normal vampire anime, but has a very unique view and intriguing plot that is believable.  The only problem may be the English version of the anime.  I find the voice actors completely off par with the Japanese voice actors, though I feel this way about most : )  The music is also...amazing, with some great j-rock songs and an amazing song sung by the character Diva.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes darker, more serious anime with just enough humor that the drama is not overbearing. amazing, with some great j-rock songs and an amazing song sung by the character Diva.

Once I got started, I could hardly stop.It is interesting to see the change the main character goes through, and it is a very interesting relationship she had to people around her.At first, the story may seem confusing, but of course it all comes together as you get more and more into the story.

Blood+ is definitely a must watch anime and one that should be re-watched over and over. It is one anime that has supernatural features, slight parts of romance, and even some historical event correlation intertwined in this fictional world that has the inhabitants called chiropterans; bat-like creatures that feast on human blood. I, myself am not one who favors all gore and blood soaked scenes, but the story in Blood+ really captivates me. The bloody fight scenes all connect to the main plot and is not one excessive blood fest. Plus, this anime is...one of those shows that gets you &quot;hooked&quot; and makes you think strategically and use problem-solving to sort of determine what is what and how things work.Now getting to the characters, they are wonderfully drawn and thought out, each with their own obvious personality. Even with the side-characters, they all equally stand out and none are really overshadowed. It isn't one of those animes that add filler characters to let the story drag on and what not. Once characters are drawn in Blood+, they are kept and have their own scene time throughout the whole thing (meaning Saya is not the center of all the attention).One downfall to the characters are their character development. Most of the time, they hold rare emotional view points and don't develop quite as fast. When watching, one usually feels a part of the anime (if it's a really good one), but the characters perceived by myself are somewhat 2-D and impersonal. Other than that, this anime is of course a great one that should be on everyone's watched/will watch list and even though I am not even finished with it yet, I am most definitely impressed with high standards and cannot believe how I missed watching such an excellent anime. one of those shows that gets you &quot;hooked&quot; and makes you think strategically and use problem-solving to sort of determine what is what and how things work.Now getting to the characters, they are wonderfully drawn and thought out, each with their own obvious personality.

I mean sure there's action and gore time to time but I'm afraid that's not enough to compensate for the poor pacing. Very slow and boring anime.  I'll avoid watching this if i was you. "", '""It is beyond blood. I have formed a bond with you sweeter and stronger than Blood."" - SolomonBlood+ is an interesting anime- not because it\'s particularly innovative or groundbreaking in its field, but precisely because it does what it does well, and doesn\'t fall victim to mistakes and tropes that many other shonen fantasy anime have, and continue to do. The premise is a twist on vampire fiction- taking many points from classic bloodsucking media, and yet giving it an anime spin, mixing the two in an enjoyable way that doesn\'t rip the fabric of the fiction.Artwork and Animation: 7Production IG produced Blood+ starting...in fall of 2005, running for a full year. The visual style is rather reminiscent of the then-newly ending series Ghost in the Shell SAC 2nd- the character models, faces, hair and particularly the scenery look very similar. One thing this anime does have going for it in the visual department is a large amount of costume and locale changes. This might sound small- but watching the same nameless streets in downtown Tokyo for 9 hours would have been really grating.Blood+ keeps it fresh by travelling across the world, including Japan, Vietnam, Siberia, French wine country + Paris, London, New York, and a few other locations- always with famous landmarks to let the viewer in on it. On the whole, the animation is fairly average- certainly a product of the time, but very watchable.Sound and Voice Acting: 7The voice acting is decent at best, and wooden at worst. Christopher Nissley as David sounds wholly uninterested and bored the entire show. Maybe it\'s that his character is the stoic tough guy, but even in rare moments of vulnerability, he\'s still the same pinewood 2X4 that he was to begin with. Kari Wahlgren of Fate/ (as the Saber) fame stars as Saya- to my surprise. She sounds entirely different in Blood+ than she does now in Fate. 10 years of aging has changed her voice a lot, but she anchors the cast fairly well regardless.Crispin Freeman (Kirei Kotomine, Fate) deserves an award for this show- having voiced 3 main characters, and so effectively doing so that it was not noticeable! He\'s most prominent as Haji, the silent and strong companion of Saya, and he affects a passable French accent for Van Argiano. Rounding out the trio, he also uses rather young sounding but commanding voice for Joel Goldschmidt, as well as voicing other unimportant one off characters and background voices.The music in Blood+ is beautiful as well- featuring opera, a few classic symphonic tunes, and a lot of cello- typically featured when the character Haji plays- but also used in tense and dramatic moments. The music was very effective at eliciting the right emotional feel at the right time, and never felt overbearing.Characters and Story: 8Given that this anime spans 50 episodes, there are a lot of characters introduced- 10 just on the protagonist Saya\'s side of the conflict, and nearly the same on the other. This is not the place to list them all or their inner conflicts, but suffice to say that everyone of importance receives their appropriate due of characterization- though the story is the journey of Saya. The character motivations are fairly logically driven, and the concept of loyalty, loyalty that goes beyond blood is a defining theme throughout the story.It\'s also interesting to see how the conflict of the show grows from a tiny microcosm at the beginning, to a world spanning conflict- though it never feels overwhelming. The conflict itself also changes from a journey of exploration to petty revenge, to redemption, and eventually to acceptance.Blood+ does have pacing issues, however. New goals or new villains are introduced in the beginning, particularly, with no explanation at all in the prior episode, leaving the viewer feeling like as though they skipped an episode. There were two moments I can remember where I actually did go back to the last episode for a little recap just because it was such a jarring shift. These issues largely clear up after the first cour (13 episodes) ends- so it\'s a bit of a trial period, but it\'s very worth it to see how it all comes together.The show also does a very good job of making immortal and near immortal enemies very difficult to kill without devolving into Team Rocket blasting off again™, or the classic ""I\'ll get you next time!"" by the mustachio-twirling villain. The humans really are nearly powerless to stop the chiropterans- and it stays that way throughout. The Chevaliers, or vampires made from the blood of Saya, or her sister Diva, can only be killed with the blood of one of the two- and this point is proven over and over again. Several times throughout the show, the characters will stop fighting solely because they recognize and say to each other that it\'s pointless to fight as they cannot kill each other.This brings me to my next point about attention to detail- the show is full of it. Small details and what seem like offhand comments about abilities or weaknesses are stuck to, to the letter. What seem like plot holes are filled in very carefully with details from previous episodes or findings- very little-to-no deus ex machina here.Drawing from the earlier comment about vampire fiction- there are several different groups and types of vampires in the show- each with a different facet of the accepted ""vampire powers"". Some can\'t be exposed to the sun, some have incredible speed or hypnosis powers. The base chiropterans themselves are a reference to the order that bats belong to: Chiroptera. Many of the beasts have long, ratlike snouts and webbed, winged arms. They all require blood, though- and that\'s what makes the show go round. Blood ties all.Lastly- the way the story is handled is a very mature and dramatic way, for a shonen. There are moments of real tragedy and gravitas in there- and a couple of truly horrifying moments that continue to serve up grimaces long after the event, once it\'s revealed what actually happened. This is a show that\'s not afraid to kill off main characters- and even requires it of the plot. There are a few genuinely sad and touching moments- a rarity in what could otherwise just have been a mind numbing action fest.Enjoyment and Overall: 7I was pleasantly surprised with Blood+. I typically shy away from long running series; even one that clocks in at 50 episodes, but I have to hand it to them- I remained engaged, interested, and wanting to see what happens next (in part thanks to the cliffhangers). The only thing that really threw me off was the really poor pacing in the first third of the show, but aside from that, a solid watch.Bonus: The Blood+ Drinking Game, by LawlMartzLick a shot when:1) There\'s a closeup cut to Haji\'s face and he says ""Saya"" in a sensuous, hushed whisper2) A flashback occursTake a sip when:3) A chiropteran transforms onscreen4) Someone mentions Vietnam5) Louis is eating something6) Mao gets bitchyFinish your drink when:7) A Chevalier or important character diesDon\'t be afraid to drop me a comment and all that, and as always- come rage at me. in fall of 2005, running for a full year.

He\'s most prominent as Haji, the silent and strong companion of Saya, and he affects a passable French accent for Van Argiano. Rounding out the trio, he also uses rather young sounding but commanding voice for Joel Goldschmidt, as well as voicing other unimportant one off characters and background voices.The music in Blood+ is beautiful as well- featuring opera, a few classic symphonic tunes, and a lot of cello- typically featured when the character Haji plays- but also used in tense and dramatic moments. The music was very effective at eliciting the right emotional feel at the right time, and never felt overbearing.Characters and Story: 8Given that this anime spans 50 episodes, there are a lot of characters introduced- 10 just on the protagonist Saya\'s side of the conflict, and nearly the same on the other. This is not the place to list them all or their inner conflicts, but suffice to say that everyone of importance receives their appropriate due of characterization- though the story is the journey of Saya. The character motivations are fairly logically driven, and the concept of loyalty, loyalty that goes beyond blood is a defining theme throughout the story.It\'s also interesting to see how the conflict of the show grows from a tiny microcosm at the beginning, to a world spanning conflict- though it never feels overwhelming. The conflict itself also changes from a journey of exploration to petty revenge, to redemption, and eventually to acceptance.Blood+ does have pacing issues, however. New goals or new villains are introduced in the beginning, particularly, with no explanation at all in the prior episode, leaving the viewer feeling like as though they skipped an episode. There were two moments I can remember where I actually did go back to the last episode for a little recap just because it was such a jarring shift. These issues largely clear up after the first cour (13 episodes) ends- so it\'s a bit of a trial period, but it\'s very worth it to see how it all comes together.The show also does a very good job of making immortal and near immortal enemies very difficult to kill without devolving into Team Rocket blasting off again™, or the classic ""I\'ll get you next time!"" by the mustachio-twirling villain. The humans really are nearly powerless to stop the chiropterans- and it stays that way throughout. The Chevaliers, or vampires made from the blood of Saya, or her sister Diva, can only be killed with the blood of one of the two- and this point is proven over and over again. Several times throughout the show, the characters will stop fighting solely because they recognize and say to each other that it\'s pointless to fight as they cannot kill each other.This brings me to my next point about attention to detail- the show is full of it. Small details and what seem like offhand comments about abilities or weaknesses are stuck to, to the letter. What seem like plot holes are filled in very carefully with details from previous episodes or findings- very little-to-no deus ex machina here.Drawing from the earlier comment about vampire fiction- there are several different groups and types of vampires in the show- each with a different facet of the accepted ""vampire powers"". Some can\'t be exposed to the sun, some have incredible speed or hypnosis powers. The base chiropterans themselves are a reference to the order that bats belong to: Chiroptera. Many of the beasts have long, ratlike snouts and webbed, winged arms. They all require blood, though- and that\'s what makes the show go round. Blood ties all.Lastly- the way the story is handled is a very mature and dramatic way, for a shonen. There are moments of real tragedy and gravitas in there- and a couple of truly horrifying moments that continue to serve up grimaces long after the event, once it\'s revealed what actually happened. This is a show that\'s not afraid to kill off main characters- and even requires it of the plot. There are a few genuinely sad and touching moments- a rarity in what could otherwise just have been a mind numbing action fest.Enjoyment and Overall: 7I was pleasantly surprised with Blood+. I typically shy away from long running series; even one that clocks in at 50 episodes, but I have to hand it to them- I remained engaged, interested, and wanting to see what happens next (in part thanks to the cliffhangers). The only thing that really threw me off was the really poor pacing in the first third of the show, but aside from that, a solid watch.Bonus: The Blood+ Drinking Game, by LawlMartzLick a shot when:1) There\'s a closeup cut to Haji\'s face and he says ""Saya"" in a sensuous, hushed whisper2) A flashback occursTake a sip when:3) A chiropteran transforms onscreen4) Someone mentions Vietnam5) Louis is eating something6) Mao gets bitchyFinish your drink when:7) A Chevalier or important character diesDon\'t be afraid to drop me a comment and all that, and as always- come rage at me.', ""If you watched Blood C and you didn't think it was very good, don't let that keep you away from Blood+.Story 10/10I thought that Blood+ was really well done. If I had to pick a favorite part of Blood+ I think it would be the story. I love when a show has a story that takes a lot of episodes to play out, but doesn't ever loose focus. This is what Blood+ does best. The concept is fairly simple but there are many complexities that you discover as the show progresses.Art 8/10For an anime made in 2006 this show is on par...with what you would expect. By the standards set by more recent shows it is nothing special, but it still good. The characters are well depicted and I have nothing to complain about.Sound 10/10The soundtrack is very well done. It is produced by Mark Mancina/Hans Zimmer and if you are familiar with any of their work then you know what to expect. The opening and ending songs are fantastic. I especially love the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th openings. The 3rd opening is one of my all time favorites. The 4th is done by Jinn. Some people can't stand the vocals of Jinn but I came to enjoy them (Jinn is the same artist that performed the second Code Geass OP).Characters 9.5/10I thought the characters of Blood+ where very good.

It did have a good initial setup that made me curious about Saya's past, but I'd recommend just skipping around after the first 2 episodes to get the basic gist of what happened afterwards since the execution isn't that worthy to waste time over (it's another one of those mandatory tragic backstory to prep for the character...development later). Second half is pretty ok personally since Haji felt more relevant. The compositions/panelling of the scenes are also dull in my opinion; it didn't really do its job to enhance the ominous atmosphere the slow pacing seems to try to get at. With that being said, if you wanted to watch it over the battle scenes overall, I wouldn't; it's bland in the entirety of the show.In spite of the R17+ cause of the blood/violence, the story itself is probably better oriented for around 14 yr olds. I would've definitely enjoyed it more at a younger age, as it would be more difficult to guess the plot. If you decided to watch this after watching shows like FMA, boku no hero academia, one punch man, attack on titan, tokyo ghoul or code geass, it's best not to watch this; it'll be way too boring.

Though I have watched countless of anime, this anime has one of the most lasting and strongest impression on me.-----Story-----In the beginning, the story is gritty and hard to watch as it lays down the foundation for the plot, but the pace quickens as it reaches the middle.  While the story may be somewhat predictable, it manages to deliver the predictable plot in a refreshing way.  50 episodes may sound alot, however while watching it, it has managed to hold me...on the edge of the seat to watch it right to the end.  The story itself seems plain and nothing special, but it dives into the details making you to want more.   The plot development was well done, leaving no loop holes to anyone to guess at.  A well rounded development in both story and plot.------Art-----Its art is better than the general anime.  Yet while watching you may notice the intricate details that the artist has drawn in - the weapons, the scenery. The expressions of the characters have been drawn well.------Sound------The soundtrack of this anime is one of the most amazing ones I have heard.  The essence of the scene captured perfectly. It was been able to convey the emotions of what one might feel in that situation without much support of the art. Moreover to listen to it on its on, despite not being much of a classical music fan, I have found it extremely enjoyable to listen to.  Having said that, it was composed by Mark Mancina who is a Hollywood composer, having such an excellent soundtrack might not be such a surprise after all.-----Character-----Most animes lack proper character development, animes that have good character development are few and I am probably able to count on without them without using my toes.  Blood+ however, specializes in this.  Each character developed proper with an indepth view of his/her background and personality change.  This makes its refreshing to watch.-----Value-----I seldom re-watch animes and animes rated 8 and above are too few to count.  I have enjoyed Blood+ throughly despite having re-watched far too much (I think 10x times is a little too much too) on the edge of the seat to watch it right to the end.

Creatively titled Blood+, the show seems to disavow the ""last vampire"" claim. Because Saya isn\'t the ""last vampire."" Notwithstanding the plot holes of the movie in which she wasn\'t the ""last vampire"" either...Whatever.This is a 50 episode tour de force that tries to really do everything at once.So, Saya. She\'s a vampire, or rather something called Chiroptera (it\'s a generic name for all bat like critters, but for the english subs it\'s what Vampires are in the show). She has several unusual characteristics. She\'s dormant for most of her life,...awakening only to mate or kick ass.But she is more of a solitary, withdrawn creature and prefers just to kick ass when the US military (who happen to ""own"" her at the time) choose to use her. Apparently they tried to awaken her when she wasn\'t ready in \'Nam and she went batshit crazy. Somehow her care was then entrusted to a guy called David--whose special forces squad she massacred.Fast forward to the present or near future, and Saya is living in Okinawa with David and two of David\'s adopted sons, Kai and Riku. She has no knowledge of being a vampire thing until an incident at school ""awakens"" her.Apparently Saya is a queen of a species that has a complex life cycle not unlike bees where queens spawn male drones and have sterile workers/soldiers. This entire concept has been exploited by various organizations. But in short, there are generic drones (the usual ugly primitive vampire brutes that act like the usual fodder for mass slaugther) then there are chevaliers, sort of like male bees--their job being protecting a queen and mating with her twin to propagate the species. Artificially created chevaliers fit somewhere into all of this, too.And this is where it begins: a story that encompasses several timelines, involves over a dozen key characters, and another dozen or so supporting ones and keeps unraveling in complexity. The problem is that when it makes transitions, it does so abruptly and makes for poor continuity (especially seen with flashbacks, advancing time, etc.)There\'s Saya\'s past--a strange zoo where she was raised along with her sister Diva and their chevaliers at the hand of a kind man she saw as a kindly father, but apparently had different interests in her twin. There\'s the several ""present"" storylines where an unaging Saya and her gypsy chevalier Haji find out more and more about their past and Diva, as the other characters age and grow up and interact with Diva\'s chevaliers and creatures artificially made as Chrioptera research by mysterious government organizations.Her present tries to tie all of this together, and implies as Saya has been sleeping events that began at the zoo continue to transpire and as time wears on, she becomes more and more aware of the chiropteran/Diva threat that the seed of which was planted at the zoo.All of this is rather complex and results in several plot holes, continuity errors, and duplicated characters which makes the anime very clumsy. There\'s too much going on, the show is trying to accomplish too many things at once before it chooses a direction and starts to prune everyone off as it approaches the end.With that said, Diva is an unexpectedly complex character whose superficial cruelty and barbarism hide a rather genuine and troubled soul. Her devlopment, from just a stock antagonist is one of the pleasantly suprising elements of the anime.  The problem is that Saya is not a very well developed character, despite being the lead. She seems weak and unmotivated, eternally tired and hurt, constantly being dragged along by the other characters--a premise that gets old. Even the eventual realization that she is this way because she\'s murdering her own kind (kinda obvious) it doesn\'t excuse for her rather simplistic and one-dimensional characterization.Diva has the luxury of being persecuted, wronged, wanting to be loved, hating humanity, not understanding herself... all of which make her fascinating, and yet, ironically, is one of the less developed characters. Saya just seems flat, and too much of the attention is focused on her brooding.Then there\'s the issue of Diva\'s chevaliers... most of them are similar, and the arcs where Saya hunts them down are rather redundant. Red Shield makes their own chevaliers--and they\'re mostly also redundant. There\'s so much filler that it takes away from what is otherwise a decent story and makes this tiresome instead of a pleasure to watch.Trimming many of the story arcs and characters, and developing a few more would have made this show shine.

Action-wise the animation felt a little dull but not terrible.SoundWell I watched the English dub for this one, the voice actors where well chosen but nothing extraordinary yet again.Opening and Ending was average yet again..i mean average comes to mind so much I dunno what else to say.Story...One word keeps coming to mind when I think about the story…..POTENTIAL.Once I got to the end of the anime and I knew the whole story I found myself thinking it had a lot of potential but the implementation of the story was mismatched, slow and it just feels very anti-climactic. I was disappointed because it felt like the story stole elements from various other anime and it came off like another TYPICAL monsters vs. the hero anime. I think people who watched the movie blood will definitely be disappointed with the scope of story but then again that’s just my opinion.CharacterThe whole range of characters include military guys, scientists, whiny useless tag-alongs and siya herself.

I was all set to give Blood + a perfect 10, a honor which only Evangelion has received from me before (excuse the tongue-in-cheek ego) but while the series was great for 40 or so episodes it just couldn't land the ending. I will try not to reveal much but I need to get this off my chest. To me its almost as if the original writer died before the series was finished and didn't tell anyone how it was supposed to end. So some guy who has only seen a few clips...of the previous episode comes along and writes an ending based on limited knowledge. Other than Haji's kick ass fight scenes in the final episodes (I wont spoil much but any fight scene in which someone is impaled on the Chrysler Building and then is struck by lightning kicks ass). Also in the last five episodes when it started to have semi-political undertones and started to portray Americans as devious scheming bastards who nuke something whenever the shit hits the fan also turned me off. Read my lips; POLITICS HAS NO PLACE IN ANIME! The last episode was for me a let down and a pain to watch after I had such I hopes for the series. Blood + really is good but in retrospect it never should have gotten a 10 to begin with.Ok on to the review:Story:Up until the final quarter of the series the story is pretty engaging and there are some story arcs where you find yourself almost forced to watch the next episode in order to see what happens. There are several twists and turns, several &quot;I did not see that coming&quot; moments and a fair amount of mystery and revelations for the majority of the series. The only reason I give the Story a 7 is because as I said the ending was just that much of a disappointment for me.Art:The graphics were stunning. Ive only seen a few animes with better eye candy than in Blood + which is surprising because usually these kind of action/adventure animes are not known for their graphics. Character Designs are pretty good for the most part as well. 9 out of 10.Sound:I could be wrong but I think Hans Zimmer was involved with this Anime. Even if he wasnt the music in Blood + tops that of any anime I have seen except maybe for Kanon and possibly Clannad. The voice actors did a superb job as well. I cant think of anything wrong with the sound in Blood + so perfect 10.Character:For an anime that takes 50 episodes to reach its conclusion you really would expect more from the characters. With a few exceptions among the top few characters, Blood + offers very little in the way of background story for a large portion of the major characters. We learn very little about most of the villains and we only get a taste of many of the protagonist's stories. Also the characters feel one dimensional near the end of the series so their development and behavior is very inconsistent. Normally I wouldn't complain this much because they did give a sufficient amount of back story for the two main characters but since we are stuck with them for 50 episodes I kinda felt like the characters around Saya seemed a bit too hollow (nothing to do with Bleach). 6 out of 10Enjoyment:What can I say I watched an anime that was 50 episodes long so I obviously enjoyed it, at least episodes 1-40. Ok I admit I first started watching it because I saw Saya wielding a Katana in a school uniform and so Blood + joins the the long list of Anime that have lured me in with such tactic but it is one of the few that I have seen to its conclusion, granted the conclusion was a bit of a let down but still. I recommend this Anime. Even though it doesn't warrant a 10 or even a 9, it is still an overall enjoyable experience. 8 out of 10Overall:Blood + is much like Saya's acrobatics in the first episode.

It is a truely moving storyline and to those who love action/heroics/love stories this is the series for you.There is nothing i could put down about...this anime because everything has been polished up to the best standards. The sounds also have a huge effect on how the emotions get put across with the music and intrumentals playing at just the right times to create that particular nerve wracking atmosphere.highly recommended this anime because everything has been polished up to the best standards.

At first, it seems that it’s a typical anime about vampires but then you realize that there is not typical. The plot is quite original. This anime keeps many mysteries and doesn’t disclose all the cards until the end. Even in the end we have place for the imagination.. For example, (how can I do no spoiler?!  =.=) what will be with Haji and Saya, Kai and girls. Their future remains a mystery. Some say that 50 episodes it\'s too long but I would have looked more 50! After all, it would be interesting to see history from Diva’s eyes, to...find out what will happen than, to sea the history of the mummy.Of course in anime there are some minuses but they aren’t so big.

For the anime Blood Plus, most of the people were involved in some way with previously mentioned Stand Alone Complex. Could this group and Studio match the success and magic of their previous work(s)? Did Blood Plus reach the feats and grit that the movie Blood The Last Vampire (2000) had, and create an in-depth and interesting storyline?Our main character, Saya Otonashi, has amnesia and is under care of an adoptive family living near...a US airbase on Okinawa Island. One day, her simple life is interrupted when she is attacked by a strange blood feeding bat-human creature called a Chiropteran. Saya quickly learns she is the only one that can kill these things due to her own blood crystalizing the creature’s blood. Over the course of the 50 episode series, Saya embarks on a world-wide journey (with sidekicks) to defeat an evil organization, uncover the history of the Chiropterans, and her own past.At the time, or at least in the first few episodes, the animation was superb. However, it quickly became mediocre even for 2005. Details began to disappear in return for still images. The show itself can be split in half in terms of quality and the plot being interesting. Blood Plus’ first half builds mystery to the characters, a complex conspiracy, and some fairly decent shock drama. However, the series then dives into a collection of terrible sub-arcs, some deaths, explosions, but in the end turns into a hot mess.Blood Plus goes from outstanding and tense to a mellow over dramatic story. Each fight quickly becomes not only episodic but also either prolonged fights for the sake of extending it to another episode, or the audience being forced to listen to the dying words and life tale of said victim. The goal was probably to ultimately lead to a crazy finale in which the Studio clearly lost sight of long ago. Everything becomes so predictable and repetitive for the show that even the monster-of-the-week fight scenes and the overall chase plot becomes a snooze-fest.It is really hard to enjoy a show that has become a bit of a cult classic when pacing is a little on the dull side, animation quality deteriorates hard, a show clogged with uninteresting subplots that are never truly answered, plus a main plot that is delayed just for the sake of more episodes.

I guess this show is not worth rewatching if you\'re not as forgetful as me.The series\' enviroment is good and the soundtrack is also good. I loved almost all the openings and endings (there are 4 each). But the plot... oh boy, that could have been great. The plotline is: the main character has to kill all the chiropteans (vampires) and Diva, the main antagonist (also a chiroptean). Sounds really stupid but at some points this is very well played and really entertaining. Also, there\'s a little discussion...about blood family VS non-related family, which is interesting but poorly executed. It could be a really good show if it wasn\'t for Saya, who is really tedious, and all this ""humans VS chiropteans"" thing, that mostly shows a self-centered mankind and a stupid and entirely avoidable fight (oddly, chiropteans noticed it quicker than humans).The main character, Saya Otonashi, looks like a pretty good heroine at the beginning. But then you start discovering that she\'s just a really really spoiled kid who can\'t think about anyone except herself and some people she might befriend. For years and years, she keeps trying to kill Diva because Diva is supposedly bad. But that\'s not true. Diva is indeed something like a psycho but it\'s because she\'s been tortured and used her whole life. It would be reasonable (and tragic) to hunt Diva if Saya didn\'t know about this but she\'s given evidence about it ALL THE TIME. There\'s even a chapter where someone TELLS HER about it and stuff. And Saya does what??? Instead of saying ""Ok, you guys are SO DAMN CRAZY and you TORTURED SOMEONE FOR YEARS and now you\'re trying to kill her, it\'s pretty obvious she would hate all of you. I\'M OUT, I\'m not killing anyone, you\'re all really crazy people, go get some treatment"", she says something like ""Ooooh, nooo, this all my fault, she\'s sooooo bad, she killed the bastard who tortured her because she\'s bad, she\'s naturally bad, nothing but bad, I will kill Diva because she\'s bad. Have I already said she\'s bad??? Oh, I hate Diva, she\'s bad, bad, bad"". That\'s so spoiled I can\'t stand it. Saya is one of the worst protagonists I\'ve ever seen because she\'s (em)pathetic with basically anyone except Diva, for just no reason (the only possible reason is: she\'s spoiled).Diva, on the other hand, is a very interesting character and I dare to say she\'s the only reason you should watch this show. She one of the best antagonists I\'ve ever seen and she has a great background story. She\'s MUCH MORE interesting than Saya even though the show doesn\'t focus much on her (at least, not compared with Saya).Also, all that Siff stuff is really, really boring. The only good thing about them is that you can have some laughs since they look like goth teenagers (I found it really funny, sorry).The end of the story is also pretty dull and foreseeable. about blood family VS non-related family, which is interesting but poorly executed.

I found it nice to see and watch a good type of 50ep anime that gets to be a rare thing these days. If you are a fan of blood sucking ""vampires"" you can star this one and go with the flow and watch the story.For me, I personally love it and is one of my forever favorite anime in my entire life and time. I have watched it as a young kid on TV, being fascinated by the openings, Saya\'s character and of course, my personal forever one and only crush, Haji.Reporting on a present...day (2023) i think it will be considered outdated or lack of plot with cringe characters but I think you should watch till season 2 to see how the story unfolds. day (2023) i think it will be considered outdated or lack of plot with cringe characters but I think you should watch till season 2 to see how the story unfolds.', 'Perfect score. I really enjoyed this anime despite not being directly related to Blood the Last Vampire. I enjoyed it anyway.This anime starts off slow, getting to know the main characters a little. and then gradually builds them up. The character development in this series is suburb. You grow up with these characters and feel their hardships in the stuff they face.Not only that but you get to see some great vampire fights.Even if you havent seen Blood the Last Vampire, you will still enjoy this. It is filled with twists and tragedies that will have you crying yourself.I would definitely recommends this to anyone...who enjoys a great story and great characters. who enjoys a great story and great characters.', 'Blood+ is a very touching and dark story. The story is about a young girl, (Saya) who has a very unfair destiny to complete. Maybe, the first image you get when you read the summary of this anime, is a boring story about some violence, vampires and lots of blood. That\'s absolutely not the point here! The reason I gave the story a high score (Rate: 9) is because of the thrilling scenes and very tense moments. You can not stop watching. The first episode begins peaceful, but you discover after ten minutes the opposite; another reason why the story is very good. ""You never...know what happends next."" I don\'t want to spoil, so I ain\'t able to describe more about the story, than saying it drags you in. If you have completed the anime, it will hunts you down for some weeks. Especially the last ten episodes, when the final showdown is near its end. And, I said earlier: it\'s not only dark, mysterical and exciting, it\'s touching too. Sometimes, I nearly started crying. At the end I cried for sure. It\'s so unfair and sad. But although the anime spins around darkness, it has its happy and comics too. That\'s another good thing about the anime.The art is not very special. (Rate: 8)  It matches good with the story\'s darkness, but it\'s not astonishing. Backgrounds and overvieuws are breathtaking, but the characters could be a little better. Don\'t think it\'s bad, but it\'s not amazing too. The second part (episode 25 -- 50 ) looks way better than the first. Maybe because Saya\'s hair is longer and she wears another suit?The music is perfect. The OST\'s are very well made and do match the moments, scenes and episodes brilliantly. I gave this one a 10. The openings are nice too. :)Characters. I discoverd my interesting for almost every character in this anime. They are pieces of the anime, everyone is important and has something to do with the events. If one would be erased, the anime could fall apart. That is a very nice thing. So you are sure you don\'t look to some unimportant persons who\'ll never show up again. Every person has its own history and stories. They are not put in ""good"" or ""bad"". Sometimes, good persons turn into bad guys, and the opposite can be too. The main character Saya isn\'t a very holy character at all. This makes the anime interesting. Relationships, friendships, family and love is in every episode. Some more than another, but you can find them growing or beginning to grow. Maybe, you didn\'t expect something like that in this anime? Yes, you can be assured of that! No, Blood+ isn\'t very unorginal and boring anymore, do you think?My enjoyment is a 10 as well. I think I had every emotion with this 50 episodes. I could be angry because of some moments, or was laughing my ass off. At the end and in the middle, I cried. It was just too sad. And I had moments I watched three hours at night. Yeah, very addicted. :)My average rate is a 9. I am very happy I tried this anime and watched it completely. I am sure it was one of the best animes in my life. I think everyone can like Blood+, because it\'s divers and isn\'t only about blood or something like that. It\'s very touching, has it\'s happy, sad and tense moments.

Ranging from egoistic, funny, morally over desperate, lovable, childish, weak to downright evil, fanatic  and insane.And there are a lot of characters, by covering any major concievable aspect, the anime fails to give each of them a compelling background-story or enough ""prime-time"" to fully develope.

By the time the anime ends over a dozen substories have been created and most of them  wont be finished. The end is horribly designed and features ""deus ex machina"" in all its glory. Also the entire story could have been told in around half the episodes, without any noticable loss.But my main problem with the anime is not it\'s story. Blood+ is completly, fundamentally illogical. Each anime has a set of rules under which it operates.Like ""vampires burn if they go into the sun"", ""Shinigami can\'t die, they just go back to the realm of dead"" etc. Blood+ violates his own set with a to me yet unkown consistency.The entire story is based on a fundamental rule ""The only one beeing able to kill the vampire-like-creatures is Saya"", it adheres to this rule for just a few episodes, than ignores it, states it again (and keeps stating it until nearly the end), gets proven wrong (severing the head/burning works just fine), but ignores this by saying humans are not able to do this, although they have already done it. This continues by proclaiming those creatures can\'t kill each other, which gets also silently changed. New rules are introduced, old ones are forgotten, reawakend and changed just to proceed the storyline.

Enjoyed the character development a lot. I would recommend if you want to watch an anime that continues past 12 episode cap. Very amusing, will definitely watch again. ', 'This was one of the very first anime that I watched; along with Higurashi and Elfen Lied. So obviously I didn\'t have much experience in what made anime good or bad. However, by now I\'ve watched dozens of anime and I feel that I\'ve allowed it enough time to settle in my mind.Story & Character:The plot itself is compelling and interesting; there wasn\'t anything cheesy or drastically overblown as you sometimes run into with anime. No chaff or filler episodes to my recollection; all ~50 episodes stay on track.I like all of the characters, for the most part: the main character has an annoying...tendency to state the most obvious crap that made me want to face palm; she also screams (the same way) every time she gets into a fight which became pretty funny to me by the end.Art & Sound: Nothing stood out.Enjoyment:This anime definitely nails the whole ""rising action"" thing; it is paced very well and I wasn\'t able to put it down. Before I knew it, it was finished and I was seeing the credits. The Achilles Heel of the show, I feel, is the main character\'s lack of a strong personality and staying power, relative to others in different anime.

I don’t know why; it was probably the weird presentation of an otherwise simplistic premise. Some years later, some other dudes decide to make a series out of this and the result is Blood+. The tale of an apparently normal high school girl forced to take part in a sinister conspiracy that aims to make humanity food for vampire-like freaks.To make a long story short, the series has a very good concept and interesting characters but its presentation lacks the stuff that would make it great. Here...are the reasons:1) Long duration / Slow pacing. The show lasts twice as it should; it is 50 episodes long yet it might as well be only 26. The reason is simple, many episodes feel like minor side quests or filler missions that in the longrun only manage to hinder the progress of the main story with characters and storylines that lack excitement and tire the viewer.2) Passive crybaby main character. Very few like such protagonists. A dynamic character would have done the same things in half the time instead of constantly doubting and holding back or crying in a corner. Although the basic motto of the series is to portrait a normal girl as she steadily becomes more decisive and active, it doesn’t change the fact that the main heroine is going around in circles. One moment she is trembling in fear, then she suddenly finds the strength to fight, then she reverts back to how she was… 20 times in a row. It gets REALLY bothersome. It is excused the first few times but when it keeps happening over and over, then it pisses you off.3) Lack of focus on secondary characters. Saya and her nemesis get all the spotlight, leaving all the rest as almost unneeded background decorations. Although it is true that a great deal of characters are fleshed out throughout the series, none of them does something overly important to affect the story. Imagine an entire secret organization of supposed elite agents who in the entirety of the series didn’t manage to beat the weakest monster, while Saya an otherwise simple-minded schoolgirl has slain a mountain of brutes. Why were they in the story then? Just to pay her traveling tickets and giving her a quest list? Nice NPCs they were… Her family ain’t better either. Her step brothers keep interacting with her and are even willing to fight for her, but eventually don’t do anything to affect the battles or the result of all this mess. Do you know how irritating it is to have epic level fighters who do nothing while the rookie squire kills the dragon?4) Boring battles. Although there is a lot of action in the anime and most problems end up being resolved through fighting, almost none of the numerous duels and spars are exiting. Saya will just use her super blood to instant-kill any monster she cuts with her sword, after a simplistic battle choreography. And if she gets injured in the progress? Big deal; she immediately heals like Wolverine. In the meantime, all the rest of the supernatural people around her will be flying and shooting and blowing stuff up, usually with zero importance to the plot. And as I said, elite agents are completely useless at beating even the weakest of foes. Where is the interest in all this?5) Huge mystery build up / disappointing revelation. For most of the show Saya will have amnesia (which is a bad trope on its own but I felt generous enough not to make a different topic about it). She will keep traveling and fighting and investigating and having flashbacks in order to remember what had happened in her past. And we are kept teased with these vague images and hints and weird stuff, making us expect an amazing revelation. And when the revelation finally comes, you go all “WTF, after all this waiting that was all of it???” Seriously, the explanation of the grand mystery behind her past is simple as frakk, yet they make you think it will be something unimaginably epic.6) Clean CGI. Although the animation is quite good and the sceneries are great to stare, the anime just doesn’t feel “dirty” enough. The textures on objects like clothing or rocks will look sparkling clean, even when they should be worn-out from weather, bloodshed, dust, mud or generally affected by their surrounds. Even the wind blowing on the characters’ faces will feel more like a fan. It is as if the entire thing was shot with a blue screen and thus feels fake. 3D effects weren’t as well developed back then, so everything feels more artificial than hand-drawn.7) Ever-present school uniform. Saya wears one most of the times, even when she is not going to school. Pander the otakus too much and you end up making it look too ridiculous to care about her personal drama.8) Red lips. Saya has them. ALL THE TIME! They stand out. She is the only one with so much RED. They are annoying…That’s pretty much all of it. The finale may also feel corny as frakk, but I am generous again and leave that alone. Corny doesn’t mean bad; just unimaginative. It is otherwise good corn quality.And now the few things I can praise:1) Gore. Buckets of blood and some deviant things here and there.2) Shadows. Good use of lighting by … not using it. Makes things pitch black and scary by being just black silhouettes with glowing red eyes.3) Soundtrack. Exceptional use of violin and musical instruments; very good in building atmosphere. Too bad most of it gets wasted on a boring plot and silly story. And the lyrics are pop shitz. What in blazes is pop doing in a semi-horror anime? … Oh, right, it has a schoolgirl in it. are the reasons:1) Long duration / Slow pacing.

Saya has them. ALL THE TIME! They stand out. She is the only one with so much RED. They are annoying…That’s pretty much all of it. The finale may also feel corny as frakk, but I am generous again and leave that alone. Corny doesn’t mean bad; just unimaginative. It is otherwise good corn quality.And now the few things I can praise:1) Gore. Buckets of blood and some deviant things here and there.2) Shadows. Good use of lighting by … not using it. Makes things pitch black and scary by being just black silhouettes with glowing red eyes.3) Soundtrack. Exceptional use of violin and musical instruments; very good in building atmosphere. Too bad most of it gets wasted on a boring plot and silly story. And the lyrics are pop shitz. What in blazes is pop doing in a semi-horror anime? … Oh, right, it has a schoolgirl in it.', 'I really love this anime.  It had a great story line. I enjoyed that there was no fillers to get in the way of the main conflict. And i also liked how they ended in a postion where they could pick up the show for another season or just leave it. This is an amazing anime with lots of emtions and if u dont believe me watch it yourself. ', 'Let\'s start with a summary of what happens in the first 1 1/2 episodes:The story begins with a scene of a massacre: A girl with red eyes and a sword slices and dices through dozens of humans and werewolf-looking monsters. Even though she is repeatedly shot by a bunch of soldiers, she just keeps murdering innocent people. The scene ends with the girl standing in front of an almost army-looking mass of those werewolf things. After the scene ends and the (very badass) opening finishes playing (you should skip it though, if you really don\'t want ANY spoilers), the story continues in an apparently normal...Japanese high school with two apparently ordinary high school girls: Otonashi Saya and her friend Kaori.Throughout the first episode, we learn that Saya can\'t remember anything that happened more than one year ago and she lives with her father, George and her brothers Kai and Riku. We also learn that they are not blood-related, but they were all orphans and George decided to take care of them. Kai takes Saya to the clinic from school, for a blood transfusion. Why? We find that out much, much later. After the treatment, Saya goes home and comes across a guy who plays his cello in the street. As she listens to the music and closes her eyes, something that looks like a dream scene appears: We see through the eyes of a girl in an almost medieval dress run through a corridor in what looks like a castle. After she runs up a staircase, she runs towards a locked door. She takes out the key and unlocks it, at which point Saya calls out ""Don\'t!"" and reaches out with her hand, as if to stop the door from being opened. Back in reality, she trips after doing so and falls right into a bush in front of several people. Saya then stands up again and quickly leaves with her face bright red, after we briefly see the face of the guy who played the cello. Afterwards, Saya returns home to her apparently happy family life. However, it turns out that Saya left her trainers at school. Blast it! So she returns to school when it is already dark outside.The scene switches to their house where Kaori brings Saya\'s trainers. So they aren\'t at school anymore. Seeing how Saya doesn\'t have a cellphone, George calls Kai to get Saya from school. Now, this is where it starts to get interesting. Saya searches for her trainers all over school and under a tree, she meets the cello player again. After he says ""We finally meet"" and both Saya and the audience are left to wonder what he means by that, he pulls out - guess what - a dagger! Saya does what anyone would do: run away in fear. She literally bumps into a teacher - why the heck is a teacher still at school that late at night - and asks him to search the area for that cello player. When they find nobody under the tree, a large hand from above grabs the teacher\'s head and pulls him right into the maze of leaves and branches. As Saya, frightened, calls for the teacher we hear chewing noises and finally the teacher\'s dead body is dropped, Saya does what anyone would do: just stand there, shocked. But there\'s no time for being shocked, as one of the monsters from the beginning suddenly shows up. Apparently, it was that monster who killed the teacher.Again, Saya does what anyone would do: run away, screaming for help. She passes through a door and locks it, hoping that it will stall the monster. But it doesn\'t. The monster easily breaks the glass and the door, leaving Saya injured on the ground. But she stands up anyway and tries to run, but bumps - not literally this time - into the cello player. He throws the knife from before, apparently aimed right at Saya\'s head, but it passes right by her and hits the monster. A few more knives hit the monster at various points, like the eye. The guy then picks up Saya and jumps right up the whole staircase (quite a jump, I gotta say) and takes her into an empty room, where he explains to Saya what the monster from before was: a Chiropteran, basically a vampire, but it looks like a werewolf. He takes out a cool-looking katana from his cello case and removes the bandage from his right hand... Now that\'s a sight. His right hand looks pretty much exactly like it was taken from that Chiropteran. He then cuts his palm with the katana and looks like he wants Saya to drink the blood. However, they are interrupted by the Chiropteran breaking in, who removes the knife from his eye and it heals super fast - in about 2 seconds, he has it regenerated. The cello player then drinks the blood himself and seems to kiss Saya. However, it was his true intention to get her to drink the blood. After she does, Kai comes in and discovers her, the cello player and the Chiropteran. After he sees the latter, he does what any person would do: stand there in shock.Now this is where it gets very cool. After drinking the cello player\'s blood, Saya seems to remember things - apparently, she was the girl in the very beginning, who murdered all those innocent people! The cut on her face heals in an instant as her eyes turn red. With that, she enters an almost trance-like state, calling out ""Sword!"", extending her hand towards the cello player. He obediently hands it over and Saya draws it in a very cool-looking manner. She then cuts her hand in a very cool-looking manner and slashes right through the Chiropteran in a very cool-looking manner.Now, let\'s stop it here and go watch it yourself if you wanna know moreAs for the plot development:I personally found Blood+\'s plot very good, we gradually learn about Saya and her past, as well as about the enemy, the Chiropteran. We get tiny bits fed to us one after another, leaving us hungry for more. Not once was there a point where I was like ""Awww, it\'s boring, when is it gonna get interesting?"" I also liked the academy in Vietnam very much, where Saya has to hide her identity and abilities from all the other girls there, as well as Kai\'s girlfriend (okay, she loves him, but he doesn\'t love her back, but I\'m still gonna stick with ""girlfriend"") and a reporter going after Saya and her group. There are lots of secrets that are gradually revelaed, such as the cello player\'s true identity and his connection to Saya. Also, I found all characters perfectly fitting. The only annoying thing was Riku, after he became - no that would be a spoiler. I\'ll only tell you that he gets annoying after ~ episode 25. As for the other characters, they all have their unique quirks and I liked all of the good guys all the way through - and despised all of the bad guys (which is a good thing), especially about halfway through the series, where you get to know their motives and background.As for the action:Blood+ doesn\'t have too much action, however, there are a few fight scenes. Most of them are pretty awesome and easily surpass standards I would expect, even though Saya and her friends often get saved by pure dumb luck - or by Solomon . In my opinion, at least. I especially like the fight at the end of episode 28, where Saya and Haji (the cello player) fend off about 8 enemies in a very badass manner. And the final fight with Diva is of course pure epicness, even though most of that epicness is in the dialogue.Other stuff:I really liked Saya\'s flashback scenes, especially the ""mirror scene"" in episode 2, even though it isn\'t really a flashback. But it\'s pretty much guaranteed to freak you out. Whoever made this series really knows how to pique the audience\'s curiosity over Saya\'s past.Conclusion:Overall, I find that Blood+ is an awesome anime, with 1 being the worst rating and 10 the best, I\'d give Blood+ definitely a 9 or 9,5. The reason it doesn\'t get a 10 is because there are some characters who should\'ve been granted a comeback, such as Saya\'s friend Min from the academy in Vietnam.To conclude this review, let me say that if you are interested in supernatural stuff such as Bleach, you should definitely watch Blood+. The plot is better than Bleach in my opinion, and it\'s a lot more serious, which is a good thing. At least I think so.

The art and sound were the only two things that I thought were pretty good but everything else was lacking. The love triangle between Saya, Haji and Kai was plain annoying with these two guys chasing after a girl who constantly second guesses herself. The story felt like it dragged on and could have definitely been told better in 20-26 episodes. Lastly the action scenes were painful to watch because usually a character gets stronger after facing multiple...obstacles and trials which enables them to be strong enough to face their final problem. In this show, however, our main character starts off at her peak and gets weaker throughout the entire show winning her battles through pure luck. This is definitely not worth the 50 episode commitment. obstacles and trials which enables them to be strong enough to face their final problem.

All I can say is, if you haven\'t watched this anime, you haven\'t lived. To be fully honest... I don\'t even know what to say. I guess I\'ll just tell my story...A few years back, before I even heard of the word ""anime"" my family was hosting a Christmas party. At my Christmas party, me and my cousin were in my room, being the socially-awkward people we are, instead of socializing with my other family members. He mentioned how he is obsessed with this ""anime"" called ""Air Gear"" or something along...those lines. He introduced me to the first episode, but other than the ecchi aspect to it, I wasn\'t a fan. So naturally I moved on to the next show. This time it was my turn to choose. I decided that I did like the art aspect to ""Air Gear"" and I was looking for another show in the ""anime"" category. That\'s when I stumbled upon Blood+. After the first episode I was hooked, and so was my cousin. We watched a few episodes together that night, and he made me promise I wouldn\'t go ahead. I promised, but admittedly I wasn\'t very faithful to my promise, as I immediately continued watching as soon as he shut my door and left my house.The character development in this anime is fantastic, it\'s truly a work of art. I regret however, watching it dubbed. Since I was new to the whole ""anime"" thing, I decided against watching it subbed, and boy do I regret that. In the future, I do plan on re-watching Blood+ in subbed, but not right now. Blood+ was absolutely outstanding. The most underrated anime to date (in my opinion of course). I recommend it to everyone, even to those who haven\'t seen anime or those who dislike anime. If you\'re reading this, and you haven\'t watched Blood+ yet, I ask you to trust me, and watch this masterpiece as I can guarantee you will not regret it. If you don\'t, that\'s okay too, but just know that you are missing out on a mental roller coaster that will, without a doubt leave you breathless. those lines.

Fair warning, it\'s a massive spoiler for Episode 32, and on. In my opinion, it makes the show unwatchable. I even tried for a few more episodes, but alas, no.

Trust me, this anime is a lot more than that!!Blood+ is actually a really good anime! I highly, HIGHLY recommend it out of the others in the blood series, (Blood the last vampire & Blood-c) because of its richer story and better character development.The lore with the monsters is fascinating, though I feel the information about them is kinda incomplete... I guess that's fine since the scientists where still experimenting on them and discovering new things.The characters stray...away from the generic stereotypes/tropes which makes most of them, especially the main character, feel realistic with fleshed out personalities.Even the main antagonist of the series has a level of sympathy when you get a better understanding of her.The story is a dark adult series with the main girl killing vampire like monsters and completeing her mission.It's like a horror battle series with a level of mystery and tragedy to it.It's no where close to the assumption that it's an action story about an overly cute girl swinging a sword.This show feels grounded in reality with humanity beings at war with a rising species of blood thirsty monsters...so yeah this show get DARK.Though it's not all dark, there's some suspense, tear jerking, and sweet moments in the anime.Like when Saya is spending time playing catch with her brothers.The art and animation is lovely, pretty good for back then and holds up pretty well. Though a knit-pick I have is Diva's lip-synch when she's singing.The song is the same in both dubs so not sure why she couldn't of been animated better when singing...I guess that would of been time consuming?The dubbing in both languages is really good though in the beginning of the anime some characters like David sounded a little off in dire situations. I also noticed that the last scene in the final episode wasn't even dubbed....why?Over all this is a really good anime that I can't recommend enough! away from the generic stereotypes/tropes which makes most of them, especially the main character, feel realistic with fleshed out personalities.Even the main antagonist of the series has a level of sympathy when you get a better understanding of her.The story is a dark adult series with the main girl killing vampire like monsters and completeing her mission.It's like a horror battle series with a level of mystery and tragedy to it.It's no where close to the assumption that it's an action story about an overly cute girl swinging a sword.This show feels grounded in reality with humanity beings at war with a rising species of blood thirsty monsters...so yeah this show get DARK.Though it's not all dark, there's some suspense, tear jerking, and sweet moments in the anime.Like when Saya is spending time playing catch with her brothers.The art and animation is lovely, pretty good for back then and holds up pretty well.

So my initial reaction to seeing this new Blood+ [and Saya] amongst all this peaceful scenery and at a regular school leading this idyllic home life complete with parent and siblings was a complete and utter shock to the system indeed. But then as this amazing story unfolds, I realized that this show way better than...it seemed at first. Even if the art style is kind of shoujo, do NOT let that mislead you or dissuade your from watching this series!Art-StyleBlood +, has VERY good animation...I'd even say it was excellent! There is extensive CG work used on this tries&mdash;rather tastefully I might add&mdash;for general vehicular movement such as cars, boats, helicopters etc. CG is also used for a lot of the architectural shots and camera pans like when character is running down or thru hallways of a building. A lot of the special FX used for the action scenes were CG, most notably would have to be FX used for when the SCHIFF members fought.I don't know what more could be required from this show! There are a lot of exotic scenes as the character travel across Europe and Asia. There is a lot of attention to the artistic details in making each locale look authentic.This show is a fantasy show but there are some very powerful imagery being used....with countless scenes that burn their way into your mind!

There were also some pretty unforgettable battle scenes!SoundI actually only liked the 3rd OP and ED songs and the art sequences that go with them. So for me this gets the lowest score.

Because if you're like me then you'll be sad [also if you do not like gore....there's lots!] In the anime world it's really not so surprising to see main characters die, but somehow I was still shocked......even when trivial side characters died, I was shocked and saddened.

There's no real explanation why I've linked these two sets of characters except in my minds eye, I do see a lot of similarities. For starters, this isn't just a cut and dry case of Good Guys v. Bad Guys.

I actually just finished watching the last episode this morning at 4:00am, after spending two days straight watching the whole series. I am not going to lie I knew about the series since it came out in 06 but I just never gave it the time of day because I thought it would be just a stupid vampire plot that was either endless or shallow. I was completely wrong, a friend who had watched it convinced me too, I admit the first 3 or 4 episodes seem painfully slow and way too soft for what...a dark anime should be. It got interesting very quickly, and soon I could not stop watching, hence the reason I turned off my phone and locked my self up for the last couple days. The story as described is about a girl named saya fighting vampire like beings, but this is only a main theme to the plot. The real story is how Saya deals with being different and coming to except herself as she is and how she interacts with humans. The story is dark and like my other fav, code geass (also a bandai film), they are not afraid to kill main and lovable characters in order to progress the story line (I am trying not to spoil but I want to give you a good ideal of how dark this anime is). This anime is really about one girls hardships, feelings, and suffering. It will blow your mind and make you think in a different manner. a dark anime should be.

It was taking too long for her to ""wake up"". The father was just too unreal ""don\'t forget to smile"" and all those life lessons he had. Kai wasn\'t like he was in the manga and had the tradition anime hang up of ""being useless"" and ""unable to protect"". The story just dragged on and it took too long for them to get to the point and made any action scenes were made too short.All in all, it was a big disappointment. ', 'Blood+ takes vampire folklore and twists it into something unique and well suited to the series. Although, it may seem as if it would be a boring plot where a girl travels around hunting down vicious monsters this series is very far from being boring. From the first episode it stays true to the plot and remains consistent until the very end.The atmosphere of Blood+ is rather intense. It takes a cheery high school girl and thrusts her into a dark world filled with violence, blood, and death. Being as it is a 50 episode series I had expected for the series to, occasionally,...break from it\'s serious atmosphere or to become episodic. The series is consistent with both the story and atmosphere and never breaks. You witness the growth of both the storyline and characters to the point where the story is much more in depth than a high school girl with a katana killing off creatures. Watching anime I often expect for a random shot of chibi characters being silly and arguing about pointless things as to entertain or relieve the viewer from the seriousness of the series but Blood+ never makes an attempt at comic relief. Although, instead, they offer you a little bit of hope for the characters and their situation, as if things are looking up, only for it to be snatched away from you. It will literally drive you to tears. The plot will not disappoint you. It unfolds at a steady pace, and will offer you enough of a story and the characters that, at the end of it, you won\'t think, ""I want more than this"", you will just be completely satisfied with how everything panned out. Blood+ is rich with a beginning, middle, and end.The characters of Blood+ are extremely well developed. As you watch the series it\'s as if you are watching them grow before your eyes. What I love about this series the most is how in depth and real the characters of Blood+ are. Despite having inhuman capabilities even the main character is of human nature in personality. In fact, you may even find yourself feeling sorry for the most sadistic villain of the series. Characters that are young and lack knowledge and understanding from the beginning mature as the series progresses. The situations they extract their experiences from make them grow stronger in character. Even if they know they are weak against the enemy they continue fighting as to support the one character who is able to end the misery brought on by chiropterans. Even adult characters that seem to have an understanding that the youth lacked are thrown into situations that cause them to experience something as a means of development in their character. A lot of the characters are often faced by the confusion of their own emotions and, as such, change drastically from their revelations.Overall, the series was very enjoyable. It remained consistent to the plot and atmosphere with an excellent beginning, middle, and end. All the questions you could have had about the series are answered and you are not left in confusion at the end. The characters are strong, likeable, and well developed.

I just kept thinking, it has to get better, it has to, right? Well it doesn\'t.The plot had potential, with all of the different factions. Some conspiracy stuff going on which is always good. I like that it goes back in time and explains the history and backstories. The art and sound were fine.The main problem is the main character, Saya. Basically the entire series is her saying ""I can\'t"" and whining and being a big annoying baby. I can understand the first few episode/fights, yeah the chiropterans are big and scary. But this literally...goes on until the very end, it\'s really really annoying.The rest of the characters are okay, but nowhere near cool enough to make up for Saya\'s horribleness. goes on until the very end, it\'s really really annoying.The rest of the characters are okay, but nowhere near cool enough to make up for Saya\'s horribleness.', 'Overview:At this point, twists on the traditional legends of vampires have pretty much become the norm in just about any type of media. However, anime is particularly infamous for it. Generally, they put a twist on the legend using their own folklore and making them mutants or demons rather than the undead, with sucking blood being practically the only resemblance to the original legend they\'ve got. ""Blood+"" is one such anime, and while it\'s not without many flaws, it\'s still a nice and welcome twist on an outdated tale.Story (8/10):It\'s very hard to delve into the story without presenting some spoilers but I\'m going to...try anyway. Basically, it follows Saya Otonashi, a seemingly normal girl who lives peacefully with her adoptive family and has no memory of who she is or where she came from. One night, she crosses paths with a mysterious man named Hagi, who appears to know her very well and obeys her every command. Furthermore, an agent named David who appears to be well acquainted with Saya\'s adoptive father appears and says that he needs Saya for something. One thing leads to another, and it\'s not long before Saya and her family are caught up in a battle against creatures called Chiropterans, and Saya slowly begins to remember her mysterious past and reason for her existence, assisted by the anti-Chiropteran military organization Red Shield.The story is pretty slow to start, as it\'s only until episode 6 that something significant happens, and it\'s only until episode 8 or 9 that we finally get a good idea about exactly what Saya and Red Shield are up against. This certainly isn\'t helped by the fact that Hagi, David and the others refuse to tell Saya anything about her past, as they believe that it\'s best for her to remember on her own. Not to mention that when she regains her memories, they regret not telling her as it would have saved a lot of trouble.In any case, I can thankfully say that the second half is vastly superior to the first, as it is far more fast-paced and is overall just much more interesting and exciting. The fight takes the group to all sorts of locations, from a hotel to a snowy landscape to a theatre, and Saya slowly grows from a scared girl who can barely fight to save her life to a highly competent warrior who can kick blood-sucking monster ass, albeit with a lot of help from Hagi. The story of Saya\'s past is also very interesting, as it ties brilliantly with the villains and is crucial for her character development. The origin of Chiropterans is great as well, and things aren\'t as black and white as they seem at first. The story ultimately proves to be very interesting and unique in spite of the slow start and manages to keep you interested throughout its 50 episodes, all the way up to a well-thought out conclusion.Art & Animation (8.5/10):The art is very impressive for the show\'s time, which is from 2005-2006. The characters and monsters are all very well-drawn and the animations are mostly quite smooth, though they can also be rather stiff at times. My favourite effect is when Saya kills a Chriopteran by stabbing it with her sword, which causes the beast to crack up and crumble into pieces. It\'s a very well-done effect that\'s used really well throughout the series.Sound & Dialogue (7/10):This is, unfortunately, the low point of the series. The soundtrack is generally made up of generic tunes that fail to stand out and are quickly forgettable. There are 4 openings and 4 ending themes but none of them are memorable and I skipped them every time. Thankfully, there are two exceptions to this- ""Saya\'s Victory"" and ""Diva"". The voice acting isn\'t the best either; Kari Wahlgren and Crispin Freeman both deliver strong performances as the lead pair but apart from them, the voice acting is mostly average and can actually be pretty poor in places, with some voices not sounding right at all. The sound never gets unbearable, especially since the dialogue is mostly good, but I have definitely heard much better.Characters (7.5/10):Let\'s start with Saya. As I mentioned before, she starts off as a scared girl who can barely fight to save her life but as she regains her memories she gets stronger and stronger. Well, I should say more skilled, since physically she isn\'t much stronger than a human, and so relies on martial arts and swordplay, which thankfully allows her to easily hold her own against more powerful opponents. Unfortunately, with her extra power comes serious consequences, since her past was definitely not sunshine and daisies. About three-quarters through the series, you really get the impression that the entire world is out to break her, as she suffers one tragedy after another, making you hope that the poor girl will finally catch a break when everything\'s over. She does have an annoying habit of pointing out the obvious, but overall she is a great protagonist and the best character the series has to offer.Coming a close second is Saya\'s bodyguard, Hagi. He starts off as a typical, stoic quiet character, rarely talking and when he does he only says a few sentences. He also follows Saya\'s every command regardless of what it is, almost to the point of being a pushover. His character development revolves around him outgrowing this and considering what he wants, and it begins to show in later episodes as he starts to voice his opinion more and more. He\'s also just as (or at first more) capable a fighter as Saya, even when he\'s holding back, though he still ends up getting injured by almost every enemy he fights.Next up is the other two main protagonists- Red Shield special agent David and Saya\'s adopted older brother Kai. As I mentioned before, their voice acting isn\'t anything special but they\'re at least well-written- David is the hardened war veteran with a heart of gold while Kai is the hot-headed teenager with a heart of gold. David doesn\'t have any powers like Saya and Hagi, but he makes up for that with his sheer force of will, as he doesn\'t let anything keep him down for long- he\'s even described in-series as being indestructible. Kai, on the other hand, starts off as rather annoying and immature, as well as pretty selfish, but thankfully he becomes more responsible and likable as the series progresses. But while the main cast is very good, the supporting cast is less so, and there are definitely quite a few I think the show could have done without and others that were just underused. I can say the villains are interesting, however.Enjoyment (7.5/10):As I mentioned before, the series takes several episodes to get going, so you definitely need some patience if you want to watch it to the end. This is also a very dark series, and while the show gets more exciting in later episodes, it also gets a lot more depressing. There\'s also a sense of danger and quite a few characters don\'t make it to the end. If you can\'t handle all that, then I would definitely advise staying away.Overall:""Blood+"" certainly isn\'t the best anime I\'ve ever seen, but it\'s still a unique and interesting twist on the old legend of vampires. In spite of the slow start, forgettable soundtrack and variable voice acting, ""Blood+"" is a very good series to watch, with an intriguing story, great action and good character development.Score:8+8.5+7+7.5+7.5=38.5/50=7.7/10 try anyway.

This is another anime that has been sitting on my ""I need to finish watching it some day"" list for years.How should I put it.Have you ever seen series where you could see an amazing potential, then just had to watch the show to fail to reach the full potential, despite trying very very hard? Well... this is this kind of show.I\'ve rated it 6/10, and 6/10 Story, 6/10 Art, 6/10 Sound, 5/10 Character, 5/10 Enjoyment, 6/10 Total.This is probably the closest there will be ever be to properly realizing full potential of Saya\'s story from Blood the Last Vampire. Unfortunately, it is...not good enough to be considered a masterpiece, it fails to reach its full potential. Watching this anime is very, very, frustrating.In essence, it starts with interesting premise, produces decent first season, then things start deteriorating, and devolve into some sort of melodrama with characters occasionally spending time stating ""moral statements"", almost in shounen-like fashion. Fairly convincing fights from the first episodes are then displaced with almost comical abilities that on the level of superpowers. For example, very early you\'ll get characters that can move very far away at blink of eye without triggering a shockwave somehow. Compared to the first episodes that looked like they were trying to be realistic - to the extent it is possible wit ht he premise - this is very odd.So, what we have is an oddity. Nice core idea. Nice art. Good music. Characters are mediocre, however, a lot of them with wooden acting. There\'s a large variety of locales over the course of the show, which doesn\'t happen often. However, it lacks some sort of ""punch"" that would make it great, and sluggishly and slwoly drags out for 50 episodes, reaching.... not very interesting conclusion.Sigh. I\'m not sure how this could possibly have been done better, but it definitely doesn\'t reach the potential, and this is frustrating.Detailed breakdown is below:Story: 6/10: The reason why it is 6/10 is largely because of scope, and because of occasional nice moments it has. The story has a problem, because it starts with interesting premise, but then slows down to crawl, and throws many pointlessly melodramatic moments that were supposed to trigger some sort of response, but usually don\'t. As I also mentioned, there\'s inconsistent level of ""powers"" throughout the anime. At the beginning we get more or less realistic depiction of the world, but later there are peopel with magical abilities. Closer to the end, or to be more specific, past the first season, the story largely looks like collection of backdrops, and resembles some sort of not very convincing theatrical play. But still... it is ambitious you can give it that. And closer to the end  it has one nice moment that adds some redeeming values to it that shifts it from 5/10 to 6/10... Still... I can\'t think of how it could\'ve done better and more believable. Something is definitely amiss with it.Art: 6/10: It is surprisingly detailed for a TV show. Clean detailed style, characters are realistic. Nobody is ever going into chibi mode here, characters are adult proportioned. Basically, they pretty much wanted to make it look realistic as possible, when it comes to visuals.Character designs are fairly good as well.... I mean monsters aren\'t interesting, but visuals of characters themselves are unique enough and interesting enough.Sound: 6/10: Soundtrack is nice, but the same tracks are played many times over course of 50 episodes. At some point they nice music starts leaving next to no impact.Characters: 5/10: Character interaction is not good, and same goes for character portrayal There\'s a lot of instances of somebody pointlessly talking baoaut something. Some cliched interactions. Melodrama. Many attempts to overdramatize something. Basically... I think there was maybe one moment total where I felt sympathetic towards someone.Enjoyment: 5/10: It is simply too long and drag out for too long. By the 30th episode the show loses all of its initial momentum and moves slowly towards the ending, while events that happen in it become less and less and less plausible. The world fail to react to catastrophes. The powers of characters become more and more magical. People act oddly. This... gets annoying.Overall: 6/10: I\'ll rate it 6/10 for trying but... the thing is I cna\'t recommend this anime. As i said, this is probably one of the best attempts to retell saya\'s story (and it is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the abomination called BloodC), but the anime doesn\'t achieve its full potential and this is frustrating.Maybe if you have a ton of time and absolutely nothing else to watch you could give this one a try, but after finishing the anime myself, I could only think that idea behind Saya could use a much better story. not good enough to be considered a masterpiece, it fails to reach its full potential. Watching this anime is very, very, frustrating.In essence, it starts with interesting premise, produces decent first season, then things start deteriorating, and devolve into some sort of melodrama with characters occasionally spending time stating ""moral statements"", almost in shounen-like fashion. Fairly convincing fights from the first episodes are then displaced with almost comical abilities that on the level of superpowers. For example, very early you\'ll get characters that can move very far away at blink of eye without triggering a shockwave somehow. Compared to the first episodes that looked like they were trying to be realistic - to the extent it is possible wit ht he premise - this is very odd.So, what we have is an oddity. Nice core idea. Nice art. Good music. Characters are mediocre, however, a lot of them with wooden acting. There\'s a large variety of locales over the course of the show, which doesn\'t happen often. However, it lacks some sort of ""punch"" that would make it great, and sluggishly and slwoly drags out for 50 episodes, reaching.... not very interesting conclusion.Sigh. I\'m not sure how this could possibly have been done better, but it definitely doesn\'t reach the potential, and this is frustrating.Detailed breakdown is below:Story: 6/10: The reason why it is 6/10 is largely because of scope, and because of occasional nice moments it has. The story has a problem, because it starts with interesting premise, but then slows down to crawl, and throws many pointlessly melodramatic moments that were supposed to trigger some sort of response, but usually don\'t.

I have probably watched this show around 3 times, and everytime I see it in a slightly different light. Sometimes western influence ruins an anime, but in this anime, it really fits. The various settings which also partially mark the start and end of each arc really helps add to the excitement of the series. Saya's personality does seem a bit robotic at times, but the other characters like Haji, Kai, and Diva really help shape her as the story progresses. If you're looking for a series with a bit of action, drama, and adventure, this is a good match. It...is, however, a bit gorey and mature, and also contains tragedy down the road, so if you're not prepared for that, then I would not suggest this for the light of heart. The OPs and EDs are also super great if you're looking for more music. Overall, if you're interested in a girl recovering her past and saving the rest of the world from disgusting creatures, Blood + is pretty great. is, however, a bit gorey and mature, and also contains tragedy down the road, so if you're not prepared for that, then I would not suggest this for the light of heart.

I like the way how the OPs were pretty fast beat and pumped me up for the next episode while the ED were more soft, and slow.Character:Wow, I would give it a 20/10 if I could for character development.

I fell in love with all the character, and not just the main characters.

With an amazing story, sound, characters (except for one), and overall enjoyment, Blood+ is one of my personal favorites. Set in an alternate world to the movie Blood: The Last Vampire, The story revolves around a young girl named Saya who is apparently the only girl who can stop the vampire like monsters known as Chiroptera. I will Divide this Review into each of the 5 Sections.Story:The Writing in this Anime is phenomenal. The work, although based off the original movie, Is incredibly Original and is Very different from the original work. The Chiroptera are not...like ordinary Vampires, which made me very happy. They seem more like savage monsters who don\'t think and just eat. There are however, different types of Chiroptera. I won\'t get into it because of spoilers, but the concept of the Chiroptera is very interesting and is pulled off successfully.Art:The art was one of the two issues I had with the anime. The scenery is beautiful but the characters lack originality. Saya, who is the main character, has a weird looking mouth that distracts you from the Amazing writing. I had to watch the beginning over again because I couldn\'t stop staring at her mouth. This doesn\'t take away the greatness of the show, but instead distracts you from it. It is a problem, but I won\'t take this into my Overall score.Sound:I personally love the soundtrack of Blood+. Diva\'s song is great and fits in perfectly with the mood of the show. Even the other pieces of music were well placed into the events of the show. The sounds of the Chiroptera sounded original and I didn\'t notice anything Bad about it. Other sound effects like the swords or guns seemed normal and fit in perfectly with the show. The sound effects were nothing special, But didn\'t take away anything from the story itself.Character:This section holds the biggest problem in my opinion. Almost all the characters were well developed. The only thing I had a problem with is Kai. I found Kai to be the most annoying character I\'ve ever seen. Kai is basically Saya\'s ""brother"" even though they are not blood related. Kai is like the male version of Kagome from Inuyasha. He constantly thinks about Saya and is kind of an asshole to everyone else. Riku is another sibling of Saya\'s and is actually very likeable. Riku has the right balance of love for Saya and Love for everyone else. Haji is probably one of my favorite characters in this anime, next to David and Solomon. I even Love the villains of the show. The ONLY person I hate is Kai. This character brought my overall score to a 9. That\'s pretty bad. like ordinary Vampires, which made me very happy.

If you want a bad-ass female protagonist, this is not the anime for you. With nil character development and a core concept that can\'t decide whether to make her \'normal\' (yet go...all the way to, god forbid, any sense of reality in her reactions) or a fighter. you\'re left with imo, the single MOST annoying female character ever.And it\'s unfortunate because the plot had the potential for a LOT of solid character growth.It\'s like they wanted to capture a sort of nuanced take on the personality aspect of \'normal\' girl who is a god chara w amnesia, so they focus a lot of screen minutes per episode on her \'emotions\', yet fall so far short of the mark, those minutes only exacerbate the ridiculousness.It\'s also like they want to milk the \'mystery\' aspect as much as possible so they end up having every conversation inanely cryptic, even among those in the \'know\' and those outside, and then make the characters ok with it, when even 1% reality would have had them respond, ""hold up, wtf are you talking about.\' Like we get it, you want to create suspense, but ffs, have your human characters behave even a bit like humans??Back to the useless, pathetic crybaby who constantly insists she can handle it to the point of trying to \'protect\' her brother, but invariably ends up crying \'i can\'t, i can\'t\' when faced with any danger, irrespective of how many people die and suffer around her, when she can protect them so easily.

I can’t say I haven’t seen that before.  I have seen worse vampire anime and definitely worse vampire stories in general.  However, at the same time, there are better vampire anime out there as well like Vampire Hunter D or Hellsing.  Hell, why stop at anime.  Watch stuff like the Blade movies.  This series seems very much like Blade in a lot of ways.  You have a main character, Saya (in this case a woman), who is a powerful and special vampire (supposedly) who wields...a cool-looking sword and slays other vampires.  I can tell you that Blade could kick Saya’s ass any day of the week.  I would much rather watch Blade and Blade 2 than this anime.  I would watch this over Blade Trinity but that’s not saying much.  There will be some SPOILERS from here on so be warned.Let’s get the good points out of the way.  Firstly, the art and animation is good for the most part.  For an anime that came out in 2005 the visuals are good.  The animation during the fights was usually fluid and some of the action seasons are decent mainly ones involving the Shiva lies.  The music is also good.  All the openings are great and will get you hyped until you realize what you’re watching.  The ending songs are okay and the score does its job.One of the main issues I have with this anime is the characters.  I find most if not all of them boring, uninteresting, or just whiny.  If you like the characters that’s fine, but I was not invested in any of them.  At first I was invested in Saya’s character but as the series progressed I became less and less interested.  Many people think Saya is a great character and a very strong female lead, but I did not see that really.  Saya would not be in my top 10, 20, or even top 30 lists of best female characters in anime.She’s not badass.  Her fights are honestly pretty dull.  Plus, she almost always has to get saved by her Shiva lie Haji, her brother Kai, Solomon, or somebody else.  Haji does most of the work in fights and Saya then has the finishing blow.  She is also whiny and indecisive.  I could forgive it at the beginning because she is still adjusting to everything.  However, as the series went on her indecisiveness grated on me.Diva is even worse.  She is built up as the main villain and a massive threat, but she wasn’t really.  She wasn’t that great of a fighter and her personality and motivation was really weird.  At first she wanted to kill Saya, then she wanted Riku but then kills him,, then it seems like she wanted to sing, then at the end I guess what she wanted was a family.  It is really confusing.  Did the writers want us to feel sympathy toward her at the end?  She tried to kill Saya multiple times, she killed Saya’s real father, killed Riku, and took on Riku’s appearance as a final insult.  She gets no sympathy from me.  If she did really want a family then that’s a rather weak motivation for the main villain.Diva’s Shiva lies were more of the main villains than she was and they seemed stronger too.  They are the ones with the grand scheme to take over the world and replace humans with Chiropterans, not Diva.  Even though Saya and Diva are supposed to be the head vampires their servants seem stronger than they are judging by what I’ve seen each of them do compared to Saya and Diva.  I know Saya and Diva’s blood is deadly to them, but from an ability and combat efficiency standpoint they seem better.  The Shiva lies get all the good fights.  I am never hyped to see Saya and Diva fight.  I always wait for Haji or the other Shiva lie to come fight or fight each other.  The final fight between Saya and Diva is pathetic.  While that was happening you had Haji fighting Diva’s head Shiva lie and that was a much better fight.Also, it is so boring.  This anime is fifty episodes in length and it could have easily been half that if not even less.  It really shows in the pacing, which is slow and tiring.  There are some episodes where barely anything happens.  The story isn’t big or complicated enough to warrant being as long as it is.  The plot is pretty straightforward and there are really no twists or turns.  Diva’s Shiva lies want to replace humanity with Chiropterans as top of the food chain and Saya and her group has to stop them.  You could’ve easily resolved that in a 25 episode series or even a 12 or 13 episode series.Plus, there’s the whole love triangle between Saya, Haji, and Solomon (Diva’s Shiva lie) which falls into Twilight territory.  Okay, it’s not that bad but it does give off that Twilight vibe to me, which isn’t a good thing.  People give this anime’s successor, Blood-C, a lot of shit.  That series, while not perfect, is better than this.  Blood-C is much shorter so the pacing is better, the action is better I think, the lead heroine does more, and there is no Twilight-esk love story in there.Overall, Blood+ soap opera making as a vampire anime.  The action scenes involving the Shiva lie are decent but the rest is just dull.  It’s too long and the pacing is super slow.  The main character, Saya, is boring, indecisive, and not that strong overall.  The other characters aren’t any better.  The villains are weak especially Diva.  Her motivation is all over the map, she didn’t come off as this badass ultimate villain, and she doesn’t really do much.  Her servants seem more like the main villains.  They have more screen time than she does.  They are the one that have the grand scheme in mind while diva just seems to be just going along with it.  The only characters that are somewhat worth anything are Haji and Solomon.  As I said previously there is much better vampire fiction out there.  It is definitely not the worst but I’d skip it. a cool-looking sword and slays other vampires.  I can tell you that Blade could kick Saya’s ass any day of the week.  I would much rather watch Blade and Blade 2 than this anime.  I would watch this over Blade Trinity but that’s not saying much.

At first she wanted to kill Saya, then she wanted Riku but then kills him,, then it seems like she wanted to sing, then at the end I guess what she wanted was a family.  It is really confusing.  Did the writers want us to feel sympathy toward her at the end?  She tried to kill Saya multiple times, she killed Saya’s real father, killed Riku, and took on Riku’s appearance as a final insult.  She gets no sympathy from me.  If she did really want a family then that’s a rather weak motivation for the main villain.Diva’s Shiva lies were more of the main villains than she was and they seemed stronger too.  They are the ones with the grand scheme to take over the world and replace humans with Chiropterans, not Diva.  Even though Saya and Diva are supposed to be the head vampires their servants seem stronger than they are judging by what I’ve seen each of them do compared to Saya and Diva.  I know Saya and Diva’s blood is deadly to them, but from an ability and combat efficiency standpoint they seem better.  The Shiva lies get all the good fights.  I am never hyped to see Saya and Diva fight.  I always wait for Haji or the other Shiva lie to come fight or fight each other.  The final fight between Saya and Diva is pathetic.  While that was happening you had Haji fighting Diva’s head Shiva lie and that was a much better fight.Also, it is so boring.  This anime is fifty episodes in length and it could have easily been half that if not even less.  It really shows in the pacing, which is slow and tiring.  There are some episodes where barely anything happens.  The story isn’t big or complicated enough to warrant being as long as it is.  The plot is pretty straightforward and there are really no twists or turns.  Diva’s Shiva lies want to replace humanity with Chiropterans as top of the food chain and Saya and her group has to stop them.  You could’ve easily resolved that in a 25 episode series or even a 12 or 13 episode series.Plus, there’s the whole love triangle between Saya, Haji, and Solomon (Diva’s Shiva lie) which falls into Twilight territory.  Okay, it’s not that bad but it does give off that Twilight vibe to me, which isn’t a good thing.  People give this anime’s successor, Blood-C, a lot of shit.  That series, while not perfect, is better than this.  Blood-C is much shorter so the pacing is better, the action is better I think, the lead heroine does more, and there is no Twilight-esk love story in there.Overall, Blood+ soap opera making as a vampire anime.  The action scenes involving the Shiva lie are decent but the rest is just dull.  It’s too long and the pacing is super slow.  The main character, Saya, is boring, indecisive, and not that strong overall.  The other characters aren’t any better.  The villains are weak especially Diva.  Her motivation is all over the map, she didn’t come off as this badass ultimate villain, and she doesn’t really do much.  Her servants seem more like the main villains.  They have more screen time than she does.  They are the one that have the grand scheme in mind while diva just seems to be just going along with it.  The only characters that are somewhat worth anything are Haji and Solomon.  As I said previously there is much better vampire fiction out there.  It is definitely not the worst but I’d skip it.', ""An anime with guts. A highly intellectual exercise in self-discovery, Blood+ doesn't shrink when it comes to tackling questions and issues no one likes to hear or talk about.Rife with metaphors on just how it is to be human in this day and age,  Blood+ is a story of tragedy and loss, of tolerance and insufferable cruelty, and of love and redemption. It's characters are chillingly introspective and easily blur the lines between what truly is good and evil.  While Blood+ is not immune to a number of cliches that creep up in an episode or two, these imperfections are more...than made-up for by it's novel plot and engaging characters. Any story that dares to question what it really means to be human deserves great praise in my book. Blood+ does just that; in spades. than made-up for by it's novel plot and engaging characters.

It is a series about family and what it means to be one. Not a conventional family, as you may have guessed, but a family just the same. I watched this when it aired on [adultswim] a while back and got hooked. I couldn't help but root for Saya and Kai as they both struggled to keep their family together while their whole world was falling apart. It's hard enough for teenagers to come to grips with who and what they are, then they have to deal with being chased by chiropterans... "", ""Well what can I say, if your a vampire type of person than this anime is right for you. A descent amount of blood, some notes of humor, and some very good action scenes. Saya, though a little bit more shy and frightened then when she was in Blood: The last vampire, is still a good character, added with some new character you didn't see in the movie.The story/plot to this was alright and found it rather enjoyable through most of it (though some episodes nearly bored me.). The art and animation of it was a lovely different to the old time vampire movies...that just have it in dark senery all the time 'twitch', this brings a good concept of light as well as darkness blended in together like a perfect cup of vanilla and carmel tea.Sound was alright and the opening/closing songs went almost well with the anime as well as its graphics. Though I did not enjoy seeing Saya so.. uhm what's the right word, girlsh I was still able to add her to my favs, even though her attitude got down graded abit, the other characters were a nice change instead of just focusing on one person.My enjoyment of this was quite high for a vampire anime. I have to say that seeing Diva and Saya together was really brought an amusing smirk to my lips, as well as the fresh way of blood splatter.Overall, I give it a nine. It was good but like I said some bits of it bored me to death, some was odd and I found it quite annoying. that just have it in dark senery all the time 'twitch', this brings a good concept of light as well as darkness blended in together like a perfect cup of vanilla and carmel tea.Sound was alright and the opening/closing songs went almost well with the anime as well as its graphics.

I saw it back when I was about 15, when Naruto, Bleach, and DBZ were by far my favorite anime. And after watching Blood+, it completely overshadowed them. I always had a love of dark, sadistic, and stylish things, which is exactly what Blood+ is. The story was dark, it had a strong vampire based storyline, and it wasn\'t just about getting stronger and stopping evil, there is lust, revenge, depression, ect. The artwork was at the time really good, but that was 2005 I think, now-a-days it could be considered decent. The music was hit-or-miss,...some of the OP and ED I loved, but some of them I despised. The characters worth pointing out IMO are Saya (protagonist) and Haji (most stylish sidekick ever). Haji is by far the best character in the show, and it doesn\'t take long to realize this, his loyalty to Saya is absolute, and he his style is really awesome. He throws knives, has a demon hand, and beats enemies down with a cello case, all while maintaining his ""swagger"". Overall, the main flaw of this anime would have to be the fact that at times it did get pretty boring, there would be episodes of complete build-up, which weren\'t exciting at all, but after about episode 39, it becomes a complete rollercoaster ride.

Who helped rebuild their economy and established their democratic and capitalist structure? The animation is fine, but the Saya and Kai are really dumb. I hate seeing dumb and emotional characters as well as Kai's dumb script, dialogue, or what he says. There are little tidbits on how the show just doesn't make sense naturally and that they're no limits in their world so anything can happen. The enviromental details are also...very bad such as Viet Nam. A lot of issues I have with the show is things like using platinum credit cards to buy whatever they want in Viet Nam when the people there don't even accept such cards at vendors. Vietnam also looks very developed when in reality, it's very run down. It's one of the poorest countries in the world yet they can afford a big private girls school. Not only that, but the drawings of the faces of asians are so bad that you can't even tell the difference between a Jap and a Vietnamese. They don't know the landscape of Vietnam at all and that orphanage they had of children who come there because their parents were killed by duds..... Well first of all, orphanages don't even take care of the orphans in Vietnam and duds don't exist in suburban areas especially their capital except for the ones that remains as tourist sites of the traps they made. I'm only on episode 6 and they messed up that much about Vietnam in like 2 episodes. If they messed up that badly, then what other features of different cultures did they mess up. You even wonder if they've even visited these areas before they even did their show.Edit: Episode 9 now.Oh my FUCKING GOOOODDDD. They don't give scholarships in Vietnam, especially to fucking musicians. You don't get money there as a musician, even a professional one. AND NO ONE IS STUPID ENOUGH TO FIND DUDS AND SELL THEM AS SCRAP METAL EVEN IF THEY DID EXIST IN VILLAGES IN VIETNAM. My god these people are retarded.

For the idea of it being a Vampire show, this is not. It has no actual vampire although it has some variation of a ‘vampire-like’ monsters. It doesn’t really explain much about the main characters and why they really were the main characters in the first place. It starts out with Saya and her friend seeming to be way to close then just friends. Saya pretty much lost her memory and goes to blood...transfusions often. As she does all this, she searches for her memories. Then all hell breaks loose that same first episode. WARNING! There is a little bit of spoilers in this review.There is a saying that goes around the show of ‘whatever will be, will be’ but yet, the show does not really keep to this. Other interesting things is the fact that the monsters in this are similar to vampires and yet, they are not exactly like vampires. It actually feels pretty interesting in that sense for it gives it a feel all its own (and yes, I know there are a couple animes out there with almost the same feel. This one at least tries to be different though). Much of the story is rather sad and dark, with only a little bit of comedy what doesn’t stand out well.We will talk about Saya first. Saya is just like a normal girl with a big secret. She is actually not human, but yet not like the monsters (Chiropteran) she fights. From the moment she tastes Hagi’s blood, she remembers things about her past that were sealed away when she fell asleep 30 years before. Its really hard talking about her and the other characters for it can really bring about spoilers for the show.Hagi is her Chevalier and only person who have been alive almost as long as Saya has. He was bought from his parents as though he was a piece of livestock with the hope he would ‘breed’ with Saya like they were animals. I actually really do with that the two would get together and find happiness because they are a rather cute couple. He’s the rather silent type almost all knowing and truly cares about Saya.There is a deep connection between Saya and her adopted family. It’s so great that when Saya leaves, they end up trying to follow her to help her as much as they can. It’s really heartfelt and will bring tears to your eyes if you’re rather sentimental about this type of stuff.The animation is actually rather beautiful, looking like it was done almost perfectly. At times, the scenes are rather dark and give a rather horror based look about the show, and then it will actually lighten up to make it a little more cheerful. As the story gets going, the darker it gets and the more fight scenes happen. I know this is a little strange to say, but in Anime terms, Saya actually does look a lot like a Korean. Other characters are a bit interesting, though there really wasn’t much that stood out. I love how they created Hagi in the rather quiet and mysterious type of character. He has a very Victorian feel about him everywhere he goes.The music is beautiful, mostly orchestra related and captures the sad moods rather well.  The voices are actually pretty good, though some of the supporting characters sound a bit off. They made the perfect voice for Hagi as Crispin Freeman. He’s perfect for the mysterious style of guy.

Although not having many plot twists, they  are fierce and shocking beyond belief. The story can be somewhat predictable at times for the seasoned otaku but the parts of the story that were predictable were intended to be that way o give the viewer a sense of security. In addition to predicatble moments in plot the suspensful ones more than compansate for it. Lastley, the ending to this anime is immaculate. The creators provided an ending that the viewer wanted instead of one that the viewer had to create themselfs or were extreamly dissapointed with.Art:...The artwork in Blood + could be described as good but not the best out there. By no streach of the imagination does the artwork compare to the unparalleled work found in Clannad/AS or Kanon(2006), but does posses artwork on par with Deathnote. Deathnote combines anime style art and the real appearance of people giving anime characters a more human /realistic look, and Blood + did this as well. The animation is fluid with and has great detail.Sound: Sound was not the bread and butter for this anime. I did not really notice alot of the soundtrack while watching the aniem prolly because I was so absorbed in the story. Anyway, a soundtrack has to be memorable in order to be considered great. A great example of a fantastic sound track would be Clannad. The redeming quality for sound though were the opening and closing themes. I have all the themes on my Itunes they were so good. Having artists like Jinn doing an opening theme will really make the feel of the anime more nastalgic. I would say that this anime has  not so great sound trak but the opening and closing themes are it's saving grace.Characters: The characters in this anime are perfect. The creators went into depth with the characters they needed to and shrowded others in mystery for the same purpose. When the viewer cares about the well ebing of the other characters then that anime has amazing characters and the creators did a great job. plus, the protagonist's development blew me away. Saya took a complete 180 in the first season and slowly reverted back to her old self. Also, the viewer will remember the entire cast without effort meaning that if the characters were that memorable they were done well. The overall character development is second to noe as well. No anime that I have seen has ever developed their characters better than Blood +.Overall: To say that this anime is a masterpeice is more than an understatement. Having a perfect story, characters, and near perfect art with a decent soundtrack makes Blood + the series to watch. i watched this sries in six days because I was so absorbed in it.

So please people, be tolerantOK, first of all this animé was recommended by the MAL community as a similar one to Claymore, so I decided to give it a shot.I have to say that this animé has the best character development of all. One can never say, whatthe characters are going to do next, mainly because they can be seen sometimes as controversial. I have to say that I was a little disappointed with the level of detail in some scenes, but overall the animation...is superb. The music is the best part about this animé - if you are into opera or sad cello concertos, be sure to watch this one.Now, the plot: The animé doesn't follow only the protagonist, but also has some parallel stories which enriches the whole experience. For me, at least, there we're a lot of open questions which found their answers only near the end of the show. One more thing, the last six or seven slow down the pace a little bit finishing the parallel stories I spoke of earlier. The finale is both dramatic and optimistic, it doesn't leave unanswered questions but yet manages to convince us that the story will continue and the viewer will certainly be satisfied.So, to sum up: If you like drama-packed animés with kick-ass protagonists and meticulously written plot, and also that bloody fighting scenes have a charm of their own, then this animé is just for you!Again, as I've said, this is my first review, so constructive criticism is more the welcome, but spare me your unmotivated anger.Boris Yanchev is superb.

At the start of the series I didn't know where this was going; I mean the typical high school girl everyday life thing did not much match with the title. But I digress, as the series progresses the main protagonist Saya and Haji, and her family are thrust in a torrent of tragedies one after the other. And this was one of the best things that this series have to offer, the character development....I love how the characters learn to cope with their losses in their own way and as well as how the anime make us sympathize for the main antagonist, Diva. Saya and Diva are foils to one another and it was entertaining to see the two going after one another's throat and unraveling their causes of disputes.Another one of the great things this anime has to offer its is music. Yes, both the opening and closing does great justice to the seriousness of the anime and compliments them. I also want to applaud the soundtrack and theme music of each character as they are extremely memorable: to Diva's song to Haji's cello and the epic songs when a chiropteran battles in place. It keeps the adrenalin in tact all right,To me, this was one of the very well-done animation of the 2000s. I watched this in my early teens and the animations looks unique and pleasing to the eyes. The action mixed with the drama creates a whole new dimensions of entertainment if you don't mind the blood. This is a great gem found in the piles of vampires stories that didn't made you quench because of how cliches it was or how mindless is the plot.Blood + has a great balanced of gore, drama and action that makes you looking for more of this roller coaster ride. If you want a refreshing heart-throb and a little blood, this is the anime for you. Just a warning: prepare a tissue cause I certainly did need it. I love how the characters learn to cope with their losses in their own way and as well as how the anime make us sympathize for the main antagonist, Diva. Saya and Diva are foils to one another and it was entertaining to see the two going after one another's throat and unraveling their causes of disputes.Another one of the great things this anime has to offer its is music. Yes, both the opening and closing does great justice to the seriousness of the anime and compliments them. I also want to applaud the soundtrack and theme music of each character as they are extremely memorable: to Diva's song to Haji's cello and the epic songs when a chiropteran battles in place.

Sadly for me, it was nothing more than an exercise in advanced animation techniques. I praised it for very sharp attention to detail in regards to the visuals. However, I thought it was very close to worthless in other areas. The story left a lot to be explored and when I heard about Blood+ being a 50 episode series based on Saya; I figured here goes that missing part to the story. Contrary to what some folks...would have you believe. Blood+ is not a sequel to the original movie, and the creators made no attempt to tie the two together. This is a separate story that examines Saya from a different perspective and explores her origin.The first area I must hit on are the production values. In regards to the visuals, Blood+ is very beautiful with some very fluid animation frame by frame. These visuals are very close to top notch for a TV series. The animation during the battles are very good with nice choreography at times and the scenes can be violent and brutal, with lots of sword play resulting in dismemberments.The backgrounds are simply gorgeous as they effectively combine with the CG. The ocean, river, and snow laden backdrops are outstanding, and it\'s the little things that appealed to my senses like high speed trains going by in the night time.The character designs are also very pretty, and I thought it was a plus that the old school girl uniform wasn\'t being used to death to give anime perverts something to constantly drool over. Saya is seen in many different types of clothes, and most of the time she is very conservative. The fan service is kept pretty low and this is not something you will hear me complain about ever. Some of the villains look great too with some of the more powerful chiropterans having freakish appearances.The soundtrack is also very well composed with some of the dramatic scenes being supported by a slow paced, melancholic piano backdrop. The opening and ending credits have some pretty nice themes as well and they do change later on.Despite the heavy action feel of the original movie. Blood+ is actually a lot more character driven. Now don\'t get me wrong, there are several action scenes with some good sword fighting and heavy gore; but the characters are the main focus and I consider them a mixed bag for the most part. Saya is heavily developed as the story deals a lot more with her human side, and although she\'s a very flawed heroine in regards to toughness. She\'s difficult to truly dislike. Additional characters possess heavy potential for drama but most of the side characters are nothing more than mere stereotypes, and even though some may have a bit of depth it makes several of them no less annoying. Fortunately thanks to at least one key character death I can\'t say they were that bad.The series features a great amount of suspense and the viewer would more than likely be gripped to the screen while waiting for the next revelation. The plot follows Saya as she begins to exterminate the creatures called Chiropterans. Along the way, there are certain factions introduced and the lead antagonist is of course revealed with this character playing a huge role in Saya\'s origin, as well as things moving forward.Blood+ is decent at best and had potential to be far better. However, the series has some pacing issues because it juggles many side stories. There are way too many side plots taking place and finding time for all these events plus character interactions were a lot of times distracting. I think several characters and situations could have been left on the cutting room floor, and this would have helped the story move a lot more fluid. I understand that a lot of these things played into Saya\'s character development, but this was one of those cases of too much character development, and as a result, it gave away Saya\'s actions in the final cut. The foreshadowing was so strong to the point where it heavily took away from the ""deciding moment"".I praised the series for its use of drama, but due to the obvious I felt that a certain dramatic moment wasn\'t as strong as it should have been. In addition, some of these elements began to repeat themselves over and over as if the point wasn\'t made clear the first couple of times. I think these segments will differ from person to person all depending on how much they bought into the characters. Since I didn\'t really care for all of them some of the segments really didn\'t appeal to me much.I will give this series credit for tonal consistency. There are some brief moments of comedy injected, but it\'s not the least bit forced nor does it distract from the serious nature of the content unlike Hellsing Ultimate, which is heavily damaged by its shifts in comedic moments. When looking at the style of Blood+ compared to that I have to say it\'s well written.Blood+ could have been an amazing anime. It\'s definitely far from a bad title, but due to several issues in its storyline it just comes off as an average title. I didn\'t feel like it was a waste of time, yet I wish back then I didn\'t buy completely into the hype and simply put it off for awhile. In closing, I recommend this to most anime fans, those whom loved the original movie, and even those that hated it.Highs: Production values, some interesting characters, endingLows: Pacing issues that really hurts main narrative would have you believe.

Blood+ this is a magnificent Anime, it has some good action, a deep twisting plot (though I am sure someof you will say it is a recycled plot, I assure you it is not), Deep, and when I say deep I mean FUCKING DEEP characters. There is something about an anime that can let you connect with more than one character on an emotional level.The anime revolves around Saya Otonashi, an high school girl who is a hemopheliac who has to get blood transfusions regularlly. She meets a mysterious man who plays a Chello who saves her...life from a beast in her school. This mysterious man gives Saya a sword with a portion of the blade reversed whith a vein for her blood to travel down and through the blade. Apparently her (Saya) blood is key to destroying these ""beasts"".As far as story goes, Some of you may think, ""Wow, another conspiracy theory against the USA, BORING recylcled plot."" but I assure you if you invest your time in the first 4-5 episodes you will be drawn into the series until the end.The art is very mature, there is a lot of bood, the muzzle flashes from the gunshots don\'t look very animated, they look more like big lens flares and supernova effects. The detail of many of the characters are very well done, though overall it seems as though the artist(s) were holding back, for example the intermissions sequences show a little bit more of the talent that I believe should have been applied throught the entire series.The sound isnt anything spectacular, it isn\'t bad but it isnt great. I bumped my score of it up to a 7 instead of a 5 because I absolutely love the opening and closing themes.The Characters, oh boy isnt this a topic... Saya, David, Kai, Riku, Haji the list goes on. These characters have such a deep earthly connection to each other that (at least I could) it leaves veiwes able to connect with them and feel a part of the problems and emotions directed throughout the entire series. When Saya remembers her past one the day at the Zoo during *unnamed character*\'s birthday made me feel as though I was in Saya\'s shoes, I actually felt really guilty, as if it was MY fault that the events had occcured.Enjoyment, hrmmm I dont know how to put it other than, everytime I finished an episode I felt compelled to watch the next, and the next, and the next, so on and so forth. I would say that this is one of the most enjoyable anime\'s out.I know there are going to be a lot of people who disagree with me and my thoughts, but I also think that there are a lot of people who are going to agree.

Though she has only lived with them for a year and can remember nothing of her past, her father George and brothers Kai and Riku take care of her and have given her the chance at a normal life. Things change quickly, however, when strange creatures appear in Okinawa, and soon Saya finds herself face-to-face with a blood-sucking monster. Narrowly escaping death, she is saved by a mysterious man named Hagi, and even more surprisingly, is able to fight and kill these creatures. As the incidence of attacks on civilians by...the monsters increases, Saya is forced into cooperation with the mysterious Red Shield organization. What awaits her is a journey from which neither she, her family, nor the world can escape. In the process of fighting to protect humanity, she will learn the dark secrets of her past.Blood+ is a success from the start. The viewer is quickly drawn into a world of urgency, suspense, and uncertainty, all centering around a loving family and seemingly loving teenage girl. Blood makes a habit of having horrific twists and turns, and it is exactly this approach which makes the series such a pleasure to watch. What's more, unlike so many other anime that have achieved success abroad, there is no real sense of progress or powering-up by the protagonist. For virtually the entire show there is a sense of despair as it seems that Saya and her allies pose no real threat to their powerful enemy and the worldwide network that it has established. Further, the series avoids typical pitfalls such as filler episodes and inappropriate length: at 50 episodes, the duration felt perfect. As for animation, the visuals are clean, bright, and rather detailed, as would be expected from a reputable show. While there is nothing special here, there is nothing particularly wrong either (though don't expect any impressive fight scenes).The voice actors were pretty pivotal for me: while the Japanese actors are passionate and bring life to the characters, the English actors sound misplaced. In the English version, Saya becomes a much younger-sounding girl, Hagi a far more British-sounding man, and Van is suddenly cast as a German. All of this detracts from a storyline that carries itself without the need for such vocal creativity. The show's soundtrack is well done and the Bach pieces performed by Hagi add to the elements of suspense and despair. The most memorable song and theme throughout the series, Diva's Song, is a truly beautiful opera piece which brings to life the evil genius of the enemy.

It was the first anime that I went and found on my own, without referral from friends, and endeavored to finish...

Honestly, if I\'d been introduced to this anime in a similar way, I\'d do the same thing.

The art is excellent, proportionate and very smoothly animated, and there isn\'t any of that over-dramatic flashy crap whenever there\'s a plot twist that seems to scream ""PLOT TWIST!

"", 'A girl who fights monsters. Basically Japanese Buffy, but with a katana instead of stakes.But under the careful guidance of Production I.G, the simple premise and seemingly overused vampire setting of Blood+ is turned into something more thoughtful and satisfying. Originally a 2000 movie titled ""Blood: The Last Vampire"" by the same studio, Blood+ has a similar premise as Buffy in that it has a girl as the Chosen One destined to fight vampires, but that\'s where the similarities mostly end. Instead, the protagonist, ""Saya Otonashi"", goes on a more dramatic and epic journey that\'s not too different from your traditional Shakespearean protagonist, one that\'s...larger than life and goes beyond the American formulas of ""vampire hunter by night.""Also, it\'s sad. Like incredibly sad. Like ""Buffy almost looks like a Disney sitcom compared to Blood+"" sad. While the anime starts out like any typical shoujo or even shounen anime, where the main character has good times with her friends, just fooling around like there\'s no tomorrow, things become bleak pretty fast as people start dropping dead, and Saya becomes so numb that she curses her own existence and literally just wants to die. Try that for depression, Buffy fans.When I first heard of this anime back then, I dismissed it as just another typical vampire fighting story. In many ways, Blood+\'s plot is traditional like that, lacking that need to insert unexpected twists or self-parody elements you see in modern TV. What you see is what you get, which is a bit of surprise considering that Production I.G. was known for much more complex works like Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. When I saw the studio\'s name attached to such a seemingly generic work, I was naturally intrigued and gave it a shot, and you do see some elements of their style here, like the heavy use of political jargon (without being too excessive that the plot becomes confusing) and the unrelenting use of mature subjects. In fact, much of the morbidness found in their Tsubasa: Tokyo Revelation adaptation could be found here, with characters often questioning the worth of their own existence, and their morality and motivations are often blurred in grey, including the kind-hearted Saya herself.But what stands out in Blood+ is its hope in all the doom and gloom. Most vampire anime tend to just emphasize on how brutal the world is, but here, the optimistic Okinawan idiom, ""Nankurunaisa"" (""everything is gonna be alright,"" as said by Bob Marley) is constantly repeated by the characters as a catchphrase to remind themselves that the sun would shine again tomorrow in the darkest of nights, no matter how many times the good guys lose (and boy, do they lose a lot).Another distinctive element found in Production I.G.\'s anime is its patient exploration of the side characters. Like literally, the anime can be very slow in ""getting to the good part,"" but never was I bored by the story because it\'s always focused on something important, be it character development, character revelation, or just a reflection of a character\'s philosophy. Much like Buffy, there\'s usually a theme in each episode and a message to be learned by the characters.Arguably, the best part of the show is its avoidance of romance as an easy way to attract the audience. Much like Buffy, there is a forbidden romance sub-plot in Blood+ too, but it\'s rarely focused on, which is good, because they are fighting a literal war where people die everyday. Kissy smoochy stuff like that just wouldn\'t make much sense, and it\'s befits Production I.G.\'s nature to keep their worlds realistic and believable.Overall, Blood+ has been a satisfying and solid experience worth giving a look. It\'s not Production I.G.\'s best, and I do favor Hellsing Ultimate over this just because I like my action to be more fun and exaggerated, but this heart-rending story is well-crafted and emotional enough to be worth a look. larger than life and goes beyond the American formulas of ""vampire hunter by night.""Also, it\'s sad.

When I saw the studio\'s name attached to such a seemingly generic work, I was naturally intrigued and gave it a shot, and you do see some elements of their style here, like the heavy use of political jargon (without being too excessive that the plot becomes confusing) and the unrelenting use of mature subjects. In fact, much of the morbidness found in their Tsubasa: Tokyo Revelation adaptation could be found here, with characters often questioning the worth of their own existence, and their morality and motivations are often blurred in grey, including the kind-hearted Saya herself.But what stands out in Blood+ is its hope in all the doom and gloom. Most vampire anime tend to just emphasize on how brutal the world is, but here, the optimistic Okinawan idiom, ""Nankurunaisa"" (""everything is gonna be alright,"" as said by Bob Marley) is constantly repeated by the characters as a catchphrase to remind themselves that the sun would shine again tomorrow in the darkest of nights, no matter how many times the good guys lose (and boy, do they lose a lot).Another distinctive element found in Production I.G.\'s anime is its patient exploration of the side characters. Like literally, the anime can be very slow in ""getting to the good part,"" but never was I bored by the story because it\'s always focused on something important, be it character development, character revelation, or just a reflection of a character\'s philosophy. Much like Buffy, there\'s usually a theme in each episode and a message to be learned by the characters.Arguably, the best part of the show is its avoidance of romance as an easy way to attract the audience. Much like Buffy, there is a forbidden romance sub-plot in Blood+ too, but it\'s rarely focused on, which is good, because they are fighting a literal war where people die everyday. Kissy smoochy stuff like that just wouldn\'t make much sense, and it\'s befits Production I.G.\'s nature to keep their worlds realistic and believable.Overall, Blood+ has been a satisfying and solid experience worth giving a look. It\'s not Production I.G.\'s best, and I do favor Hellsing Ultimate over this just because I like my action to be more fun and exaggerated, but this heart-rending story is well-crafted and emotional enough to be worth a look.', ""Let me start off by saying that it's rare that I give an anime -especially one that I watched that was a dub- a 10.Years ago when it aired on Adult Swim, I had only seen bits and pieces of it. Unfortunately, what I had seen, was the very last episode. I never heard much about Blood+, but I decided I would give the show a chance and watch the entire thing from beginning to end. SO glad that I did.Story:10/10Ok, yes, it's about vampires. But only to an extent. The actual 'vampires' are huge, ugly, monstrous, and about as far from human as...you can get. With all the vampire craze going on at the moment, it was nice to see scary, in-humane blood-sucking beasts for a change. No sparkly crap here! With that out of the way, the story is about a high school girl with no memory of the previous year, has to get frequent blood transfusions, and can eat enough to sustain an army. She was adopted into a family with two foster brothers, Kai and Riku. Everything is going great until she notices a man playing the cello on the streets for a crowd. After getting a flash of her memory, encountering a mounstrous beast that tries to kill her, and meeting that mysterious cello player, her entire world changes.This anime gives you clues and leaves you guessing until the very last episode. Never a dull moment.Art:8/10Saya's hair pissed me off to no end. I HATE her hair. She is a beautiful girl with a butch cut. Haji had narrow, beady eyes that made him looked stoned throughout the anime. Other than that, the art and animation was flawless. The fight scenes were fantastic and no cencorship on the blood and gore, which was actually refreshing for a change. I mean, this show is about vampires, so there has to be blood and death. Yay for no cencorship!Sound:9/10I tried watching the Japanese version first, but was frequently pissed off by the pronounciation of the American names. After the 10th episode, I reluctantly switched to the dub, and boy was I surprised. Good dubs are hard to find, and Blood+ has one of the best dubs out there. The voice actors matched the characters to a tee, and they even did the accents of the French and Russian characters. The only voice I had a problem with was Riku's. He was supposed to be about 13 and he sounded like a five year old.Characters:10/10Saya: Saya is one of the only female leads that can kick butt and stand up for herself. She grows and matures throughout each episode and is willing to die to protect those who she loves. Even though she has to shoulder the burden of purifying the world of the Chiropterans, she remains strong.Haji: Haji was a great main character, even though he rarely showed any form of emotion. He is devoted to Saya and has promised to follow her until the end. Not much to say about him, aside from that. He's cool, but that's about it.Kai: Kai is one of my favorite characters in the show. He had the most character development and was actually useful from time to time. Loved him to death.Enjoyment:Action, history, vampires, fighting, blood, romance, angst, comedy. What more could you ask for in an anime? This show ROCKED and I'm proud to have it listed under my favorites. you can get.

At first I was hesitant to watch this, but since I first saw promotion video made by adultswim, I decided why not give it a try. The plot was really mind twisting, there were mostly a lot of feedback of Saya\'s memories and times where they story just started to drift off with other characters point of view. But this made the story much more interesting. The music was the amazing since it fitted to the fighting scenes and not to mention the mood of the...story. The way the Diva sang gave me chills while watching this even reading the manga. Though it was long and the romance was mostly a cliffhanger, this gave a chance for the story it self to unravel the truth of Saya and why she exist in the world. The characters devotion to other characters strike a homerun in the plot, especially Haji and Saya relationship of a chevalier and a chiropteran queen surely created an irresistible romance.""Nankurunaisa"" meaning it\'ll be alright gave hope, enlightening the story with a memorable ending. story.

Blood+ takes you on a journey rather than an adventure. The journey makes you see a lot of things and honestly by the end, you won't even remember how it all started because so much has happened in so little time. I call it a journey instead of an adventure because I feel like journeys are more about people and adventures are more about the events. There are probably fewer shows on journeys than...adventures, but there are even fewer shows on journeys that are actually adventurous.Maybe that's why I find Blood+ kind of special compared to other vampire, gory, military, or action packed shows. To say Blood+ is a show about vampires is entirely wrong. It has pretty much a little of everything. But surprising, it's not messy. I personally prefer simple and focused stories, not really because I don't like adventure packed shows. I just think one One Piece or one Gintama is enough, unless you can give me something greater. Simple stories are easier to bring out the meanings, and simple stories are easier to stay focused. Of course, they tend to get boring if you have a bunch of stereotyped characters. Not even the most outrageous situation can save those type of shows.Going back to Blood+. It's definitely not a simple story and it definitely did not come out of Jump, but it's not like your average mecha or vampire series either. Vampires, especially blood, in different relationships and situations mean differently. Blood+ pretty much weaved all the different meanings of blood together in a presentable form, which I think is brilliant. some of you like me won't think anything special about it even after finishing it.

You get so attached to the characters and feel all their emotions. I was always kept on my toes, wondering what would happen next. The emotions in this anime though; they were so strong. In my opinion, it wasn't boring during the beginning or middle, unlike some anime. This was absolutely a fantastic anime that was violent, filled with drama and entertaining throughout the whole thing. There was a little romance and some parts that made me chuckle but this was a little more serious overall.

However, Blood+ is really special in a sense that it motivated someone as indolent as me to write this review in order to share my enjoyment with you. Ok enough babbling, let’s get to the review.In terms of plot progression, the series is full of suspense, leaving the audience dying to figure out the unanswered questions (e.g. regarding Saya’s past). The series also kept the audience excited with full of plot twists and surprises. Some surprises are really mind fuckers! Yet, the surprises did not seem awkward at all thanks to the help of...well planned foreshadowing.The central theme of Blood+ deals with several difficult dilemmas. For example, what does it mean to be human? Is it true that whatever is in the best interest of the humans always the right thing to do? Is it right to choose the life of your only family member in the world over saving humanity? The choice for the previous question would be painful regardless of which one you ended up choosing. Also, is it right to save someone’s life knowing that the only way to do so will turn the person into a monster? You can imagine how the choices affected the character’s lives, which leads to my next topic, which is on characterization.What’s attractive about the characterization is that not only there is a wide range of personalities, but also that each recurring character’s personality cannot be described simply by one sentence. The personality of each recurring character is multi-faceted and undergoes an extensive development.  For example, we can see that Saya grew from a soft crybaby to a strong female figure, due to the immense pressure laid on her. Also, we can see that Diva, who exhibited psychopathic traits, became more sympathetic and loving after a particular event (I don’t want to spoil the event). You also have a main antagonist that has been mistreated for her entire life and you couldn’t help but want to sympathize with her.Furthermore, Blood+ would be a bonus for you if you are into series with a sad and tense atmosphere. Some of the most tragic and emotive moments include a peaceful and loving family got shattered, the character that you got attached to died, and the nice guy, who provided major emotional support to the important characters, met his cruel end. By the way, I don’t want to spoil anything but whatever happened to the main antagonist in the end is truly heartbreaking. However, I want to make the point that despite the tragedies in the series, the characters continue to maintain their positive energy and fight for their core values.Now I am going to talk about aspects that I wish the series could have done differently. First, the series is kind of long. For god’s sake, it is 50 episodes! I think the series can certainly be made more compact. For instance, there are some unnecessary subplots in my opinion, such as the story of the Schiffs, which was just telling the same thing as the rest of the story and did nothing in terms of furthering the theme and the important characters. Second, the first 5 episodes are way too slow! I know most anime watchers use the first few episodes of the series to determine if it is worth watching, and if the first few episodes are shit, it will lose a lot of audience. Lastly, I was expecting way more blood and gore judging from the title. Before I watched the series, I was really excited and expected it to be around the same level of goriness as say Elfen Lied, Berserk, Claymore, Deadman Wonderland, Gantz, etc. But, its level of goriness is just around that of Shiki, Fullmetal Alchemist and Bleach. I suspect that there could be a number of audiences that came here for the blood (because of the title) but ended up being disappointed. well planned foreshadowing.The central theme of Blood+ deals with several difficult dilemmas.

Only Hellsing Ultimate is slitghly better in the genre of vampire animes in my opinion. I dont want you to be miss led and belive that the shows are simuilar, they are quite different from each other. So ok, why is Blood+ one of my favorite anime ever? Let´s go down to that.Story: 10/10Absolutly fantastic! Its nothing new that humanity (and sometimes fellow vampires) is fighting against vampires, but this show does it right in every aspect. It takes this not so uncommen theme and makes something very orginial and deep...of it. Then you put in global politiical and military conspiracys, good action, drama and wonderful character developemnts - than you how Blood+. It also have a bit of reverse harem done very right in it.The story are pretty dark and gets darker the further the show progressess, which in my opinion only makes it more realstic - there are no plot armor what so ever. I really enjoyed that the truth and background to the whole story, is revealed to you in the means of Saya getting her memories back - bit by bit. Yes, you get little more info than that, by watching other characters memories and converstions, but it slowly comes toghter beautifully. This made me keep high alert during every episode, due to cluse came here and there, sometimes you would had mist it if you didnt pay close attation. Blood+ really makes you think of the deeper nature of both humans and monsters. Whats drives us to do what we do, how much our environment effects us and how do we get through dark times, which may seem endless? And deep down we all want to be accepted and loved. The show is also much about to fight your true nature and have the strength to carry out your duty, even if may kill you. Could write a freaking novel about this story and why its  so awesome, but I gonna leave it here for now.Art: 9/10Is absolutly great. As usal it has its flaws here and there, but are overall very beautiful. Character designs, colours, backgrounds is outstanding in my opinion. Action scense are very well exicuted, with fluid motions and feeling. You can often really feel the weight the fight has on the characters, and how it effects them emtionally during the fight and afterwards.Sound: 10/10One word - AMAZING. Absolute one of the best soundtracks I ever heard in a anime (mayby otherwise as well). All music is calssical with live intrusment (they most have heired a whole orcester for this), and are perfectly adapted to which kind of scene it is and the mood of it. If you not gonna watch the show (which you should), i recommend that go at least listen to the soundtrack for the pure reason that it is beautiful. As I often do I watched the dubbed version. I wasnt the least dissiponited, the vocie actors was great. They really made a good job of breathing life into the characters and making them feel real.Character: 10/10Here will I use one word again - OUTSTANDING. They all very personal, realistic and deep. Even most of the side characters feels like so much thought and time been put in to.Saya - Our MC, the girl who only remember the last year of her life. To follow her, was truley enjoyble and many times sad. She probaly has the most extental character development of all. From being a normal girl that goes to high school and enjoy her calm days with her adopted family (execept that she needs blood tranfusions) - only to discover that she is by no means a normal girl. That she has a dark past she cant remember (execpt for a very bloody nightmare), that she is the only one that can kill terrfing monsters, that people around her starts to dying and she is dragged in to something that big and complexe that an happy ending seems impossible. Saya is e very kind hearted person, which makes this story even sadder. To see how Saya has to adapt when memories and events is forced on to her, is nothing less then impressive. Because even do she may start out a bit frail and hesitent, but she grows stronger and stronger (both in mind and body). For the storys heroine she is brillaint.Haji - Sayas loyal companion. He is very quite and reclusive but than things starts to go to hell he is there and becomes a total badass. He dress in very tradtional cloths (like 1800 th) and carries a big case which contains his cello and Sayas katana. Its quite clear from the begning that he cares for Saya alot, even do she cant remember him. To watch their relationship to grow throughot the story was beautiful.There are so many more fantasic characters in this show, but i cant really go in to the depth with them all (novel warning agagin). But other great character which should at least be mentioned is Kai, Riku, David, Diva, Amshel and Solomon.They all contrbiute to the story in their own special way and are all very rememberble and special.Enjoyment: 10/10I was hooked from episode 1 through all the 50 episodes. Blood+ really gives you an emtional ride, sadness, excitement, hope and happiness. Absolutly enjoyed every second of it. Not even for a bit was i bored, confused (because you get the answers to most of the qusteions you may have given little time) or annoyed. This was pure bliss to me. I sat on edge in almost every episode and they manage to build up the mystery and story without it feeling rushed or slow pased. And the music.. as I mentioned before it is a masterpiece in its own.Overall: 10/10I gonna keep it short here. Then all above is put toghter a beautiful, complex and facinating story is told. MASTERPIECE is truly the word. I would recommed Blood+ to everyone. I thnik most people would find some elements in the show that they liked. of it.

But other great character which should at least be mentioned is Kai, Riku, David, Diva, Amshel and Solomon.They all contrbiute to the story in their own special way and are all very rememberble and special.Enjoyment: 10/10I was hooked from episode 1 through all the 50 episodes. Blood+ really gives you an emtional ride, sadness, excitement, hope and happiness. Absolutly enjoyed every second of it. Not even for a bit was i bored, confused (because you get the answers to most of the qusteions you may have given little time) or annoyed. This was pure bliss to me. I sat on edge in almost every episode and they manage to build up the mystery and story without it feeling rushed or slow pased. And the music.. as I mentioned before it is a masterpiece in its own.Overall: 10/10I gonna keep it short here. Then all above is put toghter a beautiful, complex and facinating story is told. MASTERPIECE is truly the word. I would recommed Blood+ to everyone. I thnik most people would find some elements in the show that they liked.', 'I loved the whole concept and plot of this anime.. but I feel like after season 1 it was a FLOP. The details in the animation decreased by about 70% and that`s odd because shouldn`t it be getting better after each season? For example in season 3 in the anime look at the television and how the reporters are drawn. I usually cackle at bad drawings but I really liked the idea of this anime and I was upset that the directors/executives didn`t take more time with it. I`m a stickler for good drawing so I rated it harshly. However I did finished it because...I remember watching it years ago and never did. Lastly some of the characters` actions were so illogical I felt as though they were just killing off everybody for no reason. I remember watching it years ago and never did. Lastly some of the characters` actions were so illogical I felt as though they were just killing off everybody for no reason.', 'Blood+ is vampire anime with a solid mix of action and mystery.However before you get into watching it, let me just warn you that unless you love a main character who is incredibly dumb, naive and a straight up wuss, you\'re better off watching something else.Honestly, everything else this anime does great is dragged down by the incredibly unlikeable main character and even some of the supporting cast.Saya is a main character with off the charts powers, but she decides it\'s better be a scared damsel in distress who gets manipulated by literally everybody because she\'s as naive as can be and without any...sense of rationality. Episode after episode you want to say ""do something you potato"" but instead you\'re treated for another scene of her falling to her knees and randomly sobbing for no good reason.Imagine if you find out you have superpowers. Super speed, super strength, can heal from any wound, and oh yeah, you need to get random blood transfusions every other day. Would that make you question something? Probably, yeah?No Saya though. To her none of those things are ever worth asking any questions about. You\'d think she\'d be curious about all her superpowers, where they come from, what do they mean etc. But nope. She doesn\'t bother to ask a god damn thing, just does what some random creepy dudes she met 5 minutes ago tell her. Until she runs into a vampire who tells her a bunch of nonsense and she\'s like: ""oh yeah, that\'s totally what it all means, I never cared to ask but now that you evil bloodsucking monster tell me some stuff I\'ll instantly believe everything""It\'s mind blowingly absurd.Her two brothers are no better. One who happily rushes off to kill himself for a stepsister he\'s known for a year, and the other who\'s primary reason for existing is to be a useless kid who drags everyone down. Like seriously, imagine you just ran into a vampire monster who ripped someone\'s head off and punches straight through walls and shrugs off bullets. Is your first reaction like: ""I\'mma go and beat the shit out of that thing with my bare hands and maybe a gun I can\'t really shoot""? Fuck no, that would be idiotic. Yet he keeps doing shit like that, constantly butting his head into everyone\'s business as if his 1-year of stepbrother relation is somehow grounds for being an annoyance to literally everybody.It\'s just dumb.Unlike many other shows, there\'s really no ""connection"" between the main characters either. You don\'t develop feelings for any of them. In fact, I spent most of the anime wishing they\'d just kill them all off and introduce someone more competent. The characters just lack any in-depth personality and emotions. It\'s like you\'re watching animated cardboard figures.I\'ve seen anime develop a better emotional connections between family members within 10 minutes, than Blood+ does in 5 hours.Failing in this regard removes a huge emotional impact from the show.Art and sound are good. The overall story pretty good. But god damn if the main character and a large part of the cast just doesn\'t take most of the joy out of watching this anime.Still, if you can tolerate poor characters, the rest of the show is good.

She really grows in you and by the last episodes, you truly care about her! This also applies -in a smaller scale- to some of the other characters, such as Haji, Solomon, and even Diva. If you\'re into character development, you\'ll like this aspect of the series! That said, in the other hand: There are some serious pacing issues and the sci-fi military sub-plots end up taking you nowhere memorable. Add that to the ""a little too much"" romantic intents and well... :-( When ""Blood+"" is at its best, it\'s...BRILLIANT! There are moments of absolute exquisite cinematography, very high production values, and you can bet your heart is gonna get wrenched... but I can\'t help to think that with more focus on the strong elements of its universe (vampires, promises, destinies...) and around 20 episodes less, we could\'ve had a modern classic. I hope someday ""Blood+"" gets the ""Brotherhood"" treatment, if you know what I mean. In the meantime, give it a chance, but don\'t expect a a hidden masterpiece. BRILLIANT!

Honestly, this ought to be one of the classics which I'd recommend to any otaku rookie next to FMA and Death Note. It's really got it all; from emotional roller coasters over eye-opening life lessons to sexy waifus battling mosters and superhumans with big swords-it's all in there, and it all blends incredibly well. Plot progression is its strongest aspect in my opinion; it rarely spends too much time on a scene that doesn't entirely captivate your interest but never feels rushed either. While keeping that balance, it manages to combine very mature themes...frequently centered around the experiences, psychology and resulting ideology of the MC with spot-on comedy and light-hearted moments from the side characters.Without delwing into spoiler territory though, please keep in mind that this show is everything but a comedy show and doesn't exactly make your day with the scarily realistic bleakness and struggles of the intriguing personalities of both the main and side cast. This show made depressed me tear up a fair bit more often than fall out my seat laughing, you have been warned.In addition, here's some well-intentioned advice: Be careful with your attachments ;)Bonus points: the OP were so good, I skipped them less times then not (coming from somebody who oftentimes skips the plot before the opening out of sheer boredom).

It is truly pure joy."", 'First of all, the episodes are a lot. And when it\'s a lot, viewers will have expectations. We would wish that the main characters ( respectively Saya and Diva ) are the ones who will mature more, become wiser and stronger, we get to see their full struggle and understandings regarding their motives and stories.But there aren\'t as much as developments that we wished to see. Perhaps we wish for too much, given that Saya, a sixteen years old girl, is expected to mature and become wiser like her fellow brother and comrades.But the truth is, Saya isn\'t just a sixteen years old...girl. Whether she accept it or not, she is a 100 year old something and not a human. She\'s a vampire with humanity, but not a human. The disappointment come from the fact that she is supposed to be the protagonist here and battle against ""evil"" aka Diva.But Diva has no time to ""accept the fact that she\'s a vampire/monster"". She was locked away. She has no friends, no family, she was simply an animal and test subject for years. She has no pink dresses and pink roses, no Hagi, no father or brothers, no schools, and even her chevaliers have no interest in her personal life; one seeks power, one admires her talent, one was forced into it, and so on, and so on. She has her sister chasing her with the intent of killing her but she shows no fear. She destroys a lot, but so does Saya.Given the many episodes, one would wish that we get to see the character more develops, because there is a lot of room for that. But no, everything is solely focused on Saya.The truth is i admire Saya. She is strong, gentle, and will do anything in her power to protect her family, all the strong points we would want in a hero. But the way the story and overall characters develops, we can expect nothing else.I understand Saya in a way; she is so full of guilt and desperation. If anyone were to stand in her place, one would understand. How much she have done, how much she have sacrificed, and likewise, how much damage she has caused too. She is just want to be done with it. It\'s like she is chasing her own karma. But what i wish from a character like her, especially given the fact that she is has the same blood as the supposed ""bad guy"", is that she understand better, better than her human comrades. What humans can do except study, guessing, and analyze ? Saya though, can just feel it in herself that the kinds like her are a lot more complex than just ""monsters."" Things aren\'t just so black and white. She never once questions the motives of the humans. Why creating these ""schiff""/monsters ? If anything, Diva was so used by the humans for her power.Towards the end of the series, perhaps there is an attempt to be sympathetic for both Saya and Diva, but there\'s no point in it. It would\'ve work if it\'s on episodes 25 or 30, so that we can learn more about the characters, we can actually see the characters try to be themselves rather than just doing what they are ""supposed to do"". Saya is ""supposed"" to kill Diva and Diva is ""supposed"" to be the bad person.This is all a story about guilt. I understand Saya\'s point of view, though. Her sadness perhaps comes from her feeling guilty, but rather than trying to understand and take control of her own view on her own, she always ended up rely on others (particularly her brother) of what to do.My only concern is this : Saya is willing to sacrifice herself. But for what point, she needs to ask herself. Stopping Diva ? From what ? Diva has no clear goals in her evil scheme whatsoever. And supposed Saya feel curious as to who her sister actually is, and understand her, like how much all these humans around her try to understand her and get to know her, that despite her past and urges, she is actually a kind person ? That even though Saya is ""a monster"", a different species, she can have friends, feels sadness and have dreams, attached to a home or memories, and even fall in love, perhaps ?She supposed to question things more, especially things about her own kind. Everyone around Saya are trying to understand her, but not one person, not even Saya, try to understand Diva. The whole series is about Saya is a human, Diva is a subject.In this story, it\'s all about ""no, im not like Diva. im not a monster"".yes, please explain why you are not like Diva and why Diva is the way she is. The more the protagonist understand her opponents, the better. But it all feels like she knows, but she does not understand.It all ended up with, ""Its my fault i let her out. "" – “ I let her out so I have to kill her “ – “ this is it, im going to end it with everything. “She never question anyone or anything. She become mature but still underdeveloped. She cannot decide things for herself.Supposed Diva is kept locked, what then ? No story ? It never occurs to her about why, you might wonder, a girl is locked away ? and most importantly WHO locked her away ? Saya in this past life time was supposed to be young and naive, but not stupid and ignorant. Why would anyone be crazy enough to locked an innocent girl up there, while she, just a normal girl too, was living her normal life not too far from the tower, in her supposed father estate ?She had a great life with her adoptive father and brothers and one day it\'s all gone. But then again, so does everyone involved in her life. All of them lost something.Again, i admire Saya. But i wish how the story develops giving us more chance to see her grow and accepts reality rather than drowning in guilt. The fact is i sympathize with her so much, and she did grow up to be a responsible woman with all her heavy burdens.But i wish she questions more, asks more, and look for more truth. She talks more and try to find out the truth and get to know her own kind, her own urges, her ""supposed"" opponent, etc. Because the truth is, if it weren\'t for her well upbringing and her friends and family, she has the same instinct as Diva. The question is, if their circumstances were the same, what would makes her any different ?If anything, all those people around Diva are the ones who are evil, as opposed to those around Saya. Those around Diva are shown to be power-hungry and possessive, while those around Saya are loving and warm, accepting. It matters a lot.Diva said herself that the people that there are only two kinds of people she have met : people who adore her and people who want to kill her. Not one person ever offer friendship or help to her. One guy want to dominate the world with her power and the other is crazy about art and her ability.Not one person ever have the point where they direct the core issue here : saya and diva background, their species and history, and how they can be the same as much as they can be different from humans. It’s all about “let’s get this over it so we can go back home” and saya, with her guilt, is all about “ending everything here and now”.If anything, the red shield is using Saya too. Not one attempt that the red shield ever do to reach out to Diva to help her or take her under their care, it’s all about finding/keeping the other sister so this other sister can kill her own sister. Saya is the only hope. That’s it.In a way, both saya and diva’s existence is all about humanities best interest. The humans demanded them, which of them that will have more humanity but all in all, everyone then forget the fact that both are humans too in a way, with hopes and fears. In the end they must sacrifice, with one of them dead. That’s it.The future generations, though, have the chance that the both Saya and Diva didn\'t. And that\'s bitter-sweet understanding touches me.The best character development here is Kai. Without him, a lot of things could go wrong. He is the only human with no military background, no super power, that grow up to be stronger and have the something that no one else in this series have : an understanding. He is not the best fighter, no superhuman power, no strong background to back him up, but he understood and is able to look at the core of things.All In all, though, this is one of the best series I’ve ever watched. I will remember this one for a very long time, and even will watch the whole series again and again in the future.Here’s also to all the friendships that Saya ever made throughout the series, and all the amazing characters that we get to see. girl.

I will remember this one for a very long time, and even will watch the whole series again and again in the future.Here’s also to all the friendships that Saya ever made throughout the series, and all the amazing characters that we get to see.', 'Blood+ is a seriously underrated gem. It\'s not a masterpiece, and it probably won\'t top your favorite anime series of all-time (though it\'s possible), but it\'s still great and deserves far more attention than it gets.Story (9/10):The plot of Blood+ is almost perfect; it\'s what all anime should aspire to. It probably deserves a ""9.5"" score for story, if that was possible. It reminds me of Monster in that the plot starts with a very small focus on a specific event, and then gradually over the series, the writers pull the camera back slowly to reveal that there is a huge interconnected web of events...behind everything. This is the right way to build plot complexity. I\'ll give a small warning here that this anime is somewhat dark. It\'s not even close to something like Berserk in terms of darkness, but there is sexual assault and murder, even of characters you may think ""aren\'t supposed to die"". My favorite aspect is that there\'s enough nuance in the plot that you can make some deductions of what will happen next before characters in the show do, if you\'re really paying attention. I\'ve seen some people complain that there\'s too much ""filler"" in this show, but honestly, I didn\'t think was -any- filler in this show. Every single \'arc\' (and honestly, they\'re woven together so seamlessly it can be hard to identify where one \'arc\' ends and another begins) adds new information to the world that Blood+ is building.Characters (8/10):Saya is obviously the heart and soul of the show (and the plot gives very good reasons for this), but the cast of characters that assemble around her and against her are also very well characterized. The villains in particular are very unique, and the show leaves you guessing for a long time who\'s really pulling the strings and who\'s just a puppet. Also worth noting that there are some aspects of a reverse harem here, forming around Saya. There are multiple men who profess their love for her. Saya seems flattered by their interest, but she\'s on a very personal quest and isn\'t interested in any kind of romantic interludes until she\'s done with it. In a way, her motivations strongly mirror those of Kenzo Tenma from Monster (justice/revenge for their mistakes). I really liked this, as it is a very realistic approach. So, if you\'re heavily interested in romance, know that there is some, but it doesn\'t fully develop until the very end. There is a bit of inconsistent characterization around one plot point involving a journal that made me knock the score down here slightly. Also, there\'s a couple of side characters (the journalist and his friend) who don\'t really have a strong reason for existing. The cast was already large enough and while their adventures don\'t waste much screen time, there isn\'t much gained by their presence most of the time.Art (8/10):The art style is very reminiscent of the time period in which the anime was made - it\'s a little old-fashioned. It\'s very similar to other anime made back then, such as Monster and Claymore. This doesn\'t mean that it is bad; the art style is actually quite good and it fits the show well. However, I do generally slightly prefer the more modern styles that have more contrast in their color selection and let elements \'pop\' more. This is purely a personal preference, and I know several other people who absolutely hate the more modern art styles for that exact reason. Oh, and obviously, this anime was made before widescreen was a popular thing, so it\'s in a 4:3 aspect ratio.Sound (6/10):The sound effects in the series are generally good and so is the background music. Unfortunately, the OP and ED pieces are just bad (the visuals for them are bad too). It\'s actually amazing that an anime with 4 seasons managed to pick consistently awful pieces for all 4 OPs and all 4 EDs. Do yourself a favor and skip these when watching.Enjoyment (10/10):This anime wasn\'t just great for all the reasons I outlined above. The best part of the entire thing is how seriously it takes itself. The only comedy in the entire show is when characters are trying to force themselves to be cheerful in order to get over recent traumas - the comedy is initiated by the characters for their own sake and never for the sake of the audience. There is no fan-service in the entire show at all. Period. Some female characters actually wear shorts instead of skirts, and skirts never magically fly upwards from sudden gusts. I don\'t think there\'s a single panty shot in all 50 episodes (if there is, it\'s probably on Saya during a combat sequence where she\'s flipping all over the place, so it seems natural). It\'s great. There is a single instance where an older woman wears a dress with a very low neckline which exposes cleavage at a fancy party, but she does it intentionally to try to catch the eye of a man who is ignoring her advances (and the other characters are shocked by her brazenness). This is one of the rarest things in all of Japan: an anime that wasn\'t made for an audience of 13-year-old boys.Overall (9/10):Perhaps the only real major criticism I give is that Blood+ doesn\'t get quite as philosophical as something like Monster or quite as thrilling as something like Steins;Gate (mostly because the length of the series necessitates some lulls in the action to build up more action later). The show does cover some deep themes, such as what it means to human, the importance of nurture in the ""nature vs nurture"" debate, and questions how far you can go when you\'re ensuring the safety of the human race. Its handling of these themes is sometimes clumsy though, and I feel it fails to make its points as strongly as it could have. Despite this, Blood+\'s extremely high-quality plot and great cast of characters make it a must-watch for any fans of even moderately dark anime. If you\'re into any of the genres covered by this series, you will like it. behind everything. This is the right way to build plot complexity.

Every single \'arc\' (and honestly, they\'re woven together so seamlessly it can be hard to identify where one \'arc\' ends and another begins) adds new information to the world that Blood+ is building.Characters (8/10):Saya is obviously the heart and soul of the show (and the plot gives very good reasons for this), but the cast of characters that assemble around her and against her are also very well characterized. The villains in particular are very unique, and the show leaves you guessing for a long time who\'s really pulling the strings and who\'s just a puppet. Also worth noting that there are some aspects of a reverse harem here, forming around Saya. There are multiple men who profess their love for her. Saya seems flattered by their interest, but she\'s on a very personal quest and isn\'t interested in any kind of romantic interludes until she\'s done with it. In a way, her motivations strongly mirror those of Kenzo Tenma from Monster (justice/revenge for their mistakes). I really liked this, as it is a very realistic approach. So, if you\'re heavily interested in romance, know that there is some, but it doesn\'t fully develop until the very end. There is a bit of inconsistent characterization around one plot point involving a journal that made me knock the score down here slightly. Also, there\'s a couple of side characters (the journalist and his friend) who don\'t really have a strong reason for existing. The cast was already large enough and while their adventures don\'t waste much screen time, there isn\'t much gained by their presence most of the time.Art (8/10):The art style is very reminiscent of the time period in which the anime was made - it\'s a little old-fashioned. It\'s very similar to other anime made back then, such as Monster and Claymore. This doesn\'t mean that it is bad; the art style is actually quite good and it fits the show well. However, I do generally slightly prefer the more modern styles that have more contrast in their color selection and let elements \'pop\' more. This is purely a personal preference, and I know several other people who absolutely hate the more modern art styles for that exact reason. Oh, and obviously, this anime was made before widescreen was a popular thing, so it\'s in a 4:3 aspect ratio.Sound (6/10):The sound effects in the series are generally good and so is the background music. Unfortunately, the OP and ED pieces are just bad (the visuals for them are bad too). It\'s actually amazing that an anime with 4 seasons managed to pick consistently awful pieces for all 4 OPs and all 4 EDs. Do yourself a favor and skip these when watching.Enjoyment (10/10):This anime wasn\'t just great for all the reasons I outlined above. The best part of the entire thing is how seriously it takes itself. The only comedy in the entire show is when characters are trying to force themselves to be cheerful in order to get over recent traumas - the comedy is initiated by the characters for their own sake and never for the sake of the audience. There is no fan-service in the entire show at all. Period. Some female characters actually wear shorts instead of skirts, and skirts never magically fly upwards from sudden gusts. I don\'t think there\'s a single panty shot in all 50 episodes (if there is, it\'s probably on Saya during a combat sequence where she\'s flipping all over the place, so it seems natural). It\'s great. There is a single instance where an older woman wears a dress with a very low neckline which exposes cleavage at a fancy party, but she does it intentionally to try to catch the eye of a man who is ignoring her advances (and the other characters are shocked by her brazenness). This is one of the rarest things in all of Japan: an anime that wasn\'t made for an audience of 13-year-old boys.Overall (9/10):Perhaps the only real major criticism I give is that Blood+ doesn\'t get quite as philosophical as something like Monster or quite as thrilling as something like Steins;Gate (mostly because the length of the series necessitates some lulls in the action to build up more action later). The show does cover some deep themes, such as what it means to human, the importance of nurture in the ""nature vs nurture"" debate, and questions how far you can go when you\'re ensuring the safety of the human race. Its handling of these themes is sometimes clumsy though, and I feel it fails to make its points as strongly as it could have. Despite this, Blood+\'s extremely high-quality plot and great cast of characters make it a must-watch for any fans of even moderately dark anime. If you\'re into any of the genres covered by this series, you will like it.', 'Story: 5/10Story is quite captivating, it seems fresh to me (I have watched only one more vampire anime, though), but having watched it all I realize it\'s rather basic and predictable when you know enough. The good thing is the atmosphere of mystery holds quite long and there are revelations even in the last ten episodes.That said, some were ridiculously obvious and also literally delayed for tens of episodes without any reason behind this. The story is also extremely dragged and sometimes feels like not moving at all. I think the number of episodes could be halved to make the plot develop without periods...of nothingness. The story feels somewhat disjointed between different countries, as well. There is also the Schiff subplot that feels detached and doesn\'t really affect the main plot in any way. And there is a lot of plot armor and everyone is able to talk to everyone in Japan, Vietnam, France, Russia, the UK or the USA.Art: 4/10The artists seem to have done some research, I was particularly glad to see the setting of different countries displayed accurately. Still, the art style is somewhat unusual and I couldn\'t help thinking character designs were way too cartoonish and undetailed for an attempted dark atmosphere. Often, when one shot changes the other, so much happens it can give you a feeling of some shots being dropped somewhere.Sound: 5/10Mainly fine, but I find Saya\'s battle screams and Kai\'s angry voice terribly annoying (Saya screams 5 times or so, but Kai spends all first half of the show angry and yelling). I liked the cello music Hagi keeps playing, but it happens rarely and he seems to be playing the same moment every time. And the characters tend to say other characters\' names all the time, in any circumstances, even just because.Characters: 2/10That\'s the real problem with this anime. Protagonists are mainly useless. A useless main heroine Saya who only feels sad, avoids any help and communication, saying she has to protect everyone, sucks in fighting (she\'s usually unable to fight 3 ordinary chiropterans in a row) and doesn\'t do a single thing about it, all because she resents her nature. She\'s still the only one who has at least theoretical ability to defeat chiropterans, so we get the only one capable soldier being terribly indecisive (kinda like Shinji from Evangelion). A useless secret organization who has a sweet didactic talk with too nosy a reporter, sinks a ship attacked by flying creatures to bury them and keeps sending people against chiropterans, the monsters who are bullet-proof and able to tear a human in 2 seconds. I wonder how this organization even managed to exist for more than a century. The useless adopted brother of Saya, Kai, who\'s whiny and slightly sabotageous in the first half, he at least stops shouting in the second, but, unfortunately, doesn\'t become much of an asset. Hagi, Saya\'s chevalier, is somewhat useless, constantly being thrown somewhere or impaled by enemies and vainly fighting back. There is a reason behind his rather little fighting capabilities, but given the scale events attain, I think it\'s plain stupid. Also he can\'t really think on his own and only waits for Saya to give him an order, while other chevaliers built a multinational corporation on their own. I guess, ""Nankurunaisa"" or ""The things will work out"" is mentioned this often in-universe because it turns out to be the motto of the protagonists. They don\'t work toward their victory, they just wait around with sad faces and suddenly start winning in the end just because this anime has to finally end. There is also at least one situation of stupid inability to express/perceive one simple thought (whether one of the groups is a total enemy or can be negotiated with) for the sake of cheap drama.The antagonists aren\'t useless but are ruthless and/or psychopathic. Solomon, though, is particularly prominent, because he\'s a thoughtful character with interesting development vector, but his development also stops just when there was a good prospect, without him really achieving anything.The side characters or the guys somewhere between protagonists and antagonists either are underdeveloped or are finished soon enough. Looking at the characters in focus, I\'m just happy they aren\'t ruined as well.In the end there is simply nobody to root for or care about but annoying Saya and her team are constantly shoved into your eyes.Enjoyment: 1/10The series starts rather promising. There are mysteries to be solved, the power to be acquired and the circumstances to be overcome. Saya is said to ""not be fully awoken"" which holds her back in battles and gives her depression and frustration. But as the story progresses, her abilities don\'t increase and the sadness doesn\'t go away which becomes increasingly annoying. The mysteries, on the contrary, get solved so the only reason left to watch becomes to know how it all ends. There the dragging begins... Luckily, it contains a period of quick pacing, but not in the end. Also the future events become increasingly obvious toward the end and the story degrades into simple killing of kinda villains of the week one-on-one with luck and miracles. And the attempted depressed dark atmosphere is based not on the real events but on the mood of the main character I could care less about. So we get 50 episodes of Saya whining, shutting in and getting her ass kicked. It\'s a marvel the ""good guys"" are able to last this long. There is also a lot of blood, more than I expected or wanted, but I guess it\'s on me, given the name of the show.Overall: 2/10I feel sad I spent my time on this and I definitely won\'t rewatch it. The story isn\'t that bad and the abridged version of the plot would read cool, but watching it for 50 episodes, as well as horrible character stupidity is just a waste of time.

Her support, unfortunately, is such a creepy, unhelpful twat that you end up wondering why he exists.Kai (Saya\'s not-blood-related brother, because incest isn\'t incest when we\'re not related, right?) serves as one-half ""brave onii-chan"" and one-half brother-with-fixation-on-sister.

I don't mind people's opinions when it comes to Blood+ and Blood C but there needs to be a line between story plotting and understatement. They don't have none of...those comparisons. I want less of the Red Shield and more of Diva's group. Saya is such a boring character. Saya in Blood C had more character than her when it came to personalities and finding one true-self. I feel as if the battles are useless and pointless because the characters doesn't know what they're fighting for and why. It's so boring and dry. I do like the soundtrack but, that's so consistent and dry that it irritates me that the editor made wrong choices of using them at certain times. There's a lot of consistent error animations. I don't care how it is, I've seen better animation done in 1979. those comparisons. I want less of the Red Shield and more of Diva's group. Saya is such a boring character.

It was just as great as I remembered.The story is amazing and is told in 50 episodes, so it’s a long one, but they couldn’t have made this show great if they pushed it into 24 or fewer episodes. It needed all of these episodes. I know some people may think some episodes would be boring considering the amount, but I know every episode has something to tell, never making me lose interest.The art fits the anime well, nothing to complain about. It’s an older art style,...but to me, it doesn’t matter as long as it fits and the animation goes smooth.The characters are outstanding. The main characters are well written and have a tremendous amount of character development due to the situations they go through.

Eventually, I decided to sit down and finally watch the anime those songs were associated to.Unfortunately, despite the anime being called ""Blood+"" the main female lead Saya spends the first 25 eps in the fetal position crying about how she can\'t do it, leading to someone...dying due to her inactivity which then leads to her announcing her resolve to change and wanting to know about her past only to repeat the entire process. It\'s not until ep 34 that Saya transforms into a badass emo character after an off screen 1-year time skip that she\'s able fight without the need to be heavily coaxed into battle.Despite all of this, the series reminds you as often as diva performing her one opera song (often) that Saya is the chosen one and that only her blood can kill the Chiropteran, yet even the expendable support characters point out the plot hole of the narrative regarding the need of Saya to single-handedly handle the issue by asking why they don\'t just put her blood into the bullets for which the excuse given was ""we don\'t have the time and Saya is the only one."" Keep in mind the time wasted trying to convince Saya to fight + the fact that a year time-skip occurs where they advanced their bullets\' capabilities to the point that they can make big holes in Chiropteran (which they just regenerate from), yet no one bothers to set aside Saya\'s blood during all the transfusion scenes to use for effective bullet research. (The writer knew that if this was done then Saya\'s importance within the series would be reduced to that of a glorified emo blood bank for their bullet manufacturing instead of an emo sword wielder.)Accompanying Saya for the vast majority of the series is her incestuous non-blood related elder brother Kai. Kai remarks about how he cares greatly for his siblings and shares his strong desire to protect them; yet his equally strong desire to get into Saya\'s pants compels him to follow Saya around the world while dragging his younger brother into increasingly dangerous locations. Funny enough, he has this uncanny ability to make almost any female (not Saya) to become infatuated with him to the point that one girl even went as far as to steal her father\'s money and use it to cajole a bum reporter to take her around the world just so she can get into Kai\'s pants. Yet despite this, Kai only has eyes for Saya and brushes all other girls off leading to arguably the best moment in the anime where in the final episode, Kai gives one of the most dead-inside expressions while on stage looking at Saya kissing someone else (you can practically hear the poorly performed sad song flutes playing in the background).The art in the Openings and Endings are pretty good but within the show itself tends to lean from being average to somewhat decent at times.In short, the story and characters leave something to be desired but if you\'re still interested in watching this, I recommend starting at ep 34 and if you need context, just google it to save time. dying due to her inactivity which then leads to her announcing her resolve to change and wanting to know about her past only to repeat the entire process.

Unfortunately, the weak tension thread is a bit daunting.', 'Don\'t be fooled by the cover like I was; this is a straight-up shoujo dressed up as a vampire action series. It\'s the worst kind of shoujo at that--- the kind that makes every decision in order to create maximum drama rather than to tell a good story. In turn, my critique is going to sound especially harsh, because this is more than just about what a show succeeds or fails at doing--- this is about how nasty the intentions of the creators of this show are.As such, this is going to sound more like a rant than a review, but only because there...is literally nothing good I can say about this show outside of the technical aspects. Trust me, I really did try to hold onto the one thing in it that had some potential and figure out whether or not it worked, and this review is part of that attempt. Also, yes, this review is only for 30 episodes, but I believe the patterns I recognized in these 30 episodes extend throughout the show AND if 30 out of 50 episodes are trash, most of this criticism is relevant.I\'ll start with the characters. None of the characters have any interesting personalities to speak of, which isn\'t always damning by itself. The show\'s overall tone or collective chemistry can make up for that if the characters and overall feel aren\'t archetypal, but that isn\'t the case here. Saya has no personality other than being demure, Kai is the redhaired boneheaded juvenile delinquent, and Riku is the cute innocent little brother. Meanwhile, the character dynamics are also typical anime high school fare. Hagi is the dark brooding bishounen that\'s forever by the poor girl\'s side because shoujo. He\'s bland as hell even after his backstory and you\'ll find the exact same character in Vampire Princess Miyu. You won\'t be watching the secondary characters for their personality either, but the show doesn\'t give us additional reasons to care about any of them. The primary villains lack enough personality or background for you to care about all the scenes with their internal scheming. Maybe in the next twenty episodes the show will devote time to flesh them out but the fact still remains that it introduces the politics first and the character investment later (which would work if we cared about the plot, which I\'ll get to later). There\'s an attempt to make sympathetic villains in the Schiff but since they\'re cold blooded murderers with little characterization/background up to this point it doesn\'t work.Still, a show certainly has the right to flesh out the scheming of the villains. However, it adds two additional plot threads involving the secondary protagonists that in thirty episodes have added absolutely nothing to the plot or characterization outside of the viewer wanting to follow those characters in the first place (which I doubt, because again, we\'re not given enough personality or background to care). The show also has characters make dumb decisions in order to get those plot threads started in the first place, so it feels especially forced. Kai, Riku, Riku\'s girlfriend, and some random reporter all go to great lengths to involve themselves in what an extremely dangerous and creepy situation while they themselves are powerless in such a situation.The main plot thread is not much better. The overall problem is that the show doesn\'t bother setting up the threat that\'s going to keep the tension high throughout the show. For half the show, all we know is that sometimes these things called chiropterans attack people, but we don\'t know the scale and it seems small scale. We don\'t know what potential threat the main villain poses; a scene establishing the power and destructiveness of Diva on a large scale could have been inserted early on in the show to keep the viewers scared of her return. Instead, for twenty five episodes we watch some German guy scheme behind the scenes and Red Shield uncovering some attempts to make chiropterans, but the question is why do we care? In fact, I didn\'t pay much attention to any of that and by episode 30 none of it mattered. The main point was very simple in that the main villain simply awoke, but we still have no idea about what her plans are and thus what threat she poses. Of course, you can argue that they will insert the point of tension later, but that\'s still 30 episodes with no tension. You can also argue that the mystery will keep viewers watching, but usually mysteries create tension because either the initial events are bizarre/intriguing enough for you to want to find out what happened and/or solving the mystery negates the big threat. Well, there\'s no big threat established here, and I don\'t find the events bizarre enough to warrant a mystery; monsters are attacking people to suck their blood for sustenance.So if the plot isn\'t engaging, what about the character development? Since I\'ve already discounted the majority of the supporting cast, the only potential source of interest on this front comes from Saya\'s development. In theory, Saya\'s character arc goes from a timid, PTSD-afflicted girl who longs for a family to a decisive, independent warrior who has made peace with her past trauma. I can\'t say Saya didn\'t get stronger at all, but let\'s just say her development is highly questionable. What complicates matters is the issue of PTSD and ""realism"". That is, if a character suffering from PTSD goes through many events that feel like they should change her for the better but don\'t, you can always make the reasonable defense that realistically speaking people don\'t move on from trauma easily. Because over the course of 30 episodes, Saya jumps back and forth between fighting and being too traumatized by her past to fight. Of course, it\'s obvious from all the illogical melodrama in the show that the writers aren\'t earnestly trying to tell the story of how Saya overcomes her trauma and gets stronger but are just trying to milk her for all her angst. But if you isolate Saya\'s arc, it\'s hard to attack it because of the aforementioned PTSD defense.Now I will make a long list of all the illogical/pointless things the writers contrive for the sake of melodrama in order to justify the claims I made in the opening paragraph and to discuss Saya\'s arc in detail. SPOILERS AHEAD-As mentioned Kai and Riku insisting that they tag along with Saya despite the obvious danger and their own powerlessness in such a situation instead of just waiting for her to come back like normal people. It\'s not just that they want to be there to support Saya; Kai is mad that he isn\'t allowed to participate in physical combat even though he\'s just a high school boy who likes to get into fights. In addition, in the first few episodes, Kai hears that a monster has severely injured his dad and responds by going off on his own in order to try and shoot it in revenge.-Along the same lines, Riku\'s girlfriend is somehow so attached to him that she steals money from her father to travel the world in search of him, and when she finds him, she adopts the same mentality of wanting to involve herself in this supernatural conflict despite being powerless. In response, Kai does the same thing that the Red Shield guys did to piss him off; saying that she shouldn\'t get involved because it\'s too dangerous.-She is accompanied by a reporter who has a better reason in that he wants the big scoop, but this plotline does nothing because we\'re just watching them discover things the viewer already knows.-Solomon falls in love with Saya at first sight and having had one dance with her.-The show spends time setting up Saya\'s school life in Vietnam as she goes undercover and this goes nowhere, except to have a final scene where Saya\'s new best friend (that she made over the course of a few days) sees her all bloody with a sword after she had a fight. This gives Saya more reason to mope around despite it being no big deal.-The show wastes time hastily setting up Kai\'s friendship with a local girl who later gets turned into a chiropteran. She\'s a generic girl designed for the viewer to feel bad for and she hasn\'t been seen since episode 14 so far. As far as I can tell there was no point in this except to produce angst when the girl he likes gets turned into a monster.-In the same vein Kai gets heavily attached to one of the Schiff after spending an afternoon with her and based on this he decides to try to help the Schiff even though they\'re trying to kill Saya. This creates a temporary rift with Saya just for the sake of it, because the two can\'t have a reasonable conversation. Saya clearly sees that some chiropterans like herself, Riku, and Hagi are humanlike but unilaterally lumps all the chiropterans as her enemies without even hearing Kai out.-The Schiff decide that the best way to get Saya\'s blood is to kill her instead of asking her, which the show excuses by saying they were raised as weapons. OK, fine. But after they realize Saya\'s not their enemy and that they\'re both after Diva, they turn down the offer to work together because apparently they don\'t know how to work together with others because of how they were raised. I mean, even animals know how to work together in packs to hunt larger prey.-The Schiff decide not to engage with Saya and Hagi only to come back later and fight them while they\'re with the Red Shield members.-Saya feels guilty over saving Riku\'s life with her blood, thereby turning him into a chevalier, even though she had no other choice to save his life AND this means that he lives forever and has healing powers. She thinks she can\'t face Kai because of what she did, even though Kai was literally right there and told her to do it. They also decide not to tell Riku about his new status as a chevalier even though it has almost no downsides besides needing blood transfusions periodically and Saya\'s been living a happy school life that way. Sure, you stay a kid forever... but you LIVE FOREVER! Instead, they spend the whole episode angsting about it.-Saya is in the middle of fighting the Schiff because they\'re chiropterans before she relents to Kai and gives one of the Schiff her blood to try and save her. The Schiff dies instead, and Saya mourns over her death for an episode despite being intent on killing her just moments before (she didn\'t know her either)  and it wasn\'t her fault.-Saya meets a group of soldiers on her mission in Vietnam and after one of the female soldiers died that same day, after all other soldiers had died, and despite Saya exchanging only a few lines with her, Saya tears up for that one specific female soldier as if she was a lifelong comrade.-Get this, it was SAYA who killed the female soldier because she went on a mindless rampage. Before the mindless rampage, she refused to fight because she was traumatized by the setting reminding her of her rampage in Vietnam 30 years ago when she killed monster and human alike. So she goes on the rampage and slashes the soldier, snaps out of it, and cradles the soldier in her arms. The soldier tells her to she is their only hope to defeat the chiropterans in an encouraging way, even though she was just mortally wounded by Saya.-Along the same lines, 30 years ago when Saya went on a rampage and killed a bunch of American soldiers, one of the soldiers with his dying breath told someone to take care of Saya.-Hagi stands by and watches Saya\'s father charge the chiropteran and even keeps Saya from helping him, which results in him being injured.-So 30 years ago in Vietnam Saya goes on a rampage because she was awoken by drinking Hagi\'s blood. Except in the present day we have repeatedly seen Saya consume Hagi\'s blood to enter her kill mode, kill the monster, and not go on the rampage. Instead, she faints after she kills the monster. The rampage mode is usually indicated by Saya\'s eyes glowing red, or perhaps not, because her eyes go red when she\'s just fighting in control as well, and sometimes they go red after she sheds her own blood on her blade but hasn\'t consumed Hagi\'s blood.  In the present day, the rampage mode is not triggered by consuming Hagi\'s blood but by Diva\'s song. Later when she visits the Zoo, she hears Diva\'s song but doesn\'t go on rampage mode. Anyway, during the rampage 30 years ago, Hagi, her lifelong friend, isn\'t able to get through to her to stop her but in the present day, all it took was Riku (who had only known her for one year) to call out to Saya. Now, the whole berserker mode trope has always been a cheap and dishonest way for writers to create flawed characters without actually having flawed characters. Saya is clearly just a normal girl and her rampages are not triggered by any inherent suppressed bloodlust/anger in her personality but some biological reaction she can\'t control. But all these inconsistencies tell me that aside from this the writers are clearly just using her rampage mode as a plot device for more angst rather than a flaw that Saya has to overcome. It doesn\'t help that after the incident in Vietnam her rampage mode doesn\'t show up again so far.-When Saya is afraid to fight the monsters that are attacking her and her father and when she\'s afraid in Vietnam, Hagi doesn\'t her his blood to make her go into her kill mode, which results in her dad dying and all the soldiers dying.-Both Hagi and Red Shield don\'t tell Saya about her past, using the weak excuse that it\'s better for her to remember on her own. This of course is the cause of all her angst as she keeps getting flashbacks but doesn\'t know the whole story. Even if I accepted this, the least they could have done was shown her to the Zoo, which helped her regain most of her memories just by being there. In addition, Saya gets an iron resolve to defeat Diva after regaining her memories because Diva killed her father, so apparently Red Shield didn\'t think it was wise to reveal this to her early on in order to motivate her to work for them. Obviously, the real reason the truth was kept from her was to prolong the angst and mystery.-Saya\'s resolve to fight the chiropterans almost breaks when one of the chevaliers tells her that she\'s also a chiropteran and that she\'s fighting against her own kind. The chevalier tells her that she\'s being used by the humans. This is AFTER both her dad and the female soldier died at the hands of the chiropterans and she had resolved to defend everyone from them. What difference does it make it she\'s also chiropteran? She\'s not the one killing people. Saya also starts to angst about being a chiropteran even though practically speaking she\'s mostly human and NOT a bloodsucking monster. Plus, she knows that Hagi isn\'t human and has a monstrous hand. Anyway, after the chiropteran tells her all this she leaves Red Shield and leaves a note calling them liars, even though 1) why would you trust the enemy who\'s turning children into monsters 2) you KNEW they were withholding information from you and you just went along with it 3) they didn\'t technically lie to her about any of those points.-Saya angsts about having freed Diva from prison which allowed her to kill Joel, even though it was mostly not her fault because she didn\'t know. She also doesn\'t immediately question why Joel would imprison her sister to begin with.Next, I\'ll talk about Saya\'s arc, which involves more subjective critique. As some reviewers have noted, Saya is way too mopey and intentionally so; the show constantly resupplies excuses for Saya to mope each episode, as I\'ve already described. If I were to identify her primary struggle though, I\'d assume that she\'s traumatized by memories of being a killing machine in Vietnam 30 years ago, which prevents her from fighting chiropterans in the present day for fear of reliving those memories and becoming a killing machine again. Saya also longs for the peaceful life she lived with her adoptive family in Okinawa, which seems to be taken away when she\'s called to fight chiropterans. I find it very hard to sympathize with her in this regard, as1)she\'s only been living this peaceful schoolgirl life for a year so her nostalgia for it seems overblown2)the show doesn\'t do a good job actually showing the bonds between Saya and the family3) she has amnesia, so it\'s not like she has memories of a much harder time in her life to make her treasure her peaceful life, so her 1 year of peace would just feel like boring normal life4) when you finally learn about her past, you see that she\'s been coddled most of her life and her memories in Vietnam were only a brief moment after which she went back to sleep. Even after her original family was killed, she had Hagi accompanying her the entire time.5) it\'s not like working for Red Shield meant being separated from her family forever and they even allow Kai/Riku to accompany her on her mission, or even that she becomes a vampire killer for the rest of her life.6) The fights that Saya goes through are not portrayed nearly as viscerally as in Red Garden, which makes her job seem pretty tolerable.7) The series attempts to create wholesome family/friendship moments just to provide contrast to Saya\'s seemingly cruel fate but it comes off as sappy, especially when Saya\'s fate doesn\'t come off as very cruel and the characters and character interactions are generic. These scenes have none of the poignancy and authenticity of similar scenes in Red Garden where the protagonists brave their doomed fates together.As for her primary arc of dealing with her trauma, Saya does not progress much in 14 episodes and when she does progress... it doesn\'t make much sense and is reverted. There are several critical points in her arc to give it an outline:-The first time Saya fights, she\'s scared but after given Hagi\'s blood she goes into a kill mode and slays her first chiropteran. The second time she fights, she allows her father to get injured because she was too presumably too afraid of reliving being the monster she was in Vietnam.-In the midst of retrieving her father from the hospital, Saya again says she can\'t fight, which results in her father dying to defend her. In his dying words, her father tells her to follow her heart and to face her past. You\'d think after this incident Saya would at least unsheathe her sword in future fights because her inaction led to her beloved father dying.-While undercover in Vietnam, Saya visits a war museum and gets PTSD flashbacks. After running out of the museum, she\'s confronted by a chevalier who brings up her haunted past. Saya remembers her family and the words of her father and says that she will face her past, after which she draws her sword and fights off the chevalier.-She fights the chevalier one more time, this time with her eyes glowing red but she\'s in control.-14 episodes in- Afterwards, as I previously described, she says she can\'t fight as Red Shield\'s soldiers are being killed off by chiropterans because she hears Diva\'s song and is having war flashbacks again, even though she had previously resolved to face her past. After going on a rampage and killing the female soldier, she heeds the female soldiers last words and resolves to protect everyone, even if she becomes a monster. First of all, you\'d think she had already learned her lesson about this when her dad died because of her inaction, which is a pretty big impetus for change. Second, if the female soldier died by Saya\'s hand on a rampage, how does that give her motivation to go protect everyone even if it means risking killing them? Third, I\'ve already talked about the the inconsistencies of Saya\'s rampage mode, which disrupts her arc.-Anyway, after finally resolving to defend the world against the chiropterans and two deaths later, one of the villains is easily able to make her question her resolve by telling her she\'s a chiropteran, as I described before. This makes her leave Red Shield and go to the Zoo, where she regains her memories. Upon learning that Diva was the one who killed her original family, she resolves to kill Diva and all chiropterans. This is redundant, as she already had ample reason to kill chiropterans after they killed her dad and the female soldier that she cared so much about. The only difference is that it became personal, as now she has a name to focus on.-So for 14 episodes Saya is too traumatized to fight, after which she fights to protect people regardless of becoming a monster in the process, which seemed like it should have been abundantly clear to her to begin with. Then she falters again because of dumb reasoning from the villains before finding out that her enemy is Diva and strengthening her resolve. After this she mopes over what happened to Riku, her rift with Kai, the death of that one Schiff, and the fact that she allowed Diva to go free. Based on all this, as of episode 30 I don\'t think Saya actually dealt with any of her trauma. Instead, it seems she bypasses the problem by finding motivation to defeat the chiropterans, even though she had ample reason to do so from the very start. She knew people like her dad and the soldiers were in danger of being killed by the chiropterans and still didn\'t do anything, but she only finds motivation after their deaths, motivation which is easily weakened. She supposedly agrees to join Red Shield to face her past as her dad said, but she only makes weak attempts to get answers out of Hagi and the Red Shield members.Besides her arc being very messy, Saya is too passive of a character. The plot happens to her instead of her driving the plot. Her constant self-blame, moping, and passiveness undermine the ability of the viewer to sympathize with Saya in her primary struggle because even if being traumatized is understandable, it makes her come off as a pushover who prefers to sulk instead of taking action to improve herself. Even in her action scenes, Saya is only able to deal with the low level grunt chiropterans and doesn\'t seem to stand a chance against any of the chevaliers which means in 30 episodes she wasn\'t able to accomplish much. In addition, Hagi bails her out half the time. While journeying to the Zoo, they\'re attacked by the Schiff and Saya hides under a rock while Hagi takes on 10 Schiff because apparently she hadn\'t had much to eat. Even in a non fight scene, Hagi has to carry her to make a simple jump, even though she supposedly has superhuman capabilities too. You know, when I watched Revolutionary Girl Utena, I had trouble with the analysis because I couldn\'t fathom that some women want to be damseled and saved by men. Yet here it is before my eyes; shoujo writers actually fantasize like this, so they write weak, tortured characters like Saya so they can be saved by the dark brooding bishounen in Hagi.I promise you I\'m not intentionally taking these out of context. I skimmed through the episodes I watched before I wrote this to make sure I wasn\'t missing anything. If you\'re a fan of the show and wish to defend it, by all means write an equally long post on my page explaining all of this.But as it stands, it\'s clear to me that all these contrivances are all symptoms of the same flaw; the creators of the show are more concerned about creating melodrama than telling a good story. I\'ve seen this all before at various levels in other media; in particular, if you watch Silent Mobius/Escaflowne/Scrapped Princess you\'ll find the same patterns. This is one of those things that really grinds my gears because I am absolutely disgusted by people who revel in melodrama and intentionally write things to entertain you by putting your emotions on a see saw. is literally nothing good I can say about this show outside of the technical aspects. Trust me, I really did try to hold onto the one thing in it that had some potential and figure out whether or not it worked, and this review is part of that attempt. Also, yes, this review is only for 30 episodes, but I believe the patterns I recognized in these 30 episodes extend throughout the show AND if 30 out of 50 episodes are trash, most of this criticism is relevant.I\'ll start with the characters. None of the characters have any interesting personalities to speak of, which isn\'t always damning by itself. The show\'s overall tone or collective chemistry can make up for that if the characters and overall feel aren\'t archetypal, but that isn\'t the case here. Saya has no personality other than being demure, Kai is the redhaired boneheaded juvenile delinquent, and Riku is the cute innocent little brother. Meanwhile, the character dynamics are also typical anime high school fare. Hagi is the dark brooding bishounen that\'s forever by the poor girl\'s side because shoujo. He\'s bland as hell even after his backstory and you\'ll find the exact same character in Vampire Princess Miyu. You won\'t be watching the secondary characters for their personality either, but the show doesn\'t give us additional reasons to care about any of them. The primary villains lack enough personality or background for you to care about all the scenes with their internal scheming. Maybe in the next twenty episodes the show will devote time to flesh them out but the fact still remains that it introduces the politics first and the character investment later (which would work if we cared about the plot, which I\'ll get to later). There\'s an attempt to make sympathetic villains in the Schiff but since they\'re cold blooded murderers with little characterization/background up to this point it doesn\'t work.Still, a show certainly has the right to flesh out the scheming of the villains. However, it adds two additional plot threads involving the secondary protagonists that in thirty episodes have added absolutely nothing to the plot or characterization outside of the viewer wanting to follow those characters in the first place (which I doubt, because again, we\'re not given enough personality or background to care). The show also has characters make dumb decisions in order to get those plot threads started in the first place, so it feels especially forced. Kai, Riku, Riku\'s girlfriend, and some random reporter all go to great lengths to involve themselves in what an extremely dangerous and creepy situation while they themselves are powerless in such a situation.The main plot thread is not much better. The overall problem is that the show doesn\'t bother setting up the threat that\'s going to keep the tension high throughout the show. For half the show, all we know is that sometimes these things called chiropterans attack people, but we don\'t know the scale and it seems small scale. We don\'t know what potential threat the main villain poses; a scene establishing the power and destructiveness of Diva on a large scale could have been inserted early on in the show to keep the viewers scared of her return. Instead, for twenty five episodes we watch some German guy scheme behind the scenes and Red Shield uncovering some attempts to make chiropterans, but the question is why do we care? In fact, I didn\'t pay much attention to any of that and by episode 30 none of it mattered. The main point was very simple in that the main villain simply awoke, but we still have no idea about what her plans are and thus what threat she poses. Of course, you can argue that they will insert the point of tension later, but that\'s still 30 episodes with no tension. You can also argue that the mystery will keep viewers watching, but usually mysteries create tension because either the initial events are bizarre/intriguing enough for you to want to find out what happened and/or solving the mystery negates the big threat. Well, there\'s no big threat established here, and I don\'t find the events bizarre enough to warrant a mystery; monsters are attacking people to suck their blood for sustenance.So if the plot isn\'t engaging, what about the character development? Since I\'ve already discounted the majority of the supporting cast, the only potential source of interest on this front comes from Saya\'s development. In theory, Saya\'s character arc goes from a timid, PTSD-afflicted girl who longs for a family to a decisive, independent warrior who has made peace with her past trauma. I can\'t say Saya didn\'t get stronger at all, but let\'s just say her development is highly questionable. What complicates matters is the issue of PTSD and ""realism"". That is, if a character suffering from PTSD goes through many events that feel like they should change her for the better but don\'t, you can always make the reasonable defense that realistically speaking people don\'t move on from trauma easily. Because over the course of 30 episodes, Saya jumps back and forth between fighting and being too traumatized by her past to fight. Of course, it\'s obvious from all the illogical melodrama in the show that the writers aren\'t earnestly trying to tell the story of how Saya overcomes her trauma and gets stronger but are just trying to milk her for all her angst. But if you isolate Saya\'s arc, it\'s hard to attack it because of the aforementioned PTSD defense.Now I will make a long list of all the illogical/pointless things the writers contrive for the sake of melodrama in order to justify the claims I made in the opening paragraph and to discuss Saya\'s arc in detail. SPOILERS AHEAD-As mentioned Kai and Riku insisting that they tag along with Saya despite the obvious danger and their own powerlessness in such a situation instead of just waiting for her to come back like normal people. It\'s not just that they want to be there to support Saya; Kai is mad that he isn\'t allowed to participate in physical combat even though he\'s just a high school boy who likes to get into fights. In addition, in the first few episodes, Kai hears that a monster has severely injured his dad and responds by going off on his own in order to try and shoot it in revenge.-Along the same lines, Riku\'s girlfriend is somehow so attached to him that she steals money from her father to travel the world in search of him, and when she finds him, she adopts the same mentality of wanting to involve herself in this supernatural conflict despite being powerless.

Third, I\'ve already talked about the the inconsistencies of Saya\'s rampage mode, which disrupts her arc.-Anyway, after finally resolving to defend the world against the chiropterans and two deaths later, one of the villains is easily able to make her question her resolve by telling her she\'s a chiropteran, as I described before. This makes her leave Red Shield and go to the Zoo, where she regains her memories. Upon learning that Diva was the one who killed her original family, she resolves to kill Diva and all chiropterans. This is redundant, as she already had ample reason to kill chiropterans after they killed her dad and the female soldier that she cared so much about. The only difference is that it became personal, as now she has a name to focus on.-So for 14 episodes Saya is too traumatized to fight, after which she fights to protect people regardless of becoming a monster in the process, which seemed like it should have been abundantly clear to her to begin with. Then she falters again because of dumb reasoning from the villains before finding out that her enemy is Diva and strengthening her resolve. After this she mopes over what happened to Riku, her rift with Kai, the death of that one Schiff, and the fact that she allowed Diva to go free. Based on all this, as of episode 30 I don\'t think Saya actually dealt with any of her trauma. Instead, it seems she bypasses the problem by finding motivation to defeat the chiropterans, even though she had ample reason to do so from the very start. She knew people like her dad and the soldiers were in danger of being killed by the chiropterans and still didn\'t do anything, but she only finds motivation after their deaths, motivation which is easily weakened. She supposedly agrees to join Red Shield to face her past as her dad said, but she only makes weak attempts to get answers out of Hagi and the Red Shield members.Besides her arc being very messy, Saya is too passive of a character. The plot happens to her instead of her driving the plot. Her constant self-blame, moping, and passiveness undermine the ability of the viewer to sympathize with Saya in her primary struggle because even if being traumatized is understandable, it makes her come off as a pushover who prefers to sulk instead of taking action to improve herself. Even in her action scenes, Saya is only able to deal with the low level grunt chiropterans and doesn\'t seem to stand a chance against any of the chevaliers which means in 30 episodes she wasn\'t able to accomplish much. In addition, Hagi bails her out half the time. While journeying to the Zoo, they\'re attacked by the Schiff and Saya hides under a rock while Hagi takes on 10 Schiff because apparently she hadn\'t had much to eat. Even in a non fight scene, Hagi has to carry her to make a simple jump, even though she supposedly has superhuman capabilities too. You know, when I watched Revolutionary Girl Utena, I had trouble with the analysis because I couldn\'t fathom that some women want to be damseled and saved by men. Yet here it is before my eyes; shoujo writers actually fantasize like this, so they write weak, tortured characters like Saya so they can be saved by the dark brooding bishounen in Hagi.I promise you I\'m not intentionally taking these out of context. I skimmed through the episodes I watched before I wrote this to make sure I wasn\'t missing anything. If you\'re a fan of the show and wish to defend it, by all means write an equally long post on my page explaining all of this.But as it stands, it\'s clear to me that all these contrivances are all symptoms of the same flaw; the creators of the show are more concerned about creating melodrama than telling a good story. I\'ve seen this all before at various levels in other media; in particular, if you watch Silent Mobius/Escaflowne/Scrapped Princess you\'ll find the same patterns. This is one of those things that really grinds my gears because I am absolutely disgusted by people who revel in melodrama and intentionally write things to entertain you by putting your emotions on a see saw.', ""The first half of the show serves as a prolonged introduction to the show, with Saya and her followers, including Hagi, Kai, Riku, David, and many others from the Red Shield organization, being introduced. Diva, her chevaliers, and the Schiff appear as the show's antagonists. However, the story moves at a slow pace, spending a lot of time on how Saya deals with being a vampire. Saya breaks down in tears and whines about her fate as a vampire, even though we already know the situation. The only surprise in this half is the relationship between Saya and Diva and why Saya wants to kill...her. It takes only one episode to explain everything, and many characters appear to be pointless. The mafia's daughter's subplot is unnecessary, and the journalist's investigation of the Chiropteran is uninteresting. Despite these weaknesses, the first half is still entertaining and compelling enough to make me want to see what happens next. The final few episodes contain many twists and revelations that can easily erase any thoughts of dropping the series.The second half is different, as all the players are already in place. The story moves forward quickly, and the scientific explanation of the chiropterans and the D-nucleotide is introduced. The characters start to express changes and developments. Saya becomes stronger and stops whining during battle, becoming the super cool female warrior that we want to see. There are also many subplots, including the conspiracy of the US government to use the Chiropterans and the Corpse Corp to expand its power worldwide. Solomon's decision to side with Saya, overcoming his own blood because of love, is also a neat subplot. The final showdown between Saya and Diva is well-built and does not feel rushed. The conclusion is convincing and leaves space for our imagination.The animation is well done with fluid movement and beautiful art direction. The original score contains a heavy Western atmosphere and reminded me of the movie 'Gladiator.' The theme 'Diva' is especially adored because it is both sad and powerful. In conclusion, Blood+ is a long anime with first-class production, good characterization, and interesting ideas. The first half is slow and unsteady, but the second half is mind-blowing. her.

The thing is that the drama gets forced on you all the time. The writers don\'t seem to pick their moments and push in entire character speeches, even in mid-action, about the characters motivation for fighting yada yada yada. Buzzlines like ""you\'re still our family"" and ""I will protect you"" get thrown around a lot. It isn\'t bad in itself...but they should pick their moments better.The story is pretty neat, telling the struggle of two immortal sisters, one raised in a caring environment, the other only knowing hatred and bloodshed. Sometimes the characters are a bit flat (mainly due to those continuous speeches) but at least some episodes are dedicated to put some more life into them.The action and animation are of a good level. The action is a bit repetitive, and the characters don\'t seem to get that shooting immortal creatures isn\'t going to help (even when doing it for the 20th time). The sound is decent although there\'s a lot of material being reused all the time.So that wraps it up I think. Thanks for reading. but they should pick their moments better.The story is pretty neat, telling the struggle of two immortal sisters, one raised in a caring environment, the other only knowing hatred and bloodshed.

Thanks for reading.', ""TLDR: Watch Episode 30, and then return to the beginning (anytime from Episode 1 - 5). You'll thank me later.Full version: Plot holes, plot holes everywhere. I was very excited going in. 50 episodes of what seemed like a promising series, good looking characters, and a bad ass female heroine? Sign me up, vampire novels (especially from Laurell K. Hamilton) are some of my most-loved books. Well, if you're also a fan of those books, don't bother with this trash, it's closer to Twilight in terms of poor quality.Biggest problem: It moves too slow.No anime, movie, or media, should take 30 episodes (that's...30*30 mins = 900 mins = 15 hours) to tell us a backstory that literally took 15 MINUTES.I'm serious - if you skip Episodes 1 - 29, you won't miss anything. We don't learn anything about the protagonist (Saya), except that she has PTSD flashbacks every episode. The same two flashbacks. On repeat. No one explains anything until episode 30 (more than halfway through!), where there's a full conversation - and fully colored - flashback sequence.The remaining 20 episodes have slightly better pacing, but can also be skimmed through. There's a lot of repetition, filler, and side character scenes that don't contribute to any developmental plot.Main character:Saya starts as an oversensitive and useless girl, and later becomes an insensitive and somewhat useful girl. That's all. I wasn't a fan of her at the beginning, but I really started to dislike her in the London arc.It's totally understandable that most humans would need time to transition into e.g. the military, the battlefield, anywhere with a lot of violence and potentially death. PTSD and other triggers are natural. But Saya's aversion to killing does not seem to be something she can overcome at all, costing the precious lives of basically everyone else around her. And when she does manage to 'kill' monsters, her rate of success is about 1 out of 6. That's right.1 out of 6, less than 20% effective.I was expecting a goddess of destruction, and got a goddess of hesitation. Considering how she's repeatedly worshipped as the 'world's only hope' or salvation from monsters, 20% is a pretty dangerous rate to hedge your life on, imo.Which leads me to another important point...The bad guys in this show who don't die, get stronger. The heroine and her team members who die / don't die, seem to struggle to live even one more day. There is a weird power imbalance that could be described as watching a sports team play a game where they NEVER WIN. Throughout the series, Saya's team suffers from severe injuries, death, and tragedies, while the antagonist and gang remain... untouched. It is the opposite of most hero stories. So, even if Saya is weak, her team is sadly, not much better.And yes, in case it isn't already obvious, the producers kill off a lot of amazing characters (but don't worry. The manga rights all these wrongs, and keeps the RIGHT people alive).Side characters:Almost all the side characters were entertaining and had excellent character depth. It was like all the creative writing that should've gone into Saya, went into the background characters instead. You start rooting for e.g. David and Julia, enjoying Lewis, Riku, Min, Moses, and Solomon (my favourite boy). The side characters kept me watching the more than Saya. Granted, not everyone was neccessary (like the Schiff), but the dialogue and personalities came to life for each of them, and is possibly the series only redeeming point. Heck, I'd rate Saya a 2/10, and the supporting characters a 10/10.The only 2 side characters I could do without, would be Kai and Haji. Kai is full of denial, selfish, projecting his insecurities on others, an arrogant troublemaker, and incestuous towards his sister. He always causes problems for others, and then doesn't take responsibility afterwards. I firmly believe he should've stayed in Okinawa and gotten married to Mao. He would've been happier, and his life goals would've been the same.Haji had a lot of potential, but slowly became a silent 1D character, more like a human shield and servant for Saya. His past and personality should've been explored more, and there was a hint of it in like, the last 2 episodes, and then it was gone. His strength was also weak compared to many bad guys, always in defensive stance vs. attacking, and unable to wound any of them. A lot of good intention, but overall a passive and forgettable character.Other notes- Plot holes around Saya, her parents, chevaliers, the species, biology, are never explained fully, if at all. I was frustrated throughout the episodes and referenced the manga often, just to understand what the * was going on. They don't even mention the word 'vampire,' even though that's what they are, extremely evolved bat creatures.- Content is predictable for anyone who knows basic World History and world geography. Judging from the rave reviews, a lot of people don't.- I couldn't stand the music / soundtrack. The series plays like 10 variations of the same song (the antagonist singing), at least once per episode. It's not even a full song, by the way, just a 20 second melody. Gets tiring, fast, so mute your volume and read the subtitles if it gets unbearable for you too.- Considering how burdensome Saya was, I was really hoping she would die at the end and give it a clean break. Nope. Instead, all the irritating characters stay alive, and the best ones remain dead.All in all: This series was a waste of time, psychologically dark, and I wouldn't recommend it. The manga appears to be much better and a quick read, though there are many character differences. 30*30 mins = 900 mins = 15 hours) to tell us a backstory that literally took 15 MINUTES.I'm serious - if you skip Episodes 1 - 29, you won't miss anything.

Hirogaru Sky! Precure,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53716/Hirogaru_Sky_Precure,"['Hirogaru Sky! Precure is airing as a 20th anniversary series for the Pretty Cure franchise, and has so far been delivering well on the hype on which it was built upon.Starring our first blue “leader” cure, as well as the first male main team cure and adult cure, Hirogaru sky is certainly breaking past the barriers of what most fans would expect from a season of this show. Going with the theme of soaring high into endless expanse above, this show takes the audience on an unforgettable adventure between the worlds of Skyland and Earth as the cures fight monsters threatening to ruin the peace...of their lovely city.If I had to give one major criticism to this season, it would be that the monsters are among the more generic types for pretty cure, just being a manifestation of “Undergu energy” as opposed to Heartcatch’s use of negative human emotions or Go! Princess’ use of dreams being sealed away.As for the characters, so far I am personally loving their development and interactions, with the show having already taken great care in creating situations and conflicts to which the audience can relate with on some level, and connect with the main cast.Overall, I would definitely recommend picking this one up if you’re a fan of Precure already, or even if you’re a newcomer struggling to decide which season to begin with! of their lovely city.If I had to give one major criticism to this season, it would be that the monsters are among the more generic types for pretty cure, just being a manifestation of “Undergu energy” as opposed to Heartcatch’s use of negative human emotions or Go!

Fushigi Yuugi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/123/Fushigi_Yuugi,"['Though by some standards today, the story may seem a bit clich&eacute;, but for its time in the mid-1990s, it wasn&rsquo;t really that much of the norm. So the Alice in Wonderland concept may not be something that will appeal to everyone since you&rsquo;ve already seen it in more semi-mainstream animes in comparison to this one such as 12 Kingdoms, Inuyasha, and Escaflowne which came out after Fushigi Yuugi though this was the anime that did it before it became something semi-common. Even though this is primarily shoujo, the well diverse but archetypical cast do have mass appeal.Each character for the most part has...their own unique use and contribution to the story and they are presented in ways you get to know them. The characters or heck, maybe even one character will grow on you as you watch from start to finish. I would explain this, but it would be a significant spoiler, and if you&rsquo;ve seen this anime, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about. Whether that character is good or bad, you&rsquo;ll love them. Hell, my favorite character Nakago is the primary antagonist and even Yuu Watase, the original manga-ka has admitted that Nakago is her favorite character.The anime will hopefully satisfy men and women. The story overall is very diverse with its appeal, but it went a little longer than it should have, but it ends in a way where everything is resolved and the characters wonderfully develop. It has romance, adventure, excitement, comedy and action, which I will further get into. However, what will annoy male and female alike is the interaction between Tamahome and Miaka when they really get romantic with each other. It kind of drags and we don&rsquo;t need that much hugging even if we can appreciate how much they love each other.Well, the character design today doesn&rsquo;t really stand out in comparison to most shoujo out there for the most part. The costume designs are a little flamboyant for the setting, but even so, they still compliment the character designs very well where it helps make them stand out a bit more. The action is well coordinated, technical and raw which will appeal to male viewers. The city settings captures the heart of ancient China very captivatingly and truly represents their culture at that time period where they gathered to worship the emperor. However, with the modern day settings, you get a different approach to the school uniform with the blazer and ribbon design you see in lets say Evangelion, than the more mainstream sailor uniform which I thought was unique to anime in the mid-1990s with Magic Knight Rayearth and Sailor Moon being the rage back then with those designs, so its nice to see something different. It is also unique to point out in the real world in Fushigi Yuugi, nobody has crazy color hair, but in the book, you got the typical crazy color anime hair which was somewhat of the intention of Watase and the staff at Studio Pierrot. So overall, the art may be descent, but the character design 100% stand out, but the action, costumes, and scenery makes up for it.The dub of Fushigi Yuugi does have some credible names, but I don&rsquo;t think the dub was good. First off, Tamahome is played by David Hayter who you may know as the voice of Solid Snake from MGS. When you hear that voice in relation to Tamahome&rsquo;s image, it just doesn&rsquo;t match. He makes Tamahome sound gruffy, though it&rsquo;s not the voice he uses for Solid Snake, but when he does scream, he does scream like Snake. This kind of casting is to me, for the sake of casting a big name and you&rsquo;re giving him a character he&rsquo;s not appropriate for. However, this was a role I thought perfectly suited his Japanese counterpart, Midorikawa Hikaru, the voice of Heero Yuy from Gundam Wing, and Rukawa from Slam Dunk. Granted Midorikawa has played character opposite from Tamahome, he had a different kind of cool that Snake has, but he still has that passion and soft side that really captures him. As a matter of fact, Watase actually wanted him to play Tamahome because he had him in mind when he created the character.I also enjoyed Kae Araki the voice of Sailor Chibi Moon as Miaka. She does sound annoying with her high-pitched voice, but it was at a certain tone where it really captured the character with all of these emotions whether sad, happy, concerned, or excited. And Seki Tomokazu, my 2nd favorite seiyuu who has played Miyata in Hajime no Ippo, Domon in G Gundam, Kamui in X The Movie, and many others was great as Chichiri, my 2nd favorite character. He is so multi-talented and he demonstrates it very well when you get to know his character more. Overall, the cast is just top notch and they all have great chemistry. Even though the romantic tension between Tamahome and Miaka gets annoying, their seiyuus truly make it believable.The opening theme song Itoshii Hito no Tame Ni does open with this more traditional approach and then at the right moment, transitions to a more energetic J-Pop song. It&rsquo;s very unique to me because it captures the cultural and romantic atmosphere of the series. And the ending theme Tokimeki Doukasen has a different kind of energy that is generic but still catchy and semi sexually suggestive in a more innocent sense. The background music is well orchestrated in every sense. Such as traditional Chinese music, more traditional cinematic.Anyway, I think this is an anime I believe you should try to give a chance even if it may not be your taste. There are all kinds of good qualities this anime has that does make up for its bad ones. Even so, the bad qualities are still there but if you concentrate and stick to what you like, you&rsquo;ll forget about them. I remember during the days of VHS fansubs, I used to talk to people who cried watching this series. It has all of these great themes such as love, friendship, loyalty, and betrayal and they are presented in a very realistically approachable manner. And believe me, there are moments where you might and I&rsquo;m not ashamed to admit I have watching this series. The only anime that has achieved me to react like this since is the Kimura vs Mashiba oav of Hajime no Ippo. their own unique use and contribution to the story and they are presented in ways you get to know them. The characters or heck, maybe even one character will grow on you as you watch from start to finish. I would explain this, but it would be a significant spoiler, and if you&rsquo;ve seen this anime, you know what I&rsquo;m talking about. Whether that character is good or bad, you&rsquo;ll love them. Hell, my favorite character Nakago is the primary antagonist and even Yuu Watase, the original manga-ka has admitted that Nakago is her favorite character.The anime will hopefully satisfy men and women. The story overall is very diverse with its appeal, but it went a little longer than it should have, but it ends in a way where everything is resolved and the characters wonderfully develop. It has romance, adventure, excitement, comedy and action, which I will further get into. However, what will annoy male and female alike is the interaction between Tamahome and Miaka when they really get romantic with each other. It kind of drags and we don&rsquo;t need that much hugging even if we can appreciate how much they love each other.Well, the character design today doesn&rsquo;t really stand out in comparison to most shoujo out there for the most part. The costume designs are a little flamboyant for the setting, but even so, they still compliment the character designs very well where it helps make them stand out a bit more. The action is well coordinated, technical and raw which will appeal to male viewers. The city settings captures the heart of ancient China very captivatingly and truly represents their culture at that time period where they gathered to worship the emperor. However, with the modern day settings, you get a different approach to the school uniform with the blazer and ribbon design you see in lets say Evangelion, than the more mainstream sailor uniform which I thought was unique to anime in the mid-1990s with Magic Knight Rayearth and Sailor Moon being the rage back then with those designs, so its nice to see something different. It is also unique to point out in the real world in Fushigi Yuugi, nobody has crazy color hair, but in the book, you got the typical crazy color anime hair which was somewhat of the intention of Watase and the staff at Studio Pierrot. So overall, the art may be descent, but the character design 100% stand out, but the action, costumes, and scenery makes up for it.The dub of Fushigi Yuugi does have some credible names, but I don&rsquo;t think the dub was good. First off, Tamahome is played by David Hayter who you may know as the voice of Solid Snake from MGS. When you hear that voice in relation to Tamahome&rsquo;s image, it just doesn&rsquo;t match. He makes Tamahome sound gruffy, though it&rsquo;s not the voice he uses for Solid Snake, but when he does scream, he does scream like Snake. This kind of casting is to me, for the sake of casting a big name and you&rsquo;re giving him a character he&rsquo;s not appropriate for. However, this was a role I thought perfectly suited his Japanese counterpart, Midorikawa Hikaru, the voice of Heero Yuy from Gundam Wing, and Rukawa from Slam Dunk. Granted Midorikawa has played character opposite from Tamahome, he had a different kind of cool that Snake has, but he still has that passion and soft side that really captures him. As a matter of fact, Watase actually wanted him to play Tamahome because he had him in mind when he created the character.I also enjoyed Kae Araki the voice of Sailor Chibi Moon as Miaka. She does sound annoying with her high-pitched voice, but it was at a certain tone where it really captured the character with all of these emotions whether sad, happy, concerned, or excited.

These days there are so much anime that are about the main character/s sucked into another dimension and they are the chosen ones to fix the problems of this so-called dimension (Kyo Kara maoh, Escaflowne, Izumo. etc)Although it is one of my favorite series, there are some parts that to me are considered unsatisfactory. I feel a bit sorry for Chiriko because he was one of the lesser important seishis (the other would be Mitsukake). I am not...a fan of Chiriko or Mitsukake, but I do think that they could've used more screen time.I also noticed some discrepancies. It could be due to translation errors, but I'll say it anyway. There was an episode where Keisuke and Tetsuya go to the Genbu shrine. They went there to see the Byakko miko. One question: why is the Byakko miko in the Genbu and not the Byakko shrine?I have to mention that I watched the english dubbed version, because I found certain voice dubbers annoying. I hate Tomo's voice - it is the most annoying voice I have ever heard in my life. Whoever thought of making Tomo's voice sound that way was nuts and should be locked up in an asylum. Miaka was also a bit annoying. I cringe whenever she would cry out Tamahome's name.And now for the positives. I love the story - I think it is well thought of. It was able to mix in elements such as love, friendship, deceit, war, etc. into something really decent and worth watching. I first watched the show 6 years ago, and when I watched it again last month I find myself obsessed once more.The visuals weren't bad either - although I can't say if I prefer seeing genitals on Yui and Miaka. Seeing naked people is bad enough. However, the show is filled with bishonens throughout the show. My personal favorite is Nuriko of course. He is my god. The wonderful art shown at the end of the show via the ending theme was beautifully made and I never grew tired of it.The music wasn't bad - most of it were mid 90s music, so I can't say I'm a huge fan of it. I do like the ending song, &quot;Tokimeki no Doukasen&quot;. It's another one of those nostalgic song for me - everytime I hear it I can't help but feel reminiscent of the year when I first watched Fushigi Yuugi. Some of the insert songs weren't bad either. Again they were mid 90s styled, but they're not so bad. I did get tired of the opening song after a while. Hearing &quot;Maiagare Suzaku&quot; for more than 10 times tends to get on my nerves.I think one reason why the show was suspended on Filipino free TV was because of mild sex and vulgar language. This is definitely not for kids, but I would say it is a must - see for the 16+ crowd (mostly because I saw the show when I was 16). a fan of Chiriko or Mitsukake, but I do think that they could've used more screen time.I also noticed some discrepancies.

Miaka and Yui are in the library when Miaka sees a mysterious bird lead her to the restricted room of the library. There, Miaka finds a mysterious book, and her and Yui are pulled into the world. Miaka and Yui meet a mysterious man who saves them from slave...traders, but Yui is thrown back out of the book, and the man has left, leaving Miaka all alone in this Ancient Chinese world. Miaka meets with the man again, and they end up at the palace, and through circumstances, Miaka is charged with the duty to gather together the seven senshi of Suzaku, and save Konan from destruction!I know that makes no sense, but in a nutshell, Miaka fell into Konan, an Ancient Chinese world, where the whole world lives on the idea of the Four Gods in Chinese Mythology. Miaka is in the south, where Suzaku, the Red Bird (Pheonix in some translations) protects the country. Each God has 7 constellations (or in this case, the 7 senshi). So the constellations have taken the form of 7 warriors, and Miaka needs to gather them to summon Suzaku, who will grant her 3 wishes.AnimationThe animation itself is smooth, and well done, until about the second season (ep 27+) where the animation seems to take a bit of a plunge at times. The colouring is also very vibrant at times, but others, it's very muddy looking, and monotone, because everything seems to be in the brown colour tone, except the hair of Miaka's senshi. The most remarkable thing in the animation, however, is the eyes. When the animators but their mind to it, they draw some beautiful, bright, colourful eyes.SoundThe music in this falls into an olden style theme, mostly Chinese sounding. However, they have their theme, and ending theme that do not fit that theme. And one thing you need to know about Fushigi Yuugi, is if you want to hear more of it's music, be prepared for trumpets. Lots of trumpets.Anyways, the theme song is fairly slow at first, but then seems to almost have dance feel to it. It's nothing remarkable. The ending theme, however, is a dance song, but also has a fairly sad tone to it, fitting the series well, I feel.The voices, English and Japanese, I have to mention, are wonderful. I love it in both languages. The voices fit the parts perfectly.CharacterThere is a whirlwind of characters. Be prepared to remember some names. The main characters are essentially Miaka, Yui, Tamahome, and Nakago, but you have the supporting cast (that consists of atleast 12 senshi, only including the Suzaku and Seiryuu), and about 13 more characters I can name off the top of my head.While most characters have well-done development, because of the mass amount of characters, some of these character appear almost personality-less, most notably two of Miaka's senshi, Chiriko and Mitsukake, and two of the Seriyuu senshi, Tomo and Miboshi (I'm not counting Ashitare because he practically never talks, and well... if you want to sure, he has no personality I suppose). Watase herself never really developed these characters, so they continue to suffer, even onto OAV's, and even in their songs. But for the characters she does focus on, they are all very different, and it's not hard to pick a favourite.EnjoymentFor all the bad things I have said, this series has an amazing fanbase, and I personally think it has high replay value. Everytime you watch the series, you find something you missed, but I remember the first time I saw this, and I was an addict, most literally. I couldn't wait for them to release the next VHS (and boy did they have alot... 14). I know of people that do dislike this series, but for the most part, everyone has something about this they liked, and it usually lies in the characters themselves, particularily the senshi.C'mon, for a series that spawned so much merchandise, character songs, OAV's, etc, how can it not be enjoyable?Well yeah, the OAV's aren't enjoyable, but the series itself is fun to watch over and over again.Overall / My Comments / My FeelingsThe story is a bit different from the manga, and justifies this beginning a bit more. Miaka and Yui are pulled in to the book world, but they both return (in the anime, it's only Yui). Miaka gets in an agruement with her mother, and runs back to the library, getting pulled into the book again to set her free of the pressures of her real life. The manga honestly has a stronger beginning, and gives you more sympathy for Miaka as the protagonist.Even though my above comments aren't the best, this is me looking at it critically. If you don't, and just watch it for enjoyment, I can guarentee anyone who loves the romance genre of anime will like this.Yes, Miaka and Tamahome can be terribly annoying. They are my least favourite characters after all... But the first time I watched the series, I LOVED those two, it's just been 9 years since my first watching, and I've developed a series dislike for their constant crying for each other.I know I sound negative, but I do recommend this series to anyone. Anyone. It's a classic, and for it's time, it was an incredibly original plot. (Yes, we know in Inu Yasha that Kagome travels between worlds, however, Fushigi Yuugi predates Inu Yasha quite a few years.  Fy being originally published in the '92 region and manga, while Rumiko was making Ranma 1/2 still at that time (she published the first Ranma in '93) so it's not possible that InuYasha could be more original than FY, because it wasn't made at the same time. It's possible Rumiko could have gotten ideas at that point (I can't find the year for InuYasha)).ANYWAYS, just watch Fushigi Yuugi. I'm going so off track here, because I like talking about how original the series is, and how much I love the characters. (Me?

I'm so glad I listened.The main character, Miaka, got a little annoying at times but I thought she was cute with Tamahome. Many watchers, at least the ones I know got sick over how much they were all over each other. But what do you expect? This girl was in a time she wasn't from. She was always attacked or in danger and she had no one else to really turn to. He was the one...she trusted the most. I thought their relationship was cute.Her friend, Yui had to calm down though. She went into total pms mode...and for what? Just because Miaka got her crush? And for the times Miaka wasn't able to get to her, it wasn't her fault. Miaka just didn't know how to use her powers...whatever those may be. But I do understand that Yui was also scared....but she was supposed to be the smarter of the two. Didn't she stop to think things through? Or was it because of Nakago? Though his story made me cry....But anyway, for the harems that these two girls had....I liked almost everyone in Miaka's group except for Chiriko and Mitsukake. The kid annoyed me and he really didn't do much. Mitsukake was alright but not a favorite. The other guys had life to them and their stories were so sad. T-T But my absolute favorite was Nuriko. He was just too awesome for words. (And too beautiful too xD; )For Yui's group, it was the twins. Everyone else had pretty much psycho issues.... Nakago was just a conniving evil dude but I'll admit it...he was pretty. xD; Tomo would have been okay but he's way psycho....The character developments were good in the aspect of each one developing like a life of their own. They weren't all similar but weren't all that extreme either. It was a nice variety among them. And I thought the voices were perfect for each character. Of course I love Hotohori's....his being Koyasu Takehito. (the man does 100's of voices lolz)The animation was nice, given the time it was created. I always liked hand-drawn as opposed to all the ones done on computer today... -_-;;;;; It just gives the show a different feeling. Especially if the story itself is supposed to be another time, like in the past.Overall, I think it was a great series. I actually cried at the end! I felt for the characters that were lost. And the story was just great. I loved how the creator utilized legends and made a good romance. Kinda' makes girls wish they could find a book like the &amp;quot;Universe of the Four Gods&amp;quot; (only without all the scary parts xP ).I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a romance series that's not too depressing but not so bubbly and happy.

I mean I'm not a big fan of shoujo or romance, but to be honest: it's not the point.Story isn't bad. I like fantasy, magic, alternative worlds etc. Maybe it's not super duper complicated but I don't have too high expectations either.ArtWell, let's say Pierrot.But not Naruto-like, a little bit better than usually. Drawing was like you should expect from...13 years old anime. Animation in fights  is so-so, scenes are colorful...SoundOpening and ending aren't anything special. Soundtrack? I didn't notice, nut maybe it's better.CharactersIt's the biggest vice here. Romance thread is really important here so, unfortunately, we have to cope with main character Miaka all the time. Miaka is an idiot. First she resembled me Usagi form Sailor Moon: she eats a lot, she's cute (but not pretty anyway), but she's even more hopeless and helpless. But it's not a reason to do nothing, right? So Miaka doesn't listen to anybody who ask her to wait or stay somewhere and then she tries to fight enemy alone and then she's captured and then rest of team have to rescue her. It happens over and over a-gain. Miaka is indecisive too. She love Tamahome and wants to spend all her life by his side only to realize taht their relationship is impossible and break up in the next episode. Later they make-up but not for too long. Reasons are always the same. Rest of characters isn't bad, but there's too much of Miaka and her problems in 52 episodes.Enjoyment: it was a pain. Reason is mentioned above.Well, my english isn't good enough to express all my feelings, negative I guess, but I think you have to watch it yourself.

The concept that all interesting life experiences don’t end with falling in love is clearly presented and that is a worthy message.While this may have been an early form of the 'priestess stolen from another world to save an ancient city' theme, it was by no means the best I have seen.  The characters were interesting and had potential, however, the...main character was clothed in piety in order to hide that she was truly ignorant and selfish.  She cried a lot about how people around her got hurt and how she wasn't any good at doing things and then would run off alone, forcing her companions into danger and giving them all kinds of needless obstacles in protecting her.  Then, when they acted in a similar fashion she was hurt and confused.  If the point is that sacrificing yourself to alleviate your own feelings of guilt and fear is counterproductive and only gets people hurt, then this is a good lesson.  But Miaka is only seen as more loving and benevolent after these choices and continues to make them throughout the series.  And Miaka’s friends continue to take the brunt of her poor choices.Yui’s reaction to her struggles was unbelievable.  She and Miaka had known each other since kindergarten and still, when it came to believing Miaka, Yui blindly takes the word of a stranger she had known for only a few months?  This is instigated because when Yui is taken into the book, she is attacked.  She knows how little knowledge and ability that Miaka has and in all the times Miaka was attacked Yui was powerless to help her.  Yet, because Miaka didn’t magically come when Yui called her Yui hates Miaka for it.  Then, Yui blames Miaka for having people to save her when she entered the world, but the only thing difference between their experiences was that Miaka protected herself against the thugs before she was saved by Tamahome, whereas Yui did not protect herself before Nakago came.  Beyond that Nakago never hid is cruelty or manipulation of others from her, so he was obviously not the good guy type.  It would have been more believable if they had claimed Yui had been envious of Miaka from the start of their friendship.  Either way, the character reactions to almost everything were over dramatized and unrealistic.Ultimately this anime tried hard, but falls short of anything beyond mediocre entertainment.  It reinforces a lot of poor judgments and makes unrealistic conclusions about consequences.  But it was not all bad so I gave it a grade of average. main character was clothed in piety in order to hide that she was truly ignorant and selfish.

But it was not all bad so I gave it a grade of average."", ""First off, I'm going to start with the fact that I finished this anime, all 52 episodes and I'm still not sure why. I couldn't stand most of the characters, the art is outdated, the story is decent but there are so many stupid tropes and situations that I stopped watching it several times throughout the series.But I returned to finish it. Why? Because despite the annoying characters, painful voice acting, and dumb tropes, it has a weird sort of charm. Maybe I'm just nostalgic for shows I watched in my childhood (mainly Inuyasha, actually) but I actually enjoyed it. "", ""MainFushigi Yuugi is a lukewarm anime series. Obviously compared to the shows of today...but even back then, I can't say that I was as enthralled by it as everyone else. Sure it has it's high points: Lots of action, dramatic tension and bishounen galore...but with all the cheesy canned romantic dialog and all the ill-timed [Sailor Moon-ish] humor seriously detracts from the show's dramatic intensity not to mention, total enjoyment from this show.Art-StyleI would say say this is the typical 90's style animation...nothing too impressive but it wasn't boring or hideously drawn either. There are a bunch or errors...and irregularities with the animation with the way things are supposed to move or fall also with the way characters run and pose. And there were definitely some corners being cut during the action scenes with some minor looping and also with freeze frames....not enough to complain about though, as I said this is very typical of animes from the early to mid 90's anime.SoundExpect some pretty dated music from this one. One of the BGM used for the some fight scenes actually sounds like the base track from the song &ldquo;pump up the volume&rdquo;. Some songs weren't too bad for their time tho, like Chiriko's song and the OP Theme. I actually like the very beginning for the OP because it sounds very majestic and then you see the lead female character [Miaka] all dressed up in her priestess robes looking refined. The show was watched in english and I must say that the voices actors did a really really good job on this show, no one had an annoying voice on this show. Best Voice Award goes to Nakago and definitely to that one creepy gay warrior with that kabuki make-up on his face and all the feathers sticking out of his head.StoryThe story has a good beginning and a great ending....but it kind of sags in the middle. Boring, annoying and definitly irritating with all this back and forth with Miaka and Tomohome. All this break up/Make up...Love me/Don't love me BS, very annoying and it spans too many episodes, like one of those epically annoying battle scene from DBZ that spans 14 &ndash; 30 episodes. The other conjoined story lines, like about her and Yui being in the Realm of the Four Gods or the individual dramas of the accompanying seven warriors [or 14 warriors if you count those of the Seiyu Clan] were definitely great and made watching this anime worth it. But also other drawbacks from this story were the excessive chibi use, the screwball Sailor Moon type humor that didn't fit with the high-tension moments and not to mention all the CORNBALL romance lines being used in the show.Cast/CharactersThe bishounen factor is very high [at a very solid 100%] with this series, there is also some SHOUNEN-AI and brief moments of MxM going on up in this anime....so there will be no character complaints coming from me......mmmmmmmmm, well actually Miaka is kind of a do-do head. Anyway they were all drawn very well and looked cute.Worth it or NOT?I know many people hold this series in high regard and so those who love it have already bought it. I wouldn't buy this though....for one, I hear Tomohome's name too much. She calls his name like every 5 seconds....and......it's reeeeeeeally annoying! If I played a drinking game based off of how many times I heard her call his name...Tomohome, Tomohome, I'd die of alcohol poisoning!!! and irregularities with the animation with the way things are supposed to move or fall also with the way characters run and pose.

After season two i almost killed myself, the main characters who seemed to have so much power in the first season suddenly are at the mercy of the over-powerful baddies. The love story really f\'d up too they really just needed one reason to not be together instead of all sorts of useless side reasons that are solved so quick. I also hate how one sequence, going from spot A to B takes 4...pointless travel episodes with a crap load of foreshadowing and flashbacks, just show me the damn fight!Despite all this i really invested myself in the show 52 f\'ing episodes does that, and i really liked a few characters but of course they aren\'t in the second season as much and suddenly there is no comedy left!  As much frustration as i had while watching ie. yelling at the computer, flipping off the douche bags, and skipping to the good parts. I did enjoy the anime enough to finish all the OVA’s which were better than the whole series!! pointless travel episodes with a crap load of foreshadowing and flashbacks, just show me the damn fight!Despite all this i really invested myself in the show 52 f\'ing episodes does that, and i really liked a few characters but of course they aren\'t in the second season as much and suddenly there is no comedy left!

I did enjoy the anime enough to finish all the OVA’s which were better than the whole series!!', 'You\'ll notice I rated this anime a 6/10 which I know is lower than what most other people rated it, but that\'s only because I don\'t think Fushigi Yuugi is that special of an anime. The story isn\'t original, the characters are simple, and by the end I was bored of watching.Story: Miaka was just an ordinary girl until she got sucked into a book and became the priestess of the beast-god Suzaku. Now, in order to fulfill the prophecy, she has to gather the seven warriors of Suzaku in order to save the world and ""make all her dreams come true."" So the...anime\'s driving force is Miaka trying to summon Suzaku, but she can\'t do it without the seven warriors. When I read the summary of Fushigi Yuugi I thought to myself ""finding the seven warriors is probably going to span the entire anime"", but actually Miaka finds the warriors surprisingly quick, she finds one right after the other with no filler in between.However, the biggest problem I have with this anime is all the attention on romance. A lot of the problems the characters face in the anime are solved not with fighting and violence, but with the power of true love. There is some action in the anime, but always the problem they face is ultimately solved with love as in all the characters crying, hugging, and the music getting all soft. Even after the fight is over, Miaka says ""I was so worried about you"" and then more hugging.Furthermore, I was shocked how long this anime is, I mean after the main story is over it has three OVA\'s that total 13 extra episodes! Also, just when I thought Miaka had everything she needed to summon Suzaku, Miaka finds out that she still needs to do something else!Characters: If you\'re the kind of person that likes relationships then you\'ll love this: Miaka loves Tomahome, but their love is forbidden; Hotohori also loves Miaka, but Nuriko loves Hotohori and Nuriko is gay, but Hothori isn\'t; Yui loves Nakago, but Nakago is just using Yui; Soi also loves Nakago, but Nakago doesn\'t love her. Do you think you can follow all these love-triangles? Miaka never stops talking about Tomahome, I actually counted once and she said his name almost 30 times in one episode! ""I love Tomahome"", ""I\'m worried about Tomahome"", ""I miss Tomahome."" I\'m so sick of romance >:(Furthermore, some of these characters have such flat personalities. Chiriko and Mitsukake barely say anything, the writers basically erased Hotohori, and Miaka has to constantly be rescued. You see in anime\'s picture Miaka\'s holding that sword, that sword actually belongs to Hotohori and Miaka doesn\'t even know how to use it so she\'s useless in a fight.Also, it\'s so obvious that Nakago  is just using Yui so whenever Yui talks about destroying Miaka I just scream ""Miaka never did anything bad to you, you have no reason to want to destroy her, stop acting crazy!"" Seriously, how is that these characters can\'t tell Nakago is evil, he is pure evil and Yui doesn\'t seem to notice!Overall: This anime is for people that like love stories and soap operas, not people like me who like action and adventure. Only watch this anime if you\'re a big fan romance and if you aren\'t then don\'t torture yourself by watching this anime. anime\'s driving force is Miaka trying to summon Suzaku, but she can\'t do it without the seven warriors.

Everything about this anime is just right- right amount of comedy, romance, fantasy, underwear exposure, drama, harem...it has everything. i first seen this anime years ago but i just cant help re-watching it over and over again. i even got some of my friends to watch it and i'm not even surprised that they loved it too.the characters are amazing. making it different from one another, having those skills and each...characters take and timing were just right. the romace in the story is what's most noticeable. be it the romance between tamahome and miaka or miaka and hotohori and even of yui's and nakago's. it shows the hardships of a couple and how their love get through it all. the love in this anime does not revolve merely around couples, it also shows the love for one's family, friends, comrades and kingdom. the display of powers and skills in every battle is just a plus. just something that would add up to make this anime a masterpiece. it appeals to all kinds of people of all ages. both gender could learn from it. the comedy- for those who doesn't want to be bored i assure you that there is enough punchlines here that will make you laugh. the fight scenes- though not in any tournament or some arena, it does offer some good fights. for the tearjerkers- if crying is your hobby then this anime won't fail you.oh yes, i cried several times too. for the romantics- it doesn't matter whether you're in love, just got out of love, have a one-sided love, super lovey-dovey, secret love even forbidden love i'm sure this anime will get your attention.what i hate about it though is the main girl miaka. she's too loud and too stupid yet she still get the boys. this is just too unfair.even yui (her bestfriend) will agree to that. sometimes it makes me wonder, maybe ancient china likes stupid girls since they're unique in their own way. haha but infainess to her, no matter how clumsy she is , she always get the job done.and now it comes down to what i love most...it's the guys of course. they are all beautiful with amazing characters.i love the art in this one. tamahome and hotohori are my ideal men.unfortunately none like that exist in the real world.no wonder miaka want to get back inside that book so much.haha  sometimes i wish to be an anime instead because of these guys.hahawell, i just hope that everyone enjoys fushigi as much as i do. characters take and timing were just right. the romace in the story is what's most noticeable. be it the romance between tamahome and miaka or miaka and hotohori and even of yui's and nakago's. it shows the hardships of a couple and how their love get through it all. the love in this anime does not revolve merely around couples, it also shows the love for one's family, friends, comrades and kingdom. the display of powers and skills in every battle is just a plus. just something that would add up to make this anime a masterpiece. it appeals to all kinds of people of all ages. both gender could learn from it. the comedy- for those who doesn't want to be bored i assure you that there is enough punchlines here that will make you laugh. the fight scenes- though not in any tournament or some arena, it does offer some good fights. for the tearjerkers- if crying is your hobby then this anime won't fail you.oh yes, i cried several times too. for the romantics- it doesn't matter whether you're in love, just got out of love, have a one-sided love, super lovey-dovey, secret love even forbidden love i'm sure this anime will get your attention.what i hate about it though is the main girl miaka. she's too loud and too stupid yet she still get the boys. this is just too unfair.even yui (her bestfriend) will agree to that. sometimes it makes me wonder, maybe ancient china likes stupid girls since they're unique in their own way. haha but infainess to her, no matter how clumsy she is , she always get the job done.and now it comes down to what i love most...it's the guys of course. they are all beautiful with amazing characters.i love the art in this one. tamahome and hotohori are my ideal men.unfortunately none like that exist in the real world.no wonder miaka want to get back inside that book so much.haha  sometimes i wish to be an anime instead because of these guys.hahawell, i just hope that everyone enjoys fushigi as much as i do."", ""This anime is a bit old but it rivals (is as good as) any romance anime I've watched till now.Miaka, main character- attractive, cute, honest, caring but annoying, is sucked into an ancient book and found herself in plenty of trouble. Well first, she falls in love with Tamahome. Somehow, Miaka is so hot that even the Emperor is in love with her LOL:) There are some love triangles going on, adding spice to the story.The (Suzaku) warriors are slowly revealed in an interesting manner. Each has their own tale and attractive personalities. I would say my favourite is Tatsuki- because he adds a lot...of comedy besides looking soo hot. Also, he initially was rough and sort of a bad guy. Other than Tamahome, he seems to have actual character depth and development out the the 7 warriors.For the Seiryu warriors, my favourite are the twins. The really livened up the story. As you know, Miaka's best friend, Yui became the priestess of Seiryu and so became enemies with Miaka. However, you'll have to watch the anime to find out why Yui went over to the dark side:)  The real bad guy here is Nakago of course- he is smart and manipulative. However, you'll feel sorry for him when you learned of his tragic past.Since this anime's setting is in ancient China, the surroundings and clothings will be of that. Think Chinese temples, emperors, etc. Each warrior also has a Chinese character on his forehead. Ironically, the villian Nakago's character represents 'heart' ,while the protagonist Tamahome's character means 'demon'.The story is compelling as it is not the usual 'fight the bad guy, save the world type'. A very important part of the story (other than romance) is about friendship. It is really touching to know after all the bad things Yui did, Miaka still forgives her and retain their frienship.Overall, the story is great and entertaining. There is a fair bit of fight scenes but violence is kept to a minimum. Lots of drama and suspense moments.A word of caution: Miaka and Tamahome will proclaim their eternal love for each other multiple times throughout the anime. Translation: there will be a lot of kissing, hugging, etc. Most of the time it's sweet and cute though:) of comedy besides looking soo hot. Also, he initially was rough and sort of a bad guy.

It is perhaps the shojoest of the shojo anime series and rivals Nana and Revolutionary Girl Utena.  So if you’re female, there’s an 85% chance that the series will appeal to you in some way, shape, or form.  If you’re male, there’s an 85% chance that you’ll find the series either boring, slow, redundant, or stupid.  If you are male and are in the minority, there’s a chance that you’ll get mocked.  I did at Anime Detour.But honestly, there are worse things that you can admit to...liking.  The show starts out interesting, and most characters catch your interest by immediately creating an instant impression yet hold your interest by being multi-layered.  You have to keep watching the show to actually see this, since characters change their personalities so often, and the slow pace means that in order to see their entire self, you can’t pick and choose.  The main character, Miaka, may seem a bit naïve at times, but despite her constant dramas with her protectors and with her friend-turned-opponent Yui, she is strong in her own way and able to see the true side of things.  She’s a typical teenage girl, but yet is portrayed to be sensible to a degree.  Her relationship with Tamahome is like a rollercoaster, and will find a lot of appeal for viewers…  and also be the source of ridicule for those who dislike the series *insert drama cry and cues “Get one with it”*.  It’s developed so well that it serves as the perfect centerpiece and there are moments where you cry out for the two of them to get through their problems and be together again.  It just shows that for a relationship to be perfect, it’s not always peaches and cream.However, despite the excellent development of the two main characters and most of the secondary characters, there were some characters that seemed to have been shoved in there just for appearance sake and thus weren’t developed very well.  Chiriko, Mitsukake, and Miboshi, among others, just simply had a few lines of dialogue or were only featured in a few episodes before they were taken away from the series altogether.  It’s worse for a shojo series, especially for the protagonists, since they’re treated as walking dolls rather than individuals with depth.That said, however, Nakago is simply the perfect villain.  Maybe a little boring (not much in the form of diabolical laughter or Gendo Ikari hand gestures here), but he is a complete asshole.  And in this shojo series, what better weapon to use than sex?  Especially lies about sex.  And it’s way better the clichéd ability showed in the ending battle with Tamahome.  Honestly, despite him being an asshole, without him, the story would collapse and fall into nothingness.  There would be no Seiryu vs Suzaku, Yui vs Miaka, the clash of ideals and the intertwinedness of characters within a faction.  The drama would fade away, turning a color-filled clash of drama, determination, and righteousness into something blander than wallpaper paste.And speaking of battles…  though most of them are emotional ones, ones of drama, lies, ideals, broken promises, and obligations to others, the ones that are portrayed are hit-or-miss.  You get your clichéd Nakago who’s stronger than everyone, but also ones where the best weapon is your own head rather than a sword or special ability.  But what really appeals to me is that every one of these battles has a purpose.  It’s to achieve something, and in each one, the only way is forward.  You may get sidetracked, but there’s always a twist thrown in so that a whole new series of events start to happen.  Battles are not for “moving onto the next opponent” (this isn’t Bleach here) but for starting a whole new series of events.  You don’t long for them but you know that another one will be coming up soon as the drama rebuilds back up.And of course…  the plot…  ah, yes…  yeah…  think slow…  .hack slow.  In order to like this series, you’ll have to put up with it.  Keep track of the relationships within both factions amongst all the characters and what they have gone through and what they will go through.  It’s a series of thought, angst, happiness, and sadness.  You watch it with your heart and mind open, and within one big plot of trying to summon two gods, there are many subplots of why characters are doing what they are doing, and for whom and what they hope to achieve.  It’s a story of connectivity, and best taken one disc at a time (though tough luck finding them for cheap if you don’t own them already).Like I said, it’s not for everyone.  The plot is sluggish, it requires lots of concentration, and the same themes cycle throughout the entire series.  There are lots of things to keep track of, and you can easily get bored.  But the characters (most) are well-developed, the drama keeps you interested, and you’re always wondering what’s going to happen next (presuming you’re interested in the show).  Worth giving a shot for at least the first disc.  Best to watch this over a course of…  several weeks minimum. liking.

Especially lies about sex.  And it’s way better the clichéd ability showed in the ending battle with Tamahome.  Honestly, despite him being an asshole, without him, the story would collapse and fall into nothingness.  There would be no Seiryu vs Suzaku, Yui vs Miaka, the clash of ideals and the intertwinedness of characters within a faction.  The drama would fade away, turning a color-filled clash of drama, determination, and righteousness into something blander than wallpaper paste.And speaking of battles…  though most of them are emotional ones, ones of drama, lies, ideals, broken promises, and obligations to others, the ones that are portrayed are hit-or-miss.  You get your clichéd Nakago who’s stronger than everyone, but also ones where the best weapon is your own head rather than a sword or special ability.  But what really appeals to me is that every one of these battles has a purpose.  It’s to achieve something, and in each one, the only way is forward.  You may get sidetracked, but there’s always a twist thrown in so that a whole new series of events start to happen.  Battles are not for “moving onto the next opponent” (this isn’t Bleach here) but for starting a whole new series of events.  You don’t long for them but you know that another one will be coming up soon as the drama rebuilds back up.And of course…  the plot…  ah, yes…  yeah…  think slow…  .hack slow.  In order to like this series, you’ll have to put up with it.  Keep track of the relationships within both factions amongst all the characters and what they have gone through and what they will go through.  It’s a series of thought, angst, happiness, and sadness.  You watch it with your heart and mind open, and within one big plot of trying to summon two gods, there are many subplots of why characters are doing what they are doing, and for whom and what they hope to achieve.  It’s a story of connectivity, and best taken one disc at a time (though tough luck finding them for cheap if you don’t own them already).Like I said, it’s not for everyone.  The plot is sluggish, it requires lots of concentration, and the same themes cycle throughout the entire series.  There are lots of things to keep track of, and you can easily get bored.  But the characters (most) are well-developed, the drama keeps you interested, and you’re always wondering what’s going to happen next (presuming you’re interested in the show).  Worth giving a shot for at least the first disc.  Best to watch this over a course of…  several weeks minimum.', 'My opinion on fushigi yuugi is that it was a very good anime to watch. The plot was a very good plot with a good romance triangle between miaka, tamahome, and hotohori. Personally I think that miaka could have been given a better power and actually do a little more fighting and defending her self a little bit more because the suzaku seven where always fighting for her even saving her. but that is just my opinion.

It was fun to watch but now I\'m older, I have a different perspective. The art and animation was ok. The fighting scenes are ok as well but the problem lies within the main character of the show.Miaka Yuki:She is greedy, stupid, coward, crybaby. Everytime when she wants to rescue Yui, she always thinks of Tamahome. She keeps saying ""Tamahome! Tamahome!"" many times until I got tired of it. Just like characters keep saying the name of a person who he or she loves like Yuka Minase from...11eyes, Orihime Inoue from Bleach. She also becomes vulnerable in situations and becomes the damsel in distress. She always do not want to accept the difficulties in life and she easily cries all the time.I really just don\'t understand why the characters like Miaka.So because of her, she screwed the whole show for me and I am not going to watch it again. As a note, I really hate whiny and crybaby anime characters like her. If you enjoy the series, that\'s cool. But I just couldn\'t dwell in it. 11eyes, Orihime Inoue from Bleach.

It was tele-casted in ANIMAX in India, every Saturday from 11:00 AM to 12:00PM during year 2001. At that time I was studying degree and I started bunking classes for watching this anime. To reach home from my college I have to take a bus and it would take lot of time to reach home.

My personal favorites are prince hotahori, tomahome and the sage ( I forgot his mane though). Moreover this is the anime in which I felt sympathetic towards nakago. Its admirable on part of the writer to  show the other side of a villain.

The characters are a real shortcoming in this anime. Miaka is not a heroine. She is a cipher for the viewer to place themselves in. Even when she finally attains the ability to defend herself she ends up being AWFUL at it. Her main jobs in the anime is to serve as a global taunt for the enemies, eat food, and be the cipher/object of the reverse harem\'s affections. This is literally...all she does for 50 episodes. It blows me away how characters like Bella Swan are so rejected and torn apart by most fandoms but characters like Miaka are acceptable.The characters I found most interesting weren\'t even the ""good guys"". Yui had the potential for MASSIVE development in the series due to her experiences but she was never really given any chances. She\'s vastly ignored for a part of it and ends up getting defined by one bad thing that happened to her. At that point, she isn\'t really a person, as much as she is ""That girl that had the bad thing happen and now she\'s bad too.""Also, if you\'re a victim of sexual assault, I suggest staying away from this anime. I dropped the series a couple times throughout because of how poorly and insultingly that subject is dealt with. Unless you like it being implied that you\'re damaged goods.If you\'re looking for a lighthearted ""girl out of place"" type anime, I suggest trying something like Inuyasha and staying far away from this.

They\'re not explicitly showed, but it does hint that attempts happened/tried to happen.As cute of a show it looks on the outside, it can get pretty dark, which is why I put the warning up first.Aside from that-I didn\'t think I would enjoy this much because based on the cover art, it looks like a  reverse harem. Most of the reverse harems I\'ve seen have not had that great of stories, and are more for fanservice.But this show wasn\'t a reverse harem (or not emphasized to be). Thank god! A few characters do...crush on our main girl, but it\'s not focused on those aspects. Cool, she\'s surrounded by handsome guys, but the anime focuses more on the plot and developing the characters individually rather than trying to use the main heroine as a way to show themselves.

A lot of them were really likable and I even found myself sympathizing with some of the opposing characters too.I think because a lot of stuff happens in the show, that the story is constantly evolving and moving forward that it may feel \'rushed\' for some people. Compared to other shows I\'ve recently seen where 2 opponents will spend the whole 20 minutes staring each other down in a battle or thinking ""ah what do i do"", this show mostly goes straight to the action. I like it this way, since I never felt bored.The music was a bit weird for my taste, but fair.

I\'m proud to say that even though I\'ve seen other animes that have taken off from this idea, this still is able to maintain this freshness throughout. The story for the most-part is pretty predictable. Even though is tries to through some ""OMG"" moments of twists and turns, the show does not execute it well enough to make it as truly powerful as it could\'ve been....The story is laced with comedy and alot of drama and from my understanding is pretty enjoyable for most the viewers. The story is good but definately not perfect.Art-The art and animation for this show is a double edged sword. Since this was released it has been a good 14 to 15 years. So I wouldn\'t expect it to be up to par animation-wise. Fights include speed lines and flashes (bleehhhh seizure) during those ""Pwnage"" moments. Typical of something released long ago. The art is able to maintain this amazing classic feel while also being incredibly intricate. It can go from this to SD/ Chibi in those comedy moments. The art is translated well from it\'s manga counterpart. The only problem I have with the art is that the men(some of them) often have the same facial features as the next ie; Tamahome to Nakago. The quality can from good to barely average. (honestly the art does not tend to bother me because of how engaging the story is.)Sound-The sound is good as well. Not normally my come of tea and i felt it could\'ve had a little more effort put into it. It includes alot of synthe and somewhat cheap attempts to fill the void of the moment. The romantic songs often left me with the impression of being with a ""magical unicorn"" (what would you expect from shoujo though lol) It sounds like glitter (if that really has a sound) It sometimes incorporates some rare instruments to pair with the intial vibe of the show ex-Saxophone. It also has some traditional instruments that get more engaged with the magic of it all. I think the mixing of the instruments are to mix the idea of the real world and the world the story takes place in.Character-The characters are VERY cliche. Not that\'s bad it\'s just very expected and average. Miaka the lead is often annoying and needy (atleast how i see her.) Typical of shoujo though for having her wait for her knight in shining armor. Tamahome is also very typpical of his suspected role ie; overly protective, compassionate, always is serious about loving Miaka Blah Blah Blah. But of course almost all the male leads want to ""have their way"" with Miaka....OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT!!!! I wish they could\'ve been more original with this idea....Enjoyment-Overall I really liked this series having it\'s hiccups here there it\'s still a good solid watch.

Not that\'s bad it\'s just very expected and average. Miaka the lead is often annoying and needy (atleast how i see her.) Typical of shoujo though for having her wait for her knight in shining armor. Tamahome is also very typpical of his suspected role ie; overly protective, compassionate, always is serious about loving Miaka Blah Blah Blah. But of course almost all the male leads want to ""have their way"" with Miaka....OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT!!!! I wish they could\'ve been more original with this idea....Enjoyment-Overall I really liked this series having it\'s hiccups here there it\'s still a good solid watch. Nothing ground breaking but something plausible enough to be memorable.Overall-Good Points-Original storyline (at the time)Engaging StorySolid listen in both languagesGood HumorSolid soundtrackBad Points-Predictable StoryAnimation could\'ve betterStory often can have some pacing problemsVERY Mellow dramatic', ""this is a really great anime to watch. Even though the whole concept of having a time traveling protagonist, the warrior guy versus the oji-sama, having rivalries between the protagonist and the best friend that ends up as an antagonist because of hilarious love triangle, and some weird characters that appears in the midst of the story.But still for me there are lot of off spins that happened in the story. Of how they manage to go back to the real world and how the love story of miaka and tamahome ended. The sound was really great.And also the OVA is some how...really hard to get ( the flow of the story) if you don't watch it! really hard to get ( the flow of the story) if you don't watch it!"", 'This was the first anime I ever watched with more than 14 episodes. It is really good, and enjoyable. I remember being at school and just thinking about what could happen next and then I would watch it for hours. Even though the story is very good some parts did annoy me a little bit. For example; the main character Miaka Yūki either gets kidnapped or attacked every single episode. Which leads to Tamahome (Main Guy) to shout ""Miaka!"" about a million times through out the episodes. But hey ho i still loved it!It has everything really; Action, Romance and it is very very...funny at times :) funny at times :)', ""Initially, I thought this anime would be one huge chick flick focusing solely on romance and relationships. I am glad I stuck with it and continued to watch, because boy was I wrong! It has a very good balance of romance, drama, comedy, and action. I enjoyed it very much the entire way through. Most of the characters are very compelling, and you find yourself growing attached to them--especially Nuriko and Chichiri (Ya know?). The only reason I didn't give it a pure 10/10 rating is because a few times, the plot seemed to take some ridiculous turns--some good, and some not-so-good. I won't spoil...them. Everything ended up working out anyway, and it wasn't cliché. The ending was one of the most beautiful endings I've ever experienced in an anime.

There is not much variation to how “boy and girl meet” and usually everyone expects the exact same thing to happen in the conclusion. That is why to spice things up, the conditions under which the boy and the girl meet...or the ordeals they are going through need to be different each time, in order to at least make the world around the otherwise one-track romance to appear interesting.Take this series for example. We have quite the usual fuss. Naive good girl meets mysterious pretty bad boy and falls in love with it 0.13 seconds after they first meet. Why? Well, she is naive, he is a boy, he is pretty, and apparently being bad is quite fascinating if you spent your life pampered and see this as a way to get wild before you grow old and wither away in boredom with some fat, bald poor business man who cares more about football than you.

Very common today, very rare back then. This anime did not receive its fame because of its romance, which to be honest is following the book of corny romances to the letter. It is about the world around that romance.-Let’s have the girl being the reincarnation of a celestial maiden, whose mystical powers can control the forces of the world.-Let’s have her knight in shining armor be a super warrior in a magical land and part of her elite followers.-Let’s have her best friend tuning out to be her worst rival, because fate requests it and because the villain in the show exploits her emotions.-Let’s add a hundred other people trying to exploit, survive or just have fun with all that.-Let’s add flashy superpowers. Lots of them.-And tears. Lots of tears.-And let’s always end the most important episodes with a cliffhanger.Yeah, sounds great already.So I’m not going to lie, the premise of this anime is amazing, despite being so old. You can focus on different aspects to it instead of just seeing it as yet another corny romance (which it is by the way).But let’s try to see a bit deeper than that and check out some things most fangirls … err… viewers don’t notice. The pacing for example has always been the most overlooked aspect of most stories, being left alone to read books home while bijinism and extravagant are out partying like crazy all night with naivety and suspended disbelief. If this poor champ would be noticed for some weird to imagine reason, he would tell you that this series (as well as most others for the same matter) is suffering from tuberculosis. It has a very formulaic way to present its story, some parts are damn boring, some others are hardly affecting the overall, and the finale is a five year old writing Tolkien fanfiction on a napkin… with its mother’s crayon.Of course, nobody ever listens to poor old pacing as the fang… fans of such shows are too busy yelling “Kyaaa, Tamahome is so dreamyyyyy!” This example can expand to pretty much any romance by the way, with the only difference being the name yelled. But in some alternative reality of the multiverse where his voice is heard, everyone would agree that the way the story unravels is far from “as dreamy as Tamahome”.-Most side stories are hardly affecting the overall plot and yet they are there to slow the pacing. Just imagine four teams of warriors, each one having seven members and yet only one or two in each one matter. And the way the fated couple keeps copping with their ordeals looks too silly at best.But it’s not like the story is complete boinkers either. Its main idea expands further beyond the main duo and shows how circumstances can turn an average person to a savior and charismatic leaders being manipulated by shady people to do things they never intended. It is also full of emo characters with colorful personalities and sappy personal drama along with supernatural fights in the likes of Naruto or Bleach. And to its core, it is still a romance, ideal and corny enough to follow with your ears gone out of order because of the constant screams of those fang… fans of romances.Bottom line, it is a good story with a messy presentation. It may sound epic at first but it plays out like a soap opera with magic, slapstick humor and mediocre fan service.

The manga version could get away with its fluent lining and rather stiff body positions but the anime version is guilty as charged.SOUND SECTION: 7/10Analysis: Voice Acting 2/3, Music Themes 3/4, Sound Effects 2/3This part is rather ok.

They do eventually develop of course but considering the amount of air time they get, it feels slow and vein popping to the most part.-Miaka for example has nothing special to remember her about. She is aloof and frail when it comes to some hunk near her. She either gets saved by pretty boys or gets super powerful when they are not around; so she survives no matter what happens. She also has a real problem in staying dressed or not being chased around by rapists every ten minutes. And lol at her superpowers going away if she is no longer a virgin; this alone guarantees her purity remaining intact for the whole show.-Tamahome is to the most part the stereotypical hunk the heroine is after from the first second they met. He is simply so blunt in whatever he is doing and even most of that has to do with running after Miaka or desperately trying not to deflower her although he really digs her ass.-Yui is basically the evil side of Miaka, manipulated by the villain who is basically an evil Tamahome. That’s right, the main antagonists are the dark counterparts of the heroes. What, you expected something more? Anyways, Yui is also a blockhead for becoming her best friend’s nemesis for something she never did.

I chose to return about 25 years in the industry to observe some of the work of the Pierrot study back then, and I found it striking not only because of its synopsis and genres it covers, but also the good overall average score that “MAL” leaves us. "" But let us not go any further and enter fully into the analysis.Story: (5/10)(SPOILERS)This section tells us the adventures of how 2 friends find a strange book in a library and are taken inside it to another world from...the ancient Chinese era, where the protagonist Miaka ends up being a priestess who is in charge of gathering her guardians to invoke to the spirit of Suzaku and thus be able to fulfill his desire to return his life to normality.In the course of the trip we have observed many adversities or situations that are presented to our cast of protagonists and they are drawing successfully and eloquently for the plot during its first half of the series, or rather until chapter 30. Since then You can see a change in the rhythm and considerable development seeing that the emission limit that would be 52 episodes was approaching, they had to search and force some facts in the story, this was when the quality of the show began to decline, being very summarized and Obtaining a certain ""script"" from the management with very convenient situations in certain sections of the history of our protagonists, which unfortunately lasted until the end of its broadcast.Despite this, it should be noted that regardless of how, this adaptation achieves a starting and finishing point that is truly important, but in a way it hurts to see how that solid series that was in the beginning gradually faded away.Art: (8.5 / 10)Honestly, it is difficult for me to catalog or criticize this point, since I do not consider myself too expert in the subject and the truth is even more complicated when you analyze an Anime from 25 years ago, but from what was my point of appreciation, I consider that it has had a performance according to what it deserved with a fluid animation and beautiful designs for the time the show was held.Sound: (7.5 / 10)In particular I like it, although it did not get more than one OP / ED throughout its 52 chapters, I liked the 2 songs and that caused the essence of the adaptation to be impregnated in its melodies that was recorded in my mind by a good time, positive point.Characters: (5.5 / 10)(SPOILERS)Here we enter a dilemma as in the case of ""history"". The cast itself that we are introduced to during the adventures is considerably interesting, but only a few characters at the end of the day receive the treatment they deserve in good depth and developed from it, and I mean some like the same Miaka and Tamahome who are the main ones and would summarize Nuriko and Hotohori as outstanding, although already with a more relegated role and with fewer minutes on stage (somewhat understandable). The rest of the guardians of Suzaku pass without penalty or glory, they receive some introductory chapter at the time but once inside the main cast they become part of the environment that does not contribute much in itself. Which generates a certain point in obtaining a ""Death Flag"" and transmits as much empathy as it should to the viewer.Enjoy: (7.5 / 10)(Spoilers)Last aspect and as always I mention the most relevant to my criteria.Personally, I felt very happy with the Anime in the beginning, since at all times it showed what I was looking for, that mixture of romance, action and drama in good quantity and quality. But as I already mentioned, the emotion began to drop as we got to the middle of the show and the plot began to fall apart, since truly to create an anime that would last through the ages, it had to obtain at least 100 chapters for Doing everything to the letter, including the final battle, leaves little to be desired in the little that was developed and the way in which it takes place. Now, what really pays off at the end of the anime is that epilogue ""surprise"" that leaves us with the revelation that the guy with glasses that appears at the end is Tamahome\'s ""reincarnation"" in a way, which leaves me a very gratifying final smile.General: (6,8 / 10)I recommend this adaptation for people who love the gender / Romance / Shoujo / Action combination, as is my case, but be careful, it is not a series that I consider to be fundamental in these sections, because it does not comply in some points, which could be expected more, but if you are like I am a fan of this anime stereotype and you have seen everything potentially interesting today. It would not be a bad idea to take a look at this title.-----------------------IntroducciónEn esta ocasión y viendo que tenía tiempo en mi cronograma. opte por regresar unos 25 años en la industria para observar unos de los trabajos del estudio Pierrot en el aquel entonces, y me pareció llamativo no solo por su sinopsis e géneros que abarca, sino también el buen promedio general de puntuación que nos deja “MAL”. Pero no a larguemos más y entremos de lleno en el análisis.Historia: (5 / 10)(SPOILERS)Este apartado nos cuenta las aventuras de como 2 amigas encuentran un libro extraño en una biblioteca y son llevadas dentro del mismo hacia otro mundo de la era china antigua, donde la protagonista Miaka acaba siendo una sacerdotisa que está encargada de reunir a sus guardianes para invocar al espíritu de Suzaku y así poder cumplir su deseo de regresar su vida a la normalidad..En el transcurso del viaje hemos observado muchas adversidades o situaciones que se le presentan a nuestro elenco de protagonistas y van sorteando de forma acertada y elocuente para la trama durante su primera mitad de la serie, o mejor dicho hasta el capítulo 30. Ya que luego se nota un cambio en el ritmo y desarrollo considerable viendo que se les acercaba el límite de emisión que serían 52 episodios, tuvieron que rebuscar y forzar algunos hechos en la historia eh aquí fue cuando empezó a decaer la calidad del espectáculo, siendo muy resumido e obteniendo cierto “guionazo” por parte de la dirección con situaciones muy convenientes en ciertos tramos de la historia de nuestros protagonistas que perduro hasta el fin de su emisión desgraciadamente.A pesar de esto queda destacar que sin importar tanto el cómo, esta adaptación logra un punto de partida y llegada que es lo verdaderamente importante, pero cierto forma duele ver como esa serie sólida que fue en el comienzo se fue desvaneciendo poco a poco.Arte: (8,5 / 10)Sinceramente me es difícil catalogar o criticar este punto, ya que no me considero demasiado experto en el tema y la verdad es aún más complicado cuando analizas un Anime de hace 25 años, pero desde lo que fue mi punto de apreciación, considero que a tenido una performance acorde a lo que ameritaba con una animación fluida y bellos diseños para la época en la que transcurrió el show.Sonido: (7,5 / 10)En lo particular me agrado, si bien no obtuvo más de un OP/ED en lo largo de sus 52 capítulos, me agradaron los 2 temas y eso causo que quedara impregnada la esencia de la adaptación en sus melodías que quedara grabada en mi mente por un buen tiempo, punto positivo.Personajes: (5,5 / 10)(SPOILERS)Aquí entramos en una disyuntiva como en el caso de la “historia”. El elenco en sí que nos presentan durante las aventuras es considerablemente interesante, pero solo unos pocos personajes al final del día reciben el trato que se merecen con una buena profundidad e desarrolló del mismo, y me refiero algunos como los mismo Miaka y Tamahome que son los principales y sumaria como destacables a Nuriko y Hotohori aunque ya con un papel más relegados y con menos minutos en escena (algo entendible). El resto de los guardianes de Suzaku pasan sin pena ni gloria, reciben en su momento algún cierto capitulo introductivo pero una vez dentro del elenco principal pasan a ser parte del entorno que no aportan demasiado en si. Lo que genera en cierto punto un vacío a la hora de obtener sus “Death Flag” y nos transmiten tanta empatía como debería al espectador.Disfrute: (7,5 / 10)(Spoilers)Último aspecto y como siempre menciono el más relevante a mi criterio.En lo personal me sentí muy conforme con el Anime en el comienzo ya que en todo momento demostró lo que venía a buscar esa mezcla de romance, acción y drama en buena cantidad y calidad. Pero como ya mencione la emoción comenzó a bajar a medida que llegábamos a la mitad del espectáculo y la trama comenzó a caer en pedazos, ya que verdaderamente para crear un anime que perdurara por los tiempos de los tiempos debió obtener al menos unos 100 capítulos para hacer todo al pie de la letra, inclusive la batalla final deja que desear en lo poco que se desarrolló y la manera en que se da. Ahora, lo que verdaderamente vale la pena al final del anime es esa “sorpresa” de epilogo que nos dejan con la revelación de que el tipo con lentes que aparece al final es la “reencarnación” de Tamahome en cierto modo, lo que me deja una sonrisa final muy gratificante.General: (6,8 / 10)Recomiendo esta adaptación para gente amante de la combinación genero Romance/Shoujo/Accion como es mi caso pero atención, tampoco es una serie que considere que fundamental en estos apartados, por que incumple en algunos puntos que se podría esperar más, pero si eres como yo fanático de este estereotipo de animes y has visto todo lo potencialmente interesante de la actualidad no sería mala idea que le hechos una mirada a este título. the ancient Chinese era, where the protagonist Miaka ends up being a priestess who is in charge of gathering her guardians to invoke to the spirit of Suzaku and thus be able to fulfill his desire to return his life to normality.In the course of the trip we have observed many adversities or situations that are presented to our cast of protagonists and they are drawing successfully and eloquently for the plot during its first half of the series, or rather until chapter 30. Since then You can see a change in the rhythm and considerable development seeing that the emission limit that would be 52 episodes was approaching, they had to search and force some facts in the story, this was when the quality of the show began to decline, being very summarized and Obtaining a certain ""script"" from the management with very convenient situations in certain sections of the history of our protagonists, which unfortunately lasted until the end of its broadcast.Despite this, it should be noted that regardless of how, this adaptation achieves a starting and finishing point that is truly important, but in a way it hurts to see how that solid series that was in the beginning gradually faded away.Art: (8.5 / 10)Honestly, it is difficult for me to catalog or criticize this point, since I do not consider myself too expert in the subject and the truth is even more complicated when you analyze an Anime from 25 years ago, but from what was my point of appreciation, I consider that it has had a performance according to what it deserved with a fluid animation and beautiful designs for the time the show was held.Sound: (7.5 / 10)In particular I like it, although it did not get more than one OP / ED throughout its 52 chapters, I liked the 2 songs and that caused the essence of the adaptation to be impregnated in its melodies that was recorded in my mind by a good time, positive point.Characters: (5.5 / 10)(SPOILERS)Here we enter a dilemma as in the case of ""history"". The cast itself that we are introduced to during the adventures is considerably interesting, but only a few characters at the end of the day receive the treatment they deserve in good depth and developed from it, and I mean some like the same Miaka and Tamahome who are the main ones and would summarize Nuriko and Hotohori as outstanding, although already with a more relegated role and with fewer minutes on stage (somewhat understandable). The rest of the guardians of Suzaku pass without penalty or glory, they receive some introductory chapter at the time but once inside the main cast they become part of the environment that does not contribute much in itself. Which generates a certain point in obtaining a ""Death Flag"" and transmits as much empathy as it should to the viewer.Enjoy: (7.5 / 10)(Spoilers)Last aspect and as always I mention the most relevant to my criteria.Personally, I felt very happy with the Anime in the beginning, since at all times it showed what I was looking for, that mixture of romance, action and drama in good quantity and quality. But as I already mentioned, the emotion began to drop as we got to the middle of the show and the plot began to fall apart, since truly to create an anime that would last through the ages, it had to obtain at least 100 chapters for Doing everything to the letter, including the final battle, leaves little to be desired in the little that was developed and the way in which it takes place. Now, what really pays off at the end of the anime is that epilogue ""surprise"" that leaves us with the revelation that the guy with glasses that appears at the end is Tamahome\'s ""reincarnation"" in a way, which leaves me a very gratifying final smile.General: (6,8 / 10)I recommend this adaptation for people who love the gender / Romance / Shoujo / Action combination, as is my case, but be careful, it is not a series that I consider to be fundamental in these sections, because it does not comply in some points, which could be expected more, but if you are like I am a fan of this anime stereotype and you have seen everything potentially interesting today. It would not be a bad idea to take a look at this title.-----------------------IntroducciónEn esta ocasión y viendo que tenía tiempo en mi cronograma. opte por regresar unos 25 años en la industria para observar unos de los trabajos del estudio Pierrot en el aquel entonces, y me pareció llamativo no solo por su sinopsis e géneros que abarca, sino también el buen promedio general de puntuación que nos deja “MAL”. Pero no a larguemos más y entremos de lleno en el análisis.Historia: (5 / 10)(SPOILERS)Este apartado nos cuenta las aventuras de como 2 amigas encuentran un libro extraño en una biblioteca y son llevadas dentro del mismo hacia otro mundo de la era china antigua, donde la protagonista Miaka acaba siendo una sacerdotisa que está encargada de reunir a sus guardianes para invocar al espíritu de Suzaku y así poder cumplir su deseo de regresar su vida a la normalidad..En el transcurso del viaje hemos observado muchas adversidades o situaciones que se le presentan a nuestro elenco de protagonistas y van sorteando de forma acertada y elocuente para la trama durante su primera mitad de la serie, o mejor dicho hasta el capítulo 30. Ya que luego se nota un cambio en el ritmo y desarrollo considerable viendo que se les acercaba el límite de emisión que serían 52 episodios, tuvieron que rebuscar y forzar algunos hechos en la historia eh aquí fue cuando empezó a decaer la calidad del espectáculo, siendo muy resumido e obteniendo cierto “guionazo” por parte de la dirección con situaciones muy convenientes en ciertos tramos de la historia de nuestros protagonistas que perduro hasta el fin de su emisión desgraciadamente.A pesar de esto queda destacar que sin importar tanto el cómo, esta adaptación logra un punto de partida y llegada que es lo verdaderamente importante, pero cierto forma duele ver como esa serie sólida que fue en el comienzo se fue desvaneciendo poco a poco.Arte: (8,5 / 10)Sinceramente me es difícil catalogar o criticar este punto, ya que no me considero demasiado experto en el tema y la verdad es aún más complicado cuando analizas un Anime de hace 25 años, pero desde lo que fue mi punto de apreciación, considero que a tenido una performance acorde a lo que ameritaba con una animación fluida y bellos diseños para la época en la que transcurrió el show.Sonido: (7,5 / 10)En lo particular me agrado, si bien no obtuvo más de un OP/ED en lo largo de sus 52 capítulos, me agradaron los 2 temas y eso causo que quedara impregnada la esencia de la adaptación en sus melodías que quedara grabada en mi mente por un buen tiempo, punto positivo.Personajes: (5,5 / 10)(SPOILERS)Aquí entramos en una disyuntiva como en el caso de la “historia”. El elenco en sí que nos presentan durante las aventuras es considerablemente interesante, pero solo unos pocos personajes al final del día reciben el trato que se merecen con una buena profundidad e desarrolló del mismo, y me refiero algunos como los mismo Miaka y Tamahome que son los principales y sumaria como destacables a Nuriko y Hotohori aunque ya con un papel más relegados y con menos minutos en escena (algo entendible). El resto de los guardianes de Suzaku pasan sin pena ni gloria, reciben en su momento algún cierto capitulo introductivo pero una vez dentro del elenco principal pasan a ser parte del entorno que no aportan demasiado en si. Lo que genera en cierto punto un vacío a la hora de obtener sus “Death Flag” y nos transmiten tanta empatía como debería al espectador.Disfrute: (7,5 / 10)(Spoilers)Último aspecto y como siempre menciono el más relevante a mi criterio.En lo personal me sentí muy conforme con el Anime en el comienzo ya que en todo momento demostró lo que venía a buscar esa mezcla de romance, acción y drama en buena cantidad y calidad. Pero como ya mencione la emoción comenzó a bajar a medida que llegábamos a la mitad del espectáculo y la trama comenzó a caer en pedazos, ya que verdaderamente para crear un anime que perdurara por los tiempos de los tiempos debió obtener al menos unos 100 capítulos para hacer todo al pie de la letra, inclusive la batalla final deja que desear en lo poco que se desarrolló y la manera en que se da.

This anime was and is very inspirational! The plot had me beyond the edge of my seat! The characters are all so colorful and different, they make you laugh and make you cry. Speaking of crying, I could raise the sea level back up with the amount of tears I shed for this anime. But I laughed so hard at so many of the scenes! Every second of this INCREDIBLE anime was worth while! I'd say that this anime has all the elements of what makes a great...anime great. The story line is just so unbelievably addicting!!!

It's very emotional especially when it gets to the sad part so be warned.

It mainly depends on your preferences as well as your gender. This is a shoujo type anime. If you're not into shoujo - fantasy romance, then don't watch this, or you'll only get annoyed.Okay, so personally, I am a shoujo fan and I absolutely love reverse harem type series. So I definitely enjoyed reading the original FY mangas and when they've announced it was going to have an anime adaptation I literally flipped. I was so excited!The series started with Miaka, the MC getting sucked in a...magical book and became the main heroine who needs to find the 7 celestial warriors of Suzaku (all handsome men) in order for her to save the world. I know, i know! this sounds really cliche as there are thousands of other animes right now which all have a similar theme. But as a series that was published/ aired during the early 90's - I could say it was somehow Fushigi Yuugi that started it all.. this anime (for me anyway) was definitely fresh.It's every girls dream - the absolute fantasy for normal highschool girls to escape the highs school cramming life and live in another world surrounded by hot men who' are all dying to be with you. I mean, come on! Let's be honest here, ladies!Alright, so although the MC and her love interest Tama can get a little annoying sometimes with their lovie-dovie scenes, the story was actually quite good. the fight scenes were entertaining, and the setting was beautiful. What made me stick watching this anime though were not the main characters but the side characters... they are all extremely likable (even the villains), and they are the type of side characters that mattter in the story line.The art was breathtaking as expected, it is created by Yuu Watase after all. Her works are definitely my fav since I was 15 and now that I'm on my late 20's her works are still number one in my book. As a shoujo mangaka, her characters are too perfect you can't help but fall inlove with them. The music in the anime were pretty good for its time too. Wakatte-ita hazu was my personal favorite, younger kids nowadays might not appreciate these types of tracks now but back in the day this was nearly the epitome of shoujo themes.If it's your first time watching this show, I would suggest watching the original japanese voice dubs, the english ones are a bit annoying. I do admit, I started watching the english dub myself and then watched another round with the japanese ones & trust me, it definitely made a huge difference. There are just some dialogues that sounds really CHEESY in the english dub but not in japanese. Also, the humor in this series is a lot funnier in japanese and just a major EUGH in english.. it annoyed the hell out of me.Overall experience, I loved it! It's the best shoujo anime I have watched all my life. Even now that I'm older, re watching it again still gets me all pumped up and excited each episode. I've always been a fan Yuu Watase's works, her Universe of the Four Gods fantasy lore though takes the cake as one of the best reverse harem fantasy shoujo stories ever.

Although I believe the first anime I've seen has to be Pokemon. This was the first title I've actually seen through to the end (and 3 OVAs after). I really should have rated it higher, but as of now, that I'm reviewing it from memory, it would have probably been a disservice or filled with Nostalgia Points.Story-wise, it really was unlike anything else my young impressionable self has seen. But it also probably geared me away from harems in general. Whenever I look back on it now, I just realize how messed up...it kind of is. But that's not for this review to disclose.

Considering I got a good amount of enjoyment out of her later work Ayashi no Ceres, I decided to give Fushigi Yugi a shot. However, the series proved to be rather underwhelming with me considering the number of cliches common in a shoujo anime that this series gives off.This series is loaded with plenty of melodrama revolving around the romantic developments with Miaka and Tamahome, the tensions between Miaka and best friend Yui and the ongoing conflict between the Seiryu Seven and Suzaku Seven as they try obtaining the means they need to summon their...country\'s respective beast spirit. Attempting to exaggerate the issues faced by the characters also come along with their state of mind not making much sense at many points. Characters are shown rather frequently to make foolish decisions to put themselves at risk despite knowing the dangers they get caught up in, this predicament regularly happening to Miaka and needing Tamahome to save her from any sort of danger. This problem also arises with characters who become aware of obvious facts with the questionable moral issues of the side they take up and not questioning whether they made the right choices, this regularly shown with Yui\'s hostility towards Miaka for her assumed suffering despite knowing of facts concerning the nature of the book she is whisked into and the questionable morality of many of Nakago\'s actions. The show\'s efforts at also having you feel for the personal losses of major characters (shown prominently throughout the show\'s second half) also suffers to an extent due either to sloppy writing in the logic of events or limited depth on said prominent characters. If you\'re not a fan of melodrama, this series will regularly push your buttons throughout its run.Outside of the melodrama, Fushigi Yugi also carries a number of the cliches common in a shoujo anime with Miaka pretty much put in a reverse harem scenario with the multiple bishounen that make up the Seiryu Seven, several of whom develop romantic interest in her and fall under different character types. The show makes attempts to toss in comedy to relieve the title\'s more serious moments, but these attempts mostly fall flat. The series also tends to get in a bad habit at many points of having the old ""conveniently saved in the nick of time"" cliche come up whenever a character is in a life-threatening situation. Also, it appeared the series had quite the limited budget for its visuals considering the choppy frame rate for animation, washed out backgrounds and occasions of off-model character designs.Despite my constant complaining though, the series does do some things right. The characters that are reasonably developed enough get enough background where you do care for what happens to them and are rather likeable, despite the show\'s melodramatics making their serious moments look silly at a number of points. Also, the world of the book that is a regular setting in the series is based on actual mythology and elements of astronomy followed by the Chinese such as the Four Symbols and 28 Mansions, that make for interesting study and comparison to those interested in learning more about Eastern cultures.Overall though, I feel rather indifferent towards Fushigi Yugi compared to Watase\'s later work on Ceres. The series dips into too much cliches and melodrama common in shoujo anime for me to get seriously invested into the title\'s plot and characters, as well as having moments of sloppy narration and writing as a result of said melodrama.

I first dove into this series in the late 90s, while I was still in high school. It was my introduction to mainstream anime, outside of the offerings on network television. I remember being enthralled by the story, characters, and animation. Compared to what I had been exposed to previously, FY was an experience. After re-watching however, I don't feel it was able to stand the test of time in most areas. I actually took down my overall numerical score by one point after this re-watch.One area this anime still holds...up in is the characters. Now some of this feeling might be based in my nostalgic past, yet I still feel the anime holds true in character development, at least when it comes to the secondary and semi secondary characters. Even back then, the anime did a fantastic job in giving each character no matter their standing in the story an individual background and personality. Everybody's motivations and thoughts were distinct unto themselves.I fell in love with my previous favorites all over again. Nuriko, Hotohori, Nakago, Amiboshi, and Tasuki still hold as fantastic, well-rounded characters that have installed their ways into my heart again. Even ones that I could have done without years ago like Soi and Suboshi I could grow to appreciate given a more mature outlook while re-watching this series.Yet, I also see the glaring flaw in an aspect of this area, watching from the point of view of a middle-aged woman versus a teenager. That area is Tamahome, Miaka, and their cluster *beep* of a relationship. I seem to remember even back then being irritated by their whole relationship drama. Now, decades later, it's to the point of being unbearable. There is absolutely nothing admirable in Miaka's character. I have no idea why so many characters fall in love with her or want to have sex with her. Point blank, she's an idiot and in no way admirable. Their whole shouting matches at each other is irritating, so much so, that I fast forwarded through every exchange. If they were having a lovey-dovey seen, I skipped it.Story wise, I think you have to keep in mind the timeframe this manga and anime came out. The whole Japanese teenager traveling to a different world stick wasn't as commonly done. Unless there are relatively unknown 70s and 80s manga or anime out there I'm not aware of with this storyline, I think FY might have been among the first to introduce it. So keeping that in mind, I feel the story in this series is pretty strong. There's a lot of growth, conflict, and emotional turbulence to go through. I felt the series kept audiences engaged with plenty of obstacles to overcome and maturing characters. This aspect, I feel, has held up against the test of time.Again you have to remember this anime is on the older side when it comes to the art. For the time, some of the artistic techniques were revolutionary. When you compare FY to other contemporary titles like Sailor Moon, you'll notice that fight scenes and general animation flow stand out. Colors are bright and fight scenes draw you in, especially when tied in with the high emotional content of this particular title. Yet, when compared with anime from today, one can say the art doesn't stand the test of time. It's obviously dated; though emotionally driven, fight scenes can appear clunky and sometimes facial structure gets boxy. If I was someone new to anime and this was my first title, I might not notice the now substandard art. However someone who's been around the anime block now and then will definitely notice.Sound I felt was fairly good, especially the opening theme. There's just something about that opening number that gets you excited for the upcoming episode. It's just so iconic and doesn't sound like anything else I've ever heard. Maybe that's a bit of the nostalgia talking; yet, I can't help but be revved up by that opening number. Whoever put this musical score together also knows how to use music for emotional moments. For an anime that has as many tragic moments and emotional turbulence as this one, that's a key point to success. Other sound effects like for fighting and other exchanges are fairly common, like most other anime. Nothing too awesome stands here.Even after 20 years, this title still holds a special place in my heart, despite it's now more glaring flaws. Even with the dated artwork and the whole freaking Miaka/Tamahome thing, I still felt myself enjoying FY again. Thankfully some of those aspects that are irritating now I can fast forward through. I was still moved by the other characters, their trials and fates. I think an even score of seven is about right. FY will always hold a place as an anime classic, despite its many issues. It's a part of my personal anime history so stands out for me. Whether anyone else will find enjoyment out of it, I think they'll need to just keep in mind that this series is an older one. I think with that thought percolating in the back of anyone's mind, this title could still be enjoyable to anyone. up in is the characters. Now some of this feeling might be based in my nostalgic past, yet I still feel the anime holds true in character development, at least when it comes to the secondary and semi secondary characters.

It references a lot of its contemporaries, such as Sailor Moon, Inuyasha, and Dragon Ball.  But unlike Kagome in Inuyasha, Miaka is pretty useless.  She's worse than early Usagi (Sailor Moon) even.

This Anime though at the begining seems a little average and you will most likely think ""ive seen it all before"" is actually amazing! The further the story goes the more you love it. You fall in love with the characters and will cry, laugh, and no doubt you will be moved by this anime.The story becomes more and more intricate and every time you think its all going to be okay it takes a turn for the worst. This anime...keeps you gripped all the way through the two series, and while i must admit the second series is much better the first series is definately not to be missed just because it is still funny and you need that time to get to know and understand the fantastically thought out characters.Do not look over this anime it is astounding and ever since i watched this i have become hooked on anime well and truly.:D keeps you gripped all the way through the two series, and while i must admit the second series is much better the first series is definately not to be missed just because it is still funny and you need that time to get to know and understand the fantastically thought out characters.Do not look over this anime it is astounding and ever since i watched this i have become hooked on anime well and truly.:D', 'I started watching this because I loved Inuyasha and many people said that Fushigi Yuugi is similar.Story(7): It\'s not the most original plot, though at its time it must have been pretty good. Even so, I love this type of plot. The story doesn\'t lose the original plot as it goes on, which is a good thing.Art(8): It\'s good. Though I don\'t understand why most girls have short hair and most boys long hair.Sound(6): I don\'t remember any special soundtrack. The opening and ending themes weren\'t too great either.Character(5): This si probably where the anime fails the most. The main character, Miaka,...is an idiot. Seriously. I mean, yeah, the funny and klutz type of main character is more popular in animes, but they should at least develop as the anime goes on. Miaka doesn\'t. She always makes decision on her own and doesn\'t think about others\' feelings, thinking she protects them. She may seem too kind for her own good but, honestly, she never learns! She runs away and when she\'s about to be injured or killed, she yells or thinks ""TAMAHOMEEE!"" thinking he would always come to her rescue. Sometimes he does but when he doesn\'t, others do. She will only be useful at the end where she (FINALLY) does something good.Also, every fucking character falls in love with her. God..About the love story between she and Tamahome.. I don\'t find it too real. She falls for him in a blink of a second and, surprisingly, he falls for her too. But again, she\'s stupid and always makes stupid decision which will affect Tamahome too. I\'m angry with her even more because she can only think about Tamahome in some situations where she shouldn\'t.The other characters are fine, but I think they didn\'t get the importance they should have been given.Enjoyment(7): At first I watched the the first five episodes and stopped. After a month, I started watching it again. There are some predictable and some unpredictable moments, it was fine. I tried hard to watch the last ten episodes, I felt like the anime wouldn\'t end.Overall(7): It was a good anime, but if the main characters wouldn\'t have been so useless it would have been much better. The manga Fushigi Tuugi: Genbu Kaiden had a stronger lead so it was a lot better.If you want to know if it\'s worth watching it.. I think it is. There are some funny scenes that will make you laugh.

If I had to sum it up; if this seems like the type of anime that you would dislike, then you will dislike it. If it seems like the type of anime you will enjoy then you won't necessarily enjoy it.STORY- 6It's a very typical story for this kind of show and it doesn't really do anything outstanding. One thing that really spiked my enjoyment for this show is how it handled it's cliff hangers. I think they were timed perfectly, I just had to watch...the next episode, despite it not really being that mindblowing.However! What the show does, it does well. It's satisfying to watch and I personally never really felt like it was wasting all that much time. Although the middle was a bit more boring than the rest of the show, the show never really gets back to square one, nor does it have any arcs that don't have anything to do with the main plot.One thing that was almost funny was the show's fanservice. Sex is very much a thing in this show and it is discussed at length, (it can be a bit insensitive at times for today's standards) with one of the plot points being the main character's virginity status. But this definitively isn't a hentai or even an ecchi really, it truly is fanservice for its target audience: young teenage girls.ART- 4The weakest part of the show. But, to be perfectly honest with you, sometimes I just want to have something on while doing other stuff. so the lack of pretty visuals REALLY didn't bother me... This was the perfect show to just have on in the background, look at the screen once in a while, while doing homework and other tasks.If anything, it is refreshing to watch an older show once in a while, if just for a change of pace.The art isn't good. But I wouldn't have it any other way.SOUND- 7I actually liked the soundtrack. Again, it might just be the change of pace with this being an older show, but the opening and ending are enjoyable to listen to and I never really felt the need to skip them. The show has a tendency to play character songs, which you know.... It never really does make the sad moments sadder.I will listen to the soundtrack later on youtube to see if I like it separately, but it again is nothing special.CHARACTERS- 5Here we get to the part that might be a deal-breaker to many people. Miaka, the main character, she is, well... annoying. I personally did not find her that annoying, but I know that is how many people describe this type of character. The closest comparison would be Usagi (or Serena, whatever floats your boat) from sailor moon. I think those two even share a voice actor, that's how archetype-y Miaka is.She is a glutton, lazy, dumb and a damsel in distress, who just needs to help out despite not being able to contribute, because damnit, we need to further the plot somehow!! But she has a heart of gold and always does her best to do the right thing. Yeah... that kind of character.I personally don't find this type of character to be that annoying, because... yeah, I am like that too lol. And I really don't think she is the worst that this archetype has to offer, but you should stay away if this kind of thing bothers you.I think that Yui Hongo is WAAYYY worse of a character than Miaka, but I'd have to go into spoilers as to why. Let's just say that the story doesn't do her any favours; she isn't allowed much room in the role the story assigned her and it makes her actions seem unreasonable.The villain was mediocre.The best characters were definitively Miaka's brother and his best friend, they were pretty funny.All the other characters are OK I guess, no favourites here. (Although Hotohori is definitively better than Tamahome, just saying)ENJOYMENT & OVERALL- 7 & 6Enjoyable is the best way to describe this show. I enjoyed it, it was nice to have on in the background, but it is not really a favourite nor is it good enough that I would go out of my way to recommend it to people.

The fact that the main character and her friend end up in ancient China is fascinating.  From what I\'ve gathered, this anime is one of the first ""iseki"" anime.  While this is interesting, the anime slowly develops into this sad, pathetic love triangle...over a guy with the main character and her friend (who is her enemy at the time).

The plot of ""Fushigi Yuugi"" is like if the author of ""The NeverEnding Story"" decided to write a story with the reverse harem romance shoujo formula we still see today. However, the result was way more surprising and complicated than that. In my opinion, what makes ""Fushigi Yuugi"" good is how despite the more conservative time period it was conceived in, it took bold risks with the shoujo-typical themes it had, turning them darker than what you might see in other shoujo anime of the same time period (such as Sailor Moon), and I mean into almost adult themes, so this anime is not for the weak of heart.

From then I will move to the new ones which will hopefully be completed.What is there to say about this show? Oh yeah, this show it's hard to pinpoint a favorite character and a least favorite. Most are decent. But I guess my favorite will be Nuriko, yes, gotta love the abnormally strong, beautiful cross dresser ;) second goes to Amiboshi, he seems like a nice dude. Yui did awful things to her best friends Miaka, the protagonist, but if you were in her shoes and had...that brain washing influence you can't really blame her, she just seems, a bit extreme. Nakago, source of the Suzaku Seven, Miaka, and Yui's misfortune, somehow I can't hate him either. If the story was told in his view, he would be one of those misguided heroes/villains like Light or Lelouch. If I have to pick a least favorite, umm... I'd say... King of Seiyu? An insignificant character but all the main and sub-main are quite likable.Something that annoys me is how often the Miaka falls! That girl is always tripping at crucial moments!

She is too much like the stereotype magical girl character, head over heels with a bishounen dude, gluttony, stupid, a crier, etc. A lot like Usagi from Sailor Moon but Miaka has more will and whines a lot less.I would give this anime a 7/10 good, has its tear jerking moments packed with action, has its drama but it seems a bit cliche, maybe because it's old?Its biggest flaw is that Universe of Four Gods was written in ancient Chinese and while Yui and everyone else can read it but Miaka, maybe because they are smart and Miaka is kinda stupid, but it was written in ancient Chinese so why when Miaka got transported inside, she speaks Japanese and everyone can understand her, even having Japanese names and names of the cities are more Japanese than Chinese, same with the gods. At one point, Miaka wrote something on the window in kanji but Amiboshi knew what she wrote. This other time, Tamahome wrote her a letter and she read it, she can read the letter but not the book? Besides the language flaws, there arent really many other flaws. that brain washing influence you can't really blame her, she just seems, a bit extreme. Nakago, source of the Suzaku Seven, Miaka, and Yui's misfortune, somehow I can't hate him either. If the story was told in his view, he would be one of those misguided heroes/villains like Light or Lelouch. If I have to pick a least favorite, umm... I'd say... King of Seiyu?

Being an older show, it has it\'s own cliches, but aside from that this anime has been completely addicting for me. However, it\'s definitely not meant for people who can\'t stand characters dying, complete betrayals, continuous plot twists, and ""never ending love"", all with a side of slap-stick humor. If you\'re picky about those things, then all I can say is watch it and judge it for yourself. I\'m normally really picky, but I loved it to the last episode. ', ""I am truly saddened that this amazing anime is like ranked 722?! This anime has so much that is missing from a lot of current anime that deal with similar themes. It really has great character development and stories, that I feel many anime in the same category lack. The plot may seem typical reverse harem romance stuff, but it's quite deep dealing with various issues such as bisexuality,betrayal, sacrifice, tragedy, etc. also, this anime is hilarious! this is the full package for all u adventure and romance anime lovers. For it's time and even now, Fushigi Yugi is a classic, definitely way better than...some of the anime that's out now. some of the anime that's out now."", ""As my first anime and the one that will hold that special place for me it is something that I am unsure will stay popular for people watching it now. The plot is rather generic for 2020 standards but has some very memorable characters and was very good for it's time. Very typical story that we see when it came out with the stepping into a love story and to me really launched the genre.It will always be a classic with 90's complexity to love and life. I think where it really shines is in how they have many characters that you can relate to...and really build a fandom around. and really build a fandom around."", ""This anime it's amazing! The world they create it's so well constructed, that I can star believe that one day it can happen to me when I can go to my library.The love between the main characters it's so well expressed, that I don't even know if it's possible to love somebody like that.The people who like love stories they MUST see this anime!!Even if it's a old production, it's a classic that the anime lovers have to watch and enjoy.I already re-watched 3 times but I can continued watching again, again and over again, without getting sick of this characters, this love, this world,...the battles, so on! the battles, so on!"", 'I never heard of this anime before called Fushigi Yuugi, (or Fushigi Yugi, since I\'ve seen it spelled that way too). It means ""curious"" or ""mysterious play"". I enjoyed watching the anime because of it being set in a fantasy world, well moreso inside of a book & of course I do enjoy watching fantasy anime & movies. The story is pretty good & the characters are as well, though the main character kind of gets herself into trouble with the other characters in the anime, usually with someone on her side having to step in and protect her. It\'s a pretty good anime &...I would recommend it to those that enjoy this type of anime genre. I would recommend it to those that enjoy this type of anime genre.', 'Fushigi Yûgi is like if The Neverending Story was a melodramatic soap opera. It literally has the same precurser to The Neverending Story: two girls go to an antiquated library and then get rabbit holed into a magical storybook, but in this variation, it isn’t a high fantasy world, but a mystical version of ancient China. This series would have been much stronger if Yu Watase could write a story without leaning on the same old, tired reverse harem tropes.•\tAs far as the characters are concerned, there are a multitudinous amount in this series. There are seven Celestial Warriors to protecting the priestesses of fate...from the opposing factionsーthe warring territories of the Gods: Suzaku & Seiryuu; exactly like the rivalry between the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth in X/1999 (CLAMP). Unfortunately, I found the main two love interests DREADFULLY annoying.•\tThe main girl, Miaka, is an air-head who’s only talent is eating and having a pure heart―and since this is a shoujo manga, the “mary-sue” trope makes the female lead the most desirable to all of the male characters, even if she does nothing to earn the power of priestess and her main superpower isn’t kicking ass, but rather, whimpering about her boyfriend and turning down other men who make advances towards her. Admittedly, she does develop a little bit as the story goes on and becomes a little less whiny when the war causes families to be slaughtered and leavess villages in ruin, but through 95% of the series, all she does is whine about Tamahome (the first person who saved her when she was transported into a celestial Chinese world).•\tTamahome, on the other hand, is more likable, I guess? He at least has a motivation for his actions: he’s greedy because he’s feeding his impoverished family. That’s great, but he’s a really terrible boyfriend to Miaka, breaking up with her and repeating the same old, tired Twilight tropes of “we can’t be together” and then dramatically leaving Miaka to swoon in her overly-dramatized heartbreak. They had as much conflict as a couple as Inuyasha and Kagome; one of them is being seduced by another person, OH NO, but it turns out that it’s just a huge misunderstanding or the character is brainwashed and they get back together.•\tI’m not a huge proponent of stories having a good “message,” because I personally feel that a story should be able to stand on its own without shoving some kind of “life lesson” propaganda down your throat, but when there’s an elderly lady narrating the beginning of every episode, talking as if this is a story that has merit because of the character’s strong and tenacious spirits, then I expect a female lead would dump a male protagonist who gets brainwashed and cheats on her, while beating the crap out of her and breaking her arm, AND she still whines about it instead of getting pissed, even though she doesn’t even KNOW that Tamahome is brainwashed. It’s like the lonely James Cameron, Titanic fantasy of, “I’ll always wait for you,” because that’s apparently what docile shoujo heroines are supposed to do―sigh and stare out the window until their long-lost love returns.•\tTwo particularly likable characters in this series is a trans-woman named Nuriko and one of Miaka’s love interests, Tasuki; Tasuki was refreshing as suitor because he actually focused on his duties as the protector of the priestess and wasn’t pinning her down on a bed and confessing his love to her every other episode, not until the OVA at least. Nuriko is a badass who has super strength, but still manages to stay feminine and refined. She also is still an incredible best friend and protector of Miaka; despite the man that she’s in love with, Hotohori, having the hots for her friend. After watching and reading, Fushigi Yuugi, I wanted Nuriko to be my friend!•\tThere’s an interesting dynamic with the war between Suzaku and Seiryuu; during the last half of the series, it is revealed that two identical twin brothers were chosen to be on opposite sides of the war, it was something that was supposedly decided by fate and I thought that plot twist made a better statement towards to cruelty of pre-ordained destinies than the other chipper warriors. The series focuses on this with another twist that’s revealed, but I won’t ruin it the people who want to be surprised about it later. The most irritating thing about this series is that the “plot,” for the most part seems to accommodate romantic tensions and drama rather than focusing on the actual horrors of war. It’s more like the two factions are houses in the Hogwarts dormitory, rather than soldiers forced to risk their lives in battle, for the vague motive of having the priestesses’ wish granted by the Gods.•\tOverall, Fushigi Yuugi is an iconic series of its generation, but it has so much contrived drama that it’s hard to take seriously. I have nostalgia of plugging my earbuds in and listening to the MIDI version of “I Wish” on the way to school, but I believe that this series is a relic that only the young could enjoy with all of the juvenile stereotypes laid into its framework; unless you’re an older person with the tastes of a prepubescent who’s constantly tormented about their unrequited love and sniffling into a tissue somberly while writing a fujoshi fanfiction about twincest. I honestly think that Yu Watase’s best work was Ayashi no Ceres, Fushigi Yugi never made me get emotional, but Ceres did. Volume 8 of the manga made me sob like a baby when I was fifteen. I liked her other “dark” series, Alice 19th, as well, but I felt like it was short-lived and could have been more than what it was, since it was invoking a Kaori Yuki style of dark dreamscapes.  Fushigi Yuugi is admittedly better than ONE other series in Yu Watase’s mangaography: Absolute Boyfriend, which is a reverse harem version of Chobits and pure terribad trash. Overall, Fushigi Yuugi is like an animated fanfiction, I give the TV series a 4/10, the two OVA(s) a 3/10 because of feeling that they were unnecessary after the series’ conclusion, Fushigi Yuugi: Eikoden a 1/10 because it’s filler trash, and I give the manga for Fushigi Yuugi a 5/10 because Yu Watase has pretty art and the Miaka’s whininess doesn’t have a voice. from the opposing factionsーthe warring territories of the Gods: Suzaku & Seiryuu; exactly like the rivalry between the Dragons of Heaven and the Dragons of Earth in X/1999 (CLAMP).

YOU GUYS KEEP AWAY!back in 2018 i was intensely searching for anime about 2 girls get isekai\'d i watched when i was i dunno, 7 maybe? and turns out, the name itself is hard to remember as i don\'t understand japanese, because it\'s song really taking rent of my mind since i was little and i really curious about the show i was skipped back then, you know kid stuffs like additional lesson timefirst thing surprised me about this anime were, probably the first harem and isekai anime i ever watched back then, and.... the story itself is shouldnt be watched...as a 7 years old boy as it\'s alot implication of NSFW and some nudityfor character, as a dude, i dunno about girls feelings tho, i find both of yuuki and her friend are somewhat equally annoying, even tho yui\'s hate is somewhat justified but come on? switching side to the worst one? even tho, she\'s girl i like for her short hair when i was kidyuuki herself is like too idiot blinded by her love on latter episodes which kinda anger meand nuriko,  nuriko occasionally bullied by other characterfor some other harem character i don\'t dwelve into but, the kitsune monk is the stereotype fox like anime character for meor the narcistic emperori\'m not into shoujou even tho i watched some of them like wedding peach but, this one i completed to fills my curiousness from back then, i\'m not disappointed from the ending and i couldn\'t asked for moreoverall story about villain is just your typical ""look at my past OH THE HORROR now the world must suffer"" vibe which even modern anime have that, and come on, i knew they are mythical creature from old world and i doubt APFSDS\' couldn\'t solve the problemwhile romance is the clumsy girl who sometime get blinded by her emotion, and beware of handsome but broken dude, they are manipulativei find it a first unique reverse-trappy-harem-isekai-anime with minimal nfsw content and not having stereotype normal harem which after inside all of the harem member pants which i\'m not fan of it, so i give it a go as a 7 years old boy as it\'s alot implication of NSFW and some nudityfor character, as a dude, i dunno about girls feelings tho, i find both of yuuki and her friend are somewhat equally annoying, even tho yui\'s hate is somewhat justified but come on? switching side to the worst one? even tho, she\'s girl i like for her short hair when i was kidyuuki herself is like too idiot blinded by her love on latter episodes which kinda anger meand nuriko,  nuriko occasionally bullied by other characterfor some other harem character i don\'t dwelve into but, the kitsune monk is the stereotype fox like anime character for meor the narcistic emperori\'m not into shoujou even tho i watched some of them like wedding peach but, this one i completed to fills my curiousness from back then, i\'m not disappointed from the ending and i couldn\'t asked for moreoverall story about villain is just your typical ""look at my past OH THE HORROR now the world must suffer"" vibe which even modern anime have that, and come on, i knew they are mythical creature from old world and i doubt APFSDS\' couldn\'t solve the problemwhile romance is the clumsy girl who sometime get blinded by her emotion, and beware of handsome but broken dude, they are manipulativei find it a first unique reverse-trappy-harem-isekai-anime with minimal nfsw content and not having stereotype normal harem which after inside all of the harem member pants which i\'m not fan of it, so i give it a go', 'this series it\'s absolute trash, so why i decided to watch it till the end? Spoilers ahead and Trigger warning i guess, if you had experiences with SA don\'t watch this series, because this anime like to throw that as plot device whenever it wants and with no respect or whatsoever, so if you had experiences with that, stay away from this serieswell the first couple of chapters were entertaining and charming, nothing extraordinary, but i decided to give it a try, because i never watched a shojo before, and i heard great things about this one, so why not? i said to my...self, but maybe i should have stayed with battle shonen, because with every passing chapter my hated toward the series just grew up and up.First, the characters:Miaka: Oh my god, people like to throw the term ""worst MC of all time"" at any character, but i doubt they know what a trully awful MC really is, because miaka without a doubt it\'s probably the worst one that i have encountered in all of the animes that i have seen trhought my life, firt, she\'s the definition of useless, i literally can count with my the fingers of one hand the number of times she was useful, you know how many times she was truly useful? like two or three times, and the third it was mostly she trying to fix a fuck up she had made, when she\'s not being useless she is probably getting her self kidnapped because she doesn\'t like to take orders, at the begining of the series tamahome explicitly told her, don\'t follow me, and what does she do? she follows him, and thus getting a lot of inocent people get killed, and does she care? yes, like for one or two minutes, before not thinking about that again, because she was hungry, speaking of tomahome, she\'s like a parrot, i shit you not, if you take a drink for everytime she says ""TAMAHOMEEEE"" in her awful voice, you\'re probably gonna die, that\'s the only thing she does best, calling her awful boyfriend, which she doesn\'t have chemistry with, they just love each other so much, why? because he saved her one time at the beggining of the series, and because he has good heart, that\'s it, they don\'t know each other that well to have a believable romance, but i don\'t know if that\'s a staple of the shojo genre. besides being useless, she\'s dumb, like worringly dumb, i know that\'s a trope in the anime, but she\'s the bad kind of dumb, you know how there\'s character that are dumb, but lovable? well, she\'s the oposite of that, she\'s dumb and annoying, the only positive thing i can say of her it\'s that she has good heart , because if i were her, i couldn\'t forgive yui so easly, after all the shit she made her go throught because of miscommunicationTamahome: at the beginning of the series, he has more character, than in the later half, because in the second half of the series, he just became the boyfriend of miaka, and just talks about how much he loves her, and how they\'re never gonna separate, only for him or miaka do something stupid, and get separated, and that happens more than once.Nuriko: nuriko it\'s an interesting character, at the beginning we\'re told that the susaku seven could only be men, but nuriko it\'s a woman, but plot twist, it\'s really a man, but she says that she may be a man physically, but she\'s a woman at heart, and i\'m like okay, let\'s see where the mangaka takes this character, and i like her dynamic with the rest of the group, specially with tatsuki, they have a fun back and forth, and are very entertaining when are together on screen, anyway later on we\'re told that nuriko lives like a woman, because her sister died when they were kids, so he decided from that day that they were gonna live as a woman to honour their dead sister (sorry for the constant pronoun changes, but i really don\'t know how to refer to nuriko, most of the series they\'re adressed as she, but then nuriko decides to star living as a man again, so i guess we should adress nuriko as a He?) i don\'t know if nuriko it\'s a character trying to tackle the difficulties of growing and have doubts about your sexuality, and that it\'s okay to have self discovery journey? whatever the intention was, i wish it was approached better, but i think that\'s asking to much of this series.Tasuki: probably my favorite character of the cast, he\'s just charming, and i\'m kinda sad that he\'s trapped in such a mediocre series.Hotohori: he loves miaka, because he was brainwashed as a kid,  to believe that the love of his life was gonna be a girl from a another world, so when she finds miaka of course it\'s love a first sight, then he\'s taken out of the plot mid series, because he can\'t abandon the castle, and then he dies, and that\'s it.Chichiri: probably my second favorite, why? i don\'t know, he\'s funny i guess, and i like his character design, i really don\'t know what to say about him, he\'s just there to be funny most of the time, and use magic when he remembers that he can.Chiriko: would you believe me if i tell you the only time he does something it\'s befoe dying? he appears, joins the group, and then dies, he barely talks, he\'s barely a character, so i don\'t know why he was necesary to the history, besides the gimmick of being a group of seven, he\'s one of two characters that suffers from this problem.Mitsukake: he\'s a doctor, and then he dies. barely speaks, so there\'s not much character here besides him being a dr, that\'s barely used.Nakago: truly a hater, he gaslighted yui into believing she was raped, and that he saved her, so now she owe her her life, and then he tried to rape miaka, he\'s trully a villain. Everything it\'s always according to his plan, everything that is happening in the plot was always part of some big scheme of his, he\'s one of those villains, he\'s comically villanous, the only thing missing was him twirling his moustache and laughing maniacally.Yui: do you know that she was childhood friends with miaka? no? well i hope you like to be reminded of that, because she likes to bring that into conversations anytime she can, she loves tamahome for some reason, she only saw her like a couple of seconds at the begining before dipping out the book, so i don\'t know from where al this pasionate love it\'s comming from, i wish her character was treated betterthe history it\'s nothing, miaka go and gather the susasku seven to summon a god to grand our wishes, oh no miaka fucked up so now we cannot summon him, but don\'t worry there\'s a plan b, go and gather the macguffin from other countries to summon it, oh no miaka couldn\'t gather the macguffins, but don\'t worry maybe it was for the best, because if you summon the god, after the third wish it\'s granted, the god consumes you.this shit it\'s so trash, the beggining it\'s so bad it\'s good, but the later half it\'s just bad self, but maybe i should have stayed with battle shonen, because with every passing chapter my hated toward the series just grew up and up.First, the characters:Miaka: Oh my god, people like to throw the term ""worst MC of all time"" at any character, but i doubt they know what a trully awful MC really is, because miaka without a doubt it\'s probably the worst one that i have encountered in all of the animes that i have seen trhought my life, firt, she\'s the definition of useless, i literally can count with my the fingers of one hand the number of times she was useful, you know how many times she was truly useful?

Everything it\'s always according to his plan, everything that is happening in the plot was always part of some big scheme of his, he\'s one of those villains, he\'s comically villanous, the only thing missing was him twirling his moustache and laughing maniacally.Yui: do you know that she was childhood friends with miaka? no? well i hope you like to be reminded of that, because she likes to bring that into conversations anytime she can, she loves tamahome for some reason, she only saw her like a couple of seconds at the begining before dipping out the book, so i don\'t know from where al this pasionate love it\'s comming from, i wish her character was treated betterthe history it\'s nothing, miaka go and gather the susasku seven to summon a god to grand our wishes, oh no miaka fucked up so now we cannot summon him, but don\'t worry there\'s a plan b, go and gather the macguffin from other countries to summon it, oh no miaka couldn\'t gather the macguffins, but don\'t worry maybe it was for the best, because if you summon the god, after the third wish it\'s granted, the god consumes you.this shit it\'s so trash, the beggining it\'s so bad it\'s good, but the later half it\'s just bad']"
Jungle wa Itsumo Hare nochi Guu Final,https://myanimelist.net/anime/255/Jungle_wa_Itsumo_Hare_nochi_Guu_Final,"[""Please let me introduce Guu; Guu is a creature of (probably) female gender, possibly of the human species and is perhaps around the age of ten. She is the single most disturbing character in any anime I have ever seen. I kid you not, she is stranger than the entire cast of Baccano combined. It is quite interesting to see how an entire series become worth watching for a single character, though I lie, for Guu to work Hare must exist. They are complete opposites of eachother, Hare being the responsible, level headed, over thinking nice guy while Guu is possibly the devil personified, a...creature only true to her own self, doing things randomly and more often than not for her own saddistic pleasure. In many ways she resembles a cat. Cats are not really very nice animals, they don't really care about you as opposed to dogs (which I guess is an animal as good as any other to describe Hare) who are loyal to the brink of the other side of being stupid (which means they passed stupid a long time ago and are now in the twilight zone on the other side of stupidity, many of you must know what it looks like).As I have blown Guu's horn for a while now, I shall continue to do so, she is boss. I kid you not, you will like her and because of that you will like this series even though the events that take place in this anime and the two before are often parodies of clichés but become clichés themselves which is pretty much a hit and/or miss thing for the viewers, some things are funny others are not.Jungle wa Itsumo Hare nochi Guu FINAL is the third increment of the Hare + Guu collection, it is also the best animated one of the three, perhaps KyoAni's involvement had something to do with that, I personally hope KyoAni were used as slaves for various lecherous acitivities during the making of this anime, but chanes are they were just doing key animation (damn) but despite KyoAni's many, many, many flaws, they can infact draw and animate.The opening for this third increment is not as good as the two beforehand, however the ending theme for Final is simply the best and should be enjoyed after each and every episode.Thank you for reasing this, I don't really care for opinions unless you agree with me. creature only true to her own self, doing things randomly and more often than not for her own saddistic pleasure.

The simplistic, iconic animation style and anime cliches are subverted by the sharp insights into how shallow stereotypes can be.This is a comedy show with a very painful and peaceful twist.  This is the black comedy of a writer who is alienated and shocked by the inhumanity of everyday hypocrisy, but who nonetheless remains calm and sane and socially acceptable.For a contrast, check out &quot;Welcome to the N.H.K.&quot; which is equally existential and dark but a lot less mentally...balanced. balanced.']"
Jigoku Shoujo Mitsuganae,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3713/Jigoku_Shoujo_Mitsuganae,"['Ah... the final installment of Jigoku Shoujo.  Sadly, all good things come to an end, but some ends are uglier than others.*If you haven\'t seen Futakomori (season two), stop reading now and watch that first.  If you haven\'t seen Jigoku Shoujo (season one), why are you even here?Mitsuganae is like a monkey on a unicycle:  At the beginning, it looks cool and interesting--until you realize it doesn\'t make much sense (plot holes and discontinuity issues).  But then, the monkey starts throwing its poop at you.  Then (starting at episode 13), it starts using its tail to try to clean the...poop off your face.  Finally (starting at episode 20 or so), the monkey takes you out to a 5-star restaurant to apologize.  It gets better and better until you finish off with an amazing dessert.If that analogy didn\'t make sense to you, try this simpler one:  It\'s like Obama\'s bailout, except it actually works.So I\'m gonna mix things up and only talk about the first 12 episodes; I\'ll just call them ""The 12"" for simplicity\'s sake.  ***BE WARNED:  This is a wall of text, but it\'s a very important wall of text.***  To put it bluntly:  They are terrible.  The characters are SO retarded they seem to be participating in some unspoken contest to see who can collect the most drool in a bucket.  I think they all played together in the same idiot ball pit as kids.  ""The 12"" has the most instances of facepalm-tastic plot-induced stupidity I\'ve ever witnessed.  And that\'s saying a LOT.  People seem to find the most retarded reasons imaginable to send someone to Hell.  This isn\'t aided at all by the fact that characters regularly make the absolute dumbest decisions imaginable in any given situation, and tiny communication failures seem to have catastrophic consequences.  There are times when it\'s impossible to tell who of the two at conflict is actually worse; both seem they could be worthy of going to Hell.  There\'s a scene that gets repeated over and over again (that I won\'t spoil) that reminds me of the sequence from Darker Than Black: Gemini of the Meteor (in concept, execution, and repetitive, redundant usage) where Suo\'s gun appears from her necklace.  Well, if you\'ve seen that, make it like 8 times longer, 10 times more disturbing, and a hundredth as meaningful, and you have what I\'m talking about.  In episode 12, when a target is being tormented, the scene is done entirely with real-life paper cutouts.  I felt like I got trolled.  Also in said episode are not one, but TWO nose bleads (you know what I\'m talking about).  The torture sequences are now nothing more than some ball-tripping sequence; nothing worse than some pothead would see.  They are absolute jokes, and any suffering the victim seems to be going through is contrived BS.  Most people would probably just be laughing and/or confused.Episode 1 is important only for setting the stage.  The rest of ""The 12"" are complete shit and I HIGHLY recommend you skip them.  You\'ll be saving yourself time and, if you liked seasons one and two, tears.  You won\'t miss anything at all.  The only good parts are the occasional comical narcisstic moments from Ren and Wanyuudo.  Episode 13 is where things actually start getting interesting.  I swear they had some mentally unstable director during ""The 12""; the series would be so much better if they just didn\'t exist.-------------------------------Now that that\'s over with, let\'s talk about the REST of the series, where things start to actually get good.  (This portion IGNORES ""The 12."")Story: 9.  Being forced to believe WITHOUT EXPLANATION that Ai is back to continue during her job, even after the events at the end of Futakomori, is pretty hard.  But once you get over that, it\'s actually really interesting--although again, it isn\'t majorly developed until the end (the last 7 episodes this time).  During these 7, it slowly escalates until it crescendos in an explosive conclusion, and it\'s INSANELY entertaining.Art: 9.  Mitsuganae improves upon the previous two installments yet again with quite crisp, clear, and fresh-looking visuals.  But some scenes--which happened to coincide with critical plot development--were simply breath-taking.  Motions are animated pretty well, bar a few exceptions.Sound: 8.  Still a great OST, just as before: some classic oldies, some remakes, and lots of good new stuff.  However, the OP and ED tracks are pretty mediocre comparatively speeking.  Voice acting is still good as always.Character: 8.  I really like Yuzuki and her back story, but at some points, she seems to function solely as a moe-blob (just tilting her head and making soft moe noises, like ""eh?"").  Some of the characters are pretty stupid sometimes.  Pretty good character design overall, even though some of them look like familiar faces from the previous two seasons.  We also get Yamawaro\'s back story (the newbie in Ai\'s gang).Enjoyment: 9.  Most of my enjoyment stemmed from the plot and character (Yuzuki and Ai) development this time.  I was disappointed by the lack of torture sequences of people being sent to Hell, but sometimes, it was okay, because the person being sent sometimes didn\'t deserve it at all.  (I think this was why.)  I was disappointed at the inclusion of some unnecessary Yuri fan service scenes.Overall: 8.  See below.-------------------------------""The 12"" made it automatically lose a point.  It should\'ve taken off more, but the final 7 episodes are REALLY f***in\' good.  (Is my bailout analogy starting to make sense now?)  Basically, they try to fix the shit you\'d been forced to eat so far at the end.This series seriously had the potential to be a 10.  Easy.  It could\'ve easily topped the last two seasons.  But it was severly hampered by ""The 12,"" major plotholes (that could\'ve at least been hand waved with some explanation), and... well, lack of explanation--especially of plot-critical points.All in all:  If you liked the first two seasons, I recommend this BUT, skip episodes 2-12.

Once again someone tries to make a stand against the jigoku tsuushin, similarly to what has happened in the first season of the series. While new characters are introduced stories about...their past are told to eplain their bonds with Ai, this has already been ecountered in Futakomori.There is however something fresh about the series, the element of possesion. It is not only an interesting concept, but it plays a vital role in the story throughout the season and builds up the tension until the very last episode.Unfortunately, what seems to be a great material has it's downside. Some of the grudges people hold against each other are simply speaking too typical and therefore boring. While watching some episodes I actually had the feeling that they were nothing more than mere fillers, which had to be squeezed in so that the series would be 26 episodes long.Art-wise, we get the same old esthetic and mysterious animation as before, which perfectly fits with the nature of the show as well as the score playing along. In one episode though we get even more than that. While watching the finale one might say that the creators have implemented an inexplicably eccentric idea into the show. The effect is awkward, but it gives you something new to look at therefore adding value to the experience.What I found the most pleasing aspect of season three is the sound. Although when it comes to opening themes I preffered SnoW, the music in Mitsuganae is outstanding! It fits the feelings which play a crucial part of the show more than ever before. Some of the themes are actually worth listening to even without the video and voice play.The newly introduced chracters are great, they are intresting and as a viewer I was actually interested what was going on in their minds while watching the series. I was pleased to see how the bond between Ai and her companions thightens. The single-episode chracters were pretty well designed as well, some of them were pitiful, others scary. Several however were completely forgettable and tasteless like a bad meal.On one hand, Mitsuganae combined all the best ideas of the first two seasons. On the other, some of the typical strictly grudge based episodes were not as entertaining as in the past.Mitsuganae is a must watch for every fan of Emma Ai.

If you loved futakomori, don't watch this one. It would be very dissapointing, referring to the plot and the story of course. The cases are not that intriguing, relevant and amusing this time around. And the main plot is just not as good as the one in its prequel. But still, the sound and art is great. And you still get to see the lovely enma ai. Try watching it if you want to see enma ai that badly. But do not even try if you don't want to keep comparing it to it's past seasons. "", ""Story:Basically the frame of each episode is the same as season 1 and 2 *people sending other people to hell*, but the new twist of Ai being reborn with Yuzuki as the medium is very interesting. It get's interesting with every episode because it unfolds the deeper story of Yuzuki's involvement with Ai.Art:Effects are basically the same as 1 and 2 but I love Ai's new kimono. The effects of it is really great. Opening and closing vids are amazingly colorful.Sound:Timing and choice of sound effects add the eerie effect at key points of the story. Making you anticipate something coming.Character:Though old characters retained their...personalities, they have matured more, especially Ai, and how she depicts herself. Kikuri, have had a major change of personality, she is no longer the manifestation of the Lord of Hell, with a body borrowed from a toy *based on episodes watched*. Kikuri, now has a CHILDISH character. Though for me, with 3 episodes to go. Kikuri's personality is still bound for change. A new addition to Ai's disciples is Yamawaro who's origin is hidden from the start, though it is shown that he is very submissive to the very annoying Kikuri.Yuzuki, the girl whom Ai was reborn is a character who's the center of Mitsuganae, why and how is she deeply involved with Jigoku Shoujo and the Jigoku Tsushiin is what you have to watch for in Mitsuganae.Enjoyment:Very enjoyable, though some episodes are plain and boring. You can always get enjoyment from the very annoying Kikuri *why I keep saying Kikuri is annoying is what you have to find out for yourself :)*.Overall it gets a rating of 8.6, I would definitely recommend that you watch this. personalities, they have matured more, especially Ai, and how she depicts herself.

I just didn't feel like it, and it seemed worse than the other 2.You can probably get bored of it, after all it is really similar to what we have seen so far. The last episodes were pretty good though.A- for fans, and probably an C+/B for other people watching it.Worth watching. Overall: 8/10------------------------------Story (6/10):This is surely the worst season of the 3. The story was not BAD, but it was rather boring because you mostly...got more of the same: People make bad stuff, People get frustrated about it, People get sent to hell. I think I could make it a 7, if the anime was 13 episodes long, but 26 was just too much. The reasons to sent people to hell were also really plain, and you mostly knew who would send who after watching 2/3 minutes of each episode (Except for some rare occasions).Art (8/10):I guess I like JS' art a bit, but some times I get the feeling that some characters look retarded. About the backgrounds and so on, I have nothing to point out; they were good. The production quality was good in my opinion, and if you watched one of the other season, you already know what to expect.Sound (9/10):The biggest score I gave to JS3 was in the sound department, because I simply love it. It fits the series, and what is happening. You never feel like the music is in the wrong place. The OP was really good in my opinion, and the ED, even though it wasn't one that I like really much, was good for the series it was in.Character (7/10):You already know almost every one that appears in this series from the last 2 seasons, and there was not much of a improvement over what we knew before. Enma Ai was great once again, and her servants remain the same they were before. The characters we were introduced to were bland, and some of the older characters also get some new personalities. You'll understand once you see them.Enjoyment (7/10):As I already stated before, the series was really boring and repetitive, so for the most time I wasn't really interested in it. I mostly kept on watching because of two things:1st: I try to never, EVER, drop an anime unless I really hate it. Some of my favorite animes were almost dropped, so I don't drop anything anymore [Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni...]2nd: The other 2 seasons left most of the plot developments to the 2nd half, so I was waiting for them to appear. It took a little more time than I expected though....Anyway, I'm glad I did keep on watching it, because the ending was quite good. But it wasn't always that interesting thanks to bad reasons to send people to hell, and a lack of plot (most of the time at least). If you loved the other 2 seasons though, or if you just like seeing people go to hell and/or the bad of society, you can probably make this a 8 or a 9.Overall (8/10):As said in the Quick Review, this was probably the worst of the 3 seasons. It wasn't as good (plot-wise) as Jigoku Shoujo Futakomori, and if feels boring compared to the 1st season. Also, most of the time, people were sent to hell for 'no reason'.

WATDAHELL. it\'s not his fault you know -swt-Anywho,The series is really worth watching in my opinion, because it continues on the story of Enma Ai.I also read one of the reviews and that reviewer typed that you shouldn\'t watch episodes 2-12 because it\'s a complete waste of time. But YOU SHOULD REALLY WATCH IT BECAUSE it really is worth the wait. Like I did.  It wasn\'t as bad except for Episode 4. Though in episodes 1-14, it wasreally painful for me to watch Enma Ai coming out of Yuzuki, that must\'ve hurt.* mwatchepisode 25I SWEAR. THIS EPISODE MADE ME CRY LIKE AN EPISODE FROM CLANNAD AFTER STORY. Like WOAH. And this is really the episode that would make you remember the 3rd & Final season of Jigoku Shoujo.So thank you people ( if you\'ll ever read this ) and to the creators of JIGOKU SHOUJO. without you, I would\'ve never watched this anime ( well duhhh that\'s why they made it for people to watch it )I LOVE JIGOKU SHOUJO & I HOPE YOU\'LL LOVE IT TOO. :) -SPOILER ALERT-EPISODE 4 = that boy sent his ""hero"" to hell because he wasn\'t able to live up to the ""hero"" title.

Now, I never really brought myself to see the sequels to it until this year, so I had no clue of how it was altogether. Now that I have done so, I can come to a final critic about the series in general, but I\'m not someone that does anime reviews, at all. However, this season was so ""special"" I just had to give it such...a privilege.Both sequels have a subtitle instead of simply calling it Hell Girl 2 and 3, those being “Two Mirros” and “Three Vessels”…. You know, I just noticed it seems they purposely chose the number of items in the subtitle purposely based on it’s season. What would they call the fourth season if it was ever conceived, four seals? Anyways, the season that I’ll focus on reviewing is the latest, “Jigoku Shoujo Mitsuganae” or 3 Vessels.If you know Hell Girl well, then you’ll notice there’s not a clear main point, there are plenty of cases but they rarely ever connect, the closest you’ll get to a plot point is the beginning with this new girl whose name I can’t remember, but we’ll get into the characters later. It all stars with the closest thing to an antagonist in the previous season, Kikuri, calling Ai Enma assistants to reunite as “she’s returning” as she puts it. You see (spoiler alerts) Ai was killed in the end of the previous season, something that made for a pretty good (although sad) conclusion to the series, which already makes a sequel pretty pointless, but it seems we still got it regardless. Ai lost her body, but no her soul, so while obtaining a new one, she requires to possess this girl. The way she enters in her is…..suggestive, to say the least. If there was something I respected about this show, was the absolute lack of pointless fanservice scenes and even of huge breasts girls, but this was absolutely destroyed in one of the first scenes were this new random girl and Ai kiss naked in some kind of nether world lake. Is that really necessary? There’s so many ways to show how a spirit could possess a body this feels the most retarded I have ever seen or heard, it just looks as an attempt to attract desperate teenagers to watch something the might find “hot”. The worst part it seems the producers really like this scene and overuses it both in flashbacks and the actual opening of the show, ugh…If that isn’t enough, every time someone calls the hell girl to fulfill her purpose and send someone to hell there’s a incredibly disgusting scene showing how this girl turns into Ai. I seriously have no words to describe how awful it is, the only way to understand how terrible it is would be watching it, but not doing so would be doing yourself a great favor. All of this continues until Ai recovers an actual body and the new girl takes a role similar to the one of the Shibatas in season 1 trying to stop others from using the Jigoku Tsuushin. She fails so miserably at this task that it isn’t funny, it seems she barely attempts communicating with the persons contacting Ai and ends up further motivating them to use it or talk to them about the site.Onto the actual cases, most of them are pretty damn bad. I often called the second season cases to be a bit rushed, by the time the persons used to call hell girl they ended up using the doll slightly after this event, whereas in the first season they called her right from the start and further developed the problem and why they decide to use it. Here there’s a even worse problem, the cases are even more rushed as nearly everyone pulls the string from the very moment they get the doll on their hands. If that’s not enough, the reasons for using this last resort is completely retarded 90% of the times. There’s rarely a good reason to access such a desperate weapon, most of the times it merely involves stupidity or minor jealousy, is it really worth going to hell just because your boyfriend couldn’t stand against a thief? Or because your brother doesn’t want to marry you (yes you heard right)? The development is so stupid it makes my brain suffer due to the absolute lack of logic. This drives to another problem, the executions before being sent to hell, they mostly feel….silly. There’s rarely any presentation of cruelty or revenge in every death, it’s almost as the henchmen decided to make it this way to just have some fun. With all that said, the story is terrible and it barely tries to add any variety to Hell Girl, repeating the same basic formula for cases starts feeling stale after two seasons, you know.Let’s move onto the characters now, everyone from the Futakomori hell girl crew makes a return and adds a new face, a young kid called Yamawaro. One of the absolute reasons that make me hate this season so much is how they massively butchered everyone that returned. Not only they no longer feel mysterious at all, but it feels as if they merely added them for comedy purposes, who the hell would laugh in a series were atrocities such as rape, animal violence, child abuse and human discrimination are present?The only character that this was acceptable with was Kikuri as she was a brand new addition and served as a nice plot twist at the end of Futakomori, and even then this felt out of place plenty of times during the mentioned season. Ai has also been greatly butchered, between her new tendencies to appear in suggestive yuri scenes and wearing new fashions such as a soccer uniform, I can no longer take her seriously. Most of her dialogues were also reduced and feel a bit weak, forget about the imposing girl that had the power to send you to hell, she’s know a geek like many people here spending endless hours on her computer from the 70’s. But lets move onto the new character, Yamawaro. His personality is pretty generic, sure he’s gentle and loyal, but that’s about it. It’s later shown his back story, and it’s just….weird. Not good or bad, just weird and pretty forgettable if you ask me, unless you enjoy of disgusting science projects.So that’s pretty much everything about the Ai Enma and friends crew, all what’s left is the new girl that serves as the “victim” of this season and should cause conflict to the Jigoku Tsuushin. Now let me tell you this, if this was an attempt to create another Shibata, it failed, miserably. She’s plain as all hell, nothing in her personality feels unique and, in fact, she’s pretty undeveloped, and with all the episodes they could have used to do this, it’s inexcusable to leave the lead character to be as interesting as a cardboard box. She also feels pretty obnoxious due to her ideals of “sending to hell others is horrible” when she barely does anything to avoid this, let alone to understand why some people access to such a service. Her main hobbies include sleeping and taking baths at the worst moments possible, and that’s about everything I can say about her. She’s generic, boring and dull. In case anyone wonders how the characters involved in cases are, you’ll be better without knowing. They are all incredibly stupid and selfish beings for the most part that just want to get rid of things on the easy way or lack any sort of logical fundamentals.The music is…..forgettable, none of the new songs were memorable or fitting in my eyes, which is pretty damn disappointing considering I loved both of the previous seasons opening themes.The only thing I can praise about this season is the art style, it still holds the charm of the series, but it feels slightly worse due to the poor atmosphere presented at times.In the end, Jigoku Shoujo Mitsuganae is nothing but a disappointing piece of trash with no redeeming quality. It offers nothing new to the series, the cases are terrible, the characters are highly dislikeable, certain scenes are just plain unnecessary and disgusting to watch and it just feels like it drags on forever. I have no clue if this holds a good set of final episodes as season 2 did since I gave up on episode 23, but it’s impossible that could have happened. This has easily become one of my official least favorite anime of all time, right there alongside Neon Genesis Evangelion and Ikki Tousen. I’ll give Mitsuganae an abysmal 1/10, and just because I can’t go any lower in this site, otherwise, I’d consider using even negative digits. a privilege.Both sequels have a subtitle instead of simply calling it Hell Girl 2 and 3, those being “Two Mirros” and “Three Vessels”….

She has resurrected herself in a young girl, Yuzuki Mikage. This season's people who sent people to Hell, and people who get sent to Hell are very interesting. But pointless. Most people that get sent to Hell don't deserve to, in this season of Jigoku Shoujo. Most of the people who want to send a certain person to Hell is just jealous, or doesn't like how they do things. It's never for the right reasons. Except for Episode 5, whereas the person actually deserved to die.Story: Most of the people who want to send a certain person...to Hell is just jealous, or doesn't like how they do things.

She is energetic, but she is also quiet at times. She can be serious, and she is Yuzuki's best friend. The other characters, like Ren, are awesome, too.

As spectacular the first and second season were, the third fails to appeal to that level. Even though this season has its own appeals, its not THAT great!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------to elaborate:-STORYBasically, JS3 continues from the 2nd season. As the season starts  Ai Enma doesn't have her body, so she passes judgement through the body of a girl, yuzuki. as...the same People are going to hell in lots! and thats 2 for no particular reason. if your hate is enough, even the innocent go to hell. that's particulraly happening here!! Yuzuki is able to see people going to hell, and helpless when she finds out the reality.

Even the OST of the series is nice. the OP is good, but i prefer Snow's OP style as the have done in the previous series. the ending is also quite spooky.CHARACTERhere is the new parts. Ai Enma has a new member,Yamawaro  along with her three companions, Hone Onna, Wanyūdō, Ren and Kikuri.  Yuzuki's part is dull, but her life is full of twist-turns. she has a past quite similar to Ai and is always connceted to the hell corresspondence website or to the people using it . and what else, new characters and new short stories in every episode.

Mitsuganae retains the elements you would find in the first two seasons of Hell Girl where a victim browses the Hell Correspondence site to send their tormentor to hell, thinks over the decision and sends said tormentor to hell when they reach a breaking point. The elements of flawed and sympathetic elements found between the victim and tormentor of each episode are retained from the second season as well. Anyone expecting a change from the same repetitious developments found in Hell Girl's past two seasons...will be disappointed to know that the series leaves them intact. This season introduces a new companion for Ai's group in the form of Yamawaro, whose character gets his focus in a later episode of the series.Mitsuganae also creates a more ongoing story focus between Ai and new character Yuzuki when Ai possesses the body of the middle school girl to resume her duties as Hell Girl. Yuzuki finds herself pushed to her breaking point throughout this season as she gains a role somewhat similar to the Shibatas from season one which she tries and fails to prevent anyone from making use of the services of Hell Correspondence, as well as developing a supernatural connection to Ai. Hints are dropped throughout the season that Yuzuki's life is not as it seems as Ai exposes her more to the harsh realities of man's most selfish traits.It does become apparent at points that Hell Girl is starting to run out of fresh ideas for this season of the series, particularly with the role of Yuzuki's character and what we eventually learn of her past. Compared to the past two seasons, the tragic dilemma with Yuzuki connecting her to Ai is poorly contrived and skewers into melodramatic territory compared to the Shibatas from season one and Takuma from season two. In addition, a number of the punishments that Ai and her companions inflict upon tormentors before sending them to hell were a bit on the silly and ridiculous side, not consistent with the horrific images they left said tormentors from earlier seasons. It is these major reasons that make me rate Hell Girl's third season at a lower rating compared to the last season.Hell Girl Mitsuganae retains the colorful and detailed visuals found throughout the past two seasons with animated highlights shown through a number of the punishments Ai's companions are involved with and a new one in the form of Yuzuki's transformation into Ai while she is possessed. Much like the past two seasons, there are reused animation frames apparent during these scenes as a result of said repetitious developments. Some of the show's musical tracks from the prior two seasons are retained for this season, though the OP and ED musical choices do well at complementing the tense and mellow moods respectively found throughout the series.While Hell Girl Mitsuganae does introduce a couple new characters connected to Ai, this season of the series doesn't really offer up much new from what the prior two seasons provided to me and carries some significant flaws compared to the second season. Still if you have pressed on with Hell Girl for this long and are still interested in continuing the franchise, this season is a decent look provided that you understand that it still offers up much of the same thing from the prior two seasons. will be disappointed to know that the series leaves them intact.

Still if you have pressed on with Hell Girl for this long and are still interested in continuing the franchise, this season is a decent look provided that you understand that it still offers up much of the same thing from the prior two seasons."", ""I've seen the 1st and 2nd seasons of Jigoku Shoujo, so upon learning that there was a 3rd, I immediately made sure that I get a copy...

"", 'This is a review talking about all three seasons of Hell Girl. (There are some spoilers of the first two seasons and the main points of what this season has. And this is mixed with my opinion)If you want to avoid spoilers, read the conclusion which gives you an advice.This is my first time (and probably only time) writing a review.First season is where the story started with some intriguing/interesting stories (As a bonus, there were 2 supernatural episodes) about revenge, then the Shibata’s make an entrance and the story will make you hooked to know what will happen. It introduced the Shibatas’ and...Enma Ai’s backstories.Second season is where it continues, again with some (but few that had quality) interesting episodic stories of revenge. This time, there wasn’t an opposite side who tried to stop Enma unfortunately, but it introduced her companions’ backstories (2 episodes hinting at them and 3 where they actually tell you about them). This season continues until one of the characters (involved in the episodic stories) starts getting the after-effects of Enma’s actions which eventually led Enma into reacting to the situation. This was followed by a conclusion to Enma’s story. Not a great ending but still good nonetheless, with a scene or two as a cliffhanger.This is it. This is where you should stop. If there was something added to Hell Girl, it should be a movie, OVAs or a “Director’s Cut” version of the last episode to omit the cliffhangers to make it look like a proper conclusion. If there was any sequel, one would like to know who’s the Grandma? Will we see her? What did she say to Shibata that one time? Will we see that psychic guy from the 1st season? Will the spider stop from creating another Hell Girl? Did the Shibatas’ had a happy ending? Will Enma’s companions stay free?Heck. I can ignore all these questions and be content with that ending. But guess what? Here comes the 3rd season which answers to all of those questions by a ‘No!’Third season has, like, only 3 episodic stories that made me interested excluding the plot/main character related episodes (Yes, three. I counted them and this is just me). Oh you want to know about the main story? There was none, of course! This season introduced 2 new main characters, and, all it did was this:>\tIntroduce the backstory of the one of the new MCs (Yamawaro). (+)>\tTells you the situation of one of the returning MCs (Tsugumi), and it was (imo) a bad ending. (Not to the point of death or being sent to hell) (-)All the information about their status was already implied in the last season (Tsugumi being alone which only means one thing), so nothing new apart from ruining her good ending from the first season. (-)>\tIntroduce the backstory of the second new character (Yuzuki) (+) and from here, it led to the ending that ruins Enma’s conclusion from the last season. (-)… And, that’s it.I don’t know what was the point of this season. Maybe they were planning on making another sequel which was cancelled? Even if it was cancelled. Couldn’t they release something (like I said before) to remove the bridge toward the 3rd season from the 2nd season’s last episode? Anyway, I’ll just pretend that this season doesn’t exist.Conclusion: Hell Girl is a great series. I recommend watching the first 2 seasons and you have your complete story. You didn’t have enough of Hell Girl, maybe? It’s your choice, just lower your expectations and consider this season as a non-canon extra. Enma Ai’s backstories.Second season is where it continues, again with some (but few that had quality) interesting episodic stories of revenge.

While the first season wasn\'t perfect by a long shot and many critics had lots of issues with it, Mitsuganae (the third season) is a disaster compared to it.  With season 2 being the best.The problem is that the third season has the same problems as the first, except this time it\'s obvious the writers ran out of ideas.  The repetitive plot.../ revenge structure with an episodic nature comes to dominate mitsuganae once again with a ""main plot"" that is just so poorly written into the vast 26 episodes that the plot comes out nonsensical.Most of the 26 episodes of the show is filled with filler material.  There are maybe 6 episodes total that have anything to do with the main plot and the rest can be skipped.  The \'new plot\' they came up with for season 3 is just hackneyed.  The plot is basically hell girl possesses human girl and hell girl has to save the girl she possesses.  The problem here is that hell girls finale in season 2 was having hell girl be released from her role as hell girl and finally getting to die.  So the plot begins with a deus ex machina, which is just amateur level writing.  They never came up with a believable reason for why she is back.The producers also went and made huge radical changes to the characters and cast so it throws off the FEEL of the characters they established in the hell girl universe.The plot involving possession is just so forced and convoluted that it turns off the long time fan.  Each episode of mitsuganae feels rushed and it feels rushed because the characters and their motives were not written well at all.   The main problem with mitsuganae is the characters in each episode take revenge for the dumbest and most unbelievable reasons.   Hell girl and mitsuganae relies on characters in each episode beside the main cast never appearing again.   So the fact that the characters are not believable goes a long way to making the whole show a tired excercise of you trying to tolerate its badness to find the good episodes that make any kind of sense instead of wasting your time.If you\'re a hell girl fan watch season 1 and 2 and skip 3 in order for you to not end up with a bitter aftertaste in your mouth. / revenge structure with an episodic nature comes to dominate mitsuganae once again with a ""main plot"" that is just so poorly written into the vast 26 episodes that the plot comes out nonsensical.Most of the 26 episodes of the show is filled with filler material.

I’ll admit that Hell Girl is not for everyone, what not with how repetitive a good chunk of the episodes is. Going into season three, I wasn’t expecting anything different from the first two seasons: each episode, someone gets sent to hell and the series has a bit of plot progression or character development. We saw this a lot more during season two with the principle cast being given proper histories as opposed to just being Ai’s companions. It was something that I was hoping to see more of this...season since, as I mentioned, Hell Girl is VERY episodic.So, what makes Hell Girl: Three Vessels (or Jigoku Shoujo Mitsuganae) so unique? Well, unlike the past two seasons which I thought were perfectly decent series, Three Vessels manages to be simultaneously one of the worst and best anime I’ve ever seen. There truly isn’t any anime that I’ve seen in recent memory that truly ascribe to the feeling that I felt while watching this. But wait, how can an anime be both one of the worst and one of the best?Well, to put it bluntly, the first half of this season is abjectly terrible. First and foremost, Ai is back without any explanation. Don’t get me wrong, I really enjoy Ai’s character, but there is no effort to justify or explain how she returned after what happened to her at the end of season two. As for other non-principle characters in the first twelve episodes? Think of some of the dumbest and most terrible writing you’ve seen in anime and know that it doesn’t even come close to the idiocy that you see here. Back in the good ol’ days of seasons one and two, you had people being sent to Hell for murder, attempted rape, blackmail, abuse, slander, neglect, you name it. Rarely was there an instance of someone being sent to hell who didn’t deserve it. The series also did a decent job at showing how conflicted people (generally) were about condemning themselves to eternal damnation.Now do you remember the three or so episodes of Two Mirrors where the citizens of Lovely Hills were sending other to Hell for incredibly trite and dumbass reasons? Well, that is almost exclusively what you find in Three Vessels.Seriously, just to give you an idea, let’s look at some of the completely justified and 100% sound reasons people were sent to Hell in this season.Ep 1: For telling students to behave in class.Ep 3: For telling someone they can’t sing.Ep 4: ?????????Ep 5: For lying to her grandmother.Ep 6: For liking a teacher.Ep 7: For being helpful.Ep 9: For existing (Yes, really).Ep 10: For selling clothes.Ep 11: For writing a book; also, returning a book.Ep 12: For saving someone from suicide.What? Did you think that the abusive mother or cheating boyfriend would be the targets of retribution? Ha! What are you? A normal, rational person?So many of these plot contrivances in the first half of this season were caused by one of my biggest pet peeves in storytelling which is poor communication. More than half of the conflicts in these episodes could have been solved if people simply TALKED to each other. Even in episode 8, which I left out (because the woman in question deliberately poisons a dog), the ‘villain’ could have avoided her fate if she reasonably explained the problems she was having with her neighbor. But she doesn’t and pays the price for it.I’d also like to point out that there is a scene that is repeated every episode and it takes up a FULL MINUTE of the run time. It was artistic and interesting if not disturbing in the first episode and was needless every episode afterward.All that being said, the series becomes much more tolerable from episode thirteen onward. Not to say that there still aren’t stupid characters who make mind-numbingly delusional choices (looking at you Episode 18), but the justifications become a lot more in line with previous seasons and with realistic, emotional reactions.After Episode 19, the season becomes truly incredible. Without spoiling anything, all I can say is that there is a very unexpected plot twist that you will not pick up on unless you give the show your complete and undivided attention. In terms of Western media, the twist is somewhat cliché, but in the context of the anime, it was something that I legitimately did not see coming. It can be a tad melodramatic at times, but considering the circumstances of these episodes, I’m willing to overlook it. Characters are fleshed out and believable for what is an otherwise unrealistic anime.The art, sound and animation of this series are also pretty good. Nothing insanely spectacular or memorable, but consistent to what we’ve seen so far. It’s because of this consistency that I’m mad that Three Vessels even bothered with the poor writing quality of the first twelve episodes. Even simply changing the motives or personalities of a few people could have drastically altered how I viewed this show. But instead, I got stuck with this slog of dumb choices and idiotic characters.I do recommend that in watching this series that you skip episodes 2-12 and possibly 18. They are not necessary in advancing the plot in any meaningful sense. But if you choose to watch it and stick it out, I guarantee that you will be rewarded with a truly outstanding conclusion to this arc.The first half of this season was a 3, but the last half was a 9, so I'll be generous and average out my scores since it's wholly representative of what I thought about this season. season since, as I mentioned, Hell Girl is VERY episodic.So, what makes Hell Girl: Three Vessels (or Jigoku Shoujo Mitsuganae) so unique?

Maybe this is the sort of, wait a day after watching then see if you want to write a review sort of situation? Eh, screw it. If you enjoy the main focus of the story, the 'calling upon Hell Girl and watching her banish people' no matter how trivial or silly some of the reasons become, then you will still like this. However, if that isn't all you are looking for, then you will be disappointed. I know I was, despite wanting to like...it.Maybe we should start with what was good? First of all, the sound and the art were good. The visuals, sound effects, and music, were really quite nice and add something special to this show. When it comes to the 'the person is going to hell, here is the pseudo-torture scene' sections, they got a bit lazy. However, they also recycled the 'transformation' scene just like they did with the 'flying flaming carriage' scene in the first two series. That got kinda tiresome. The music was nice, but there was little to no variation to it, and if you -actually- listened to it long enough, it got boring.The characters are all still as you remembered them, with an extra side character added to Ai's cast of servants. Yamawaro gets a single episode to flesh out his backstory, like the others, but gets little to no other sources of exposure like Ren, Hone Onna, and Wanyuudo did in the other series, and do in this one, acting as her eyes and ears. He is mostly just there to support the most annoying character in the entire world, Kikuri. Why they added her in I do not know. The show would be vastly improved if she was gone. Seriously, we know who she is now, we found out in the second season, why is she back? There is no reason for her to be back.Anyways, lets get to what I wanted to talk about, and what really annoyed me: the story. If you are reading this without watching the series first, just know that it is bad, and move on. It is bad. That is it, its bad.*Warning, Spoilers*There is a glaring plot hole, in the very first episode. After the last series Ai is no longer the Hell Girl, she became human, then died. So, why is she back? It is never actually explained. You can make a few guesses. She is back because she hasn't truly left her hatred behind, and so cannot go to heaven or hell? She is back because the master of Hell has pulled her back into doing her old job? She is back because she has to pick a successor? She is back because the plot gods demanded so for a third season? All I know is that this annoyed me throughout the series.In the end it seems it is because she has to pick a successor? Maybe? If you take a leap of faith and make that assumption, because they still don't explain it to you. But even if that is the case, why? Why does -she- have to? That isn't really explained either. Can't the master of Hell just pick a new Hell Girl like he picked Ai? Why couldn't he have shown Yuzuki the truth about her life, and created a new Hell Girl? Seriously, that is what Ai did and it worked, but it took 26 episodes. The first 12 of which have nothing to do with the plot at all. Maybe they are there so that you start feeling for Yuzuki, and her friend Akie, you know, drive the character development along, but that fails. She does exactly what Hajime and Tsugumi do in the first season, which is fail at trying to prevent everything from happening, and even at times, helping it to happen!OH, and speaking of useless returning characters, guess who is back? Tsugumi. Yeah, it was neat seeing her in the second season for that short amount of time, a brief cameo appearance, but now she is back as a character (for the latter half of the series) and does absolutely nothing. Nothing. In fact, she is almost more annoying than Kikuri because she does about as much, and isn't a cute loli anymore. She has two important scenes, the first is at the festival at the portal/gateway, the second is explaining to Yuzuki that her life is a lie. Both scenes could have been done by other characters, easily. Especially the latter example, because Ai goes and explains it to her anyways, revealing her past.Turns out Yuzuki's life is a lie, and she is a ghost. Nice, a Sixth Sense move. Somehow though she is living and participating in human society. Her friend Akie comes over, but doesn't realize the building is derelict? Her teachers don't realize that there is no paperwork on her, because she died a decade ago? Somehow she lives the normal life of a middle-schooler without anyone around her noticing? This isn't explained very well. Just that everything has been 'an illusion'. But then why does she care about Akie? Why does Akie become her companion? It all just -almost- makes sense, and -almost- works, but it just doesn't get there. That is what got me so upset. I watched 26 episodes waiting for it to get better, after the first 12 it does get better, yay! Validation! But wait, then it starts to go downhill. Then it ends like it does: like a lukewarm beverage on a hot day. Not satisfying in the least.I hope you enjoyed my angry inane ramblings that I have written at 3:30 in the morning. it.Maybe we should start with what was good?

It all just -almost- makes sense, and -almost- works, but it just doesn't get there. That is what got me so upset. I watched 26 episodes waiting for it to get better, after the first 12 it does get better, yay! Validation! But wait, then it starts to go downhill.

It still deals with people being sent to hell, but Ai Enma got resurrected to Yuzuki's body. One thing I didn't like about the series is that the main plot starts again late in the series. They didn't also explain how did Ai came back... But I still enjoyed it especially in terms of the OST's... (The ones being played when Ai is about to send a person to hell)... "", 'But of course, as the last season is so much as a one hell of a cliffhanger, it is given that we want to see what really happened.There’s a long review coming…………About the STORYJust when we thought the team was disbanded with the disappearance of our beloved “OJOU”, the team is gathered again for more revenge than ever. This time the drama is tripled and much theatrical than ever and when I say much theatrical as in way much theatrical compared to the previous ones. It even looks like they are actually enjoying it when it is more theatrical. And as weird as it seems,...it is even funnier. Things are more complicated and twisted but so much more exciting when Enma Ai is seemingly retiring and actually has a replacement already. But of course, let’s not forget the revenge of the “CLIENTS” which are the most exciting part of this amazing series. It is a lot more anticipating, twisted, complicated, and exciting. Every story genuinely leveled up from the previous seasons. It’s a little bit different now as literally almost all the “REQUESTS” are happening in one place or at least around the one with the connection to Enma Ai. That is why the main characters are in one place all the time which never happened before.About the CHARACTERSI am really dying to know what happened to the companions of Enma Ai after what transpired in the last season and to my delight they are living normal lives. Enma Ai’s family gets even bigger with the arrival of another mysterious being that also joins in their very theatrical revenge. There are very mysterious recurring characters such as the nurse who we should all be familiar with and of course the most mysterious of all, the girl who have a connection with Enma Ai much like what the mysterious nurse had when she was younger. Both had very unfortunate and tragic fates. There characters are very much intriguing and interesting. The bad doers are a lot nastier and as always there are more twists to their characters. The “CLIENTS’” backgrounds are more interesting because of more complicated and twisted things so it is more anticipating. If in season two, Kikuri was a lot creepier, oddly enough, this time she serves as a comic relief in the series. I just love it whenever Ai says some amazing yet so harsh lines. There is so much reality in her words which is why it really becomes so cool.About ENMA AI/JIGOKU SHOUJOI think that Ai is still perfect for the role of Jigoku Shoujo because she knows very well that their work is neither a punishment nor justice. She doesn’t let any emotions cloud her judgment and put some crazy hypocrisy with their work. She knows that it is neither a noble nor a curse job. It just happens that it is their job, as simple as that. This is the very reason why I just love their group because they are not necessarily the best characters but at least they are not hypocrites that would put silver linings with what they do but still have pride about their work.About the ANIMATIONThe animation just keeps on getting better and better. There are a lot more artworks compared from the previous season particularly when Enma Ai and Yuzuki are separating during a revenge. They made sure to live up to the great animation of the previous ones. Oh! And let’s not forget the much anticipated change on Enma Ai’s beautiful KIMONO.For the last time, let me just say that this series is not about whether it is right or wrong to have revenge because in reality the world is not as simple as right and wrong. It is way more complicated than that more importantly when it comes to human beings which I strongly believe what the series amazingly had shown us. Like what Enma Ai would always say that REAL HELL is inside of every each of us. A crazy reality checked that every character in this franchise learned in the most painful way when they tried to stop the revenge. And Tsugumi explained it amazingly with so much truth and reality into it.Well, THAT’S A WRAP EVERYBODY. This concludes to the very tragic yet still so amazing journey about grudges and revenge of human beings. No one showcased the human behavior like this franchise did. I am more intrigue, interested, and eager to study the human behavior even more. As much as I am hoping and praying that this series will never ends, this season really gave such an epic closure for this brilliant series.

It wasn't enjoyable at all and I had to force myself to get to the good part, the climax build-up where the plot development sped up greatly and the pieces came together for the finale.While I...did like the first few episodes and the build-up leading to the satisfying climax, the episodes inbetween jumped between being interesting and pure garbage which severely lowered my thoughts about this season. did like the first few episodes and the build-up leading to the satisfying climax, the episodes inbetween jumped between being interesting and pure garbage which severely lowered my thoughts about this season."", '***This review contains spoilers for prequels of the series***So it is recommended to ones who finished 1st and 2nd seasonsThe third season of Jigoku Shoujo is still conceptually the same, keeping rather dark atmosphere with faint rays of hope glowing, and then fading. But this time it is getting really absurd, I mean it not in a bad way though it is hard to get the point, the situations pictured here are now even more absurd. Yeah, people tend to act irrationally, especially being filled with hate and wrath, and the consequence are not pleasant at all. But what for are we shown that? To...make us hate hell correspondence? Or to laugh at those [tragic] scenes?Story is still episodic, but now we again get a character who is opposing Enma Ai. Her name is Mikage Yuzuki and she is a little resembling Shibata Tsugumi. And the narration is shifted to the perspective of the new character. Rules are still the same, not changed from first season. We see Mikage Yuzuki attempting to meddle and change the situation for the better, but you probably guessed that it\'s futile.We have already been shown impressing stuff, like episode 23 of the first season where innocent girl is being sent to hell, where even usually emotionless Enma Ai is wavering. This episode really meant that Hell Girl is the thing that better not to be in this world. I wish they did more explanations and development of the story at that side, but this was cut with a short phrase ""it is not up to us to decide this"". In the end of second season we saw people in one town massively accessed Jigoku Tsuushin, which merely caused whole town\'s extinction. But now we get stories where people have very weird motivation of sending others to hell despite immense cost, going to hell after the death in afterlife. It really often made me think that people need not Jigoku Shoujo services, but a psychologist and/or psychiatrist. Because the root of the problem is within themselves and not in the outside world. So it is like they try solving every problem with it. In fact in previous seasons there also were such stories.The incongruity I still cannot understand, the idea that only people possessing strong hate can call Jigoku Shoujo, it must have eliminated above mentioned absurd cases, but why it did not? Possibly that it is based on person\'s initial hate, at the moment of getting straw doll. Often case is almost resolved without untying red thread and the hate seems to be gone, but there is still a bad ending [straw doll used].This time art is having just a minor changes, but I think they did too many repeating scenes, most events take place in one town so there is a limited amount of great view scenes. I don\'t mean that it is bad here, it is on the same level with previous seasons.Music is good and atmospheric, like the previous seasons, but just this time I didn\'t like OP and ED soundtrack enough not to skip it. Seiyuu are doing a great job.In the end you expect to see some philosophy of Jigoku Shoujo and Jigoku Tsuushin existence that everything here wasn\'t meaningless and vain, but disappointingly they throw some vague ideas. Though they do point positive sides of it\'s existence, but it doesn\'t sound solid, neither making you believe it.

Like, we\'re talking about the kind of inner turmoil that messes you up big time. The main deal is Enma Ai, this supernatural chick who\'s all about dishing out justice by ferrying souls to the afterlife. Only twist? She\'s gotta use this schoolgirl as her vessel \'cause she\'s body-less. Yeah, it gets pretty wild.Now, let\'s talk vibes. The music? Emotional rollercoaster, man. It sets this melancholic yet captivating mood that sticks with you. And those sound...effects? Top-notch. They really add to the whole eerie vibe the show\'s got going on.Visually, it\'s a feast for the eyes. Bright colors pop against muted backgrounds, and they\'re not afraid to throw some intense red in there to ramp up the tension. Seriously, it\'s like an art exhibit with every episode.But what really sets this season apart? The exploration of the human psyche. They\'re diving into some seriously murky waters here, blurring the lines between good and evil, and throwing in some seriously messed-up motivations. Keeps you guessing the whole time, and let me tell you, the climax? Totally catches you off guard.In short, if you\'re a fan of the first two seasons, you\'re gonna dig this one too. It\'s like the perfect wrap-up to the trilogy, leaving you satisfied but still craving more. effects? Top-notch.

Absolutely loved the first two seasons. While I was pretty reluctant to accept the fact that there is a new Hell Girl, I was also quite excited to see what would unravel.Guys, this was a major flop. If you had high hopes for this, just drop your expectations and watch this if you have time to kill.***SPOILER ALERT***This is my personal opinion, you don\'t have to agree with me:Yuzuki is incredibly naive, annoying and just hypocritical. She goes around telling people that accessing the Hell Correspondence isn\'t the...only way out yet she pushes for Azusa\'s Hell Sending. After seeing so many people wanting revenge, does she not even realize that these people were actually suffering? Also, she pushes for people NOT to pull the string because (in my point of view), that\'s what she thinks is right to HER. People are influenced by strong emotions so of course they\'ll want the fast way out when it comes to pain. Yuzuki also doesn\'t do her research on Hell and Hell Girl but just forces her way through everything - a routine for hundreds of years cannot be changed by a random Hell Girl ""reincarnate"".That\'s about it. Anyway, all I liked was the animation for Ai - her eyes are goddamn beautiful as always, and the flowers at the ending. only way out yet she pushes for Azusa\'s Hell Sending.

"", 'Hell Girl: Three Vessels is the most ambitious season of the series. The first season was very straightforward in introducing what Hell Girl is all about and the second expanded upon it while revealing more lore behind the characters. This season, in my opinion, has the best story so far. The previous two seasons started off with some filler episodes before getting to their main arcs. The entirety of Three Vessels is set on its plot from start to finish while still delivering great filler along the way. Well, mostly great filler with one or two stinkers along the way, which brings it down a...bit, but I still really enjoyed this season.Before I explain the story, I must warn that there is a major spoiler to the ending of Two Mirrors if you haven\'t completed it yet, so it\'s probably in your best interest to do so before proceeding.Wanyudo, Ichimokuren, and Hone Onna are all living regular lives after Ai Enma sacrificed her life to save Takuma at the end of the previous season. However, because the Hell Girl herself never truly dies, Ai\'s soul has returned now inhabiting inside a junior high school girl named Yuzuki Mikage due to having lost her body. Well, Ai can present herself to anybody requesting her services by having them meet her in the Realm of Eternal Twilight where she normally lives, but to move around in the real world and whenever it\'s time to send someone to Hell, she needs to take control of Yuzuki\'s body. Moving right along, Ai\'s return mean all of her companions are to come back together to accompany her in her work. Kikuri from Two Mirrors returns as well, now needing to possess a toy and she requires somebody to wind up the key on her backside in order for her to be able to move. Ai is also joined by a new companion named Yamawaro, who is mostly seen being a servant to Kikuri. He has an interesting backstory, which gets me every time I rewatch that episode.The filler episodes have once again taken a new twist on the formula. Two Mirrors had cases like the avenged character immediately dying after sending someone to Hell. In Three Vessels, the filler episodes mostly go on a trend where the ""villain"" characters are actually not bad people, and that was established right off the bat on the very first episode, where a teacher is disliked for recording students\' infractions on his notebook when he was actually pretending to be doing that just to scare them to have them improve their behavior. It is worth mentioning that to access the Hell Link, you just have to have a strong hatred towards somebody else. It is not based on whether or not someone really deserves to go to Hell. The last filler episode of the first season gave the audience this fact where some drug addict sent an innocent nurse to Hell. The second season had some instances where innocent people get sent, and in this season, this twist is utilized in full force. Okay, not every single episode does this, but these fillers are still very good at what they do.Ai Enma has become a lot more active in messing with the targeted people. Once again pointing to the first episode, she puts on a bee costume to sting a number 2 that was restraining the teacher during the torment segment. The Hell Girl in a bee costume... like it\'s so crazy to a whole new level... and I love it! As for her companions, in order for them to stay by her side, they work at Yuzuki\'s school. Well, that applies to Wanyudo, Ichimokuren, and Hone Onna since they resemble adults. Yamawaro is usually just taking care of Kikuri and occassionally Ai selects him to be the straw doll. While the original trio of companions are working at Yuzuki\'s school, they all seem to get along with the other students. It\'s so wholesome, I almost forget that this is a psychological anime.Since Ai has taken residence inside Yuzuki\'s body, Yuzuki is able to sense whenever someone wants to send somebody else to Hell, even after Ai recovers her body halfway through the season. In a similar fashion to the Shibatas in the first season, Yuzuki tries to stop people from pulling the red thread off of the straw dolls they receive, only to fail every single time. Towards the end, it\'s revealed the world Yuzuki was living in was just an illusion she created for herself because she already died years ago. Yuzuki\'s father was a bus driver, who died during work due to poorly implemented brakes, and the Government covered the truth up and framed him for taking out the passengers with him. If that wasn\'t bad enough, now the whole town despises his wife and child, because an elementary school girl would totally be into murder! This does sound utterly unrealistic, but people hating on an accused person\'s family is indeed a thing that can happen in real life. The hate was so bad, nobody is willing to socialize or help them with any troubles. Eventually, Yuzuki\'s mother becomes ill and passed away, leaving Yuzuki nothing left in her life, with the last thing for her to do is hugging her giant teddy bear, the last gift from her father, until she passes on as well. Having a tragic past and creating a false world where she was alive, Yuzuki is fated to be Ai\'s successor, the next Hell Girl. How this story ends is something you\'ll have to see for yourself... if you\'re someone who hasn\'t watched this season yet. I will say this is my favorite arc of Hell Girl.When it comes to this season\'s music, I respect the opening song. Nana Kitade did a good job writing and singing the lyrics and the music composition does fit with an anime like Hell Girl. It\'s just that I am not really into heavy metal music. Like I said, I respect it, but when it comes to Hell Girl music, SNoW\'s song The Inversed Butterfly from the first season is the first song to come to my mind. The ending song is pretty decent. I wouldn\'t go out of my way to listen to the full song, but at least I never skip the ending sequence, as well as the opening. In general, if I find myself skipping any openings and endings, it means I really do not like the music, and fortunately Three Vessels\'s soundtrack is nowhere near there compared to the music in the second half of Death Note, which was a case where a great anime has music that\'s unbearable for me.A very good story, well crafted fillers, characters old and new being absolutely amazing, music that at least suits the anime itself, and an epic conclusion that ends the series off with a bang, Hell Girl: Three Vessels has earned a spot in my list of favorite anime. I really want to be spoiling the ending here because it makes me feel for the characters, especially Yuzuki. Either way, I really enjoyed the Hell Girl series and if you\'re in search for some psychological anime to watch, I highly recommend it. I daresay that this anime series is perfect for October.I did it, I have finished reviewing the Hell Girl Trilogy. Oh excuse me, my phone\'s ringing.Hello? Oh, hi! Yes, I told you I will review the Hell Girl Trilogy on the month of October, and I just finished doing so... wait, what did you just say? There\'s... a fourth season? No way! If there is, Three Vessels would\'ve ended with a foreshadowing cliffhanger like the previous two, and I don\'t see any fourth season of Hell Girl listed on Fall 2009 or Fall 2010. Huh? Summer 2017? Let me take a look and see... Hell Girl: Fourth Twi-oh... OH!Dun! Dun! DUN!No!!! bit, but I still really enjoyed this season.Before I explain the story, I must warn that there is a major spoiler to the ending of Two Mirrors if you haven\'t completed it yet, so it\'s probably in your best interest to do so before proceeding.Wanyudo, Ichimokuren, and Hone Onna are all living regular lives after Ai Enma sacrificed her life to save Takuma at the end of the previous season.

Well, Ai can present herself to anybody requesting her services by having them meet her in the Realm of Eternal Twilight where she normally lives, but to move around in the real world and whenever it\'s time to send someone to Hell, she needs to take control of Yuzuki\'s body. Moving right along, Ai\'s return mean all of her companions are to come back together to accompany her in her work. Kikuri from Two Mirrors returns as well, now needing to possess a toy and she requires somebody to wind up the key on her backside in order for her to be able to move. Ai is also joined by a new companion named Yamawaro, who is mostly seen being a servant to Kikuri. He has an interesting backstory, which gets me every time I rewatch that episode.The filler episodes have once again taken a new twist on the formula. Two Mirrors had cases like the avenged character immediately dying after sending someone to Hell. In Three Vessels, the filler episodes mostly go on a trend where the ""villain"" characters are actually not bad people, and that was established right off the bat on the very first episode, where a teacher is disliked for recording students\' infractions on his notebook when he was actually pretending to be doing that just to scare them to have them improve their behavior. It is worth mentioning that to access the Hell Link, you just have to have a strong hatred towards somebody else. It is not based on whether or not someone really deserves to go to Hell. The last filler episode of the first season gave the audience this fact where some drug addict sent an innocent nurse to Hell. The second season had some instances where innocent people get sent, and in this season, this twist is utilized in full force. Okay, not every single episode does this, but these fillers are still very good at what they do.Ai Enma has become a lot more active in messing with the targeted people. Once again pointing to the first episode, she puts on a bee costume to sting a number 2 that was restraining the teacher during the torment segment. The Hell Girl in a bee costume... like it\'s so crazy to a whole new level... and I love it! As for her companions, in order for them to stay by her side, they work at Yuzuki\'s school. Well, that applies to Wanyudo, Ichimokuren, and Hone Onna since they resemble adults. Yamawaro is usually just taking care of Kikuri and occassionally Ai selects him to be the straw doll. While the original trio of companions are working at Yuzuki\'s school, they all seem to get along with the other students. It\'s so wholesome, I almost forget that this is a psychological anime.Since Ai has taken residence inside Yuzuki\'s body, Yuzuki is able to sense whenever someone wants to send somebody else to Hell, even after Ai recovers her body halfway through the season. In a similar fashion to the Shibatas in the first season, Yuzuki tries to stop people from pulling the red thread off of the straw dolls they receive, only to fail every single time. Towards the end, it\'s revealed the world Yuzuki was living in was just an illusion she created for herself because she already died years ago. Yuzuki\'s father was a bus driver, who died during work due to poorly implemented brakes, and the Government covered the truth up and framed him for taking out the passengers with him. If that wasn\'t bad enough, now the whole town despises his wife and child, because an elementary school girl would totally be into murder! This does sound utterly unrealistic, but people hating on an accused person\'s family is indeed a thing that can happen in real life. The hate was so bad, nobody is willing to socialize or help them with any troubles. Eventually, Yuzuki\'s mother becomes ill and passed away, leaving Yuzuki nothing left in her life, with the last thing for her to do is hugging her giant teddy bear, the last gift from her father, until she passes on as well. Having a tragic past and creating a false world where she was alive, Yuzuki is fated to be Ai\'s successor, the next Hell Girl. How this story ends is something you\'ll have to see for yourself... if you\'re someone who hasn\'t watched this season yet. I will say this is my favorite arc of Hell Girl.When it comes to this season\'s music, I respect the opening song. Nana Kitade did a good job writing and singing the lyrics and the music composition does fit with an anime like Hell Girl. It\'s just that I am not really into heavy metal music. Like I said, I respect it, but when it comes to Hell Girl music, SNoW\'s song The Inversed Butterfly from the first season is the first song to come to my mind. The ending song is pretty decent. I wouldn\'t go out of my way to listen to the full song, but at least I never skip the ending sequence, as well as the opening. In general, if I find myself skipping any openings and endings, it means I really do not like the music, and fortunately Three Vessels\'s soundtrack is nowhere near there compared to the music in the second half of Death Note, which was a case where a great anime has music that\'s unbearable for me.A very good story, well crafted fillers, characters old and new being absolutely amazing, music that at least suits the anime itself, and an epic conclusion that ends the series off with a bang, Hell Girl: Three Vessels has earned a spot in my list of favorite anime. I really want to be spoiling the ending here because it makes me feel for the characters, especially Yuzuki. Either way, I really enjoyed the Hell Girl series and if you\'re in search for some psychological anime to watch, I highly recommend it. I daresay that this anime series is perfect for October.I did it, I have finished reviewing the Hell Girl Trilogy. Oh excuse me, my phone\'s ringing.Hello? Oh, hi! Yes, I told you I will review the Hell Girl Trilogy on the month of October, and I just finished doing so... wait, what did you just say? There\'s... a fourth season? No way! If there is, Three Vessels would\'ve ended with a foreshadowing cliffhanger like the previous two, and I don\'t see any fourth season of Hell Girl listed on Fall 2009 or Fall 2010. Huh? Summer 2017? Let me take a look and see... Hell Girl: Fourth Twi-oh... OH!Dun! Dun! DUN!No!!!']"
Juubee Ninpuuchou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/617/Juubee_Ninpuuchou,"[""Ah Ninja Scroll, the epitome of everything a ninja anime needs and tries...and fails to be. My friend and I saw this at our local Blockbuster and he had heard of it from a coworker who said &quot;WATCH THIS MOVIE!&quot;  Now generally when I get recommendations from my friends I don't enjoy them all too much but Ninja Scroll was and is possibly one of my favourite films.Story:  Ninja Scroll in a very realistic sense is an anime B-movie.  So the story was pretty heinous.  Essentially the entire plot can be seen as a device to switch setting and to move...to the next fight scene.  However the story itself (if you're actually paying attention) isn't all too bad.  There were some interesting little character developments and a couple neat twists and turns.  It gets slightly weird towards the end and the actual ending itself was a little lacking.  But the forte of the anime is the action scenes.  Almost all of them were brilliant, I say almost all because frankly I wanted to see a couple stretched out a little longer.  Each enemy that Jubei faces is different and even though it's pretty clear that he can't be beaten it's interesting to see him face some of the tougher opponenets.Art: The art completely and perfectly suits the feel of the anime.  The art isn't good, it isn't bright or colourful....it's mediocre.  But the movie wouldn't feel right without the style of art that's used.  Granted there were 2-3 moments where I was forced to turn on the lights because I felt like I was going to have a seizure. Most of the screen flashed red and black really quickly and I quickly averted my eyes. But that's my only qualm about the art.Sound: Cheesy, oldschool....perfect for the movie.Character:  Jubeii is....the best and most powerful swordsman ever.  Well, maybe not ever, but he's still pretty amazing and he has a good heart.  All the characters are pretty one dimensional are never developed.  You get a couple &quot;reveal&quot; moments, but they're a little bit boring as well.  About the only noteworthy character is Kagero.  I felt really sorry for her during pretty much the entire movie.  However the interactions and &quot;development&quot; of characters is meaningless to the film.  The film is about action and fighting so, for me at least, it's understandable that the characters are pretty flat.Enjoyment:  I love Ninja Scroll.  It's a seriously fun ride.  There's nothing deep about it, there's no meaning to it....the film is about action and that's exactly what it delivers.  The movie is also quite gory and has a lot of nudity in it.  There's also a really hilarious sex-scene...well...it was at least funny to me.  There's also rape...so if you're offended by that you probably should steer clear.If you enjoy Ninja Scroll, which I can only hope you do, you should definitely check out Wicked City, which is from the same director and in many respects is practically the same film. to the next fight scene.

Demon ninjas with terrible powers, each unique.The Art for it's time is also excellent.

Luckily, I was already convinced of the ability of anime to stand up to anything that live action could throw at it.  This, on the other hand, went a long way towards making me realise that, as with anything else (I now realise - I was young and had no sense), not all anime is superb.So, what's wrong?  Well, ninjas.  I await the day when I can see a ninja character that I can even begin...to believe in.  However, it seems it is illegal to have ninjas that you can actually believe in; they all have to be supernatural and/or sublimely skilled, to an order of magnitude above and beyond your garden variety trained killer.  Ninja Scroll is the very epitome of this attitude.  They're not just sneaky guys with throwing knives, they turn to stone and have steerable mystic claws on endless chains and can hold off their own deaths until they deliver that one vital message.  All the most hackneyed and OTT things you can imagine ninjas doing, in all the most trashy b-movies and cheesy games, they happen here.  It's also, to my eye, unnecessarily nasty in its graphicness, tone and inference - I'm not squeamish, but I would rather gore had some point.  Think Naruto meets Urotsukidoji, but with rather less sex and filler episodes, and zero lightheartedness or charm.Everything in Ninja Scroll is resolutely (tediously) grim and opressive all the time.  It's actually quite tiring.  All the characters are also gratingly simplistic.  There's a hero, a heroine who is not allowed to be strong enough to look after herself in order that our hero Jubei can save her from a nasty fate, assorted sneaky buggers and of course all those supernatural ninjas.  No-one is remotely credible as a character.  Of course, they're not supposed to be, really, Ninja Scroll is clearly a very long way from realism.  The point is, this is a genre piece, and if you're not enamoured of the stereotype of ninjas, well, this'll not do anything to persuade you.  Then again, if Magikal Ninjery is your line, I'm sure you'll think I should rate this way higher.To be fair, it's not the worst thing ever in the history of ever.  The art style isn't really my cup of tea, but is distinctive and unique, with bold outlines, solid colours and overall a very stylised look.  Some of the ideas, if you can get past the basic ridiculousness to suspend your disbelief, are inventive and unexpected.  However, I was unable to make it that far.I'm not going to pretend to be objective or anything, this is what I think, and I think Ninja Scroll is terrible.

I probably was going to elementary school at that time and I’m not sure how my friends parents allowed us to see this sick and twisted story full of gore and tits.Needless to say, I couldn’t understand a jack shit of what was actually going on, but man did I love it.Ninja Scroll also marks my new found interest in anime. It is the first anime movie I’ve seen in 5 years. I loved it, and since then I’ve already watched about 10 anime movies.It is, in a nutshell, an action movie. And action here...is great. Let me rephrase that: it’s awesome beyond belief! But what is action alone without great characters, interesting storyline, fitting music and heavy atmosphere? For me, action is never a key ingredient into great movie, and too often movies rely only on fighting, jumping and ass kicking.Not the case here. Suspense is as it’s highest throughout the film. It will never let go and you’ll have not a second to rest. If that wasn’t enough, it is all done in great animation and surrounded by awesome sound.Atmosphere is at a highest level. I’ve been looking for something like this for so long. It’s certainly not horror, but has some touch of it. Not in a silly cat-jumps-out-to-scare-the-shit-out-of-you way, but in that dark, creepy and let me repeat myself - suspenseful way.Storyline is quite simple, but has many micro twists and is not clear from the very beginning. We are left to figure everything out as we go along and that keeps it interesting until the end.To top it all of, both, heroes and villains are really well written. Dialog is great, and characters are not some generic faceless douchebags that you wouldn’t care for. By the end of the story, you will find attached to them for sure.Good thing you can always re watch this masterpiece and meet them again.10/10 is great.

Premiering in 1993, Ninja Scroll could probably be the anime movie that fans everywhere could point their fingers at, saying that it jumpstarted the ninja trend, much like Gundam for mecha, Tenchi Muyo for harem, or Akira for cyberpunk, and what a spectacle it is. This is one of those movies that a lot of oldtaku were exposed to as kids, and is probably at least 50% responsible for the once-stigma of anime being sexed up, ultraviolent, and DEFINITELY not for kids.Madhouse blends this winning combination of stylized,...but grotesque, bloody violence with a touch of sexuality, and an unhealthy dose of visual awesomeness to bring Ninja Scroll to life. The story follows a lone wanderer, a ninja swordsman by the name of Juubei. His introduction is by and large unnecessary, because the viewer is generally aware of the wandering swordsman/ronin trope that's not unique to this series, but more of a culturally osmosis'd idea that we're aware of. The man has a dark past, and a lot of dangerous enemies who have nothing but bloodlust and revenge on the mind. After being tricked into accepting a job from the mysterious old man, Dakuon, Juubei is poisoned, and told that if he does not complete the task given to him in 3 days, he will die. This task, naturally, involves foiling a plot by a shadowy ninja clan who plan to take over feudal Japan through a power struggle created by ownership of the currency of the time: gold bullion.The setup for the movie is quite simple, but the story itself is not where Ninja Scroll shines through its brightest. No, that element would be the presentation of the Ninja, and the great care and detail that Madhouse put into the production of the movie. The aesthetic of the movie reminds me much of a previous Madhouse production; another darkly stylistic and incredibly detailed film: Wicked City. The fluidity is incredible, the character models and scenery gorgeous, and the cinematography and direction are top notch as well. Maybe I'm a sucker for old school animation, but this is incredible work. Its focus on aesthetics and style coupled with brutal action and a number of buckets of blood lend edge to the visual feast- in a way that Mad Max Fury Road was visually striking- Ninja Scroll does a similar thing with the posturing and manner of attack and movement of the characters. There's none of the silly handwaving and yelling out attacks, but ALL of the awesome mystical powers of the fabled ninja: body clones, melding into shadows, invisible wires, poison, incredible speed and strength, proficiency with all manner of melee weapons, and other just cool sh*t. Ninja are cool- and Ninja Scroll shows off the best of the genre, in all honesty. The 8 antagonist characters never progress much beyond being Ninja with XY skills, but the powers they're given keep the action interesting, and it never devolves into a drawn out shonen filler battle that, if it were a TV show, you KNOW would take up at least half a season.No, Ninja Scroll is practically the antithesis of that, as most of the 8 major battles are over in a matter of minutes. This lends a very quick pace to the movie (which is far better than plodding), which may be offputting to some, but I was glad it was not incredibly drawn out or overblown for each battle. Everything was summed up succinctly, and satisfactorily. Even the romantic and intrigue elements were handled well. The atmosphere is nearly tangible in its dark done, and gritty is the name of the game. We see the plight of the peasants and warring feudal factions that are immediately indicative of Sengoku period Japan (warring states). The movie even mentions the Tokugawa shogunate, and, supernatural elements aside, could have been some form of historical fiction if bent somewhat. All that to say: the presentation is time period appropriate- which lends an air of realism and credibility to it. All told, this is a true anime classic, and one that everyone should see once, especially if you like a good action romp. but grotesque, bloody violence with a touch of sexuality, and an unhealthy dose of visual awesomeness to bring Ninja Scroll to life.

Although it was never popular in Japan, it is not hard to see why it is a common gateway drug for western anime fans. Audiences who were unfamiliar with anime felt right at home with Ninja Scroll's plot, which is reminiscent of action films from the same late 80's to early 90's era (think Die Hard or Lethal Weapon). Juubee is a loner with a good heart and a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. To top it off, he's a rugged alpha male unlike the androgynous...leads that are typical in anime.On the surface, the plot seems uninspired: Three ninjas must stop the eight Devils of Kimon before they takeover Japan.

It is an example of why with proper execution, simple ideas can make a great movie.In contrast to many action anime, the fight scenes are fast paced, concise, and not bogged down with unnecessary dialogue. This isn't pretty fighting either. There is no motion blur or gracefully choreographed movements, and every swing feels raw and impactful. The characters recoil from cuts and deflected blows with a sense of weight that is difficult to convey in animation. Action scenes never overstay their welcome either. Each fight lasts only a couple minutes, but it feels satisfying and leaves the viewer wanting more.One of the most refreshing aspects of Ninja Scroll is its take on magic. It doesn't bother with a sophisticated magic system, it simply shows without telling. Although most of the characters have supernatural abilities, the audience can easily gauge their powers and limitations with hardly any verbal explanation. This does not stifle creativity either. The devils constantly use their powers in inventive ways, such as Yurimaru's ability to conduct his voice over a metal wire.Ninja Scroll does not shy from darker elements of war in feudal japan. There are several instances of graphic sexual assault, and political corruption. Ironically, even though these scenes are a bit gratuitous, Ninja Scroll pulls them off with nuance because the characters actually behave like people raised in that era. Too often, fiction  characters in historical settings have the same viewpoints as someone from the 21st century. In real life, people adapt to their environment. When the main characters observe or are victim to cruelty, they aren't shocked or bemoan the world; they understand how their society works. They don't approve of it, but they aren't surprised either. The character's reactions are nonchalant and understated, which gives Ninja Scroll an air of maturity.At first, you might think Ninja Scroll's formula is not special or unique, but then you'll wonder why movies this fun don't happen more often.

Our poor hero Jubei unfortunately gets stuck in the middle, when he decided to help some ninja girl that was being raped by a giant muscle-head freak who tells her to behave, because: it would not make a difference to him wether she\'s dead or alive while he\'s doing his thing. Yeah.. it\'s not classy. Jubei and the ninja girl, let\'s call her Kagero, end up joining forces to take on the evil group, yada yada...yada, we\'ve seen it many times before. It\'s pretty straigh-forward.But it isn\'t the story that makes this movie a ""MUST WATCH"" classic, it\'s the action packed, bloody, raw and uncut fighting scenes! If there\'s one thing that Ninja Scroll delivers, is action. The fights are awesome, so awesome that it\'ll make you drool like a fat kid looking at cake.The variety of opponents Jubei faces is very distinct, they all have different and unique abilities. The only downside is that some of the fights, though still cool, are incredibly short and it\'ll leave you with a craving for more (cake).The characters are also barely explored, appart from Jubei and Kagero, most of the characters barely even show emotion or motives, or personalities really... nothing. They are flat, extremely undeveloped. Some, like the blind samurai, only appear for like 8 minutes overall. Poor guy, just because he\'s blind doesn\'t mean he doesn\'t have feelings. And one of the biggest promises, the sub-boss, who all through the movie appears to be a complete badass, shows up, only to die miserably like 1.5 minutes later. Which was very disapointing.As the story moves along, Jubei\'s relationship with the girl deepens and we start to see more humanity from him, not that much, but its something. He\'s still a badass don\'t worry. His past is reavealed to be linked with the leader of the evil group and they face off once more in an epic battle, which ends beautifuly in my opinion.Overall this movie is really awesome, that\'s just it. There isn\'t much more embezzlement to be made. It\'s a classic of japanese animation, it\'s simple but it excels in its simplicity, what it promises it delivers: An action packed adventure, full of ninjas battles, nudity and blood. What else could we wish for?Wether you\'re looking for a great anime to improve your repertoire or just to have a good time, Ninja Scroll will fit your needs. yada, we\'ve seen it many times before.

Ninja Scroll is an action anime that has gained quite a solid and very rabid following. I have seen reviewers attacked mercilessly for saying anything negative about it. I\'ll never hear a reason good enough on why someone should be attacked for expressing their opinion on anything but those things happen, and I only mention that point with intentions on providing insight on how loved this animated feature is.Ninja Scroll is definitely one of the most violent and action packed anime films ever. To include, the film boasts some of the most...incredible visuals for its time which still holds up until now. For being a film that was released in 1993. It really doesn\'t show a lot of age.Director and writer Yoshiaki Kawajiri is no stranger to me when it comes down to flooding the screen with gratuitous violence. Over the years, this style of anime had become his trademark. Ninja Scroll is cut from the same cloth as his earlier anime film Wicked City. However, Wicked City is clearly edged out when it comes down to the violence.The action scenes are brutal. There is really no other way to describe them. Kawajiri was never a slouch in the violence department, and in this area, Ninja Scroll continues to be the pinnacle of his work(that I\'ve seen). The viewer is treated to gory blood soaked battles with a bit of dismemberment. The battles are very stylish. They consist of sword clashes and wild displays of superhuman skills. If there is anything I can say for Kawajiri\'s works, is that they can definitely leave you with a lasting impression with this being no exception.The artwork is gorgeous and rich in detail, with some very good and well detailed character designs along with backgrounds. The villains are by far the best looking with their creepy and imaginative designs. This is the way an intimidating antagonist should be portrayed. The soundtrack uses traditional Japanese drums and it compliments the setting well. Plus the music is used at the right times, and silence is provided when the situation calls for it. This is a very wise move, since the movie does have some incredible sound effects which ranges from running water to intense sword clashes.The animation is very fluid without the slightest bit of jumpiness during the faster paced scenes. The action scenes are simply a joy to watch. However, the animation is not as ""perfect"" as some would force you to believe. The last few minutes leading up to the end does contain a good amount of stills as well as a small bit of re-used animation. This was obviously due to budget issues, but I just can\'t let the flawless animation claim slide like that. I never had a problem with the cast for either languages; but as almost always, the English cast is my personal choice.Ninja Scroll does have its flaws that bothers me. The action to some degree actually works against it. The story does provide a stable foundation, but it\'s pretty much forgettable and one can find themselves waiting only for the next fight.I also have a problem with the ""deus ex machina"" factor coming into play at some weird times. Although there\'s slight character development, this is an area where the anime is weak at. The characters really don\'t have much, if any dapth at all. As interesting as the villains are, they\'re way too one-dimensional and their personalities are too alike for my taste. The film also contains some sexual content, nudity, and gay references. These things don\'t bother me in the slightest, but may be offensive to others.Even though Kawajiri borrowed a bit from Wicked City and Ninja Scroll does have its flaws. It\'s still a title that I always recommend to new action oriented anime fans. There are other violent titles but not too many do it quite like Ninja Scroll.Again, this is a film that is meant for the action fan whom doesn\'t mind sex, rape, and violence. If you\'re offended by any of these things or just find them boring. Then skip it completely because it may not be for you.Some additional advice or perhaps a warning. Do not be fooled by the supposed sequel Ninja Resurrection. It\'s a piece of pure trash that shares no relation to this film here at all. The attempt was to bill it as the sequel for this to boost sales, but it\'s definitely among the worst anime titles ever made.Highs: Quality animation & artwork, excellent & stylish action scenes, gore galoreLows: Bland personalities, too much ""deus ex machina"", short cuts in later action scenes incredible visuals for its time which still holds up until now.

I've seen this film 6 times dubbed and subbed. Now Ninja Scroll is a truly classic anime that anime watchers who like MOE, CGDCT, and other high school romcoms should watch and learn from to cleanse their pallet and enjoy something great and culturally rich.The story of Ninja Scroll deals with our protagonist Juubei Kibagami and basically he’s out to kill the 8 devils of Kimon because an insider from the government poisoned him, and if he doesn’t do it the government spy won’t give him the antidote for the...poison. The story of Ninja Scroll really has nothing to deal with scrolls and the villains are more like super powered demons rather than traditional ninjas.  Basically the main character Juubei was betrayed by is arch rival and sold him out to be murdered by his colleagues over some gold. He plans to buy weapons from Spain to overthrow Japan and rule Japan from the shadows.  The story it’s kind of like a video game where Juubei is killing bad guys without them overstaying their welcome and they all have different types of abilities. Also there is a love story between Juubei and the main Heroine Kagero who is just used as rape bait by the bad guys and Juubei has to keep saving her. At least she still does some useful things unlike another famous kunoichi Sakura Haruno. Otaku now at day’s in Japan are dismissive of Yoshiaki Kawajiri’s works because they just want to be filled with moe girls and Isekai trash but don’t want to look into something just raw and brutal.The characters in Ninja Scroll are really damn cool. I can see how Naruto and Basilisk would be influenced by this show. In Ninja Scroll you have a ninja/demon who can shed her skin and has snake like powers (she also has snakes in her vagina no joke) like orochimaru. You have the blind swordsman; the man who hides in shadows and uses ninjutsu like shadow clones and mind control. Finally you have Genma who is immortal and has complete control over his microscopic cellular structure and can change his form into other humans. Yeah, I said Naruto I mean come on a lot of Naruto characters have the same powers the devils of kimon share. Ninja Scroll is just a much tighter, more concise, and more grisly depiction of Ninja life and less filler lol.The soundtrack and direction for Ninja Scroll are what truly makes this anime stand out for me though. The ninja Scroll soundtrack was composed by Kaoru Wada and you’ve heard his soundtracks in anime like Inuyasha and Ace Attorney. He has these little motifs thrown in for individual moments such as the clarinet playing a sinister tone before something truly terrible or explosive happens and then it just crescendos to this very loud blaring of horns, strings, and timpani. You also have more subtle moments and when those show on the screen you hear a Japanese flute and a Shamisen come in. Also when something fast paced is happening you hear this soundtrack that has a galloping feel to it with strings and wind instruments, and softer hits from the gong and the timpani going on in the background. The sound direction of this anime is unmatched with the motifs placed in such perfect places as to what is shown on screen. The ending theme “Somewhere, Faraway, Everyone Is Listening to a Ballad” is truly a beautiful way to end the movie. Juubei experienced death, love, and betrayal and it’s all over. He can go onto living a peaceful life and the ending soundtrack symbolizes that with the images of glowing fireflies on the screen.The animation direction is also some of the greatest I’ve ever seen. For example the first major scene when Tessai kills the entire Ninja Squad is grisly yet awesome. When I first saw that scene with the great soundtrack in the background my mouth fucking hit the floor. One of the higher ups sees his comrades’ dead then he gets a rope attached to his neck and he gets electrocuted to death. Then you see this enormous double edged blade slice these ninja squad guys into little bits and pieces. You literally see raining blood and trees falling down; simply outstanding cinematography. Also the final fight you see Juubei and the main villain duking it out in a ship, which is surrounded by flames and makes it look like the main villain is a demon and Juubei has no choice but to fight for his life or be swallowed by the flames of hell. Another great scene is when Juubei is fighting the shadow clone jutsu dude with a claw and the background is completely red. This movie has some of the best animation direction and stylization I’ve ever seen. There are a lot of other great scenes but there are too many to list.In conclusion this movie is amazing. It has a love story, some brutal brutal violence, great cinematography, and an amazing soundtrack to boot. I still think to this day this is one of the greatest anime movies ever made surpassing many films even by Hayao Miyazaki and definitely surpassing the overrated Kimi no Wawa. In my opinion this movie is grossly underrated I mean a 7.6 mean score come on now. Go watch this movie buy it, steal it from your friend, pirate it go watch this movie you won’t regret it. poison.

Every person I have shown this to, whether they are an anime fan or not, has enjoyed this movie. When someone I know asks for a recommendation for anime I always start with Ninja Scroll.The opening scene is all the character development you need for Jubei. They sum up his character in a quick defensive attack and short piece of dialogue. From there, you know exactly who he is and what he does. The...scene then changes and the plot begins. As other characters enter the stage, Jubei wanders into the spotlight and fast explosive action graces the stage.Though this movie has quite a bit of violence, it is fast and well presented. Fights are short and quick. They are not dragged out and filled with dialogue. The pacing for the story keeps your interest, and things are explained in a simple but intelligent way. It helps that the characters are kept to a minimum, and each character has their own unique charm.This is an older anime movie, so you won't see any high definition animation action. Even so, it still has good animation and the soundtrack works very well. The voice acting is well done, and everything blends smoothly together. The characters are memorable, and the story works very well.In short, if you've never seen Ninja Scroll then you are definitely missing out. scene then changes and the plot begins.

Whilst I can certainly see where those people are coming from, I want to take a better look at what the so-called ""good old days"" of anime really had to offer. Today, we\'re taking a look at Ninja Scroll: a harbinger of nostalgia for the many oldtaku here on MAL that actually bought tickets to see Akira and Ghost in the Shell in theatres when they first came...to USA. Is Ninja Scroll truly a masterpiece like the nostalgia-hungry oldtaku out there make it seem? Nope. Is it still an enjoyable movie to watch? Indeed it is, now let\'s get into great lengths to find out why.Before I actually get into the review itself, I want to make one thing perfectly clear: anime from ""back in the day"" wasn\'t that great. Sure, we had plenty of awesome stuff like Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, and Legend of the Galactic Heroes coming out but there was a LOT of garbage that came our way as well (mostly in the form of ultra-violent OVAs and movies) like Angel Cop, Genocyber, Devilman, MD Geist, and Violence Jack. As much as it pains me to say this, Ninja Scroll falls into the latter group as opposed to the former. Thankfully enough though, Ninja Scroll is nowhere near as awful as Genocyber, Devilman, or Violence Jack! In fact, it was quite the enjoyable movie.Make no mistake, Ninja Scroll perfectly encapsulates the time period that it came out in: it\'s bloody, it\'s violent, and has enough out-of-place sex scenes and nudity to go around for everyone. At the same time, it still manages to cut the crap and tell a decent story without going overboard on the bloody violence and the sex (take notes, Mirai Nikki and Akame ga Kill!). From what I understand, Ninja Scroll wasn\'t that different from the other stuff that came out during the same time period so this begs the question of WHY it got so popular in the first place. Whilst I don\'t know what the situation with Ninja Scroll is in Japan, it\'s not that hard to see how it got so popular here in the west back in the early 90s.Until Akira came to the USA, there was no such thing as animation meant for adults. Akira paved the way for companies like ADV Films, Manga Entertainment, and Central Park Media to start licensing OVAs and movies for distribution here with dubs and everything. Anime at the time was still a hipster thing, but it was easy to come by at your local video store from what I can gather. When people picked up these ultra-violent OVAs and movies like Ninja Scroll, it was the shock value that kept people coming back for more because let\'s face it: THIS was the stuff that you just couldn\'t get on Toonami at the time. Thus, the first otakus were born and the plague of weeaboos began to spread throughout the West.With all of that out of the way, let\'s talk about how well Ninja Scroll can tell a story. Surprisingly enough, the story was actually quite nice. It\'s your standard tale of revenge/saving the fate of the country story that we tend to see a lot of when it comes down to samurai/ninja movies but the execution was fair enough to say the least. Also, I know that Ninja Scroll came out WAY before Naruto ever did but I just love the fact that there\'s no jutsus or annoying blond kids punctuating their sentences with the phrase ""Believe it!"" There certainly are parts of the movie that get rather ridiculous (i.e. Kagero and her deal with poisons, that guy with rock skin, the whole business with ""reincarnation"" and all that crap), but it was cool enough for me to look past that. Characters are par for the course. You have your wandering swordsman/ninja, the tough girl with her fair share of troubles, the wise old guy, etc. They\'re not gonna win any awards for originality, but at least I can find myself wanting to root for the protagonists and hate the villains and lal that junk.From a production standpoint, Ninja Scroll is a far cry from the likes of Akira and Ghost in the Shell. Even though Madhouse has a reputation for top-notch visuals nowadays, they weren\'t exactly known for their stellar production values in the 90s. Thankfully, Ninja Scroll is still pretty damn good when it comes down to the visual department. Action scenes are deliciously savage and as far as the nudity goes, it does my heart good to know that animators still took the time to painstakingly draw out jiggle physics. The actual artwork is pretty good, but I\'ve seen better when it comes down to the backgrounds and character models (but this is my own personal bias kicking in). Similarly, the OST is quite nice: all the tracks fit the mood like they\'re supposed to but there wasn\'t much in the way of tracks that stood out to my ear when I was watching the movie. The dub itself is surprisingly well-made, especially given that it came out in the mid 90s when there was no gold standard for dub quality. All the actors did a great job, so there\'s not much else I can say there.Final thoughts? I\'d say that Ninja Scroll was a rather entertaining watch and if I were so inclined, I\'d go ahead and buy it on DVD/Blu-ray. With garbage like Sword Art Online, Tokyo Ghoul and Akame ga Kill! gaining popularity in recent years, it\'s not hard to see why people would go ahead and say that they miss the ""good old days"" of anime. However, Ninja Scroll was by no means a masterpiece. At its core, Ninja Scroll is a simple action flick that got popular overseas due to the fact that people thought that everything that was animated was meant for children. Let\'s just be grateful that\'s no longer the case anymore. Anyway, that\'s all for now. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I\'m out. Peace :) to USA.

With garbage like Sword Art Online, Tokyo Ghoul and Akame ga Kill! gaining popularity in recent years, it\'s not hard to see why people would go ahead and say that they miss the ""good old days"" of anime. However, Ninja Scroll was by no means a masterpiece. At its core, Ninja Scroll is a simple action flick that got popular overseas due to the fact that people thought that everything that was animated was meant for children. Let\'s just be grateful that\'s no longer the case anymore. Anyway, that\'s all for now. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I\'m out. Peace :)', ""This is one of the Japanese animated movies that have left a long lasting mark on me.It influenced me alot in artistic style, and other ways.It's very much like typical old Japanese samurai stories, but with all the stuff animation allows in.Ninja techniques were great.I loved watching it and I watch it again now and then.I don't know why many people have a bad experience with it.Anyway, I'd reccommend this anime to hardcore samurai or ninja anime fans.Or men who are interested in animations and over the age of 27.Best suited for men in their 40s.Best Ninja Animation Movie ever!! "", ""This is a fantaastic action film. It's an homage to a series of ninja novels and the main character an homage to a famous samurai folk hero...but never mind all that rubbish! All you need to know is it's a high octane thrill a minute action adventure with great characters, great fight scenes and a decent plot (certainly much better than you'd expect for a movie of this type). Be warned it's very violent and it will shock anyone who equates animation with Mickey Mouse or only knows anime through Studio Ghibli. Having said that all the extreme content is handled in a mature and...responsible manner. It's certainly not a tastless or nasty film.My main criticism? The song for the closing credits is abysmal and totally out of sync with the rest of the film. responsible manner. It's certainly not a tastless or nasty film.My main criticism?

The characters besides the main lead Jubei Kibagami and the villain Genma the rest of the characters are pretty forgettable.the OST is pretty weak and not remember able at all. The Animation on the fight scenes and in general is pretty good in my opinion. That reminds me the ending fight at the end of the movie on the burning ship has to be the best anime fight that I ever experienced in my whole...life watching anime.

I also first heard of it when my parents are talking about when they watched anime while growing up.', ""Misogyny! Gore! Everything wrong with anime! etc etc! Really though, the way I see it is that Ninja Scroll is fundamentally an exploitation film that happens to be animated, more or less structured like a 70s grindhouse film in terms of emphasis on very base payoff. Funny how people get a lot less lenient about that kind of sleaze once it's animated, i.e. real people aren't being exploited in the process. Anyway, it's actually rather unique in how it takes a period story with ninjas and, without sacrificing the romanticism of such a setting, does something grotesque and almost horror-oriented with it. Great oldschool animation...to boot--they can capture this kind of fluidity digitally very easily now, but it just doesn't have the same soul as the traditional method. Yeah, it's misogynistic, violent and basically pretty dumb--so what? to boot--they can capture this kind of fluidity digitally very easily now, but it just doesn't have the same soul as the traditional method. Yeah, it's misogynistic, violent and basically pretty dumb--so what?"", 'THEE gold standard for proper, speedy pacing in anime. One of maybe two anime that potentially move too quickly for the viewer to follow. There\'s no hokey filler to pad the run time. Each scene carries actual character depth and plotline intrigue.That alone makes this movie a must-watch, and a compelling reason it\'s survived as a masterpiece for well over two decades.Beyond that, Ninja Scroll features fantastically rapid combat sequences, devilishly brutal tactics, some of the best Japanese voicework ever (the English dub is just hilariously bad, don\'t bother with it), a menacing musical score, a surprisingly complex story, and purely stunning animation throughout.""Why did...it need that H-scene?""The directors even admitted 20 years later that there\'s no way around it: that scene was unjustifiable.

Ninja Scroll is both very, very stupid and very, very cool.-Story-From what I know, during the early 90\'s hyper-violent and gratuitous movies and OVA\'s were very common in the anime industry. If Ninja Scroll is any indication... I heard exactly right. After their overthrow by the Tokugawa Shoguns, the Toyotomi clan has assembled an army of the night and... ah, who freaking cares? It\'s all an excuse to get a bunch of awesome ninja fights. If I had to describe the story in one word it would be \'gratuitous\'. Blood? Gore? Violence? Fan-Service? Special Powers? All check. Ninja...Scroll has the plot of any number of cheap American action films, this one just happens to be animated. One scene that sums up this movie perfectly has a geisha getting it in the butt while some exposition is being dumped. Was that remotely necessary? No. Does anybody really care? Also no. Put your brain into cruise control for this one and break out the popcorn. (Oh, and there aren\'t any scrolls pertaining to ninjas in this film, so what exactly the title is referring to is a bit ambiguous).-Art-And this is why cell animation is awesome kiddies. The grim, washed-out colors that cell animation excels in fit the tone of Ninja Scroll. Movies have better animation than TV series almost by default, and here is no exception. Fluidity is top-notch, and very few shots or images are re-used. Shot composition is very dramatic, often using silhouetting to great effect- and one scene is even shot only in black and shades of red. Ninja Scrolls looks GREAT.-Sound-A surprisingly convincing English dub considering this was pre-Bebop. The soundtrack uses many traditional Japanese instruments to create a good Edo period sound. But interestingly, the climatic battle is shot without music (there are plenty of other sound effects to make up the difference)- I thought it added to the realism as much as Ninja Scroll can be considered \'realistic\'. Excellent sound.-Characters-First rule of awesome: ""When a character can toss an object into the air, defeat multiple foes before it comes down, and casually catch it- they are awesome"". Coincidentally, this is exactly how our main character Jubei is introduced. His look and attitude remind my of Spike Spiegel- the seemingly unfocused joker who actually could have killed you 23 different ways in the time it took to read this sentence. Kagero is pretty useless for a character hyped up as an elite ninja woman. She looks (and thanks to Wendee Lee SOUNDS) a lot like Faye Valentine (perhaps she and Spike met in past life?) The comedic highlight is the manipulative old A-Hole Dakuan- he\'s a jerk, but an entertaining crazy ancient jerk. The villains are just a series of opponents with cool powers and attacks that Jubei is supposed to overcome, motivations and personalities aren\'t exactly important for a film of this nature.-Enjoyment-Go in with the attitude that you\'re going to watch \'300\' or something like that, and Ninja Scroll will be fun. I pity any poor saps who try to take this movie seriously.-Overall-Very, very stupid. Very, very cool. If I were to judge \'Ninja Scroll\' from a purely serious perspective I would have to tear it apart. But it\'s not meant to be taken seriously at all.

But yeah, here we go.The story of the movie was just okay, kind of cliche but since this was done in the 90\'s let\'s just pass it off since who knows, maybe they were one of the first ones to start the trend.The story is about A kickass leading lady named Kagero, an uber-awesome male protagonist named Jubei, with the addition of an old smartass called Dakuan to complete the trio, fighting off the evil ones by killing Kimon (because he\'s a power-crazy...cunt), Jubei\'s archenemy who was magically brought back to life, along with his goons nicknamed the ""Eight Demons of Kimon"".The movie is enough to entertain you, but there\'s just really some scenes that disappoints me here. The art is, well... kind of awkward but I appreciate it because the style tries to have a realistic touch. It\'s just.. meh.What really disappoints me here on this one is how easy Jubei and friends defeat the ""Eight Devils of Kimon"". Exactly why were they called \'devils\'? Is it because they are really incredibly strong, because they are a one big freakshow (add their horny leader to the family), or just because Jubei is super strong desu? Seriously, the fight scenes was so short and so simple. After a few seconds, tadaaa Kimon devil number one is dead~ And so on and so forth.I like the designs of characters (especially my mama bear Zakuro and the hawt homo Kimimaru) and their powers, but it\'s kind of disappointing how they die easily whenever they face Juubei & co. -___-Another is that I can understand the nudity and all in here because yeah, that\'s feudal Japan but.. sometimes I really don\'t know if some of those scenes are actually necessary or just really for fanservice. Sometimes I think this flick is for the fanboys, actually.All in all, I think this film is just fine if you\'re bored, but not really the type that will truly fascinate your mind.

Had their not been so much creativity within the film, I\'m positive things wouldn\'t have worked out so well. The unfortunate part is that creativity stretched into one of the worst, most offensive subplots I\'ve ever had to endure. There\'s this obscure, fetishistic sexual theme that runs in the film that is the first time I\'ve ever felt the urge to call \'sexist\'. It doesn\'t make the film unwatchable, but it definitely makes the film recommendable (at least in my case.)Art:Fluid. Everything flows right into everything else. The animation on this work...is superb and immersive. I couldn\'t get enough of it. Not only was the animation great, but the set-pieces were incredible. Unique settings for each act of the film made for an interesting adventure. And better yet, they weren\'t just backdrops. Characters were seen using the setting practically for their combat. There was definitely a lot of care and planning that went into creative the world of Juubee Ninpuuchou beyond just making a lone shinobi fight strange and exotic warriors.And speaking of exotic warriors, each one had an interesting and unique design that made each fight enjoyable and unpredictable. Very fun fights with intriguing combat styles beyond simple weapon wielders.Sound:Music queues were on point, and the music itself was very cool. It fit the setting very well, but also had an early 90\'s feel to it that made for fun, slightly nostalgic entertainment.The combat effects were fitting and never went beyond what I expected. This is good because it isn\'t distracting, but bad because I didn\'t get to hear anything new or exciting along with the unique powers and abilities of the warriors in the film. That said, there are points where sound effects are used to emphasize certain characteristics, but they all have a \'stock effect\' sound to them, so, again, it\'s not distracting, but nothing new.Character:The biggest hit to the character rating is by the sexist use of the female character, Kagero, and I seldom consider the use of a character sexist considering creative license dictates anybody can be used for anything. That said, I enjoy critiquing things, and that means there are things people create that I think are X or Y, and in this case, that happens to be ""I think this thing is sexist.""To elaborate - and I can\'t get into much detail without discussing spoilers - the use of her character is already only being used as a romance object for the protagonist.

In fact, that makes sense in regards to certain narratives, and this one it sort of did.The problem begins when there\'s a grotesque amount of sexual content that isn\'t putting sex in its properly understood right. The forms that sex takes in this film are very fetishistic, abusive, and disgusting. In some cases, there isn\'t even a reason for a sexual context to the event. It merely happens because the writer has a hard on for the specific idea and decided, ""Instead of telling a solid narrative, let me put this useless sexual content in it.""

It pulls the viewer out of the narrative and makes them go, ""HUH?""The reason I am going off about this in the character section and not the story section is because the sexual content surrounds a singular character like a bat outta hell. It\'s about all that defines her. Even by the end of the film she has this cheesy line about sex that completely erases any sense of self-awareness.Thankfully, the protagonist of this film, Jubei, is so freaking cool, that he recovers a lot of the issues.

Kanashimi No Belladonna, the Satoshi Kon trilogy of Perfect Blue, Paprika and Millennium Actress (trilogy made by the same company who did this, of all things), Sailor Moon, Cowboy Bepop, Ideon etc. etc. etc. all helped to push the medium out of the sole children\'s reach (I mean it with no offense for children, who are everything other than stupid) and they\'re far more relevant...and mature than so-called live action ""masterpieces"". By watching this turd and the infinite amount of accolades it has received during the years, you wouldn\'t believe it. Why? because this is a 100% horny, childish teenager fantasy with nothing relevant, interesting and mature in it, meaning it all comes to tits, ass and gore and nothing else. There\'s the badass main ninja male who is indestructible, there\'s the female side character voiced by the always amazing Emi Shinohara (who is the sole reason why I watched this after avoiding it like the plague for years due to its overbloated hype) who serves no purpose other than showing some boobas while being raped (twice) and to contrivedly fall in love/have sex with said ninja male, there\'s the third old guy who again serves no purpose other than mumbling something about an inexistant plot because who cares of having something resembling an actual plot when you have tits, ass and gore?! and there\'s the enemy, whose charisma is less than that of a faceless minion trooper in a showa superhero Tokusatsu and, like the female ninja, most of the time it doesn\'t go beyond the function of showing some nudity. And, mind you, the combination of tits, ass, sex and gore for the sake of tits, ass, sex (ridicolous early sex scene including the ninja clan leader I\'m looking at you) and gore can have its moments (even if I would prefer no pointless rape innuendo in them), but it can have them in something that doesn\'t take itself way too seriously like the first Lady Death Comics by Brian Pulido, where it was clear that was the focus of the guy and, albeit nobody would call them masterpieces in any way, they were fun. On the contrary, this movie takes itself so goddamn seriously that it clearly thinks of itself as the animated equivalent of samurai sagas like the Seven Samurais or the Zatoichi movies when in reality it\'s a teenager escapade overhyped for no real reason. Again, I question: why? it is because of the technical element? of the pretty good japanese voice acting? I don\'t get it.

Avoid wasting your time on this with no remorse whatsoever and, if you\'re an Emi Shinohara fan like me, watch something else with her in it (Abaranger and Dekaranger, for example?) or re-listen to her beautiful musical albums like I\'m doing in this moment, her doing the good job you\'re already expecting from her with the non-existant material she\'s given doesn\'t save this dreck one single inch.Edit: DEFINITELY watch Abaranger over this anytime if you\'re an Emi Shinohara fan, no questions attached. and mature than so-called live action ""masterpieces"".

heard about anime that considered as a classic featuring ninjas and demons and few other things I didn't hesitate and watched it online (I wasn't able to download it ) and what I got was more than what I thought this anime movie was and still the most graphic and violent and disturbing anime I've ever watched .story:Actually the story is simple it's basically an excuse to jump from one fight to another ,it's simple not complex and have some twists on the way towards the end but it...still serves the purpose since this an action movie so the plot isn't concerned as far as it helps to provide the enjoyment.Character:Juubee the main character is a skilled swordsman ,he is cool,badass and carefree his attitude reminds me sometimes with spike Spiegel ,he isn't your typical hero and that what make him interesting he is an anti hero he doesn't care for what's going on and doesn't want to get involved in the mess around him until he has no choice ,the ninja girl is the most unfortunate female anime character ever put to screen watch the movie and you will know what I mean  ,I think the creator is somehow a sadist, he made  her went through all type of trauma a woman  could go through.what would make ninja scroll violent and creepy without its villains,the creator had taken his imagination too far and provided us with some of the most disturbing and frightening anime villains ,they are very diverse from a giant who could turn his body into stone and his weapon of choice is giant double blade to a blind swordsman to a creepy mutated man whose back is basically a hornet hive (he is the most disturbing of the bunch) I can't remember all of them but those are the most memorable, taking their number into account they didn't developed at all they are their for most of the time to give juubee a good fight.Art style and animation:This is were ninja scroll excels although this movie is from early 90's but its animation and fighting scenes are better than most action and shounen animes I've seen they are detailed and awesome and wouldn't disappoint you, the character design is also good men look like men and women look like women (for the most part) many characters look creepy and weird ,it reminds me of fist of north star sometimes .the only thing that irritates me is those unusual long faces of some characters.music:It fits very well the music that played during action sequences make you feel the intensity of the moment and the ending theme is memorable and awesome.Verdict :Ninja scroll is fantastic action anime but prepare yourself for lots of gore, lots of nudity and disturbing imagery  (even rape) if you are going to watch it for depth or complexity then you chose the wrong anime it's like a B action movie lots of fun but no substance that's what prevent me from giving it 8 or 9 , those who enjoyed basilisk ,sword of the stranger and hellsing ultimate would enjoy this. still serves the purpose since this an action movie so the plot isn't concerned as far as it helps to provide the enjoyment.Character:Juubee the main character is a skilled swordsman ,he is cool,badass and carefree his attitude reminds me sometimes with spike

mutated man whose back is basically a hornet hive (he is the most disturbing of the bunch) I can't remember all of them but those are the most memorable, taking their number into account they didn't developed at all they are their for most of the time to give juubee a good fight.Art style and animation:This is were ninja scroll excels although this movie is from early 90's but its animation and fighting scenes are better than most action and shounen animes I've seen they are detailed and awesome and wouldn't disappoint you, the character design is also good men look like men and women look like women (for the most part) many characters look creepy and weird ,it reminds me of fist of north star sometimes .the only thing that irritates me is those unusual long faces of some characters.music:It fits very well the music that played during action sequences make you feel the intensity of the moment and the ending theme is memorable and awesome.Verdict :Ninja scroll is fantastic action anime but prepare yourself for lots of gore, lots of nudity and disturbing imagery  (even rape) if you are going to watch it for depth or complexity then you chose the wrong anime it's like a B action movie lots of fun but no substance that's what prevent me from giving it 8 or 9 , those who enjoyed basilisk ,sword of the stranger and hellsing ultimate would enjoy this."", ""Jubei is the anime hero we need but don't deserve.This is a movie I shouldn't like at all (the amount of sexual assault is something I could really do without tyvm) but I do. It's got buckets of blood, many boobs, kinetic as fuck fight scenes, interesting character designs, fantastic voice work in the English dub, all wrapped up in a moody score and atmosphere. Despite my dislike for the treatment of the female characters, there's more personality given to them than in a few other 90s anime movies I've seen. Jubei and Kagero are written so well that I feel a genuine emotional investment...in them and where the story is taking them.

It's a really dark brutal anime where people killed and torn apart in brutal fashion. It's not for the faint hearted at all. People wield all types of weapons and have special abilities. Although the action is fast paced, its also intellectual. Characters have to think deeply about the situation to counteract certain circumstances in...order to live or outsmart there opponents on the battlefield. It's really good stuff.Story 7/10.

My rating on MAL was based on the hazy memories of a child and so I decided to watch it again. So how does the movie hold up against the fresh eyes of a somewhat more matured self? Well...- Story & ThemeI can't say I remembered much of the main story and it's easy to see why. The story is good, but it's revealed to us in fragments and chunks and to...a degree it's actually more of something that happens in the background as the movie focuses on the main characters and their events. The theme is a solid mix of historical fiction and supernatural action and they're woven into each other seamlessly. There's some nudity and a few attempts at sexual violence, but it's not really a theme and doesn't get gratuitous. Huge fountains of gushing blood, however, is a theme and the closest we get to comic relief is the laughable amount of blood that, with an over-the-top sound, sprays out as a body part is chopped off.- Characters & WritingThe main protagonist is well written and his actions feel motivated and reasonable. Most of the other characters feel the same and they are fairly unique and interesting, but there are a few weak links. The most obvious ones are the main antagonist, who doesn't get enough screen time or development, and the female protagonist, who feels like she doesn't have much of a character beyond 'cursed female ninja'. The script is over-all competent but not great.- Setting & WorldbuildingThis movie paints an interesting world that is based on Edo-period Japan with a lot of strange humans and seemingly supernatural techniques. We never get an explanation for why or how some people are twisted into these monsters, but there is also never really a reason for us to know. It's just how the world is. I'd like to see more of it and it would make for an interesting setting in a tabletop RPG.- Style & PresentationIf you've ever thought to yourself 'Gee, I wish there were more pronounced chins in anime' then this is the anime for you. What the style lacks in big eyes and small mouths it makes up for in chins. The style is good and the characters distinctive, but the animation makes it clear that this wasn't a high-budget movie. Plenty of times we are treated to people staring in silence and each time we get a still frame with no movement. Some cels are also blatantly looped and the animation lacks smoothness. There is blood and action in abundance, but most action scenes are fairly short and sweet. Nothing overstays its welcome and the movie keeps a brisk pace even though it has plenty of scenes of silent contemplation or rest.- ConclusionThis movie is not a masterpiece, but it's much better than one might think. There are flaws for sure but I still stand by my rating of 8, albeit a weak one. With better written female characters, better animation and a more present antagonist this could have risen to a strong 9. Perhaps nostalgia is part of that, but I really do think that what the anime does well it does really well. a degree it's actually more of something that happens in the background as the movie focuses on the main characters and their events.

What I do want to discuss is the story. Or rather how there is none.!!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!!The film is started with the samurai on the bridge, surrounded by some bandits. As they make their presence, it is clear the protagonist owe them something, but we never learn what it was. As we proceed, we don't learn anything about the protagonist, his past, his skills, only the fact that he was somehow related to the main villain. And that...this villain is back with his supernatural squad. In the best traditions of the old anime, our protagonist doesn't break a sweat defeating them. Jesus, some of them defeat themselves. The only good fight in a whole movie was the final one.Now the Kagerou, a ninja woman and the protagonist's companion. She was there, fought along, fell in love, died. What was the point of her whole existence? She didn't change anything, at all.What I am trying to say is that this movie doesn't have neither a good starting point nor a good ending. Its just another day in protagonist's journey and it brings no joy in seeing him winning. Because he didn't win anything - no money, no woman, no better life. What's the point of a story that goes nowhere?In conclusion, I do recommend watching it because of how good the animation is, but the story is 0/10, it doesn't have one.

I was about 12 years old and it was on teletoon, or maybe YTV?,  late at night. My older brother had seen it before and made me cover my eyes during certain parts of the movie. All I had to compare it to for anime were a few episodes of dragonball.I am sure if you have already seen loads of anime this probably feels low grade but, as a young kid the action, fantasy, samurai appeal got me hooked into anime for years.

This movie is good when you have nothing to do. It would not waste your time, it would only enhance your experience of life.

Its style is different and edgier than that of Studio Ghibli but I would still draw a comparison between the two in sense of beauty. Even the insane amounts of gore is presented artistically.The gore was surprisingly not off putting for me however, insane intensity and number of r4pe scenes were. There were 3 r4pey scenes which I think added nothing to the story but for someones' sick fantasies.The heroin's character was also not well presented. She is supposed to be this independent women ninja who has joined the forces despite her...fate as a woman, however, she is running after a man the entire time and seems to have no backbone, managing to get in the way most of the time. She is mostly there to add something to other male characters. I'm not surprised by this as its an old film but its worth mentioning.The rest of the characters were also poorly developed with not much depth or back story, so much so that the story was hard to keep track of.I have scored this film so highly though because I loved the art and the fighting and the concept of the story and I think is 100% worth a watch.

I mean really cool.""Ninja Scroll viewers will either love it or hate it. It is the anime that will scare your parents. None of that happy, cutesy, Lucky Star dancing shit here. No sir. This is about the supernatural battles, the gore, the tits, the monsters violating our heroine (ewwww), and the revenge. Even though I\'m sure many of us watched this when we were young, Ninja Scroll is not for kids.StoryIt\'s a basic story but well told. The movie opens with magical shenanigans being used to fool people into thinking that there...is a plague in an area. The plan works and people clear out. However, a ninja clan (correctly) thinks something is up and investigates. And into the action we go.The story plays its cards one by one and punctuates it periodically with action. I think it\'s a good pace. I got a little bored and confused in the middle. But once things came together, it got good.The end has some expo dump and a case of the bad guy being bad mwahahahah. It\'s all good because the story is not the high-impact part of Ninja Scroll.CharactersCool. Our swordman is the cool good guy. He\'s the laid back ninja mercenary righting wrongs in the world. The lady ninja is cool. She has her code, her vulnerabilities, and her own motivations. The old man is a government spy who is astute, wiley, and powerful in his own right. He knows what\'s up, fucks around, but is game when it is game time.The bad guys are cool. They all have their own personalities, powers, and drama. I like how the guy with the string and the chick like and don\'t like each other. It was an interesting wrinkle in the characters. They all act the way that demon people would act if they were to team up. I look at them and I see the team from Blade 2. They\'re cool, deadly, and act like villains in a adult film.The characters are cool.Direction & AnimationThe direction is great. This is textbook show-not-tell. Ex: The scene of the sick woman stumbling into town. She tells the townspeople that she is sick. They zoom in on her mouth as she speaks and they overlay someone else\'s mouth speaking the same words. It\'s clear that she is being controlled and there is foul play present. All in ten seconds.The action direction is great. All the strikes are impactful. I hate anime fights where the characters line up and then punch, kick, and block so fast it\'s a blur. There is no danger and no impact. There  is even less meaning if there is dialog going on at the same time. Nobody is going to get hurt. They\'re filling run time. It\'s not exciting.Jubei\'s fight against the stone skin guy is amazing. It\'s short, quick, and to the point. Walking along the wall, horse goes by, hello there, the gut punches that break the lantern (amazing shot btw). And then we get introduced to Jubei\'s quirk. Not a magic power or anything, but rather, it\'s simply a string attached to his sword like a surfboard leash. Fuckin sweet. The stone skin guy launches his boomerang sword intentionally high. Jubei doesn\'t need to dodge, so he doesn\'t. He\'s in his crouch ready to pounce. Flies in single sword swipe. His blade shoots a sonic wave. It lands but it\'s blocked. Baddie taunts. But the sword damage takes its toll.I love that. I love the reversal of fortune in fights. The Avengers had it when Loki caught Hawkeye\'s explosive arrow. You think Hawkeye lands it. But Loki catches it and is all ""nice try buddy"". And then it explodes. What a great action moment. Same with AoT\'s Eren\'s broken jaw punch on Annie in S1. Ninja Scroll has those moments and they\'re awesome.The animation is delightful. It\'s not realistic in the least. It\'s primitive compared to modern stuff but it is incredibly stylized. The characters and scenes have so much flavor to them. The movements are crisp and the physics are great. The fights are not realistic at all but the strikes land and affect the surrounding objects in such a realistic way.The art is fascinating and the shots are amazing.AudioI watched the Japanese version. I don\'t speak Japanese but I could feel the emotion in their voices. It passes.The music is atmospheric. It sounds like a proper accompaniment to viewing Japanese wood block prints.

Released in 1993, Ninja Scroll stood out at a time when most anime was either family-friendly Studio Ghibli works or of the fantasy variety by being an ultra violent and stylistic take on the classic samurai action genre.Jubei is a wandering swordsman who is drawn into a fight against the Eight Devils of Kimon, a group of warriors displaying supernatural powers and led by the seemingly immortal Gemma whim Jubei once decapitated. In his reluctant journey he teams up with Kagero, the sole female...survivor of a previous encounter with the Devils, and Dakuan, a government agent who aims to stop Gemma in his plan to overthrow the government.The story itself is barebones and exists merely for one purpose; for our main characters to initiate combat with each of the Devils. Although the story prevents it from being as deep as other classic films from this period, the action scenes are simply a wonder to watch. Expertly drawn and with some great sound design (especially during the bamboo forest fight), these scenes get to show of the swordplay, abilities and a gratuitous amount of blood in all of its fine glory.The lack of a story prevents any deeper character development, although if there is one notable exception it has to be Kagero. At the start of the film she has to force her ill-fated group to accept her as a member, and throughout the movie during conversations with Jubei we hear her disappointment at being the woman that she is and treated in such a poor way. Which reminds me...Although this film is still enjoyable almost 30 years later and the artistry has aged well, the one thing that has not aged well is the quite misogynistic approach to the few female characters. Of the four female characters in this movie three of them appear naked, one appears only in a sex scene, and another is sexually assaulted twice in the movie. I know that this is a mature anime but for me personally there is just something uncomfortable about it, even if during the first of such scenes it does play an important part for one of the battles and allows for some character development.Despite my own feelings towards certain aspects of the film, this is an incredibly enjoyable anime which provides consistent thrills but the lack of a compelling plot is its one major flaw. survivor of a previous encounter with the Devils, and Dakuan, a government agent who aims to stop Gemma in his plan to overthrow the government.The story itself is barebones and exists merely for one purpose; for our main characters to initiate combat with each of the Devils.

The rock guy at the start was boring to watch because he just stood there whilst ninja stars bounced off him. Jubei's special attack made the fight scenes boring to watch because it's just one slash that either kills the enemy or gets blocked and doesn't...do anything.

Here, we have a film that is indeed a dark and sort of gory example of what we love about this era, the badass and the cheese.

Konnichiwa Anne: Before Green Gables,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5494/Konnichiwa_Anne__Before_Green_Gables,"[""It is a very emotional show. Its main focus is on how people process their emotions. It never loses its focus and there is always something to learn about life in every episode.The animation is a little rough and few character arcs can be boring.Dialogues and characters are the strength of this show. I love the chemistry between all of the characters. There are many characters and Anne influences everyone's life. She is a child and has an optimistic view on life. Most of the characters are adults and have a pessimistic view on life. This contrast in perspective makes Anne's dialogues with other characters...interesting. interesting."", ""For anyone who hasn't read my reviews of two of the Anne of Green Gables books—the original one by LM Montgomery and the prequel, Before Green Gables by Budge Wilson—my history of discovering the Anne series is kind of weird. I actually wound up discovering Anne through the 2009 anime adaptation of Before Green Gables, called Konnichiwa Anne: Before Green Gables. For the sake of brevity, I'm just gonna keep calling it Konnichiwa Anne. Discovering this anime led me to the Budge Wilson book and then Montgomery's book afterward, along with some of the latter's adaptations. I still maintain that the 1979 anime is the...absolute best adaptation of Anne Shirley's saga. I watched Konnichiwa Anne when it first came out in 2009, but after a while, the fansubs for it stopped, and the only subbing group that completed it gave it really, really bad subtitles that were completely riddled with basic mistakes, even going so far as to give characters the wrong names at times! After that, the anime fell into obscurity...but then a YouTube channel called AnimeLog, which was sponsored by Nippon Animation and other anime companies, began streaming English subbed episodes of this on their channel, along with other shows back in 2021. As of this writing, Konnichiwa Anne is no longer on said channel, but luckily someone had the foresight to rip the episodes and post them on torrent sites, so I was still able to finish rewatching the series! That being said, before ARR's subs finished the series, a blogger I used to know watched and reviewed the series on a weekly basis. He had mixed feelings on the show as it went on, and was rather harsh on some episodes. After rewatching the series as an adult...there are some things about Konnichiwa Anne that I agree with him on, but I also feel that Konnichiwa Anne as a series deserves more love than it got.For the most part, the anime follows the same basic premise as a book, and much like the book, the series spends most of its time on Anne Shirley and her early life living with the Thomas family. Interestingly enough, the anime chooses not to adapt the chapters that focus on her parents, Walter and Bertha, along with Anne's early infancy, and instead starts from when she's 5-6 years old onward. Weird choice, but I can understand wanting to focus on the main character right away. Similarly, it shows Anne's life with the Thomases before being adopted by the Hammonds and then when she's at the orphanage, ending as she's on a boat headed for Prince Edward Island. Remember how in some of my reviews for WMT shows, several of them tried to be faithful to the novels while expanding on them and adding stuff for the sake of fleshing things out? Konnichiwa Anne diverges from the original book quite a bit, and admittedly, its attempts to expand on certain characters and stories wound up detrimenting the series.I don't want this to be a negative review, as I do genuinely enjoy Konnichiwa Anne and what it has to offer, flaws and all, so I'll focus on the positives first. While the animation isn't as good as Porphy no Nagai Tabi before it, it still manages to get the job done. The backgrounds are beautiful and detailed, fitting the feel of the series, and the character designs manage to strike a good balance between being cartoony and realistic. True to WMT, there's no exaggerated cartoony faces or characters going chibi. The soundtrack is also really nice as well, from the well-sung opening song by Azumi Inoue to the lovely woodwinds, harmonicas, and fiddles that really make you feel like you're out in the Canadian forests. It's atmospheric and knows when to fit the mood, be it sad and solemn or cheerful and peppy...though there can be some mood whiplash when the very peppy ending song plays right as an episode ends on either somber or dramatic notes.The characters are where things start to get murky. Since Budge Wilson's book creates whole new characters and personalities out of whole cloth, they don't have to worry about being faithful to LM Montgomery's legacy because a lot of them, namely the Thomas, were never shown in the original Anne books to begin with. This comes with its own pros and cons, both in how the anime not only adapts them to screen, but makes changes in said transition. Since the series has Anne spend most of her time with the Thomases, we get to see their family dynamic play out in detail. In some cases, the new additions to the characters and their personalities make them feel more nuanced and well-developed than how they were in the books. For example, Horace was just a bratty kid in the book, with his brothers being even more one-note, but not only do all the kids get more screen time in the anime, Horace as a character is actually shown to change and develop, especially later in the series. Ironically, the most interesting character in this entire anime is, of all characters, Bert, the guy who abuses his wife. The creators did an amazing job of making this hopeless drunk come alive and give him just the right amount of background and depth to really make him steal the show whenever he’s on. Hell, he’s even far more interesting than Anne herself, and...that should not be. Not every character gets this treatment though, and some of the subtle nuances they had in the book got cut out of the anime. For example, when Mrs. Thomas scolds Anne for using the vegetable brush to clean a rug, Anne works for the Egg Man to make money to buy a new one, and when Anne gives her a new brush, Mrs. Thomas is genuinely grateful and even apologizes for not being nicer. In the anime, she uses the brush, but not only does she not thank Anne for it, she even complains about it. Say what you will about how Mrs. Thomas is in the book, but I don't like that the anime got rid of some of the nuances to her character that humanized her because in doing so, the way they depict Mrs. Thomas as continuing to be mean to Anne even when Anne tries to rectify her mistakes makes it really hard to sympathize with her situation as a whole, even taking the time period and how orphans were generally treated at the time into account.Which makes for a good segue into how the side characters are treated in the anime. Anne's classmates in Marysville don't get a lot of focus in the book, which is justified because Anne has to work once she's done with school, so she doesn't have time to really make friends. The anime tries to remedy this by having Anne interact with her classmates more, which on its own would be fine, but a lot of the stories around them and the additions made to them are just cheesy rehashes of stories that were already done in other media before this, namely Emily of New Moon. Boy wants to be a farmer but his dad wants him to be a politician? Been there done that. Mean girl secretly wants friends but acts like a bully because her rich mom tells her not to talk to commoners? Where have I seen that before? The teacher helps her kids become what they want to be? Hey, let's make her into a totally obnoxious feminist who preaches about her morals in a way that'd make her fit better in the 1960s while we're at it! Plus, any interesting traits certain characters have later get retconned because the writers tack on needlessly cliche and cheesy backstories for them that ultimately don't wind up benefiting them as characters. If there's one consistent problem with Konnichiwa Anne, it's that the producers for the anime struggle to tell a story. The series thinks that having the characters spout cheesy, one-line backstories will make them interesting, and any development they end up getting comes off as shallow and one-sided. Which is strange because other WMT shows managed to develop their characters wonderfully throughout their run time, with good examples being Les Miserables, Perrine, Dog of Flanders, Porfy, Annette, and so on. Hell, the series was at its best when it focused on Anne's family dynamics with both the Thomas and the Hammonds, both of which forget the cheese and manage to garner truly genuine and heartwrenching drama. And don't even get me started on the whiny, out-of-place feminist that is Miss Henderson. In the book, she was just a nice teacher, but for some reason the producers made her into a stereotypical inspirational teacher who preaches feminism straight out of an after school special, and she winds up taking the focus away from other interesting characters.And that's not even getting into the pretty blatant continuity issues Konnichiwa Anne has as a series. To be fair, the original book had some continuity issues as well, but they were usually so negligible that you don't really notice them unless you're really looking for them. For one, the final episode tries to wrap things up by showing how the people Anne left behind are doing, but its attempts at doing so made Anne think back on her past with a happy mindset, but in the original Anne of Green Gables, Anne hated her past and never brought it up unless she really needed to. Anne in Konnichiwa Anne never even so much as touched any Shakespeare books, something even the Budge Wilson book got right! Honestly, my biggest pet peeve with the anime is that even though Anne grows up throughout the series, her hair remains the exact same length from beginning to end, even though in the 1979 anime, and the book, her braids are explicitly described as reaching down to her waist, but in the Konnichiwa Anne anime, they stay at her shoulders. Uh, hello?! Consistency should not be this hard, people! One more thing: I had no problem with her voice when I watched this as a kid, but watching this as an adult, I have to admit, Rina Hidaka's voice for Anne is a lot more shrill than I remember it being. I remember liking it a lot when I first watched it, but hearing it again years later, Hidaka-san, who was a relatively new seiyuu at the time of Konnichiwa Anne's airing, pushes her voice pretty high, and since Anne is well known for being a huge talker, I can imagine it not sitting well with people who don't like the more stereotypical moe girl voice. Granted, Hidaka-san doesn't use her Anne voice much anymore, as she's gone on to do other things, like Laura from Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure and Ririchiyo from Inu x Boku SS, both of which have her expand on her range and don't make her sound as shrill. Though to her credit, I'd still listen to her Anne voice over the auditory nightmare that is Misaki Kuno. Or whoever the hell plays Susanoo in the English dub of Little Prince and the Eight-Headed Dragon with his car alarm/screeching alpaca scream that is guaranteed to make you want to put forks in your ears.In conclusion, Konnichiwa Anne as an anime suffers from questionable adaptation choices and its producers being too immature and inexperienced to make this story work. That being said, I don't think Konnichiwa Anne is inherently a bad anime because of this. Could it have been done better? Yes. But it has just as many strengths as it does flaws, even if its flaws are too prominent to just sweep under the rug. I'd still gladly watch this over every bad ecchi or isekai anime any day, and I applaud that AnimeLog YouTube channel for trying to bring this series and others into the US, even if it didn't quite pan out for them in the end. Even if by itself it isn't quite the best attempt at a prequel to Anne Shirley's saga, and I do think the book is better in this case, Konnichiwa Anne does deserve more love than it gets. absolute best adaptation of Anne Shirley's saga.

Plus, any interesting traits certain characters have later get retconned because the writers tack on needlessly cliche and cheesy backstories for them that ultimately don't wind up benefiting them as characters. If there's one consistent problem with Konnichiwa Anne, it's that the producers for the anime struggle to tell a story. The series thinks that having the characters spout cheesy, one-line backstories will make them interesting, and any development they end up getting comes off as shallow and one-sided. Which is strange because other WMT shows managed to develop their characters wonderfully throughout their run time, with good examples being Les Miserables, Perrine, Dog of Flanders, Porfy, Annette, and so on. Hell, the series was at its best when it focused on Anne's family dynamics with both the Thomas and the Hammonds, both of which forget the cheese and manage to garner truly genuine and heartwrenching drama. And don't even get me started on the whiny, out-of-place feminist that is Miss Henderson. In the book, she was just a nice teacher, but for some reason the producers made her into a stereotypical inspirational teacher who preaches feminism straight out of an after school special, and she winds up taking the focus away from other interesting characters.And that's not even getting into the pretty blatant continuity issues Konnichiwa Anne has as a series. To be fair, the original book had some continuity issues as well, but they were usually so negligible that you don't really notice them unless you're really looking for them. For one, the final episode tries to wrap things up by showing how the people Anne left behind are doing, but its attempts at doing so made Anne think back on her past with a happy mindset, but in the original Anne of Green Gables, Anne hated her past and never brought it up unless she really needed to. Anne in Konnichiwa Anne never even so much as touched any Shakespeare books, something even the Budge Wilson book got right! Honestly, my biggest pet peeve with the anime is that even though Anne grows up throughout the series, her hair remains the exact same length from beginning to end, even though in the 1979 anime, and the book, her braids are explicitly described as reaching down to her waist, but in the Konnichiwa Anne anime, they stay at her shoulders. Uh, hello?! Consistency should not be this hard, people! One more thing: I had no problem with her voice when I watched this as a kid, but watching this as an adult, I have to admit, Rina Hidaka's voice for Anne is a lot more shrill than I remember it being. I remember liking it a lot when I first watched it, but hearing it again years later, Hidaka-san, who was a relatively new seiyuu at the time of Konnichiwa Anne's airing, pushes her voice pretty high, and since Anne is well known for being a huge talker, I can imagine it not sitting well with people who don't like the more stereotypical moe girl voice. Granted, Hidaka-san doesn't use her Anne voice much anymore, as she's gone on to do other things, like Laura from Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure and Ririchiyo from Inu x Boku SS, both of which have her expand on her range and don't make her sound as shrill. Though to her credit, I'd still listen to her Anne voice over the auditory nightmare that is Misaki Kuno. Or whoever the hell plays Susanoo in the English dub of Little Prince and the Eight-Headed Dragon with his car alarm/screeching alpaca scream that is guaranteed to make you want to put forks in your ears.In conclusion, Konnichiwa Anne as an anime suffers from questionable adaptation choices and its producers being too immature and inexperienced to make this story work. That being said, I don't think Konnichiwa Anne is inherently a bad anime because of this. Could it have been done better? Yes. But it has just as many strengths as it does flaws, even if its flaws are too prominent to just sweep under the rug. I'd still gladly watch this over every bad ecchi or isekai anime any day, and I applaud that AnimeLog YouTube channel for trying to bring this series and others into the US, even if it didn't quite pan out for them in the end. Even if by itself it isn't quite the best attempt at a prequel to Anne Shirley's saga, and I do think the book is better in this case, Konnichiwa Anne does deserve more love than it gets.""]"
Jigoku Shoujo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/228/Jigoku_Shoujo,"[""Jigoku Shoujo takes place in modern Japan where the internet has filled the lives of many people in this bustling world of technology and sins. This anime portrays the cruelty of the human race, and shows that there are many people in this world that suffer terribly and that, indefinitely, most people wish those that are making their lives miserable would just die and go to hell. And, of course, Jigoku Shoujo, or Hell Girl, is there to exact their revenge.The storyline is wonderful. The anime itself is mainly episodic, and each episode focuses mainly on one person, and the suffering they're experiencing due to...one person. As you read more into the character's lives, and just how badly they're treated, you, yourself, will want to see that red string pulled, just so that person can suffer what he/she's had coming to them, and you'll be anxious to see their horrifying experience before they're ferried off to Hell by Enma Ai, the Jigoku Shoujo.You won't always see the the person's experience in hell, nor will you always see the person being carried off by the Jigoku Shoujo. The main experience of this anime is coming to know and feel sorry for the characters that are desperate enough to call forth the Jigoku Shoujo to end their suffering. If you're looking for humor, this isn't a series to watch. Though it does have it's moments, it's more for the people that enjoy supernatural and paranormal related anime, such as Ghost Hunt and XXXHolic. In fact, if you enjoyed either of these, though the two of them are more humorous than anything else, I recommend putting Jigoku Shoujo, and Jigoku Shoujo Futakomori on your plan-to-watch list.Anyway, this anime is one of those where you'll either love it or hate it. This is a series that got me hooked on the first episode, but if you aren't enjoying it by the third or fourth, then you most likely won't get into it.

When you look inside though, the contents of the box aren\'t very impressive. You\'ll probably never use it or end up giving it to someone else.These are the words I\'d use to describe Jigoku Shoujo, a series strongly recommended to me by a friend. I was told the art...was amazing, and it was. The story, however, is far from it.The art and sound are what constitute as the wrapping paper. Every detail is immaculate, the character designs are vibrant, and every time Ai says ""Want to try dying once?"" it sends shivers down my spine. It deserves a warm hand of applause in that department.However, where the animators succeeded, the writers failed spectacularly. It\'s not that the story is unappealing or lacks interest. There\'s plenty of that. Who wouldn\'t be intrigued about a girl sending evil wrong-doers to hell? The problem arises when each episode\'s format becomes obviously and unbearably identical. Upon watching the second episode, warning bells were sent ringing through my head when I realized that the mechanics were the same each time.Basically: A person is abused or wronged by someone else who is unapologetic and is unable to see their own acts as unjustified. The victim seeks a solution and calls upon Ai for help. However, they hesitate when she reveals that they too would be dragged down into hell when they died. In the end though, the victims are driven to the point of desperation by their tormentors and give in. Jigoku shoujo then proceeds to carry out the revenge. Evil person is sent to hell. Former victim is emancipated, but each look at the scar that appears on their chest as a reminder of what will happen to them when they die.There. Shoot me. I just spoiled at least 20 episodes for you.This anime is episodic, but it\'s episodic to the extreme. Each episode presents a different set of characters and circumstances, but will almost always follow the storyline I presented above. So it wasn\'t until episode 22 that I saw a new type of plot as the season started to wind down to a close.Needless to say, this sort of plot greatly disappointed me. I basically fell asleep on episode 4 and simply skipped 15 episodes. Now this is where I shoot myself in the foot. So, if I haven\'t watched the majority of the show, how can I really rate this as mediocre? ... True. I don\'t have complete authority on this matter, but it simply represents my opinion. I did end up taking the time to read the individual episode synopses on wikipedia, and it indicated that I didn\'t really miss much.I realize there are those who will be completely enraptured by Jigoku Shoujo\'s plot. It\'s simply a matter of taste. I prefer a plot that progresses in great strides, while some love to watch a well formed plot system that simply changes its details while laughing sadistically at the misfortunes that befall the characters. But as always, it\'s up to you, the viewer, to choose.I just hope I wasn\'t too forceful with my bitter commentary. o_o. was amazing, and it was.

Personally i think nothing in RL could be any worse than hell, but that doesnt seem to be the case in this show. Considering how many users complete the contract, it almost gets out of hand . Getting cursed to hell because some lady kills your puppies? Thats a little extreme. But for the most part, most of the stories are pretty cruel and unusal &quot;train wreck&quot; stories that range anything from grade school bullies to betrayal to medical malpractice. Considering the main theme of the story being revenge, they could easily make 100 episodes out of thin air....That is also the problem of this show, the theme starts to get repetitive after about the 7th show. Its the same formula again and again: Tragic story --&gt; Hell request --&gt; Retribution. But just when you think its going to be the same formula over and over again, they throw in a curve ball of a plot twist and introduce 2 new main characters: Hajime and Tsugumi Shibata.Thats when the show really starts to pick up, sortof. The story finally starts to pickup. No more spoilers here but if you lasted this long to reach this point in the series, then you shouldnt have any problem. The artwork is also a little mixed as well. At times its very artistic and beautiful and others it looks like your standard anime artwork. Even the art gets bitten by the repetative bug just like the story. Granted watching Enma Ai get out of the pool dripping wet in her white robe never gets old, but it hardly changes every episode. She even says the same lines over and over again every time as well, it wouldnt be a problem to me except hearing the same 20 sentences over and over and over again almost makes you think youre really in hell. There are plenty of characters drawn up for this show and they all look fine except for one trait... THE EYES. It takes a while to get used to the eyes...those damn eyes...I managed to keep my self awake for every episode and not even once fell asleep from the boredom (only once out of necessity). I think its because i always thought because the eyes were watching me. But I think it really means they at least did a good job feeling something for the characters in each story. On one side, you want to know if they\\'re going to get what they wished for, or you want to know why somone (i.e. tweenie) would want to pour so much hate agaisnt someone. And on the other side you want to know how the person whos being targeted is going to die. Kind of like the train wreck theory (ppl slowing down on the highway just to look at accidents). Aside from the ending, the episodes that interested me the most was EP6, 13, 15, 21, and 23&lt;--very sad alert.The sound effects are one thing that was constant, everything from screaming from terror to the enviromental sounds realy helped create tension and atmosphere. My favorite was in episode 5... you\\'ll know what im talking about when you hear it. Things like that get stuck in you memory banks. All thought the music is always the same as in every anime, meaning they use the same chase music and the same action music in every episode. But the music doesnt intrude to the show, its hardly annoying and it defintitely keeps your atten to whats going on.Overall this show wasnt half bad, given the train wreck sadness theme of the story and a very small dose of lolicon, i would say this show isnt half bad. But it isnt half good either with the overuse of catch lines and and animations. It also kept me at the edge of my seat 80% of the time, and it was good enough to garner a new season (Futakomori). So the goods outwigh the bads in my opinion.6/10 That is also the problem of this show, the theme starts to get repetitive after about the 7th show.

Hell Girl is a very unique anime , each episode of the series focuses on another character going through a tough time before they turn to the legendary girl everyone is whispering about. Of course there\'s a price and even that doesn\'t stop the protagonist. The story\'s weakness is that it\'s very repetitve which doesn\'t rock everyone\'s boat as most of the time the protagonist will pull the string off the doll. However, the story gets...more intense when a detective and his daughter is involved to try to stop people contacting Hell Girl. There are surprises in this series, times when the audience is fooled that the ending might be a happy one. The art is brilliant. The character designs are amazing, especially of Ai and her assistants. The scenes of the Eternal Twilight world are beautiful. The sound is addictive, it\'s very hard not to resist the soundtrack after hearing some of the music from this series especially Snow\'s Opening Theme ""Sakasama No Chou"".The characters were very well thought out, even though the main character send people to Hell you can\'t help loving them. Most of the time you enjoy it unless again it\'s not your thing. Hell Girl is also a good series for discussing and bringing up the issues of bullying, stalking, murder, blackmail, slander, adultery, lying etc... The ending of the series was brilliant and I really can\'t say anything as to why because you have to watch it. Overall, an unmissable series. more intense when a detective and his daughter is involved to try to stop people contacting Hell Girl.

Overall, an unmissable series.', ""Title: Jigoku ShoujoManga, Live-Action Drama, Anime: Jigoku Shoujo was adapted into a manga after it finished its original TV run, with art and story done by Miyuki Eto.  It began running in Kodansha's Nakayoshi magazine in the October 2005 issue, is still running, and has, for the most part, had an original story line and plot changes, though some episodes from the anime do get their own manga chapters.  Del Rey has licensed it Stateside, and the third volume is due on August 5th, while it stand at six collected volumes in Japan currently.A live-action spinoff consisting of twelve half-hour episodes began running...on TV on November 4th, 2006, and finished its run on January 27th, 2007.  There's not a lot about it, so I don't know how similar or dissimilar it is to the original anime.  It will also not be covered in this review.Speaking of which, Jigoku Shoujo was originally a twenty-six episode anime, and ran on Japanese TV from October 4th, 2005 to April 4th, 2006.  It was produced by Studio Deen (famous for their work on Fruits Basket and Fate/Stay Night) and directed by Takahiro Omori (famous for his work on Baccano! and Gakuen Alice).  It has been licensed Stateside by Funimation, and the sixth and final volume was released on May 20th.Story: There is a rumor that if there's someone giving you absolute hell and you want to get revenge on them, there's a website that you can access only at midnight, known as Hell Correspondence.  Once the name is submitted, Ai Enma (aka Jigoku Shoujo/Hell Girl) will appear to the client and give them a straw doll with a red string wrapped around its neck.  If the client wishes to take revenge, then all they have to do is pull the string and Ai and her helpers will ferry the person to hell.  However, there is a small catch to all this: Once the compact is made with Ai, the person who took revenge will go to hell once they've died as well.Jigoku Shoujo is, at it's heart, a Revenge of the Week episode.  Once you've seen two or three episodes, you have the basic outline of every episode: Introduction to person being tormented and torment, tormented accesses Hell Correspondence, Ai and tormented meet up and she tells them the conditions and such, tormented ends up debating/angsting over whether or not the deal is worth it, things are escalated in some way, and the tormented pulls the string, sending the tormentor to hell.  Rinse and repeat for twenty-three or so episodes.I'm really kind of disappointed, because there's almost no background about Ai until the last three or so episodes of the show, and even that is minimal, not to mention that the background of her helpers doesn't even get mentioned.The fact that the set up doesn't change one bit throughout the entire show, even when the show introduces two people who try and thwart Ai (the reporter Hajime and his daughter, Tsugumi, who has a psychic connection to Ai) does not help the show at all.  Hajime and Tsugumi were only really vital to the plot of five episodes total; with the others, they could've not been around, and the same thing still would have happened, which makes their existence kind of useless.  Also, the fact that Hajime has a tendency to come off as an incredible bastard at times, not to mention a bit of a hypocrite, doesn't help things. I understand what the creators might've been trying to do, here, but they missed the mark with these two.The quality for the Revenge of the Week stories average out to about half and half; half are excellent and have incredible writing and twists, and the other half are kind of... eh.  The characters are always memorable, though.Admittedly, there is a second season, Jigoku Shoujo Futakomori, that can hopefully rectify these mistakes.Art: The art that has to do with the world that Ai occupies when she's not working, the revenges that they take on the tormentors, and to do with her helpers' and her own character design are absolutely stunning.  The colors for these are incredibly rich, and the designs in general are beautifully done.As for the part that has to do with our world... eh.  The backgrounds are done well, and the character designs for the people of the week start to blur together after a certain point and become incredibly generic, but they manage to remain slightly distinct.There is some stock footage, but it isn't all that bad.Music: The music for this is absolutely amazing, in my opinion, and one of the first things I really noticed about the series.  There are several recurring themes throughout the show, and they are extremely memorable.  The music is a mix of Western orchestration, rock numbers, and traditional Japanese instruments that always seems to catch my ear.The OP's a pretty standard J-Pop female upbeat number, but is still pretty catchy, all things considered.  The ED is absolutely amazing, though; a typical J-Pop female ballad that uses cello and traditional Japanese instruments for instrumentation, and has lyrics that very directly relate to the show.Seiyuu: The seiyuu for this show did a good job, as always; no voices that seemed out of place or painful.  Though I do kind of pity the seiyuu who had to play Ai, as her lines were mostly the same throughout all twenty-six episodes; hopefully, they'll vary up the dialogue for her next season.Length: If they cut out the crappy half of the show, we have a show that could easily have fit within thirteen-ish episodes, and still been a pretty good show.  That cut probably should have been made, as most of the good part of the show doesn't really start to happen until the halfway or so mark.Overall: A really good concept that ended up lacking a bit in its execution, and in the long run, would've benefited from cutting the actual amount of episodes in half, so that the best parts of the show stayed intact, with beautiful art and music, and seiyuu that could have used more varied lines, really.  But maybe its issues can be rectified in the second season, Futakomori.Story: 7Art: 9Music: 9Seiyuu: 8Length: 7Overall: 40/50; 80% (B ) on TV on November 4th, 2006, and finished its run on January 27th, 2007.

That cut probably should have been made, as most of the good part of the show doesn't really start to happen until the halfway or so mark.Overall: A really good concept that ended up lacking a bit in its execution, and in the long run, would've benefited from cutting the actual amount of episodes in half, so that the best parts of the show stayed intact, with beautiful art and music, and seiyuu that could have used more varied lines, really.  But maybe its issues can be rectified in the second season, Futakomori.Story: 7Art: 9Music: 9Seiyuu: 8Length: 7Overall: 40/50; 80% (B )"", 'Having filled Japan with rumors that aren\'t taken seriously at first Jigoku Shoujo is an avenger.Sometimes reality hits you in the face when you thought it was sweet, and you end up in tears.Fear, Hatred, Anger and revenge, this is an unbreakable chain that represents the dark side of humanity and it is Jigoku Shoujo who weilds that chain.This anime has a great story augmented by the episodic chain that reveals smaller stories evolving around the suffering or others.

That\'s what I would succinctly wrap up Hell Girl as. The main crux of the issue is this; Hell Girl is a morally and intellectually lazy at best, disingenuous at worst, show, that manages to stay partially afloat with a couple good lead characters and some occasionally deviously twisted stories.Let me get out of the way that the art, voice acting, and sounds are all wonderful. Distinct and atmospheric, they often times accentuate the best parts of the show.However, Hell Girl suffers perhaps most greatly from being very formulaic and repetitive. Most episodes boil down thusly: we have,...""Persona A"" and ""Person B.""Person A is wronged by person B.Person A gets Hell Girl and her cronies to kill and send Person B to hell immediately.Person A, as a result of this, goes to hell when he/she dies.The first half of this show is setup just like that; episodic in nature, new stories each time. At first, this manages to be a fairly convincing and exciting setup, because the stories seem fresh and relatable. After a while though, the show wears out its welcome. The structure gets too repetitive, the people, too unsympathetic, the stories, too hard to swallow.Firstly, I am not entirely sure what this show is trying to say, if anything. For Hell Girl to take on such a serious and close topic to many people (afterlife), it damn well better to a good job of broaching the subject. I don\'t think it really does. Most characters in the show are comfortable with the idea of not only sending another person to hell for eternity, but going themselves. This is tough to swallow, especially when, as is the case in Episode 10, there isn\'t much wrongdoing between the two people involved!Is this a show a twisted look at karma? Do wrong, and you\'ll have wrong done to you? If so, it\'s over the top. Sure, some of these characters are cruel, but an eternity in hell? That\'s harsh! And what does it say about the character who sends them to hell? They\'re being even more cruel if you ask me!So, maybe the whole show is about trying to get us viewers to think on the old Gandhi quote ""an eye for the eye makes the whole world blind."" Well, that doesn\'t work either, because just about every character is perfectly willing to not only trade an eye for an eye, but enjoy it too. Not only that, they usually get a huge short term benefit! Blind my ass!And what about Ai (Hell Girl) and her gang? They swoop along to enact revenge by torturing their victim in their final moments, before killing them and sending them to hell. We never really learn anything about them until the very end of the show. It\'s too bad, because it makes them out to be much worse villains than I think the show creators intend.A lot of the conflicts in each episode could also be healed with some communication and time. Physical abuse is one thing, and certainly bad, but a lot of the conflicts in the shows are monetary in nature, which, while potentially crippling, is not permanent for a lot of these people considering how young they are. If Person A thought about their predicament for a few days, they probably wouldn\'t be so quick to pull the proverbial trigger. Unless the show is trying to completely slam immediate emotions for being irrational or some such, in which case, whoopdee do. Not particularly riveting nor well displayed.And that\'s the problem with this show. I don\'t know what it\'s trying to do. Maybe it\'s not trying to say anything, which seems really bad, especially considering the nature of what the show deals with; revenge, death, afterlife. Not stuff to be scoffed at, in this case. If you\'re going to present a show with people lining up left and right to send a rival to hell forever and themselves too, you better have a pretty good thematic core. There isn\'t any here. It feels almost like some dude just wants to piss all over people and take revenge on people through an anime he is creating. Haha, enjoy hell, characters!Maybe I am reading too much into this. Maybe I need to look at this simply and try to enjoy it. In that case, it fares a little better. When the show finally gets some continuity going, we are introduced to Hajime, a disheveled, freelance journalist who learns of Hell Girl and seeks to stop her. He is a wonderful character; flawed but likeable, morally strong but conflicted. His struggle with his young daughter, who begins to feel sympathy for the people choosing to send their enemy to hell, becomes a well-done, central conflict. Their bonding and relationship is an excellent display of subtleties that the rest of the show seems to lack.Certain episodes are generally thrilling. Others are generally boring. It\'s indicative of the show as a whole having an inconsistent pace. Some episodes are allowed to naturally develop, showing a gradual buildup of a characters wrongdoings. Others take 20 minutes to set up a scenario, then instantly drop a bunch of cruelty on a character in a matter of seconds.Still, some of the stores are cynically enjoyable, certifiably twisted in a thrilling manner. It\'s just too bad that the show falls short elsewhere, and can never get a consistent level of thrills going. It\'s a watchable show, but also, ultimately, a forgettable one.5/10 ""Persona A"" and ""Person B.""Person A is wronged by person B.Person A gets Hell Girl and her cronies to kill and send Person B to hell immediately.Person A, as a result of this, goes to hell when he/she dies.The first half of this show is setup just like that; episodic in nature, new stories each time.

Available in three designer colors: red, blood-of-your-enemies red, and YOUR-blood red!...Anyways, I was serious:  This series will probably bring out your inner sadist.  Read below and find out.Story: 8.  The premise is quite interesting and different.  However, I don\'t appreciate the episodic nature used for 90% of the episodes.  The only REAL story occurs in the last 3, where you actually learn about Ai herself.  Until then, the episodes are predictable and formulaic:  Person gets wronged, person goes to Internet to contact the Hell Correspondence,...person receives doll, person angsts over whether or not to pull the thread, eventually does, then the evildoer is sent to hell.  They switch it up a bit in between, but for the most part, this is pretty much what you can expect.  (Until Hajime, the reporter, starts trying to meddle; not like he can stop the inevitable.)Art: 7.  Very hit-and-miss.  The animation in the ""real world"" (where most events take place) is mediocre; it\'s quite disappointing when you compare it to other anime of the time.  A lot of it is sheer laziness, specifically in the areas of generic, bland, repetitive character design, poor facial expressions, and inconsistent proportions.  However, the visuals when we get to visit Ai\'s ""world"" (or whatever you want to call it), or see someone on their trip to hell, or just anytime Ai is present on the screen at all, you can expect to be dazzled.  Also part of said formulaic-ness of the series is the overuse of stock footage--specifically in the sequence where the thread has been pulled and Ai is on her way to ""fetch them.""Sound: 8.  The music as a whole is pretty good.  The OP is a generic J-pop piece that doesn\'t really fit the series at all; the ED, on the other hand, is a great, solemn piece called ""Basting"" with lyrics and tone that perfectly match the mood.  Even its NAME is suiting.  The soundtrack has some memorable gems, too.  The sound effect synchronization with actions occuring on screen is kind of off at times, though, and they could be better.  The voice actors (English) are pretty decent, but Brina Palencia as Ai DEFINITELY steals the show.Character: 7.  Like I mentioned, most of the character designs are pretty bland.  By FAR the most attention was obviously given to Ai (which I\'m totally fine with, but it DOES make looking at the supporting cast pretty boring).  Some characters are easier to sympathize with than others.  They do a pretty good job painting the picture so you end up wanting them to pull the string too.  The characters generally can provoke a decent emotional reaction from you and, in spite of generic character design, are somehow able to remain memorable in their own ways--in spite of said generic-ness.  (Not like I really care to remember most of them.)Enjoyment: 9.  Like I said at the beginning, this show may bring out the inner sadist you never knew you were.  It\'s very easy to hate the evildoer, and when the time finally comes, you *may* find yourself yelling, ""YOU DESERVE IT, MO\' F**KA!""  I always looked forward to the bastards that abused/wronged the character in focus to get what they deserved and couldn\'t wait for that string to be pulled.  By far the most enjoyable part for me was the torment/torture sequence the offender was usually subjected to before actually being ferried to hell.Overall: 8.  Hell Girl was on the fast track to being a 7, but saved itself at the end with the 3 episodes at the end about Ai\'s back story.  It does some things really well (premise, enjoyment, and Ai herself), but severely lacks in others (animation, a lot of the characters).  I wouldn\'t have minded the episodic nature if it had only taken up ~6 of the episodes and the rest was focused on Ai, Hajime, and Tsugumi.  It would also have been nice to actually get more in-depth back stories on Ai\'s helpers (all we get to hear is ""she saved us from eternal damnation"" or whatever, and is never mentioned again).  Maybe this will be fixed in season two.  We\'ll see though.Also, they seemed to have tried to cram some aesop about vengeance not being worth it in at the end, but honestly, the majority of the series was indicative of the exact opposite (bar a couple cases).So all in all:  Definitely watch this if you like seeing justice being served--evil people getting what they deserve.  Just don\'t expect an amazing overarching plot. person receives doll, person angsts over whether or not to pull the thread, eventually does, then the evildoer is sent to hell.

Just don\'t expect an amazing overarching plot.', 'Oh Hell Girl, you have disappointed me. I somehow managed to sit through 20 episodes, which was an absolutely dreadful experience because every episode might as well have been the same thing.The main problem with the series comes from the fact that the story uses its basic structure as a crutch for damn near every episode. Every time it gets anywhere near leaving its crutch behind, it suddenly gets scared and races back to the crutch and clings on to it with dear life. This might not be a problem if the stories themselves were well written with interesting characters, but half of the...time I was just yelling at the unbearable stupidity of the characters for maybe not trying to go to the authorities with their problems because half of the time that would have worked just fine. For the times where I could understand why the use of the Hell Girl was necessary, it was still laziness on the part of the writing because every single episode ended the same way anyway. Even after going to the authorities, one girl still pulled the string to summon Hell Girl even though by the time she did it it was too late to change anything and the person she pulled it against was already going to jail for life. Most of the villains are only moderately evil and not a single twist occurs where someone admits they were wrong. The story introduces a father and his daughter (who oddly enough refers to her father by first name) as they try to discover who Hell Girl is, but it basically amounts to them watching the episodes occur around them because nothing they seem to do prevents the Hell Girl from being summoned. After having nothing but the same thing happen for 20 episode, it\'s really hard to want to continue. I expected to care about the character of the episode and look forward to him or her (mostly her and they\'re pretty much all young adults or high schoolers) pulling the string, but I was just looking forward to the end credits because the series failed to convince me his or her reasons for pulling the string was completely necessary. As a result of not writing the characters in a way to make me care, every episode made me wish I\'d gotten a nice calming tooth filling instead.To top it off, the stories themselves as individual episodes just aren\'t very interesting. I\'m assuming it wants to be a horror genre show, but it comes off as more cheesy than anything else and as a drama, it\'s just too rushed to be properly dramatic. There\'s really no other genre it could fall into, it\'s not just ""average"" in its genre, it\'s pretty damn bad.Ridiculous amounts of footage are reused, and it\'s not particularly interesting footage, it\'s ritualistic footage and once you\'ve seen it once, it\'s boring. Brina Palencia is a voice actress I normally like, but either she was terrible as the Hell Girl herself or Hell Girl really was written to sound as boring and wooden as humanly possible in which case Palencia nails it. Nothing else in the dub stands out, but the Japanese seemed just as uninteresting, it\'s not very good at engaging the audience either way.There is no good reason to watch this show, it wants to be so much more than it is and it\'s nothing shy of painful to watch instead. Avoid this at all costs or watch a few episodes online first to see for yourself why this is a title to be avoided. time I was just yelling at the unbearable stupidity of the characters for maybe not trying to go to the authorities with their problems because half of the time that would have worked just fine.

I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s better than I expected, but it was enough to entertain me.For the first episodes, I thought it was too formulaic. The episode would start presenting the background of that episode&rsquo;s petitioner (the one who seeks revenge), who are usually teenage girls, by the way. We see what&rsquo;s making that person ask for revenge from the Hell Girl, or Enma Ai. Finally, that person finally asks for help from Enma...Ai through the Jigoku Tsushin (Hell Correspondence) site, and shortly after, Enma Ai appears, hands the straw doll over to the petitioner and explains her deal. At first the petitioner hesitates, but he or she pulls it anyway at a moment of desperation. Enma Ai and her posse &ldquo;delivers vengeance&rdquo; and everyone&rsquo;s happy at the end.That was the standard formula throughout the whole series, but when Hajime Shibata and his daughter, Tsugumi Shibata came into the picure, things became more interesting. These two try to stop Enma Ai and her killing spree, and in the process, we find more about them. They&rsquo;re a good pair to add to the mix of already fascinating characters. Enma Ai, of course, is very mysterious and captivating. You can&rsquo;t help but observe her every move to find more about her.  Her three companions are just as intriguing. My favorite is Ren, but I also like Hone Onna and Wanyuudo. I just wish that more background on them was given throughout the series.The &ldquo;antagonists&rdquo; were great as villains too. They really were evil, that you would think that they deserved to be punished and sent to hell. It makes you want to become a better person and hope that no one thinks of cursing you.A fine cast of voice actors for this one. Mamiko Noto isn&rsquo;t really one of my favorite VAs, mostly because most of the characters she plays are kind of boring or dull (at least for me &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t like Yakumo from School Rumble and Hecate from Shakugan no Shana). I did like her work as Shimako in Marimite, because her soft voice fit that role perfectly. I guess that soft voice worked for Enma Ai as well, because when Enma Ai&rsquo;s not sending anyone to hell, she does seem like a delicate and soft spoken girl. I also liked Masaya Matsukaze&rsquo;s work. Ren Ichimoku has to be my second favorite character that he played, next to Kyouya Ootori of Ouran High School Host Club.The animation was a bit inconsistent. Enma Ai&rsquo;s face would change at least three times each episode, and towards the end, the same thing happened to Tsugumi. Although I have to say, I love the character design. No weird hairdos or hair colors for this one. The character design is also current and fresh. As for the colors, mostly dark colors, as well as colors that would go well with black (such as red and purple) were used a lot. It really fits the feel and mood of the anime.As for the music, I like the opening song a lot. It&rsquo;s also very current and trendy, but I can&rsquo;t say the same for the ending song. Truth be told, whenever I get to the ending sequence, I take a little nap and wake up just in time for the preview. I just don&rsquo;t like sad and mellow songs. The BGM was good, and it does intensify the scenes (specially the one that&rsquo;s played whenever they get on when the vengeance) but sometimes the BGM is too much, as if it&rsquo;s over the top. Good job with the SFX too &ndash; the bells and the chimes coupled with creepy humming is very eerie.All in all I would say I liked it, but I would&rsquo;ve liked it more if it didn&rsquo;t stick so closely to the formula I was talking about in the beginning of my review. I plan to watch the second season soon, and I hope it&rsquo;s better than the first season.

If you want to know what's the plot, read the SUMMARY, and don't mark me down for not saying anything about the story. I tell you what elements are impacting in the story and what my opinion is. ANYWAYS...Jigoku Shoujo, or Hell Girl, is an anime that gets the viewers into thinking about their morals, an idea similar to Death Note, but not like the concept of controlling fate. Rather, this anime has you searching for why one would wish ill-will against another, and whether...or not you would send somebody to hell if you were in their position. Basically this anime embellishes on it's supernatural feel and does that very well. I had chills in some scenes were glimpses of Hell were portrayed. The plot idea was fantastic and characters were very interesting. However, there was room for improvement. The beginning was somewhat slow and really didn't have anything going, until maybe the 9th or 10th episode. Plus revenge plots began to look the same.Overall 9/10, don't get me wrong, this anime was pure gold and should be in the check-off list for all otakus! or not you would send somebody to hell if you were in their position.

Basically, it's all about a damn insolent girl with her subordinates going around and scare people by creating hallucinations, trying to get them to concede their faults.The whole series is awfully repetitive. And the arrogant appearance of that pathetic hell girl makes me sick. That pipsqueak acts so pretentiously as if she's absolute right to do anything to anyone as she pleases and to judge or set moral standards. She's blatantly domineering, and sadistic. None of these characteristics would turn me off so much without the combination with the arrogance and pretension. "", 'Nothing was making me to expect much from Jigoku Shoujo as there is not so many good horror anime, being relatively old, like 11 years (now it is 2016)I had a thought that there is no point in reviewing this anime as all the ideas were mentioned like hundred times,but after checking a bunch of reviews I found out the lack of some important ideas featured in this anime.In this review I am not urging everyone to watch it saying ""it is a must watch series"", however this anime really impressed me. It is a sad story and it may remind you of the worst...time in your life, but it is teaching very important moral ""revenging you dig two graves, one for your enemy and another for yourself""So the main idea of this anime in most episodes is hate driving people mad, mad enough to agree on a contract that in their afterlife they go to hell, as a result the object of their hate is immediately send to hell. To do so just untie the red thread on this straw doll. Unfortunately being filled with hate people cannot think clearly and understand the consequences of this contract. So these people hate someone enough to kill at cost of own life. Fortunately there is Hell Correspondence at your service and you do not have to get your own hands dirty. You can get rid of a person you hate and leave a happy life (may be). On the other hand you keep that knowledge that after you die Jigoku Shoujo is going to send you to hell. In my opinion bearing this tough thoughts cannot become a happy life.Before taking the decision to untie the red thread people have very perplexed thoughts for a moment understanding that being send to hell is like the worst thing happening to them. Some try to resolve the problem on their own and at some points you can see a shine of hope, faint, but visible way to salvation is just not to untie this cursed red thread...Art. For me in this anime art looks like one of the strongest sides of this anime. Enma Ai in here kimono is so beautiful that you do not get bored of seeing her again and again for many episodes. Keep in mind that this anime has rather dark atmosphere and a lot of dark scenes are set pretty impressive. Effects illustrating supernatural phenomena for me looked splendid despite that it is more than 10 years old anime.Usually I do not say much about music, music is just fine here, it creates the right atmosphere and almost perfectly fits the situations. Some people might say that it is not  so good and soundtrack variation is not rich, but I assure you while watching all the series the idea that music is bad never got to my mind.

As many people have stated and I'm sure any viewer will notice after a few episodes is that this series is VERY repetitive.  I would say that there is a reason for it in giving viewers a small taste of the hell Ai has endured for many years.The music is wonderful, animation is stunning, and the characters are a real treat.  Some of Ai's team it was easy to guess where in Japanese mythology they came from and one of them was a...really tough one.

I expected much more from Jigoku Shoujo. Sure, the series was ok but it could have been better.Let's go into more detail...The concept of the story was unique, i'll admit that. My only problem was HALF the series was VERY repetative. Half of the total number of episodes focused ONLY on random people asking Ai Enma for their vengance to be granted. Half the series went something like this: a.) Random person wants someone sent to hell. b.) They ask Ai Enma for help. c.) Random person gets their revenge. It wasn't until someone...actually tried to stop Ai Enma did the story get more interesting.The series was also suppossed to be scary or frightening to some degree. Personally, I didn't find it to be any of these. It lacked the impact to terrify me for more than 1 milisecond. Although, I found Ai Enma's way of sending people to hell very amusing.....not scary......amusing.The animation was ok. It wasn't eye candy like Kanon or Clannad. It was just average.The songs were well done and deserve praise. I loved the opening and the ending song. The bgms of the series also go well with the situations they're played at.The character development could have been improved. While Ai Enma and the recurring characters in the story were presented very well, the series failed to focus on the three dolls/spirits who assist Ai. I expected to know exactly who they were and exactly what kind of spirits they were by the end of the series but I ended up consulting wikipedia in the end.All in all, Jigoku Shoujo is average. It's postive points equal its negative points. It is enjoyable but there is room for impovement.

I was looking for a horror-ish anime, and then I remembered reading a review for Jigoku Shoujo. So I figured that it couldn't hurt to check it out.I was captivated by the simple plot that grew and progressed as the story developed. But it moved to slowly sometimes and then forced a lot on you as you moved towards the end. I also though that the side characters leading the story were a little weak or sometimes down right obnoxious.There are sound...cues in it that remind you of the event or begin to symbolize events all together.Suprising the lead characters were well designed and had more personality then I would have expected. The dialogue was was either dark and humorless to sometimes being downright funny.The art was fantastic, everything was well polished and time was spent on the details of the little things. The opening was amazing, it was really beautifully done, more to captivate though then to open it.Altogether thought,it was a really nice anime, clever for there is nothing like it.I would suggest it, but get about half way though before you find out it isn't for you.

Is only in the second part of the anime (ep8~16) who he show us a plot but he continues repetitive. Only in our third and last part the anime become nice, and finally develops our plot, even though this is a little confusing.In my opinion you can start the anime in the 8º episode and after seeing him jump for...the 17º episode.How I already said the first part of the anime is very disappointing.

Although I share the same opinion, I think that it displays so many problems of the human behaviour that I cannot help but like it. The fact that it is very fragmented is a way to show that anyone can hate, reasonable or not, and that hatred is a matter of perspective.The characters simply make sense. I mean, it may look weird for someone that is new to anime or Japanese...culture, but if you have a bit of cultural experience, everything makes sense. Most of the main characters, however, do not evolve or suffer from an inner fight. Probably the most interesting point of view to follow is Enma Ai\'s (which was totally expected), but I sure as hell like that little Tsugumi girl.As for the sound, I must say the soundtrack was chosen wisely. I definitely love both the OP and the ED (been listening to them for a few years now, yet I never knew they were part of an anime), and the BGM fits.The art is also debatable. Many told me that it looks somehow unnatural and that it is not the ""classical"" anime look, but damn, I love it! So yeah, I guess it\'s a matter of taste...All in all, I really enjoyed the series and it made me think a little bit more about behaviour and feelings in general.

This series definitely has a lot to offer on the supernatural/mystery sector with its 72 episodes distributed over three seasons airing between 2005 and 2009, but would it also offer the horror I was searching for?In a nutshell, this series is about a mysterious girl named Ai Enma who, over the course of the whole series, fulfills people´s wishes...to send another person they have a grudge against to hell with the help of her three henchmen. It is a very episodic show where every episode follows the same routines and patterns. We learn about a person suffering from torture, see how they log on to the internet to access the “Hell Correspondence” and then get to witness all the events leading up to the victim to finally decide to send his tormentor to hell for a costly price.In the first season, the above described scenario repeats itself for the first eight episodes to introduce the viewer to all the characters. By episode 8, an overarching plot featuring a reporter and his daughter who get increasingly involved with Hell Girl as they try to stop her gets established, and this is exactly the point in the show where it gets extremely good. The way the story then builds up from there and increases tension until the epic climax in the last three episodes is just very well done and kept me on the edge of my seat. I marathoned the first season within two days and couldn´t wait to continue the rollercoaster ride.The second season, Futakomori, manages to keep up the high level of entertainment without blending in an overarching storyline as it offers hands down the best and most cruel hell-sending cases of all three seasons. Futakomori  also blesses us with episodes telling the story of Ai´s mysterious helpers, who by the way are all valuable assets to the show, and how they became her companions one by one until finally in the end, her own moving and tragic past is revealed to the viewer. “Hajime-chan”, the reporter from season 1 as well as his daughter are definitely missed on the other hand as their replacement Kikuri, a strange little girl, is no way near as interesting as the pair from the first season. Anyway, like in season  1, the build-up to the ending is simply amazing and in my opinion remains the biggest strength of this generally great series.Season 3, Mitsuganae, unfortunately cannot keep up with the high quality of its predecessors. While I will not call it an atrocious show, it still is more than a little disappointing after watching all the amazingness that happened before over the course of 48 episodes. The main focus in this season is on a high school girl named Yuzuki who gets possessed by Ai.  While this is not necessarily a bad idea, Yuzuki´s personality is as uninteresting as it gets and the same goes for Hell Girl´s new helper Yanawaro, who for some reason is introduced out of nowhere and is totally unimportant to the season. Not only is Mitsuganae a step backwards in the character department but the hell-sending cases within the high school are just completely ridiculous. While the writers were able to really tell superb stories that made the audience lose their sense for what´s wrong and what´s right for two seasons, it seems like they lost inspiration here as people are just going to hell for basically nothing all of a sudden. The only thing coming remotely close to the quality of the first seasons is the ending once again. Thank god they were able to remain the drama and close out Jigoku Shoujo well as this saves the third season to some extent along with the improved quality of animation.Overall, I was once again not able to find the horror elements I was looking for and it seems like the ability to scare me to death will forever be an absolute monopoly to live-action movies. However, as a mystery/supernatural show Jigoku Shoujo does very, very well indeed and I totally recommend you watch this if you like mystery. The best thing about it is that the show does not require you to watch all three seasons. Each season has a satisfying ending to it that concludes the anime and the ending of season three is not more or less “open” then the other 2, so feel free to skip Mitsuganae. The first two seasons are definitely a must watch!To close things out I also recommend you watch this series subbed unless you don´t mind getting used to new voices from Futakomori onwards as only the first season has been  dubbed unfortunately.I give Jigoku Shoujo an overall score of 7.5 points, but it would be a 9 for the first two seasons! to send another person they have a grudge against to hell with the help of her three henchmen.

While the writers were able to really tell superb stories that made the audience lose their sense for what´s wrong and what´s right for two seasons, it seems like they lost inspiration here as people are just going to hell for basically nothing all of a sudden. The only thing coming remotely close to the quality of the first seasons is the ending once again. Thank god they were able to remain the drama and close out Jigoku Shoujo well as this saves the third season to some extent along with the improved quality of animation.Overall, I was once again not able to find the horror elements I was looking for and it seems like the ability to scare me to death will forever be an absolute monopoly to live-action movies. However, as a mystery/supernatural show Jigoku Shoujo does very, very well indeed and I totally recommend you watch this if you like mystery. The best thing about it is that the show does not require you to watch all three seasons. Each season has a satisfying ending to it that concludes the anime and the ending of season three is not more or less “open” then the other 2, so feel free to skip Mitsuganae. The first two seasons are definitely a must watch!To close things out I also recommend you watch this series subbed unless you don´t mind getting used to new voices from Futakomori onwards as only the first season has been  dubbed unfortunately.I give Jigoku Shoujo an overall score of 7.5 points, but it would be a 9 for the first two seasons!', ""Horror is a genre that strives to invoke fear and dread in people. Many a scare tactic and dark twist have been concocted to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, there are many times when the genre is so focused on scaring its audience that it chooses shock value over humanity. Thankfully, this is not the case with Hell Girl. Though often cold and unforgiving, Hell Girl has a humanistic core, and because of that it is all the more effective as a horror. After all, the most terrifying thing is not some big bad boogieman, but rather the flaws of humanity itself.Rumor has it, there is...a website that can only be accessed at midnight. The Hell Corespondents... All you have to do is type in the name of a person you hate, and the Hell Girl will make that person disappear from your life; forever to suffer in the depths of hell. However, everything comes at a price, and the price of your revenge is your very own soul. For when you die, you will also be damned to suffer in hell. It is a steep price, however, the temptation of sweet vengeance might prove too strong for those who truly crave it.Hell Girl is a morbid and sophistic horror. Rather than going for cheap shocks and chills, it relies on slow building dread. Each episode features a tortured individual seeking to escape the cruel fate given to them by removing their torturer from their lives, or maybe simply looking to take revenge on someone who did them wrong. Whatever the case may be, the circumstances are always dire, highlighting the cruelty humans are capable of, and the damage their desires, self-righteousness, and vanity can bring. This is by far the most unsettling part of the entire series, such grim examination of the human heart is endlessly more frightening than any supernatural monster could be. Some of the most mortifying episodes are the ones that involve a neglected friend, an overbearing mother-in-law, and a friendly nurse.Of course that is not to say that is the only source of the show's scares. Hell Girl herself, Ai Enma, is quite the chilling presence. Her cold, stoic demeanor exudes a menace that an adolescent girl shouldn't be capable of. Her appearance is incredibly beautiful and discomforting at the same time, especially while she is wearing her falling-flower kimono. The show as a whole has a beautiful but deadly look. This is especially true for the surreal landscape of constant sunset where Ai resides. Hell Girl's visuals a are at their best during the vengeance scenes, nightmarish sequences filled with disturbing imagery, which have intricate scenarios of their own. The sound adds to the atmosphere considerably, you can just feel the mounting tension listening to it. The ominous chants and haunting orchestration of the music fits the horrors seen on screen all too well, and lighter bits of music serve well during touching moments or times where people are just going about their daily lives. The show looks good even when it is not in full flux horror mode, and the only real shortcoming is the short occasions of choppy character animation, which are easily forgivable. No doubt this uniformly strong package is due to no small part to the direction of veteran Omori Takahiro, director of great works such as the refined (and discomforting) romance Koi Kaze and the brutal romp Baccano; who once again proves his versatility with this bone-chilling horror.There is one big drawback for this show however, its extremely formulaic format for episodes. The show stubbornly sticks to its revenge-of-the-week structure to the point that someone being sent to hell by the end of every episode is as expected as the sun rising in the morning. This makes the show kind of hard to take in big doses, and will wear thin many a viewers' patience. To remedy this the show throws a reoccurring father and daughter duo into the mix, and this might just be the best decision the show makes. Their addition gives continuity to the show, and just as importantly gives voice to the moral debate of the shows themes. Hajime, the father, feels that what Hell Girl is doing is wrong and is determined to talk those who have contacted her to find a different route than revenge. Tsugumi on the other hand doesn't see why her father is so against Hell Girls services, though she still reluctantly helps him find those who have contacted Hell Girl. They are pretty important plot-wise as well, as Tsugumi has a strange connection to Ai, at times getting visions of her. This, as well as Hajime and Tsugumi's relationship, comes to a head in the shows powerful conclusion.Hell Girl is a rare gem, a horror that uses humanity to provide its scares rather than simple shock value. It takes you into the darkest pits of human cruelty and selfishness, giving dark insight on the most frightening things of all. The insistantly formulaic structure does hold it back a bit, and will doubtlessly not fit all tastes.

A story which revolves to a creepy and a psychological way as the main character Enma Ai fulfills someone’s desire to make revenge on someone. As Enma Ai being the Hell Girl and the ones responsible in doing such hideous actions, it brings such mystery to the story as in each episode there are different tales to tell with different personalities to view. The main attraction here would be the procedure of how the person is getting sent to hell, little by...little, knowing the reasons behind it. With the development of the story, there are minor arcs & major arc to consider, as minor arcs fills up and strengthen the background of the story while the major arc follows the path and the reason behind the whole series.Art & Animation...It is quite good for the art & animation. The series use a dark backgrounds that support the creepiness of the story and animations that is just the right thing to see in a horror genre. They are also drawn and animated based on each scenario including different and detailed sceneries, but sometimes there is similarity to be seen.Sound...Screams, shouts and other BG music and sounds that pertains to the scenario of the story gives a nice effect throughout the show, The OP song is quite a catchy song and ED that has a melodic and slow tune, also voices of characters is quite okay.Characters…Enma Ai, the protagonist of the story, a mysterious and gloomy girl that leaves an expressionless face and grants desires of taking revenge. There are also three helpful followers to help with her, Hone Onna, a not too old or not too young woman, Wanyuudou, a pretty much of being of a wise man, and Ren, has a power to see anywhere he wants. These three people give such little impact throughout the show. While Shibata, Tsugumi and Shibata, Hajime, daughter and father and also have quite similarity on its perspective, these are normal people that has been affected by the actions of Enma Ai, having a great part throughout the story.Enjoyment…The series is quite fun to watch as different people getting sent to hell as they beg and please to Enma, Ai. Also being quite a humorous show and giving horrific sounds and background music that supports the essence throughout the show, it is entertaining. But the disappointment here might be the usage of the same method that consists of repetition of scenes, which becomes unbearable to watch as the story goes.Overall…A little different way to tell a story which focuses on its horrific and psychological theme, but in the end be wary that this series is kind a repetitive in a way as each episode use the same method which is quite boring to watch, but on the other side, the main story is quite something & unique that contains humorous and strange arcs that might hook you up. little, knowing the reasons behind it.

I knew about Enma Ai already, but only the fact that she was the main character. Because the ongoing animes were so disappointing, I decided to take a break from it and watch an entirely different show. After seeing that there was full episodes of Jigoku Shoujo on Youtube, I decided to watch that and give it a go.Jigoku Shoujo is about different people who wants to take revenge on someone they hate; whether it be a bully, an annoying coworker or even a murderer. They can take revenge and...send that person to Hell, via the Internet (how amazing is that?). The site is called Hell Correspondence, and it rumoured to be only available to access at midnight and to those who want revenge. It is then Enma Ai\'s job as the Hell Girl to fulfill her client\'s request with the help of Hone Onna, Wanyuudo and Ren Ichimoku.Jigoku Shoujo\'s plot is pretty much straight forward - short stories that lasted around one episode usually containing a person they would focus on and an antagonist. The person would ask help from Enma Ai, and throughout the episode would reveal the backstory of that individual and why they want to send someone to hell. By the end of the episode, the antagonist usually dies and sent to hell. This worked quite well for a few episodes, but then started getting a little bit repetitive. It was the same thing over and over again, and in some cases even had the same sort of plot as an earlier episode. However, I do commend them for their creativity in being able to portray different scenarios per episode and except for the few occasions where it was kind of the same, it was generally very well done. At a later stage of the anime there became a distinct plot of Enma\'s background and why she became the Hell Girl. Another recurring plot was that of Hajime and Tsugumi\'s and why Hajime tries to do the opposite of Enma and to stop the people from committing revenge. Plot wise, I think Jigoku Shoujo does what it is supposed to, and the finale of the first season was definitely excellent and opened up the possibilities of further seasons.Now the characters of Jigoku Shoujo were quite diverse. There are new characters introduced each episode, but of course, they don\'t really appear again. However, there are recurring characters such as Enma Ai, who appear every episode. Now, it is really not possible to develop the main characters since pretty much all the episodes were focused on the minor characters each episode. The last 5-10 episodes were the only ones used to really develop them and to provide history on the main characters. Of course, the most interesting character out of the bunch is no other than Enma Ai herself. I asked a lot of questions involving her character and towards the end, I feel like some were answered in great detail, but some were still left a little fuzzy. The other one that struck me the most is Hajime. he is really a love or hate character, and for me, I really hate him. It might not be him and his actual background, but his role as the stereotypical type who wants to ""save"" the people around him. Moreover, he utterly terrible at saving people so I thought, why bother with it? But towards the end, I guess I did start to like him a little bit. Just a little.Now, Jigoku Shoujo\'s art is amazing in some parts, but not all the time. Now, I don\'t know why this is the case though (*cough* Studio DEEN *cough*) but overall it was pretty mediocre. Nothing really stood out for me, but nothing was really horrible about it. I gotta say that the character designs of Hone, Ren and Enma were superb and loved it whenever they were on the scene, especially Hone. The animation as well was pretty mediocre - except Enma\'s nagajuban. I mean, how can one not like moving flowers on her dress? The musical score of Jigoku Shoujo was impressive too, ranging from the soothing calm nature to the action scenes towards the end of each episode. The opening song wasn\'t terrible exciting, and really gives off a different feeling to the anime and portrays it so differently, one might think it came from a different anime. As for the ending, I thought it was really entertaining to listen to and loved the transition between the final scene of each episode into the ending song.Overall, I think that Jigoku Shoujo was an interesting anime to watch. Although it is a little repetitive at the beginning, the ending is truly worth it. The art and animation is mediocre, but doesn\'t really disturb you from enjoying the show. The musical score is very wonderful and was a pleasure to listen to. Watch it if you like bad guys going to hell :DRating: A(81/100) send that person to Hell, via the Internet (how amazing is that?).

The anime tend to go for sheer style over things like character development or logic and generally end with gruesome deaths tinged in irony. In the case of some of the shorter works, the formula tends to work: Vampire Princess Miyu, Pet Shop of Horrors, and even the more recent and slightly longerRequiem from the Darkness are all fairly worthwhile titles despite having basically zero character development or coherent storyline.Unfortunately, this is where Jigoku Shoujo falls short: length. With so many episodes to...fill, the show quickly dead-ends into the same exact formula. Just as a magic trick gets less impressive the more times you see it, Jigoku Shoujo\'sexcellent premise is bound to lose appeal by the 17th iteration of the same basic episode.People might think I\'m exaggerating, but not only is the plot basically identical for each episode, there are in fact entire stretches of dialogue that only change by one or two words. Feeble efforts are occasionally made to mix the show up a little, but adding different-colored sprinkles to the same goddamn cup cake does not make a new experience.This wouldn\'t be so frustrating if the first episode hadn\'t been so entertaining. The show\'s actual premise is delightfully creepy, a true example of a modern Japanese ghost story. If the creators had actually continued to come up with original ideas, the storyline could have really shaped up into something special. As is, we\'re left with a disappointing narrative some people might like but almost no one will love.AnimationThe show has a good stylistic feel to the entire thing, but falls short in a lot of areas when you compare it to other contemporary works. The designs of the one-episode characters all begin to blend together after a few episodes, and movement is generally choppy and minimal. There\'s a bunch of reused (albeit admittedly cool) animation from episode to episode, and the entire visual experience is tainted by an action scene at the end that looks like absolute ass.SoundOMG GOGOGOGOGO Noto Mamiko!!!!!!!1111!!!1...at least, that\'s what I\'d usually be saying, as I love her work in just about every anime I\'ve heard her in. In this case, however, all the director has her do with her character (Enma Ai) is speak the same handful of lines over and over again in a sleep-inducing monotone. The experience is somewhat comparable to hearing a master musician play one note continuously over the course of two hours - a freaking waste of talent.The rest of the voice acting is unmemorable either way, and the music does an ok job at setting the mood, but does suffer a little from overuse. I didn\'t particularly enjoy the OP, either.CharactersIn every episode, the anime focuses on a new set of characters, which translates to minimal development or depth. These characters generally fall into one of two archetypes: victim and villain. From there, it\'s a slow agonizing process of watching them sink into the dull abyss of inevitability. This works for a while, but after a few episodes the total lack of characterization makes caring for them extremely difficult.There is a small set of recurring characters, but most of these are even less developed than the ones that go away at the end of every episode. Enma Ai, the title character, remains an emotionless enigma until the final few episodes, at which point her back-story feels decidedly underwhelming.The sole beacons of light in an otherwise tedious cast are the ""mortal"" recurring characters, Shibata and his daughter. Their past actually ends up being somewhat touching, and is definitely the high point of Jigoku Shoujo\'s development. Unfortunately, this isn\'t enough to save the show.OverallThe old cliché is that variety is the spice of life, and it certainly applies here, where literally every portion of the anime is reused somehow. Even though the show starts strongly, this becomes irrelevant when the writers refuse to expand on their initial ideas.Imagine your favorite episode of your favorite TV series.

The review may have some really slight spoilers!- Story - 9/10At first, the story may look like it is just about a mysterious website that only shows its self at midnight and only to people who has hatred to someone, but in fact, the story is more than that. In every episode, there are repetitive moments and therefore you may find it boring, but repetitive moments are there to show us what Enma Mai's life looks like.Grieving people, hateful people, desperate people and sinners all over and every day is the same. not only that, she is also immortal. We learnt that there are...evidence about her from Azuchi–Momoyama age ( 1573–1603 ). All these years she lived in an endless nightmare, and the only thing she could do to help people was taking revenge on their behalf. as much as doing this hurts herself, there was nothing she could do about it. As I said at the beginning, episodes are a bit repetitive to shows us a piece of what Enma Ai lived so far. It is there in order to make the ambience better.- Art - 10/10Even though there are some cliche features about character's physical appearance, It is still well done. Protagonist's emotions are well reflected and there is no repetition of among the characters.- Sound - 9/10There is not much to talk about. Ending and opening lyrics are really deep and fits the anime. Also without Enma Ai's theme, atmosphere would be incomplete,- Characters - 10/10Most of the characters are temporary, they are just there to shows us the real face of the world we living in. And when it comes to main characters, most of them are really unique.Most of them are from Japan culture, mythological people, therefore they fit each other so well. Even the Jigoku Shoujo, Enma Ai, just a character from mangaka's imagination looks like she is also a mythological person because of the story and character cast.- Enjoyment - 8/10I know the reason why most of the episodes are repetitive and stationary and I am finding them necessary but still, to be honest, I can not say that they were really fun, they were necessary to make ambience and story complete. Other than that anime was great.- Overall - 9/10I find the anime great because of protagonist's mental and physical features and the ambience itself. And I would recommend to people who is into slow paced mystery animes or people who like gothic, haunted themes, ( for example anime called Another ) evidence about her from Azuchi–Momoyama age ( 1573–1603 ).

Even the Jigoku Shoujo, Enma Ai, just a character from mangaka's imagination looks like she is also a mythological person because of the story and character cast.- Enjoyment - 8/10I know the reason why most of the episodes are repetitive and stationary and I am finding them necessary but still, to be honest, I can not say that they were really fun, they were necessary to make ambience and story complete. Other than that anime was great.- Overall - 9/10I find the anime great because of protagonist's mental and physical features and the ambience itself. And I would recommend to people who is into slow paced mystery animes or people who like gothic, haunted themes, ( for example anime called Another )"", 'I am not lying .

Hell Girl in English.Jigoku Shoujo is the answer to the question of ""What if we made the grim reaper weeaboo bait as fuck?""But no that\'s actually really inaccurate despite your titular character sporting looks that could just bring some japanophiles to hell.Hell girl is an episodic train of 24 episodes, each fleshing out instances of ""People in power"". The ""victim of the week"" (quoted because they\'re no saints themselves) is given a choice to send their nemesis to hell on the spot.No form of high horse, no ""necessary evil"", told like how it is; nobody is a saint. That\'s where majority...of the show\'s story point\'s stem from. (I give the show a 9/10 in that aspect) Every episode is chock-full of down-to-earth despairlikeThink of a bowl of curry. Add prawn paste chili, wasabi and jalapenos and for good luck cook it in Godzilla\'s fires. If hell girl was curry that would be what hell girl is. Taking despair and giving it power alongside a troublesome decision.(Oh hey I just summarized 90% of the show.)What\'s keeping it from the perfect 10 is well, the fact that a curry metaphor summarizes 90% of the show. It\'s rather linear. It\'s almost a legitimate argument that you\'re watching the same episode again and again with a few anomalies until  the the final effort to give the show closure of sorts which is great and all but is it perfectly paced? Haha no you need more than 3 episodes if you wanna wrap the show up properly.The Art gets a 10/10 just look at the fucking eyes drawn god do you see Enma\'s lovely red jewels no I don\'t mean her nipples look at her eyes I actually feel like having intercourse with those rubies and nothing else those red eyes are EVERYTHING about Ai*ahem*The sound\'s a downer here at a 7/10. While the the Opening and ending songs (ED especially Karinui is amazing) are solid the show provides very little variety of an OST and what\'s present isn\'t too powerful on its own. It\'s (understandably) in relation to the show\'s ""One-dimensional"" but that doesn\'t change the fact that it\'s grating to hear the same pieces when there\'s at least the decency to come up with new scenarios every episode.The characters are at a 10/10 here considering if the hell correspondence was an actual thing there would be events that unfold as written in the anime. That\'s enough to justify the 10/10.What do I say about the enjoyment part? I like watching people get shit on by the Hell correspondence team in their Executions and I especially love all that human jazz that goes on before the victim finally pulls the string. What\'s stopping me from giving it a 10/10 for enjoyment?Overall while I\'ll have it as rationally a 9 I\'ll always frame it up as a 10 on my list because I\'m a faggot lol of the show\'s story point\'s stem from.

I tried avoiding spoilers the best I could.I started watching Jigoku Shoujo with very high expectations. My friend had praised this anime to heavens and the general idea about a girl who takes upon people\'s revenge and ferries the wrong-doers to hell is very intriguing.Story: Jigoku Shoujo should be reviewed in two parts, because the second half of the show is just so much better than the first half. The first half of the show is episodic and specially the first episodes until about 10th episode or so, are quite repetitive in their plot.About...2/3 of the anime is quite episodic, with each having their own plot and side characters. It is really interesting to see how much people are suffering and what they have to go through in order to contact Ai Enma (Jigoku Shoujo / Hell Girl) and send the person they hate to hell. It often feels even good when the suffering person pulls that thread off the straw doll\'s neck, sending the wrong-doers to hell. Despite this, the anime is sometimes even a bit dull with the ever-repeating plot line.Towards the second half of the anime, the cases start to differ more from the basic formula and the cases get even quite bizarre. It isn\'t always necessarily the evil people who get sent to hell, and for good reasons. This brings up lots of questions about Ai Enma and her past, why is she doing the job of the Hell Girl?By the middle of the season, two of the other main characters begin appear more often as well. The journalist Hajime, and her daughter Tsugumi, who has psychic abilities regarding Ai Enma. They are trying to find out the truths behind the Hell Girl\'s past and reasons for why she\'s taking people to hell. More and more questions about Ai Enma start to pop up. The story starts to build up in depth and intensity towards the last quarter of the season.The episodes past 20 saved the anime for me. Ai Enma\'s past is revealed and the story loses any of the repetitive dullness it had until that point. After the slow start of the story, the ending wraps it up quite well. Many of the questions about the backgrounds of the characters are answered. Still, many questions remain even after the anime ends, which asks for watching the next two seasons as well.Art: Art in Jigoku Shoujo is quite good, even if it\'s not something never seen before. The art fits the ""dark"" theme of the anime really well and creates the atmosphere the show deserves.Characters: Sadly, Ai Enma and the people (the three magical dolls) surrounding her are pretty much the only interesting characters in Jigoku Shoujo. Because most of the show is episodic, there isn\'t much of a background created for the ever-changing side characters. The two other main characters, the journalist Hajime and her daughter Tsugumi, who are pursuing the Hell Girl have quite big role in the show, but personally I dislike them, specially Hajime. I despise him specially after his past is revealed.More questions about Ai Enma start to arise as the story progresses. Why is she doing her job as the Hell Girl and why does she always take the people to hell, even if they are not bad people? Why is she so emotionless? The past and reasons behind the existence of Hell Girl are intriguing and towards the end of the show there\'s rapid development in her character and past.Ai Enma is one of my favorite female characters of all time.Her line ""Care to give death a try?"" gives me the shivers every single time.Sound: The soundtrack (including OP & ED) of Jigoku shoujo is great. I can\'t say it\'s one of my favorites, but it fits the show perfectly. I can\'t really imagine how the music could be better for this show, it really brings the feeling of the anime up a notch.Overall Jigoku Shoujo was a really good anime. Without the slow 2/3 of the story I could have scored this anime 10. The first half wasn\'t bad but it was a bit too slow for the show to be perfect. Ai Enma and the story surrounding her are really interesting, I just wish they had got deeper into the pasts of the other characters too.I love all the mysterious and symbolic things in Jigoku Shoujo, the music and art are very good as well. The show wrapped up the end well, answering most of the biggest questions. Despite that, it left too many unanswered questions which I hope will be answered in the next two seasons. 2/3 of the anime is quite episodic, with each having their own plot and side characters.

This is a series with signs of a grey moral line through the actions of Ai and her companions as they use their Hell Correspondence site to send those tormenting the main character of an episode to hell. This raises some questions on whether or not there is justification in exacting vengeance on someone who causes you to suffer.The series mostly runs in an episodic format where we are introduced to a random character suffering from the actions of an antagonist...and Hell Girl gives said central character the choice of banishing the subject of their misery to hell at the cost of being sent there themselves at the end of their life. Said character ponders over the decision until they get to a breaking point and then sicks Ai and her group on the antagonist of the episode. This is what ultimately contributes to one of the show's major flaws. While there are twists in some of the episodic stories and two characters (Hajime and Tsugumi) later become entangled in the affairs of Hell Correspondence, the developments essentially play out the same in nearly each episode and they can get repetitious. Also many of the targets of vengeance by a central character in each episode come across as so shallowly evil, that the show forces you not to care for them as they get tormented by Ai's companions before being banished to hell.Pushing through such repetitious developments does have its rewards though. The connection with the two characters introduced to Ai is slowly unveiled throughout the show as they become more familiar with the affairs of Hell Correspondence. Hints are dropped about Ai's past which are eventually fully revealed later in the series to give the viewer enough sense as to why she exacts vengeance for those desiring it, the same also in the case of Hajime and Tsugumi. Some episodes even cast aside the black and white morality setup from most of the show's other episodes reflecting on characters victims of their own tragic circumstances which Ai is shown to have regrets over casting into hell. There isn't any background mentioned about Ai's three companions in the Hell Correspondence, but I guess that is what sequels are for.Hell Girl features gorgeous looking clean visuals with bright colors, vast scenery and plenty of detail with settings and character designs. Animation is mostly consistent shown particularly well with settings as wind is blowing around branches and Ai's group are using their powers to torment the sufferers they are recruited to banish to hell, though some animation frames appeared to be reused kudos to the repetitious plot developments and repeated use of flashbacks hinting to the pasts of Ai and the Shibatas.Overall, I did enjoy Hell Girl, despite running into its major flaws, as the hinted focus on Ai and the Shibatas combined with the grey morality that comes up with the job of Hell Correspondence makes it a decent romp if you can press through the repetitious developments of the earlier episodes. and Hell Girl gives said central character the choice of banishing the subject of their misery to hell at the cost of being sent there themselves at the end of their life.

When I picked Hell Girl to be my next watchable anime, after the glory of Death Note, I was pretty sceptic, to say the least. Revenge, as a base of the story, can be done either so, that it\'s bearable at best, or insufferable, at worst - said in short, I tend to hate revenge-stories. Lucky for me, Hell Girl was that lucky bastard, that slipped between the radar, and managed to actually be something... well, out of this world, to say...it humbly!The story, for a 26-episode- show, is actually pretty devided. The first half is episodic, with no actual story involved what so ever, but more like a plot-based formula. Firstly, there\'s a person, usually some poor, unfortunate high school student, who for some reason or the other, get deep with the sharks. He/she suffers alot, pleads for salvation for their predicaments, hears this rumor about a Hell Girl, who takes revenge on those, whos name she\'s given, Hell Girl offers her goods and services, but always for a price - nice touch - and the rest, is up to our victims. Take their revenge, or be a good/stupid person, and endure their suffering, as well as the consequenses. Needles to say, that never has revenge not been served - evil is always sented to Hell, and covenant with Hell, is thus made. I truly liked this first half of the story. It was simple, intriguing in both it\'s morality, themes and it\'s consept. Revenge comes with a price, but is there ever such time, when the price is too much to pay, no matter what the circumstances? And what if the vengeance doesnät bring that long-waited salvation, but even more suffering, than before that? Most of the victims, wishing for a revenge, were just mere children, and it really made me think, would I ever be in a situation, where I would wish for a revenge, with a price being to be sent to Hell myself, after I was dead? Propably, yes, but still... pretty impressive, I\'d say!The second half of the series... not so good. Actually, no good at all! There\'s now this pesky reporter, with his admirably black and white- moralled/naive daughter, searching for anyone, who\'s even somehow connected with the Hell Girl, and as expected, sticking their ugly noses in where they don\'t belong, saying that revenge is never a right thing to do, no matter what the cause, or the circumstances! Okay, bullshit on that one! I hated this reporter, and his naive morals, from the bottom of my heart, and I hated, how by intoducing him, we also lost this wonderful, formulaic experience, with it\'s somewhat perfectly black and white morals, that fortunately, up until now, left out all the hypocrisy, and preaching on and on about values and morals of humanity - I feel like I\'m back in 90\'s for crying out loud! If I were in any of these predicaments, wowing for a vengeance for my grievance, I sure as Hell wouldn\'t want any goody-two-shoes to stop and tell me, that despite all the wrongs and pains in my life, forced upon me by some sadistic/sosiopathic lunatic, my tormenter doesn\'t still deserve to be sent to Hell, because ""it just isn\'t the right thing to do""! What a absolute rubbish! Atleast the girl was nice supporter for me, saying it straight like it is. If you\'re a bad person, doing something bad to another, you should be punished, and sometimes, revenge is all that is needed, to cleanse the soul, in order to move on.Another serious beefer that I had, during the second half of the story, was the Hell Girl herself. I liked her more, in the first half, when she was just this very emotionless, quiet, lifeless, and overall lacking any kind of free will, motives, or desires, thus being almost completely with no real personality. Sounds crazy, I know, but in order to support this morally black and white story, I truly liked a protagonist, who was just a mere entity, instead of a actual person, not really saying much, nor doing much, only appearing when needed, building up this bearly unseen moral ground of choise, and consequense, and if so chosen, sending people to Hell, for vengeance. I didn\'t want her to have a tragic backstory, with lost love and sad death! I didn\'t want to learn her reasons and motives for what she\'s doing! All I wanted to know of her, was that Hell Girl, is just some not-evil-not-good entity, that\'ll come to you, who seek for a revenge, gives you a chance to do so, while still demanding full payment afterwards, of course, and sends our tormenters straight to Hell, with no chances for them to atone! That\'s the Hell Girl that I liked! Not some bitter and vengeful spirit, who misses/hates her lover-cousin! Yeah... japanese, man! Geez...Overall, despite all it\'s errors and some unneeded minor details that I never really wanted to learn, I really liked this anime - can\'t you tell, by the score?! It\'s serious - definitely not for a weak-minded, or animal-lovers! - with some truly grotesque little stories and tragic, poor unfortunate souls. It\'s morally interesting, and has some truly facinating points and highlights of humans as a species, that\'ll always seek for a revenge, no matter how much we want to believe in truth and justice - for some, revenge is justice. Hell Girl isn\'t really anything groundbreaking, for not ever taking any actual time to process nor judge it\'s own morals, or ways to deal with sorrow, loss and despair. It just gives us this ""suffer and endure""- scenario, with a chance to get rid of your griefances easy and simple, with a little price to pay, after you die. It could have worked a lot better as a episodic piece, with no actual story in it, but as it is, it\'s pretty impressive, considering the themes, morals and values alone.Despite the problems, wound in the second half, this is actually the best revenge-story, that I\'ve ever seen, and I would gladly recommend it to anyone, who has a taste for a little vengeance.Story: 8Art: 8Sound: 7Characters: 9Enjoyment: 9Overall: 9 it humbly!The story, for a 26-episode- show, is actually pretty devided.

It could have worked a lot better as a episodic piece, with no actual story in it, but as it is, it\'s pretty impressive, considering the themes, morals and values alone.Despite the problems, wound in the second half, this is actually the best revenge-story, that I\'ve ever seen, and I would gladly recommend it to anyone, who has a taste for a little vengeance.Story: 8Art: 8Sound: 7Characters: 9Enjoyment: 9Overall: 9', 'So have you ever wanted revenge towards someone, so much you would sacrifice your soul and send them to hell?StoryThe story is basically about different people in each episode who decide to do what I have asked as my opening  question. Anyway while this is going on a ""reporter"" seeks to stop it. In all the story is very unique and very tragic. Depending which episode  almost anyone can relate. my one problem which was only small, was that some small things like someones dog dying and a girl sending a soul to hell for it, along with her own soul. I...mean I love the story but it is nonsense no one in their right mind would do this. I did like the fact they used real like examples of people out for vengeance.ArtI loved the art! it could be creepy, sad, and happy all at once. It stood out a lout and it was just plain out amazing. I do however wonder why the decided to draw a school girl dress on Ai through out every episode. She didn\'t really go to a school. It is just small, but overall the art was amazing. Some things I wished had more variety than drawing the same thing over and over, however like I said it was still a great style of art.SoundNow just the same as the Art, but I find the music fit perfect in every episode. I loved the music when a creepy, happy, sad, or just every scene when it played. It stood out to me a lot. I especially loved the i intro and ending. So that was a big plus. I can\'t say much for sound or art but I said what I think so it is good enough.CharacterEvery character that continued to show during the series had some kind of character development. I do think that the development could have been better for some. the build up was wasted at the end I find. I may be saying this because certain characters don\'t continue on to season 2, but I really thought that the ending would have more impact considering all the build up. I still liked all characters though. All the supporting characters too.EnjoymentWell what can I say? I found almost everything perfect. I realize my score is a little rough but I have my reasons. I still really enjoyed watching, I can still remember watching the first episode and feeling so exited to have found such a wonderful anime. This will always be one of my favorites and so will the next couple of seasons too I hope.OverallWell, why are you still reading this? Get on to the anime! This anime was nearly PERFECT.

And it ends with the protagonist becoming Villain instead of the ending I'm bored with the process And presenting the issue of bullying alone Without talking about any other matter I don't like that some of the characters are not villains, but go to hell because of their irresponsible human self-indulgence. Even with the conditions he ultimately had to...be sent to hell. But for me, I do not agree with the actions it affects other people.

It might make me like this a bit more, but For me now, I would say that it is bad."", 'Just like many others here, I was recommended this series and the premise is what catches most people\'s attention at first: ""it is an anime about a girl who will avenge you sending someone you hate to Hell, however on doing so, when you die, you will also be sent to Hell"".Most of the episodes will follow the same pattern someone will feel they have been wronged (each with different reasons, some more compelling, others not so much), they will get in touch with Ai Enma, she will explain the whole ""when you seek revenge you should dig two graves"" and if they agree they...have toi pull the red string of the straw doll, something will keep them from pulling and by the end of the episode they pull. For the first 7 episodes, we will see Ai Enma doing the same thing, from the eighth episode onward another protagonist, Hajime Shibata, is introduced: one that finds out about her and wants to stop people from seeking revenge. This give a bit of fresh air to the series so, despite the same ""I can avenge you, but you will go to Hell too"" it keeps pushing you to see if Hajime will be able to do anything against Ai Enma. I must tell you that sometimes even this ""fresh of breath hair"" feels a bit rotten too, it is just frustrating seeing how the writing on this is so bad.There is not much to talk about the protagonist, we have 4 beings working for Hell: Ai Enma, responsible for making the contracts, she is cold and tries not to get involved on human matters, but a few times some cases sadden her, her character develops too late; Wanyuudou is both the carriage that transport Ai to reap revenge and the straw doll that bond Ai to said revenge, he seems to care a lot about Ai, even though sometimes tries to hide; Ichimokuren and Skeleton Woman (Hone Onna) mostly work on the illusion right after the person to be taken revenge on takes part, (it seemed like the original writer wanted to at least allow that person to recognise their mistakes, but I guess they dropped that idea) so Ai can say her iconic phrase, after some sort of enchantment, ""care to give death a try?"". Then we get Hajime and Tsugumi Shibata, father and daughter, he tries to stop people from getting their revenge because revenge isn\'t the answer, Tsugumi is trying to understand the whole revenge business and somehow functions as an antenna capturing Ai\'s steps, we are shown some backstory on them, but little to none character development. No point talking about supporting characters since 99% of them will be shown only once.The art on the protagonists are great, maybe even for today standard would be considered good, but the supporting characters that only appear on every new contract between them and Ai are bland and some even look like each other - even if they aren\'t related at all. So kudos to the protagonists and outside scenarios, other than that it is quite bad.I didn\'t like the opening, I would skip every single time, it doesn\'t ""match"" the anime, the ending fits perfectly, a morbid melody to it.I wished they tried to bring more variety to the episodes, maybe even a quicker pulling on the string and showing more of the consequences of it, or how some characters regretted their choice, or characters trying to trick Ai somehow (having someone pull the string for you), something more, it just felt so predictable, I liked though some cultural references, like in episode 17, however if you don\'t know Japanese culture - and I\'m not claiming I do, I am sure I missed a lot of things - you will miss some details that will make the episodes even better. have toi pull the red string of the straw doll, something will keep them from pulling and by the end of the episode they pull.

And by similar I mean DEPRESSING AS F£$K. The protagonists do change as well, but you could say that the protagonists actually play the sub-plot part whereas the random people appearing for one episode play the main part.The anime\'s theme is about a site, which you can only access if you feel deep hatred inside your heart... In other words everyone can easily access this, and it even becomes a telephone app....(no, really, it does). This was never explained but it is assumed that each person can only use this site once. If you write the name of a person you hate on that site, you receive a Hell Doll. If you pull a string from the doll, the person whose name you wrote immediatly goes to a hell trial (supposedly you can avoid going to hell if you succeed in those trials. Throughout the series noone ever did.) which is pretty much the ""ironic punishment"" section before literally going to hell. After that, the site\'s user gets a tattoo, meaning he/she (usually a she) will also go to hell when they die (without their soul having a chance to go to heaven etc etc), though ""when"" they die isn\'t affected.Each episode usually stands on its own, with the main protagonist of each series working and scooping around on the background, but otherwise remaining a minor character. The real protagonist is usually the site\'s user of each episode. We see him getting tortured by his harsh reality (oh and I DO mean harsh), how usually it\'s a specific person\'s fault (bullying, buckets of it) and how the protagonist decides that his/her soul is not worth it if his/her life is that miserable.While in the first few episodes the anime does fool us that if your name is written on that site you\'re one sick psycho, as the episodes go on it starts becoming MUUUUUCH more complicated than that. People make mistakes, sometimes the people who they send to hell even protected them from worse things to come, sometimes it was just misunderstandings, sometimes it is the evil psychos who use the site and innocent people go to hell for no apparent reason. What you start believing is a mechanism for justice soon becomes muuuuch more complex and questionable. In addition the outcome isn\'t always what each episode\'s protagonist thought it would be.As the series go on, you don\'t get used to it, it actually becomes worse. The Hell Girl herself (basicly hell\'s employee for commiting the ""murders"" and collecting the souls) has a phenomenally depressing backstory. Her helpers also share gruesome tails. And lastly the main protagonists... For the first season it\'s pretty sad. For the second season\'s protagonist story it is pretty darn depressing. For the third season it is ""well here is the rope, you know what to do"".  Since (when I was 13-14) I made the mistake of watching all three series in a row, I actually went through depression for 1-2 months.To sum it up, what I really liked about Hell Girl is that it actually promotes the value of human life, and therefore shows how big a dillema it is to actually kill somebody. Even better there is no fear of getting caught since the protagonists of each episode never have to actually interract with said ""to-be-missing"" person, so it\'s just a matter of conflicting ethics and emotions most of the time, as well as comparing the happiness your own soul MIGHT achieve one day compared to how miserable your current life is. If you want a good way to get depressed or some read food-for-thought, there you have it! (no, really, it does). This was never explained but it is assumed that each person can only use this site once. If you write the name of a person you hate on that site, you receive a Hell Doll.

Hell Girl is NOT a horror anime..so if you fear blood and gore, don\'t worry. Hell Girl features little to none of that. Just the occasionally skulls and blood splatters is all.Secondly, I loved this anime so much. Its interesting and keeps your brain going. There\'s always a twist no one expected right around the corner. I have re-watched it about 4 times. Once I even watched it in reverse order....(don\'t ask....)In the first 12 episodes or so nothing is really given except that Hell Link is a website of which...anyone can access at midnight to enter in the name of their abuser for Ai Enma (Hell Girl) to come in contact with the person and propose a contract. But undoubtedly, each episode which contains a new persons story is always entertaining and interesting. After you get past those beginning episodes, new characters appear that add on to the story that is figuring out who this ""Hell Girl"" really is. You then begin to learn the story of Ai and the others of whom help her with the Hell Link.ALL IN ALL~FUNimation did an excellent dubbing of it.The Animation and art is beautiful.The story line isn\'t plain or meaningless.I recommend this to anyone who loves surprises and twists in an anime.It is also for the more paranormal kind of people.I highly recommend this to anyone who is okay with an anime not being happy go lucky moe kawaii desu ne. anyone can access at midnight to enter in the name of their abuser for Ai Enma (Hell Girl) to come in contact with the person and propose a contract.

Maybe that’s a bit too harsh, but it’s because of how much this series let me down. In short, this series is about revenge, it asks the question, “if you could send someone you hate to hell, at the cost of also sending yourself to hell after you die, would you?”. Sounds enticing doesn’t it? It portrays this question through letting people access a website at a certain time, then receiving a doll with a red string. If the string is pulled, their victim of choice is...sent to hell post-haste. As aforementioned, while you get to live the rest of your years peacefully, once you pass your soul will also be taken to hell. The person who takes you there is Ai, the hell girl, and her followers known as the Hell Correspondence. After rumors start spreading about people being dragged to hell, a blackmail artist and his daughter (who has some sort of telepathic link with Ai) spend the series getting to the bottom of the hell correspondence and asking themselves if this is something they should be intervening with. Now, with a premise this awesome, why do I hate it so much?It’s because this premise is diluted by the repetitive nature of this show. If you’ve seen one episode, you’ve seen them all. That’s not to say there aren’t episodes that have different premises. But those are few and far between. On top of that they’re always sandwiched between a plethora of other episodes that follow the same beats as the rest. Each episode usually goes like:- Person A goes about their business- Gets bullied or mistreated by Person B- Person A finds out about Hell Correspondence- Uses it to get back at Person B- ENDThis wouldn’t be so bad, if it didn’t go on for nearly 26 episodes, with only slight variations. It gets so predictable, and if there’s something I dislike more than a show with zero effort or heart put behind it, it’s a show that wastes my time by being so formulaic. Now I’ll give it props for having some very interesting episodes splintered throughout. Some of my favorites include; a hikki-girl who refuses to go to school and only texts one friend. She’s constantly checked on by her teacher to come back to class. Annoyed, she sends him to hell. Only afterwards finding out that her friend was the teacher. Both are relieved they’ll meet each other again in hell. Any episode where we learn the history of Ai/Hell Correspondence. An episode where they visit a haunted sanitarium where Ai meets her match. An episode where a fraud-psychic challenges hell girl. And lastly, an episode where a random drug addict tries to send an innocent girl to hell and this conflicts with the morals of Hell Correspondence. Yes you read that right, these demons have morals and standards.Had this series been 12, or maybe 16(and even that’s pushing it) episodes, this series would’ve been better. I’ve heard the subsequent seasons of the anime and chapters of the manga add more variety and spice up the story, but after 26 episodes of nothing but a story with foreseeable events, I was in no hurry to pick up the next season. Aside from its repetitive nature, the other aspects are nothing to write home about either. The character designs(aside from hell correspondence) are ugly, they constantly reuse the same animation sequence when they’re about to send someone to hell, though the tormenting sequences are always unique. The music was okay, but the OP and ED were killer. The animation was serviceable, the backgrounds did their jobs. To the show’s credit though, it is very satisfying to see these assholes get their just desserts. But after a certain point, it almost loses that satisfaction because of how often it happens. If I’ve sounded like a broken record this entire review, I apologize, but I think it’s very fitting given the show I’m talking about. sent to hell post-haste.

For the first time, I realized that not having a concrete main plot is not bad at all. Instead, it is a lot more exciting and anticipating.There’s a very long review coming…………About the STORYAlmost all types of genres are present. Horror, mystery, supernatural, drama, psychological and there’s even a little bit of romance and comedy in some of chapters. This is the ultimate revenge based-type of story I’ve ever seen. It is just so frustrating and very...much irritating when we see this different type of bad people. So it is also just so sweet and exciting that we get to see them being punish in such ways. Plus, it is episodic, so we get to see many different exciting stories. And because of that, every new story comes with so much excitement and anticipation. I just love how different stories are expressed. Every each of them starts from detailing why the characters have grudges and how they are push to the limit and ended up relying to Jigoku Shoujo. It is quite amazing how modern the supernatural things nowadays. Be it by phone, videos, and internet; they are gradually entering the world of gadgets and modernization. Setting aside the extremely exciting revenge of the different characters, I strongly believe that more than the sweet revenge, it also tackles the consequences that come with such actions. At the end of the day, just like there are consequences in doing good things to others, there are also consequences in doing harmful things to others regardless whether the reason are right or wrong. Like they said, everything that we do in our lives always comes with consequences. I think that’s why Enma Ai would let the ones requesting know the price that comes in making the contract. To be honest, it sucks a little bit. You get so irritated by those types of characters but at the end the ones requesting it also have to pay the price. I don’t think that the series is about whether Jigoku Shoujo’s actions are right or wrong. I strongly believe that the series whole point is WHY people are push to the limit and force to rely with Jigoku Shoujo. In a way, no matter how you justify it or be against on it, for them she is definitely helping them. And like what Enma Ai would always say that it is for them to decide whether to pull the string or not. And more importantly, it is also about forgiveness which is one of the hardest things for human beings to do. Lastly, regardless of all the hypocrisy and righteousness, it still definitely feels great when we see them get punish which I think one of the strongest edge of this series from others.About the CHARACTERSBecause it is episodic, there are very few recurring characters. In fact, literally the main characters are the only ones who are always shown. If there is recurring characters aside from the main leads, I guess there are two or three who plays very important roles in the story. Most characters that are the focus of the revenge are no doubt made extremely irritating which make it more exciting that they get to be punished. But that’s not the case all the time. It is not always about the bad guys getting punished and happy ending for the good guys who asked for the revenge. Actually, there are some twist to it which makes the series a lot more exciting and interesting. There are even instances that it is the other way around which I think why Jigoku Shoujo’s actions are question if it’s really right or wrong. The main characters are just a bundle of too much mysteriousness. Because there is no specific plot, we really can’t figure out who they are. I admire Hajime’s determination to stop people from pulling the string and with all his self-righteousness. Though, I pity him because he would always fail. Unfortunately, life is not as simple as what is right or wrong. It’s a lot complicated than that most especially when the human emotions are the ones involve. It’s not as black and white as a lot of people would consider it. There’s always gray matter for all things in life.About JIGOKU SHOUJO (ENMA AI)And the most enigmatic of all is of course, the protagonist with the titular alias as the hell girl (jigoku shoujo). It is no doubt that she has this very mysterious aura that really makes her scary but for some reasons she’s not creepy at all. It’s like she’s in between being scary and being charming at the same time. Plus, she’s very gorgeous as well. Her very calm gestures and poker face expressions makes her even more beautiful. In fact, she’s one of the top 5 best characters in my list of best female characters. Her very enigmatic character makes her even more likeable. Among the very few anti-heroine characters out there, my number one favorite is Enma Ai. She’s even in my top 10 out of 50 in my best characters.About the ANIMATION and SOUNDSI like how their version of hell is illustrated; it’s quite different from your typical representation of hell. For something as an image of hell, it is very beautiful. There are even flowers, streams, trees, and even mountains. Though, I am not sure if it is hell or purgatory or just the dimension where Enma Ai and her companions reside. But for a place which is no doubt not a paradise or the opposite of paradise, it is still very beautiful. I think the sounds are very appropriate with the theme of the series. It gives a whole package to the greatness of the series most especially Enma Ai’s character song.I’ve never seen a series which literally packages most of my favorite genres. And every elements of it are made so magnificently that the result is one brilliant series. This is one of the very few series that you would want to continue even after realizing that it is already the last episode. much irritating when we see this different type of bad people. So it is also just so sweet and exciting that we get to see them being punish in such ways. Plus, it is episodic, so we get to see many different exciting stories. And because of that, every new story comes with so much excitement and anticipation. I just love how different stories are expressed. Every each of them starts from detailing why the characters have grudges and how they are push to the limit and ended up relying to Jigoku Shoujo. It is quite amazing how modern the supernatural things nowadays. Be it by phone, videos, and internet; they are gradually entering the world of gadgets and modernization. Setting aside the extremely exciting revenge of the different characters, I strongly believe that more than the sweet revenge, it also tackles the consequences that come with such actions. At the end of the day, just like there are consequences in doing good things to others, there are also consequences in doing harmful things to others regardless whether the reason are right or wrong. Like they said, everything that we do in our lives always comes with consequences. I think that’s why Enma Ai would let the ones requesting know the price that comes in making the contract. To be honest, it sucks a little bit. You get so irritated by those types of characters but at the end the ones requesting it also have to pay the price. I don’t think that the series is about whether Jigoku Shoujo’s actions are right or wrong. I strongly believe that the series whole point is WHY people are push to the limit and force to rely with Jigoku Shoujo. In a way, no matter how you justify it or be against on it, for them she is definitely helping them. And like what Enma Ai would always say that it is for them to decide whether to pull the string or not. And more importantly, it is also about forgiveness which is one of the hardest things for human beings to do. Lastly, regardless of all the hypocrisy and righteousness, it still definitely feels great when we see them get punish which I think one of the strongest edge of this series from others.About the CHARACTERSBecause it is episodic, there are very few recurring characters. In fact, literally the main characters are the only ones who are always shown. If there is recurring characters aside from the main leads, I guess there are two or three who plays very important roles in the story. Most characters that are the focus of the revenge are no doubt made extremely irritating which make it more exciting that they get to be punished. But that’s not the case all the time. It is not always about the bad guys getting punished and happy ending for the good guys who asked for the revenge. Actually, there are some twist to it which makes the series a lot more exciting and interesting. There are even instances that it is the other way around which I think why Jigoku Shoujo’s actions are question if it’s really right or wrong. The main characters are just a bundle of too much mysteriousness. Because there is no specific plot, we really can’t figure out who they are. I admire Hajime’s determination to stop people from pulling the string and with all his self-righteousness. Though, I pity him because he would always fail. Unfortunately, life is not as simple as what is right or wrong. It’s a lot complicated than that most especially when the human emotions are the ones involve. It’s not as black and white as a lot of people would consider it. There’s always gray matter for all things in life.About JIGOKU SHOUJO (ENMA AI)And the most enigmatic of all is of course, the protagonist with the titular alias as the hell girl (jigoku shoujo). It is no doubt that she has this very mysterious aura that really makes her scary but for some reasons she’s not creepy at all. It’s like she’s in between being scary and being charming at the same time. Plus, she’s very gorgeous as well. Her very calm gestures and poker face expressions makes her even more beautiful. In fact, she’s one of the top 5 best characters in my list of best female characters. Her very enigmatic character makes her even more likeable. Among the very few anti-heroine characters out there, my number one favorite is Enma Ai. She’s even in my top 10 out of 50 in my best characters.About the ANIMATION and SOUNDSI like how their version of hell is illustrated; it’s quite different from your typical representation of hell. For something as an image of hell, it is very beautiful. There are even flowers, streams, trees, and even mountains. Though, I am not sure if it is hell or purgatory or just the dimension where Enma Ai and her companions reside. But for a place which is no doubt not a paradise or the opposite of paradise, it is still very beautiful. I think the sounds are very appropriate with the theme of the series. It gives a whole package to the greatness of the series most especially Enma Ai’s character song.I’ve never seen a series which literally packages most of my favorite genres. And every elements of it are made so magnificently that the result is one brilliant series. This is one of the very few series that you would want to continue even after realizing that it is already the last episode.', 'I will tell you what I think after watching the three seasons of this anime, after 26 ep each. That\'s a lot? Probably so. Is it worth the time? I think it\'s worth it. What? Without enthusiasm? No, I will not say to you: ""Wow, what a mega was cut into the cosmos! Die if you did not see! Yolo! MMA! USA!..."" No. Was well. Moments even very well. But it was not outstanding. Why? I will try to summarize ... Generally all three seasons were presented according to a certain pattern. I\'m already translating. First: As anyone mentioned here, each episode contains some indispensable...elements that repeat almost like a mantra. Presentation of the situation. Use the services of our young antagonist and her team. Sending to hell in the accompaniment of the same mantra spoken by our (anti) heroine (some viewers get bored). Second: The story. In addition to the epic plot (the story begins and ends in the same episode and not everyone is behind it), we have in every episode at the beginning and at the end a gentle pull of the main plot of the season, always associated with Enma Ai itself and Hellfire Correspondence (theme from Dr House). Third: The first 19 episodes of each season are episodic with a gentle push of the main storyline. WHERE Episode 20 from 26 is a masterpiece driving into the chair. Because we get a sense of the condensed dose of a solid, action-packed, heavy storyline with a mix of extreme emotions whose culmination we find at the climax of the 26th episode of each season. In the first season it will be a motive for a journalist exploring the mysterious disappearances of the city\'s inhabitants. In the second, the motive of the detective attempting to do the same as mentioned above. And in the third season, we get the story of a heroine with a very unusual destiny (which is without spoilers ^^). All this consists of one coherent picture of the fate of a city rolled over many years by hatred and revenge in the hearts of every citizen. Somewhere along the way, we will also learn about the arch-sad story of Ai and each of her companions. Overall, the anime is really good. Impeccable animation, very atmospheric (dark) music, very interesting and engaging story of side characters, neatly combining previous stories with current events (events of the season will be reflected even after many years in season 3), the story of the main characters that fall into memory and They give the audience a whole range of emotions (which I expected from the series). Not extending: Anime definitely worth recommending and sacrificing for it these 29 hours (total). I especially recommend for fans some darker climates who find pleasure in the plot full of unreason, speculation, mysticism and very sad history of people from different time periods. My rating is 8.5 / 10 (second season is much weaker than others). Regards.PS.: I apologize in advance for my english. elements that repeat almost like a mantra. Presentation of the situation.

Having watched this series, I've decided to review it. It's my first review and it's purely my personal opinion, so please forgive me if there's anything you don't like.-Premise- 10/10The general concept of Hell Girl is that there's a communication medium known as Hell Link, and one can use it to avenge against a person you have a grudge on. I find this concept unique and to my knowledge no other anime series has it. This is a perfect setting a horror anime and is just what makes Hell Girl...well Hell Girl.-Story- 8/10A...typical episode: a person has a grudge, and then uses Hell Link, then Hell Girl comes into action...you get the idea. It sounds repetitive on paper, considering you have the same framework/skeleton backbone for 26 episodes. However, each episode feels fresh as there is a new character and storyline involved. But there just might be some backstories that will unfold overtime and twists...I won't go into there. Overall, I enjoyed the stories.-Art- 7/10The art is decent, considering this is a relatively old anime. It doesn't stand out much though and it isn't always that colorful. I do particularly like Hell Girl's Kimono's colors and floral design though XD-Soundtrack- 7/10Music and sound are not too bad: the background music fits in well with the atmosphere, especially the one playing when Hell Girl ferries someone to hell. I just don't find the opening and ending themes fitting for a HORROR anime...they sound too happy.-Characters- 10/10Character development is amazing in this series: I can feel their mental struggles, despair, hopelessness...only to resort to using Hell Link. The recurring cast each have unique personalities that all go very well together. For instance, Hell Girl has no emotion whatsoever but once you watch the series you will understand what made her that way.-Overall- 9/10I really enjoyed watching Hell Girl and wholeheartedly recommend it to any horror anime fans. It is just so satisfying seeing people being banished to hell when they deserve it.Hope you've found this review helpful, or I won't be afraid to use Hell Link... typical episode: a person has a grudge, and then uses Hell Link, then Hell Girl comes into action...you get the idea.

But, those four episodes very well might be the only four episodes I plan on watching of it. None of the episodes tie together and each episodes plot seems to be the exact same! It gets so tedious! It goes like this: Introduced to some helpless person, they call Hell girl, more story on the helpless person, Hell girl tortures person, person dies, a little follow up on how the person does once their tormentor is dead- and it's usually not even enough for you to be satisfied.The art could...have been a little better for me to have enjoyed it... when Hell girl rides in the carriage there's always lines going across her and it annoys me so much. However, when tortuing people, they do a decent job at drawing scary things.The sound was pretty fitting for this anime, but nothing that catches my attention.Overall.. I think this show is just a little to repetitive for me. But, if you're okay with the same thing happening pretty much every episode, just in different scenario's, I say you should watch it. If you're like me and get bored of the same thing over and over again.. I say try a few episodes, but then drop it if it's boring to you. have been a little better for me to have enjoyed it... when Hell girl rides in the carriage there's always lines going across her and it annoys me so much.

Rather than relying on gory images and the like, Japan\'s always seemed to specialize in instilling fear through the use of the human mind, combined with an element of folktale, fiction or not. Hell Girl\'s story comes off summarized as a bland existence- a girl who ferries the souls of people\'s tormentors into the depths of Hell. All you have to do is ask, essentially. But it was interesting enough to at least pick up when I saw the cheap FUNimation S.A.V.E. release on sale.I wasn\'t too disappointed in the...end. While yes, the story itself is extremely repetitive (each episode with the same idea- get tormented, summon Hell Girl, and so on), surrounding elements powered together to create a satisfactory experience for me.The art is very capturing. Aniplex rarely disappoints me with there work, always producing a very traditional anime look. It\'s simple, crisp, and flows evenly. There are moments, however, during the show, where proportions go a little too far out of place (the size of hands, the width of a torso, etc.) that it became distracting from dialogue, but it\'s not enough to deter from the show itself. Just a distraction.Often, the flaws in the image can also be remedied by the music. The soundtrack is well done, and lifts, even completes, the image, but I find it very predictably used. The same songs, the same sounds, the same moments. I know this can\'t be true, but when I at least consider the soundtrack made for the show, I can only bring to mind two songs and one traditional Japanese sound. It feels insignificant enough in a horror that I wouldn\'t say it brings down the overall feel of the anime, it just adds to the repetitive nature of each episode. This can be kind of a bummer sometimes. But it\'s not the poor music\'s fault, so let\'s move on.What makes Hell Girl something short of fascinating is the changing characters. Most of the cast is very fleeting, as the story moves from episode to episode, and each of them are very clearly defined. Maybe it\'s a childish love of psychology that pushes me to drool over this aspect, but I\'m pretty sure it\'s interesting for most viewers. Each character thinks in their own way, and acts on those individualized thoughts. This means, while the plot repeats, and even some dialogue too, watching people act as people in an anime is refreshing. Good and evil become difficult to distinguish. And by halfway through the series, I stopped rooting for ""the good guy"" and found myself actually considering who was in the wrong. This is something I would say needs to be present in television and movies anywhere, but if it was, maybe it would be less special.Overall, if you ever feel like kicking back from time to time and popping something into the DVD player (or such) that will give you a few good shivers, Hell Girl is a nice way to go. I wouldn\'t say it\'s the sort of thing that would knock a viewer out of the park, but it\'s something I would recommend watching at least once in your lifetime. It repeats, true, but it is refreshing to see a large and equally complex cast of characters.-shoujokiss7 end.

No passing go, no $200 USD collection, no get-out-of-purgatory-free cards.

Curses come home to roost after all, or so I've heard.Hell Girl is...an anime series about taking out a large loan of immediate improvement towards one's personal well-being at a 100% long-term interest rate; the main characters of the episodic stories told throughout this series all pay this price, for one reason or another, and for the most part they pay it under terms and conditions that are all easily understandable, at those most severe of times when they feel they have exhausted all of their options and have no remaining choice but to outsource their problem-solving to the supernatural.This is almost an entirely episodic experience, offering significantly little overarching development or storyline beyond the scope of the stories it tells each episode for most of the runtime. It takes 8 episodes before long-term story implications even begin. The end does have something of a climax and some falling actions. The writing is fine and the series exhibits some semblance of self-awareness at how repetitive its narratives become and will fluctuate its pacing of these stories as the series progresses - thank goodness, otherwise it would be a highly formulaic slog. The animation is decent for the most part.Overall, this is a series that scratches precisely one itch: vengeance. People getting the comeuppance that, for the most part, is deserved - the people who are asking for the comeuppance also sharing in the consequences of the finality of the vengeance they are seeking. I can recommend this series to anyone who does not mind an episodic experience and can get behind the premise; I do not recommend it for anyone seeking a fulfilling story with big payoffs - you will not find it here. an anime series about taking out a large loan of immediate improvement towards one's personal well-being at a 100% long-term interest rate; the main characters of the episodic stories told throughout this series all pay this price, for one reason or another, and for the most part they pay it under terms and conditions that are all easily understandable, at those most severe of times when they feel they have exhausted all of their options and have no remaining choice but to outsource their problem-solving to the supernatural.This is almost an entirely episodic experience, offering significantly little overarching development or storyline beyond the scope of the stories it tells each episode for most of the runtime.

This is the premise of the anime and the contract you take out with Hell Girl before she exacts your revenge.Hell Girl is Enma Ai, girl who lives in a twilight world leaving only when called upon to exact someone\'s revenge. She is not evil and she does not judge the reasons for revenge, she just provides a service.The first half of the series follows the same formula before introducing Hijame and his daughter Tsugumi. Hijame is...a journalist who blackmails celebrities and the word\'s worst father, so much so that his daughter doesn\'t call him Dad. Tsugumi has a connection with Hell Girl after a chance meeting.The second half of the series follows Hijame in trying to stop Hell Girl by using Tsugumi\'s visions to obsessionly find who called Hell Girl and try and persuade them not to take out revenge leading to a dramatic finale with Enma Ai where we find out her story.The main criticism Hell Girl gets is that it is repetitive. I think this is unfair as it is a bit like saying CSI is repetitive as it solves murders using science every time. I would say the series is a little long. Maybe 20 episodes would have been better. To get the most out of watching Hell Girl you really need to take each episode as a different story and not expect a story to develop through the series.The each story of revenge is well thought out where none of the characters are 2 dimensional even though most of them appear in only one episode.

What I will say here is meant to be about this season specifically, and it's in no way a representation of the whole work.So, to start from the beginning, what is the misconception that people seem to fall for when watching this show? Well, it's a kind of hard one to explain. Mainly, they seem...to take this story as an story and not a thesis.Most people would call it episodic, but, even though the term technically applies here, this series isn't meant to be episodic, it's simply a result of it's nature.  And what is this nature? A series of situation-examples to test out a theory, a thesis, on morality.When someone creates an idea on morality, one of the ways to test it is by challenging that idea through various situations and see their logical outcome. The more you agree with the end result, the more sound your idea is, and the less you do, the chance of it being simply wrong increases.Jigoku Shoujo presents us with a set up: A person can take revenge and kill other for any perceived, on the victims perspective, damaged the other might have caused. To facilitate things, we can simply ignore laws and physical limitations by making this process supernatural, and thus focus only on it's moral aspects. And, before can test it out, we must address a logical result of it: the inevitable impact on the victim's life. You see, killing someone creates quite the burden in your life, and that burden is represented as the promise of spending eternity in hell. Secondly, another thing must be clarified: we aren't dealing with self defense. All acts thought here must be done as revenge, as answer to an aggression carried out and finished. Thus, for the victim to kill their wrongdoer, there is a three-step system: have the grievance, contact Jigoku Shoujo, and then untie the thread. In short, this isn't a gun you're firing on spot, this is a planned out act.With this set up, the show starts a series of episodes to test it out in various scenarios. However, the show doesn't give you any answers, that much is up to you and you alone. And here is why most people miss the point of the show. They're expecting an ordinary story, that will answer them, that will shift and head somewhere, but this isn't no ordinary story, it's a thesis about revenge, and you just got invited to watch the testing.It's only after several episodes that two other characters come and show us two other theories on the same subject, creating a ideological battle among the main cast. And, to differ even more from your common storytelling, the show doesn't give you a conclusion on this battle. The characters, of course, receive their endings and reach their own conclusions, but these are only satisfactory to their own personal point of views. You, as a third party, is left hanging. And that is part of the brilliance of the show, because the author never wanted to give a definitive answer on this matter. They left it up to you. You should draw your own conclusions. After all, if at the very end, the author was to step in and give their own personal views, the whole point of the series would vanish.Now, of course, there is a story being followed here. An ordinary one. However, this plays as a secondary arc to the show. The story itself is simply a progression to justify what is going on, while making you care about the characters and plot, and not sleep through it all. But, judging the show based on this story is, at least, wrong.Given it's a 2005 show, the animation has aged quite a lot, but the shot composition and directing are still on spot. The pacing of the show is good for what it wants to achieve, giving you enough time to chew on the information you're given and letting enough room for you to think and rethink your opinions as you watch it.In the end, Jigoku Shoujo is one of a kind. Definitely not a watch for everyone, but surely interesting, engaging and thought provoking to those who can enjoy such a show. to take this story as an story and not a thesis.Most people would call it episodic, but, even though the term technically applies here, this series isn't meant to be episodic, it's simply a result of it's nature.  And what is this nature? A series of situation-examples to test out a theory, a thesis, on morality.When someone creates an idea on morality, one of the ways to test it is by challenging that idea through various situations and see their logical outcome. The more you agree with the end result, the more sound your idea is, and the less you do, the chance of it being simply wrong increases.Jigoku Shoujo presents us with a set up: A person can take revenge and kill other for any perceived, on the victims perspective, damaged the other might have caused. To facilitate things, we can simply ignore laws and physical limitations by making this process supernatural, and thus focus only on it's moral aspects. And, before can test it out, we must address a logical result of it: the inevitable impact on the victim's life. You see, killing someone creates quite the burden in your life, and that burden is represented as the promise of spending eternity in hell. Secondly, another thing must be clarified: we aren't dealing with self defense. All acts thought here must be done as revenge, as answer to an aggression carried out and finished. Thus, for the victim to kill their wrongdoer, there is a three-step system: have the grievance, contact Jigoku Shoujo, and then untie the thread. In short, this isn't a gun you're firing on spot, this is a planned out act.With this set up, the show starts a series of episodes to test it out in various scenarios. However, the show doesn't give you any answers, that much is up to you and you alone. And here is why most people miss the point of the show. They're expecting an ordinary story, that will answer them, that will shift and head somewhere, but this isn't no ordinary story, it's a thesis about revenge, and you just got invited to watch the testing.It's only after several episodes that two other characters come and show us two other theories on the same subject, creating a ideological battle among the main cast.

There exists a message board called “Jigoku Tsushin” where one can access only at midnight. It is said that if one writes his grudge against someone, Jigoku Shoujo appears and she takes the person to the Hell.“ 闇に惑いし哀れな影よ・・・ 人を傷つけ貶めて、罪に溺れし業の魂 ・・・\u3000いっぺん、死んで見る?""Pitiful shadow cloaked in darkness.Thy actions cause men pain and suffering. Thy hollow soul drowns in thy sins. How would you like to see what death is like?""”— Enma Ai.Story: Jigoku shoujo is about Enma Ai, her job is to accept other’s revenge and take them to hell, the story in the beginning is quite linear since each ep is similar and...there is no relation between ep. Jigoku Shoujo might be a collection of short stories. Each of them descript the suffering of a different individual caused by one or more antagonists of him/her, and the subsequent punishment they inflict on them with the help of Enma Ai, each episode deals with someone’s revenge and there is no connection between episodes as the revenge is carried in a single episode. During each story or ep (since each ep deals with a complete story), the protagonist dramas are explained, showing us how did it all started to where when the Jigoku Shoujo is contacted, Enma Ai will then appear and hand black straw doll with a red string tied to its neck, she then says “if u really wish to take revenge, take the red string, if you remove that string you shall enter officially in a contract with me, the one u seek revenge upon will be carried to hell immediately. However if I deliver your revenge, I must have you make restitution to me.When one person is cursed, to graves are dug, when you die your soul shall fall to the pits of hell. Your spirit shall wander forever in pain and suffering, never having known paradise.” (Translation is different for each fansub group, but the meaning is the same).When someone’s cursed, a mark appears in the chest, remembering this person of his/her sin, reminding them that after their lives come to end, they must give compensation by having their own soul carried to Hell.This is only in the first episodes, starting from ep 8, 2 new important characters are introduced: A journalist named Hajime Shibata who is investigating the stories involving the Jigoku Shoujo, and his daughter Tsugumi. After an encounter with Enma Ai, Tsugumi starts to have visions of her and thus the duo becomes more and more involved in her matters. Tsugumi is somehow related to Ai, this is something that won’t be reveled up to ep 23, but will be dealed from ep 13up.Because of this connection, Tsugumi always knows who is the next client or victim, and Hajime will try to stop the revenge.The introduction of the 2 characters is important to the story, since they will always be present, trying to uncover the Jigoko Shoujo secret…Characters: Enma Ai, she is a beautiful young red eyed girl with Dark Hair, usually wearing traditional sailor school uniform.Her Mission is to carry others revenge to hell…She is quite a mature character, and as to be tough in order to carry the mission.We can see that she is not a bad person, even thought she may look terrifying sometimes, it seams she feels something for the ones she carries to hell, has an example in ep 21, she seemed she really enjoyed to take the guy to hell, I could be seen on her face and in he voice. Other example was ep 23, a pure, honest and innocent girl loved by all was sent to hell, it was easy to tell she was not happy, she showed a really sad face and expressed a sad voice.She lives in a house in an unknown world that is in eternal sunset with her grandmother who orders her around and whose face never appears only her voice and shadow.It seams she doesn’t lead a happy life, and there seams to be something bothering her, like if she is being forced to do that work…Enma Ai doesn\'t work alone. Ai, Ichimoku Ren, Wanyuudo, and Hone Onna are the only are her assistants…Wanyuud ou, he is an old man wearing a hat and a red scarf that becomes the same black doll delivered to each one of their ""clients""Ichimoku Ren, is a handsome young man in casual clothes. He has the power to look beyond walls with a mysterious big eye.Hone Onna (Bone Woman), a beautiful woman wearing a kimono, she usually helps seducing mans and helps out with the investigation and torture…They help Ai during the event when their victims are confronted with their own sins, prior to the moment when she (dressed in traditional kimono with floral patterns) ferries them to hell. Also, the trio helps her investigate the true nature of their cases every time they content something suspicious.They usually do most of the work; Enma Ai only gives the final blow and rides the boat to Hell.Tsugumi – This small girl as met the Jigoku Shoujo, they seam to have some sort of relation as Tsugumi is able to incarnate her for a few seconds giving her a sight of what she sees, and sometimes what she speaks. As it seams Ai is doing it intentionally, but why is yet to be explained.Hajime Shibata – He is Tsugumis father, he works as an investigator, he is trying to uncover and stop the Jigoku Shoujo, he is wise man that can easily deceive most of peoples to try and get information about the surroundings of each case, he follows Tsugumi’s leads to every case and is seen as an annoyance for the trio helping Ai, but it seams she does not wish them any harm, maybe wanting to be followed by them…Tsugumi and her father are descendents of Shintaro, the one and only one Ai friend, then one who protected her and in the end the one o utterly killed her, here may lye the reason why the Jigoko Shoujo is interested in them…These are the only characters that really care trough the series…There is so much I could tell about the characters and their relationships, but it would make a big review even bigger, and add so much more spoilers to a review full of spoilers…Animation - The animation in Jigoko Shoujo is very good, the art in this anime has a dark tendency, as it’s supposed to be am horror anime, the background art is also detailed an quite pleasing some times, like in her house, the beautiful nature that surrounds it, makes it look like paradise, and in contrast, the hell scenes, even thought they are reused to some extent, are really good, and look really dark, sometimes we see spirit hand trying to catch the one being ferried, also usually the chase/murder scenes are really good with great special effects that can be disturbing sometimes.The character design usually is also really good, with nice colors, and good proportion, the big round eyes look good on the characters, specially the red ones in Enma Ai, together with the long dark hair, she looks like a beautiful doll u would like to have, also the flower kimono she wears is special, if u watch the anime u will notice the flowers moving trough the kimono, giving it a mysterious look…Music: Op, the op music is not bad, it’s a regular pop song, sung by Snow (sont have any information on her, as ANN doesn’t have any for me), I don’t have the lyrics so I cant say much about the letter but I think it suits the op art.The music in Jigoku shoujo is nice, I’m currently listening to the soundtrack, while doing this part; the music contains some soft and gentle melodies using flute, cord instruments and piano, along with some traditional instruments, this music is suited for the light scenes in the story; since this is an horror anime, its supposed to have dark music, this music, is more the electronic type and more heavy, using electronic instruments together with some guitar and drums, which helps to set the dark mood throughout the series.The Ed song is more soft, Karinui sung by Noto Mamiko (Enma Ai seyuu), I think it’s better than the op. I don’t currently have the dvd with me so I cant do much more for the music, but as soon as I get it ill try to update a little…Enjoyment: When I got the first ep I did know nothing about Elfen lied, and once I started watching it, I was surprised with the great op, I thought it was really a beautiful op with a great music, but after the op those next 7m really caught me on surprise, looking all that gore, fanservise and deaths made me think, what where those guys thinking, everyone will be caught by the beginning of the show, and that’s when people will think if they should stop there or if they want to see what’s going to happen next.During the show u will end up liking the character, and enjoy each situation not getting bothered with the violence. The interest factor is always high throughout the anime, and the fights are always short yet unpredictable. You never know when Lucy might just rip a person’s head off.Other aspects of the anime: The Buddhist statue that appears at several points in the series, with what looks like a club/sword and a golden pomegranate in her hands (especially in ep 13) is Benzaiten (弁才天), originally the Hindu Goddess Sarasvati. She is one of the “Seven Lucky Gods,” and the patron of music, dance and general good fortune –all in all, a very bright deity overseeing this very dark story. She’s usually represented carrying a biwa (lute) and a jewel in her hands. Benzaiten is enshrined at Enoshima, the island in Kanagawa prefecture where the events of the series take place. She is also associated with the story of the White Snake –the archetypical East Asian story of falling in love with a woman who is not quite what she seems.The story of Elfen Lied happened in the City of Kamakura (鎌倉市) of Kanagawa Prefecture (神奈川県). there is no relation between ep.

Don\'t stop watching because of that though, as it picks up a gain and again.As stated, it an excellent anime at first. The style, the sound and the plot. After a while though it doesn\'t evolve and quickly becomes stagnant, I almost gave up... but because of playing Diablo 3 and it being dubbed I listened.It become an play of...human hatred and love, vengeance and forgiveness.While most of those can be played off as, ""who\'s silly enough, or petty enough to do this?"", you leave your self open to the episodes of love and regret which strike a cord.To me this only happened when the true story began, which is about the the newspaper person. (I also have to admit I egged on to find out about the Hell Girl more than the other characters).It all blends well together, and don\'t give up just because it\'s time consuming... if you don\'t normally watch dubbed, you should do this time. I watched it in both format (for the first 4 episodes) and I assure you the English voices fit best. human hatred and love, vengeance and forgiveness.While most of those can be played off as, ""who\'s silly enough, or petty enough to do this?"", you leave your self open to the episodes of love and regret which strike a cord.To me this only happened when the true story began, which is about the the newspaper person.

I watched it in both format (for the first 4 episodes) and I assure you the English voices fit best.', ""Hell Girl has a dark, original concept that is genuinely interesting and exciting to watch but it comes at the price of a slow, repetitive start and perhaps taking a bit too long to get away from its originally episodic nature.Art-I found Hell Girl's art to be absolutely gorgeous. Symbolism is absolutely everywhere, it's quite colorful and this anime's depiction of Hell is artistically beautiful. The visuals aren't flashy but they do not need to be and this anime has an undeniable dark, tragically beautiful feel to it, which fits perfectly with the story.Sound-The voice acting here is quite good, with Brina Palencia absolutely nailing...her role as the titular character and the supporting cast, with particular props going to Luci Christian's Tsugumi, also delivering strong, believable performances. I'm also a huge fan of Hell Girl's soundtrack and have several of its tracks on my personal playlist. The show emits a sad and ominous beauty throughout and the music is a huge part of that. The sound is definitely one of the highlights of the series.Character-The characters are hit or miss. Hell Girl herself, Hajime and Tsugumi are far and away the stars of the show whereas other named characters feel both underdeveloped and at times outright unimportant. That said, the story of those three aforementioned characters alone is strong enough and fascinating enough to keep you gripped the whole way through. The problem is, the latter two characters aren't even introduced until episode 8, at which point you may be understandably a bit bored and underwhelmed with what has been, up until that point, an episodic and repetitive experience using the same base formula repeatedly. Had the whole show continued in that way it absolutely would have worn out its welcome, and I feel it took a bit too long (one third of the show) to get away from that, but once it finally does the quality of the story improves dramatically and it never drops off again.Enjoyment-As mentioned in the previous section, the show takes a while to get to its meat and potatoes and it is initially quite repetitive. After five, six, seven episodes of essentially the same thing it's only natural to feel you don't need fifteen plus more episodes of this and begin to lose interest in the show. However, if you can make it to episode 8 without losing interest, it only gets better and better from there and it'll take you on a journey well worth taking. When this anime concluded I felt quite satisfied and glad I stuck it out.Overall-Dark, beautiful and intriguing Hell Girl is well worth your time if you can make it through the slow, repetitive start without losing interest.+Distinctly dark, sad, beautiful style resonating from all parts of the show+Great voice acting from the leads+Show gets better and better in the mid to late stages-Initially quite repetitive and formulatic-Slow to get to the parts truly worth watchingOBJECTIVE RATING- 7PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 8 her role as the titular character and the supporting cast, with particular props going to Luci Christian's Tsugumi, also delivering strong, believable performances.

By only watching 2/3 episodes a day, I was able to go throw 75+ episodes of this show without having to drop it mid way.I must say, I\'m surprised that I was able to last this long, considering this was a huge disappointment for me.Story : 2/10- Basically, a girl known as the ""Hell Girl"" allows people to send someone they hate to hell. And apart from that, there is no main story. Every episode, apart from maybe a couple of ones, centers around...new character\'s that were just introduced in the same episode. Only the main character and her gang appear on almost every episode, repeatedly for the same reason, addind nothing new to the show.Art : 3/10- I can\'t ask for something much better, considering this show is pretty old. But even then, it shouldn\'t be this bad.You will find yourself viewing the same scene and the same animation on every single episode. Same character pose, same reactions, etc.Sound : 4/10- There is maybe one or two soundtracks that aren\'t really that bad, I can say that at least. Now for character\'s voices, I can\'t say the same.Across every single episode, you will hear the same lines of text, with the same tone as well. It gets really, really boring, and I ended up skipping it plenty of times.Character : 2/10- Now, you have heard a lot of bad things till now,and you might be asking if at least the character\'s can same the show. But nop, they really can\'t. Every episode features a new set of character\'s that will be irrelevant to the rest of the show. Since those are just supporting character\'s, I\'m not able to judge those. So I will mainly focus about the main character of the show, Enma Ai (Hell Girl).She is the type of character that doesn\'t show any emotion at all. Add that to the repetitive dialogues and the same tone across every word, and you get a really boring character. It\'s a disappointment, considering she is the main character of her show and doesn\'t really get any development at all during it. And when asked a question, she just stays there with a dead look in complete silence, not even speaking at all. She is more of a doll or a machine rather than an ""ex-human"".Overall: 3/10- So what saves this show?I\'ve started watching because I found it interesting to see what reasons someone would have to send someone to hell. It could be anything from bullying and physical/mental pain, to something really poor like ""meh I just don\'t like seeing his face"". And considering that every episode featured new cases, there were more opportunities to create more scenarios.But sadly, all the previous stated points didin\'t contributed in order to make this show a good experience.And that finishes it. Overall I found this to be a pretty boring show, with nothing that really helps making it even watcheable for some people that just don\'t have the patience for it. I will advice you to see a couple of episodes if you are really interested to try it, and that would be enough for you to know the answer, since every episode is the same thing, over and over again.This was my honest review on the show, and many will disagree with me on this one. But I just wanted to point it out anyway. new character\'s that were just introduced in the same episode. Only the main character and her gang appear on almost every episode, repeatedly for the same reason, addind nothing new to the show.Art : 3/10- I can\'t ask for something much better, considering this show is pretty old.

So I will mainly focus about the main character of the show, Enma Ai (Hell Girl).She is the type of character that doesn\'t show any emotion at all. Add that to the repetitive dialogues and the same tone across every word, and you get a really boring character. It\'s a disappointment, considering she is the main character of her show and doesn\'t really get any development at all during it. And when asked a question, she just stays there with a dead look in complete silence, not even speaking at all. She is more of a doll or a machine rather than an ""ex-human"".Overall: 3/10- So what saves this show?I\'ve started watching because I found it interesting to see what reasons someone would have to send someone to hell. It could be anything from bullying and physical/mental pain, to something really poor like ""meh I just don\'t like seeing his face"". And considering that every episode featured new cases, there were more opportunities to create more scenarios.But sadly, all the previous stated points didin\'t contributed in order to make this show a good experience.And that finishes it. Overall I found this to be a pretty boring show, with nothing that really helps making it even watcheable for some people that just don\'t have the patience for it. I will advice you to see a couple of episodes if you are really interested to try it, and that would be enough for you to know the answer, since every episode is the same thing, over and over again.This was my honest review on the show, and many will disagree with me on this one. But I just wanted to point it out anyway.', ""Jigoku Shoujo is the kind of anime that takes you into the characters mind and makes you understand their feelings. Each episode shows what people can do to have their revenge extracted. Besides that, you start to understand Enma Ai's past and how she became the Jigoku Shoujo.The storyline is outstanding, as the art and the characters are and this turns into  an amazing anime. "", ""It seemed like a good idea watching this anime as the idea of it sounds good. A 'hotline to hell' on which you can revenge on others, but in exchange for sending them to hell they will also be ferried to hell. However this season of Hell Girl got slightly tedious at times and there were moments when the storyline could have been developed further to make it more interesting. "", '“It is difficult to fight against anger, for man will buy revenge with his soul.”  The immortal words of the philosopher Heraclitus have never rung truer than they have with the rising popularity of The Hell Correspondence, a mysterious website that’s been trending among Japanese youth by word of mouth and sworn testimonials from the people who claim to have used it.  If you’ve followed the popular URL to a dead end, it’s likely because you haven’t tried to access it under the right circumstances...  The Hell correspondence website will only appear to those who try to access it at the stroke...of midnight, and even then, it will only appear to visitors whose hearts genuinely burn for revenge.  This is because The Hell Correspondence is not a joke.  It’s not just some trend, or a petty game to alleviate minor school yard tiffs.  The business of revenge is real, and like any business, the service it offers does not come cheap.  In order to send the object of your ire screaming into the depths of hell, you’ll have to sell your own soul alongside them.Of course, after you’ve used the site, you’ll hear all of this when you’re paid a visit from it’s contractor, not the dark lord satan himself, but a beautiful, emotionally detached young girl sporting a black middle school uniform and an untied hime hair-style.  In a voice as cold and lifeless as her eyes, the girl will introduce herself as Ai Enma, and she will offer you a straw doll with a red thread tied around it’s neck.  She will explain her services, as well as the toll they will take on your immortal soul should you choose to employ them, and she will leave you with one simple choice...  Pull the string and send your tormentor straight into the depths of hell, body and soul, or deny the animalistic urge inside you and offer them your forgiveness.  many Japanese souls have become clients of Miss Enma, and only a select few of them have been able to resist the temptation.  But how about you?  Have you ever known somebody who you’d sell your soul to have taken care of?  You only have one soul to lose, but always remember;  Beyond midnight’s veil lies the revenge that you could not exact alone.Out of all the animation studios I’ve covered in this blog, Studio Deen probably has the worst reputation.  I’ve reviewed some shows of theirs that looked good enough, with Sankarea being the most recent example, but if there’s any show they’ve done that perfectly encapsulates all of the negative criticism they receive, it’s Hell girl.  It’s not the worst looking anime I’ve ever seen, but the character movement on display here is some of the cheapest I’ve ever seen.  It’s embarrassingly bad, and with so many examples of off-looking animation coming to mind, you need only look at the first episode, where the first vengeance victim in the series has to watch a flashback of herself stealing money from a fellow student.  The shot of her past self entering the classroom isn’t even the first questionable visual, and yet it’s so jaw droppingly bad that it’s easy to go into denial, claiming that there’s no way the series could ever look that bad again.Oh, but it can, and it does so with surprisingly often.  Movements are stiff and unnatural, running and walking cycles look awkward and out of place, and characters’ faces are constantly off-model, making for a show that you could almost say looks best when it’s not moving, and  characters are just sitting around and talking.  I say almost, because the show’s budget was clearly reserved for the show’s various punishment scenes, where Ai boards a flaming chariot and affords her victim one last piece of torment before ferrying them to hell.  Hell girl rarely employs visual effects outside of these scenes, making for a night-and-day transition between the build-up and pay-off of each episode.  I should be impressed by this, as I’ve praised some shows in the past for looking better at the right moment at the expense of quality elsewhere, but they definitely went over-board here.  The climax of each episode does look more or less beautiful, with cg fire, endlessly creative visual imagery, the haunting flower design on Ai’s kimono, and a final parting shot of Ai rowing her victim down what I can only assume is the Japanese equivalent of the River Styx.Unfortunately, as I’ve alluded, these scenes don’t make up for just how bad the rest of the show’s animation looks.  The animation may be hit or miss...  Although it’s really more miss than hit...  But thankfully, the art design is far more decent.  It’s never quite as good as the art cards that came packaged with the original DVDs would have you believe, but it’s still easy to get lost in the detailed, immersive backgrounds, and unlike the animation, this level of care doesn’t just get limited to the hell-related material...  The backgrounds in Ai Enma’s realm and in the torment scenes are beautiful, yes, but the lighting at various points in the day and the level of detail featured in the myriad of different settings are also surprisingly intricate.  As a side effect of the show’s episodic nature, there’s a diverse array of architecture that can often make the series feel more like a tour of Japan than a proper horror title.  Similarly, the character designs are just as varied, and while a select few of the people who appear in this series may be on the generic side, they’re still diverse enough to distinctly stand out against the rest of the cast without ever leaving the spectrum of realistic design.Hell Girl may not be a visual wonder, but where it truly shines is with it’s use of sound.  The soundtrack is limited, and you may very quickly notice a few tracks that keep getting used over and over again, but in it’s defense, I can only say this;  Don’t mess with perfection.  Ai herself is characterized by the chanting of a childlike, disembodied voice, normally accompanied by string music, although there are several other tunes that tell her story.  Due of course to the episodic nature of the series, there are several tunes that get repeated as a formula each episode, from the hauntingly complacent tracks floating around in Ai’s downtime to the climactic Jigoku Nagashi that closes out every individual story, but my favorite track would have to be a certain piano piece called Kakugo, which plays up the tension  whenever one of Ai’s clients makes a game-changing revelation.  It’s unnerving, it’s probably one of the best “Oh shit” type tunes I’ve ever heard in an anime, and it has the unique ability to cut in at any point during the episode, whether it’s following dead silence or cutting off another tune.The English dub is an early Funimation offering, having come out about eleven years ago, and at the risk of sounding like a broken record, the show’s episodic nature has left it’s mark on the cast, too.  Hell girl’s dub features what can only be described as a revolving door of 2005 Funimation regulars.  Brina Palencia performs one of her earliest roles as the title character Ai Enma, and while most of her dialogue is repeated in each episode, she’s still able to imbue moire and more nuance and developing emotion into what’s supposed to be an emotionless character, and in some of the most uncertain moments, she can convey that the character’s shell is being broken without letting her voice crack or her delivery betray her true feelings.  It takes an overwhelming level of talent to have her cake and eat it too in this way, and it’s not hard to see why Brina was bumped up to Funimation’s main voice acting roster following roles like this one and Beck.  Her lackeys aren’t quite as dynamic, but they’re distinct enough...  Jennifer Seman is knowing and perceptive, Todd Haberkorn is cocky and laid back, and R Bruce Elliot is wise and authoritative, and they all convey a deep sense of devotion and loyalty for their mistress.I’ve praised John Burgmeier before for being an outstanding talent behind the scenes who has more than enough voice acting chops to lend credence to his writing and direction, and Hell Girl features one of his unfortunately few starring roles.  After spending eight episodes establishing the kind of entity Hell Correspondence is, we’re introduced to out-of-work reporter Hajime Shibata and his precocious daughter Tsugumi, who has a mysterious psychic connection to Ai.  John Burgmeier remains sincere throughout in his attempts to thwart Ai’s delivery of vengeance, and even though we don’t find out his motivations until the last few episodes, he never really comes off as preachy about it.  Luci Christian, despite turning in a cringe-worthy performance as Ai’s first victim(I blame bad direction), is able to make up for it when she returns later on as Tsugumi, a little girl confused between childish idealism and an adult understanding of consequences and the cost of life.  Their presence in the story gives it the plot that it needs at exactly the right time, and these two actors could be more of a perfect selection.As for the assorted revolving door of actors that pass through Hell Girl, there are very few bad performances, but quite a few standouts.  There were a lot of flaws in the first episode, but Laura Bailey was incredibly likeable as Ai’s first client.  Vic Mignona melts into the role of a crooked veterinarian, and Caitlin Glass is spectacular as the duplicitous foul-mouthed actress who will do anything to anyone in order to secure her future fame and fortune.  Jerry Russel turns in a somber performance as an elderly former client of Ai’s who’s accepted his oncoming fate with a mix of hope and melancholy that touches even Ai’s heart.  Kate Oxley and Leah Clark play a pair of twins, and since the fact that there’s two of them is meant to be a spoiler, they’re able to match each others voices to the point that even the most astute voice chasers wouldn’t know they were different people.  Pam Dougherty and Carrie Savage play off of each other wonderfully as a cruel old woman and the poor, unfortunate soul she’s taken in as an indentured servant, with the bitter paranoia of the former feeding into and off of the heartbreaking despair of the latter.  I didn’t see this series in Japanese, but I did see season two that way, and I sorely missed the dub when I did, so I’m going to have to recommend dub over sub.One of the most consistent criticisms I’ve heard about Hell Girl is that it’s repetitive...  It has a formula that all episodes must follow, making it something of a monster of the week show, if you were to replace interesting monsters with people beefing with each other.  I can’t in good conscience say that this assessment is entirely untrue, as the show does have a solid formula that you’ll pick up on before too long...  A person is tormented by another, they ask Ai for help, Ai tells them that they’ll have to sell their souls to hell in exchange for her services, the client gets cold feet, the torment kicks up a notch, they relent, and Ai gets to administer brutal psychological torture on the tormentor before maybe or maybe not giving them a chance to repent for their salvation...  Although she never really means it.  This may sound like something that might get tiresome after a while, as several anime with similarly cut-and-paste episodic plots are far too willing to rest on their laurels once they’re assured that people will watch the same story over and over again...  Just look at Sailor moon and Detective Conan, thank you very much...  But there are also several anime that evolve from their formulas.Shows like Princess Tutu and Neon Genesis Evangelion started off just as formulaic as Hell Girl, with the former following the tried and true ‘Magical girl accomplishes task to collect a piece of something” formula that it probably had to rent from Inuyasha, and the latter established itself as one of the best monster-of-the-week anime of all time before diving headfirst into pretentious bullshit.  Like those titles, Hell girl uses it’s first handful of episodes wisely, fleshing out it’s premise at a smart pace, not only exploring the stakes of what people will be doing to each other, but also the extent of Ai’s power and the different ways that usage of the Hell Correspondence may vary.  By the time the Shibata family enters the story to fight against Ai’s activities, we’ve already seen that a contract with Ai can be used to punish a murderer, save one’s life, and potentially also serve malicious purposes such as taking out one’s rivals.  We’ve also seen it established the kind of people who can and can’t access her services, as a shrewd businesswoman with no real desire for revenge finds herself blocked from using it for financial gain.  The Hell Correspondence site, Ai Enma herself, and the show’s truest theme, the true cost of vengeance, have all been firmly established by the time the plot gets off it’s feet around episode 9.The plot culminates in a multi-episode climax that starts off with a certified gut-punch of an episode where the Shibatas are investigating the case against a pretty young nurse, and the results of their investigation shake any faith that young Tsugumi may have had about a black and white justice system where bad people deserve to die, as well as calling into question her...  And any viewer’s...  Belief that Hell girl is a benevolent force that exists to help people and to do the right thing.  Things spiral out of control from there, with Ai fighting against her curse and two very tragic backstories being revealed as the three main characters are challenged with their own pasts as well as each others’, but more importantly, it doesn’t answer any of the questions it raises about the nature of revenge and forgiveness.  It explores the theme from so many angles that you can’t simply boil it down to either one being morally superior to the other, and that’s the sign of good thematic writing.  I hate preachy shows that offer messages with definite answers, because life isn’t made of definite answers...  It’s made of nuance, of shades of grey, and of different perspectives offering complexity into every single choice a person can make.Is it okay to punish somebody if they’ve wronged you, or should you accept the fact that the damage has been done and move on?  What if you know they’re going to wrong you again, and you have the chance to prevent it at they’re expense?  What if you refuse to do so, giving them the benefit of the doubt, but they still hurt you again?  Is it okay to get revenge on them then, even thought once again, the damage has been done?  What if a person hurts you in a way that has serious implications on your future?  What if you have to sacrifice a part of yourself to get back at someone, but it’s a part of yourself you can never get back?  Isn’t it possible that someone else might come along and do something worse, but you’ve already cashed in your only chance to sell your soul for revenge, either literally or metaphorically?  Could you kill someone to save yourself?  To save others?  These are the questions Hell Girl asks, and while the characters facing them may find their answers, it’s never made clear whether or not they’re making the right choices and taking the proper actions.Of course, moral relativism isn’t the only thing this show has going for it.  It’s still entertaining, which may be the most important aspect of all.  The stories follow a repetitive formula, but it’s never the same story twice, and it’s really easy to get wrapped up in them.  They’re all unique, a lot of them can leave you feeling emotional, and yet they’re all important, offering a development to the plot or a new perspective on the theme of vengeance.  The only real exception I can think of is episode 10, Friends, which doesn’t really offer anything and ends in what I have to admit is pretty stupid fashion.  Aside from that, there’s no filler, and barely any fanservice.  In addition to offering a tour of the different Japanese communities and landscapes, it can also teach you a surprising amount about Japan’s various social issues, from obscure topics like collective responsibility and mob mentality to more well known phenomena such as Idol worship, the shunning of outsiders to the psychology behind hikkikkomori culture.  Japan is a strange place, where being in the wrong place at the wrong time can have devastating effects on the lives and careers of not only you, but your family and friends as well, and Hell Girl offers an accessible window into how these social systems work.Of course, I probably shouldn’t go any further without mentioning the obvious downside of having an anime be about vengeance...  If there was ever an anime that deserved to have a bunch of trigger warnings attached to it, it would be this one.  Hell Girl features a wide and mercilessly thorough spectrum of terrible things that people can do to each other, and never shies away from any of it.  Throughout this 26 episode series, you’ll bare witness to acts of sabotage, stalking, attempted murder, actual murder, neglect, child abuse, rape, false accusations, dehumanization, fratricide, infanticide, and no less than two mutually exclusive instances of animal cruelty.  This series is not for the faint of heart, and could easily reopen old wounds in the wrong viewer.  Another obvious issue would be the pile of inconsistencies surrounding how the Hell Correspondence works...  Sometimes people are offered a chance at salvation, sometimes they’re not.  sometimes Ai approaches her client immediately, sometimes she has to investigate the circumstances first.  She almost always waits to suit up until the string’s been pulled, but there are instances where she does so just to meet the client.  After a while, it starts to feel arbitrary, which is kind of a huge misstep, but it’s still one hell of a show.Hell girl is available from Funimation.  You can find the individual DVDs pretty cheap on amazon, but full collections, including the thick series box collection and even the thin SAVE pack, are out of print and can easily run over a hundred dollars online.  Two follow-up seasons, Two Mirrors and Three Vessels, are available from Sentai Filmworks, although the switch in companies led to them being released undubbed, and they’re not exactly cheap either, although Two Mirrors collection 1 can be found for mere pennies.  A manga adaptation by Miyuki Eto is available stateside from Del Rey, and can be found online for relatively cheap, although it’s been over five years since I read the first copy, so I can’t speak as to the quality.  A short-lived live action series ran for 12 episodes starting in 2006, and three further manga adaptations have not been released stateside, nor has the handheld video game.I first saw Hell Girl when the first two episodes aired in Gaiaonline.com’s long forgotten theater feature in 2007.  Funimation was airing a few shows there, but Hell girl was the one I became immediately addicted to.  I went out and bought the first DVD, and before long, I wound up watching it on it’s own several times through.  It quickly became one of my favorite shows as I gathered up each individual disk upon release, before eventually trading it all in for the thinpack to save room on my shelf.  I can easily see someone getting frustrated with the formulaic nature of the series, but for me, it just kept getting better and better.  Of course, even through my furious rewatchings of the first DVD, even I was able to recognize the pacing issues each episode had, as they could either flesh out the client, the tormentor, or the situation, but there was never enough time for all three...  And yet, somehow, my biggest regret about this series is that with so many interesting characters, we never get to check back on any of them.  Just one episode set in hell would be enough, really.  In any case, if you’re looking for a spooky anime to watch this October, this anthology of antipathetic animosity easily gets one of my first recommendations.  I give Hell girl an 8/10. of midnight, and even then, it will only appear to visitors whose hearts genuinely burn for revenge.  This is because The Hell Correspondence is not a joke.  It’s not just some trend, or a petty game to alleviate minor school yard tiffs.  The business of revenge is real, and like any business, the service it offers does not come cheap.  In order to send the object of your ire screaming into the depths of hell, you’ll have to sell your own soul alongside them.Of course, after you’ve used the site, you’ll hear all of this when you’re paid a visit from it’s contractor, not the dark lord satan himself, but a beautiful, emotionally detached young girl sporting a black middle school uniform and an untied hime hair-style.  In a voice as cold and lifeless as her eyes, the girl will introduce herself as Ai Enma, and she will offer you a straw doll with a red thread tied around it’s neck.  She will explain her services, as well as the toll they will take on your immortal soul should you choose to employ them, and she will leave you with one simple choice...  Pull the string and send your tormentor straight into the depths of hell, body and soul, or deny the animalistic urge inside you and offer them your forgiveness.  many Japanese souls have become clients of Miss Enma, and only a select few of them have been able to resist the temptation.

Her lackeys aren’t quite as dynamic, but they’re distinct enough...  Jennifer Seman is knowing and perceptive, Todd Haberkorn is cocky and laid back, and R Bruce Elliot is wise and authoritative, and they all convey a deep sense of devotion and loyalty for their mistress.I’ve praised John Burgmeier before for being an outstanding talent behind the scenes who has more than enough voice acting chops to lend credence to his writing and direction, and Hell Girl features one of his unfortunately few starring roles.

Kate Oxley and Leah Clark play a pair of twins, and since the fact that there’s two of them is meant to be a spoiler, they’re able to match each others voices to the point that even the most astute voice chasers wouldn’t know they were different people.

I didn’t see this series in Japanese, but I did see season two that way, and I sorely missed the dub when I did, so I’m going to have to recommend dub over sub.One of the most consistent criticisms I’ve heard about Hell Girl is that it’s repetitive...  It has a formula that all episodes must follow, making it something of a monster of the week show, if you were to replace interesting monsters with people beefing with each other.  I can’t in good conscience say that this assessment is entirely untrue, as the show does have a solid formula that you’ll pick up on before too long...

It’s made of nuance, of shades of grey, and of different perspectives offering complexity into every single choice a person can make.Is it okay to punish somebody if they’ve wronged you, or should you accept the fact that the damage has been done and move on?  What if you know they’re going to wrong you again, and you have the chance to prevent it at they’re expense?  What if you refuse to do so, giving them the benefit of the doubt, but they still hurt you again?  Is it okay to get revenge on them then, even thought once again, the damage has been done?  What if a person hurts you in a way that has serious implications on your future?  What if you have to sacrifice a part of yourself to get back at someone, but it’s a part of yourself you can never get back?  Isn’t it possible that someone else might come along and do something worse, but you’ve already cashed in your only chance to sell your soul for revenge, either literally or metaphorically?  Could you kill someone to save yourself?  To save others?  These are the questions Hell Girl asks, and while the characters facing them may find their answers, it’s never made clear whether or not they’re making the right choices and taking the proper actions.Of course, moral relativism isn’t the only thing this show has going for it.  It’s still entertaining, which may be the most important aspect of all.  The stories follow a repetitive formula, but it’s never the same story twice, and it’s really easy to get wrapped up in them.  They’re all unique, a lot of them can leave you feeling emotional, and yet they’re all important, offering a development to the plot or a new perspective on the theme of vengeance.  The only real exception I can think of is episode 10, Friends, which doesn’t really offer anything and ends in what I have to admit is pretty stupid fashion.  Aside from that, there’s no filler, and barely any fanservice.  In addition to offering a tour of the different Japanese communities and landscapes, it can also teach you a surprising amount about Japan’s various social issues, from obscure topics like collective responsibility and mob mentality to more well known phenomena such as Idol worship, the shunning of outsiders to the psychology behind hikkikkomori culture.  Japan is a strange place, where being in the wrong place at the wrong time can have devastating effects on the lives and careers of not only you, but your family and friends as well, and Hell Girl offers an accessible window into how these social systems work.Of course, I probably shouldn’t go any further without mentioning the obvious downside of having an anime be about vengeance...  If there was ever an anime that deserved to have a bunch of trigger warnings attached to it, it would be this one.  Hell Girl features a wide and mercilessly thorough spectrum of terrible things that people can do to each other, and never shies away from any of it.  Throughout this 26 episode series, you’ll bare witness to acts of sabotage, stalking, attempted murder, actual murder, neglect, child abuse, rape, false accusations, dehumanization, fratricide, infanticide, and no less than two mutually exclusive instances of animal cruelty.  This series is not for the faint of heart, and could easily reopen old wounds in the wrong viewer.  Another obvious issue would be the pile of inconsistencies surrounding how the Hell Correspondence works...  Sometimes people are offered a chance at salvation, sometimes they’re not.  sometimes Ai approaches her client immediately, sometimes she has to investigate the circumstances first.  She almost always waits to suit up until the string’s been pulled, but there are instances where she does so just to meet the client.  After a while, it starts to feel arbitrary, which is kind of a huge misstep, but it’s still one hell of a show.Hell girl is available from Funimation.  You can find the individual DVDs pretty cheap on amazon, but full collections, including the thick series box collection and even the thin SAVE pack, are out of print and can easily run over a hundred dollars online.  Two follow-up seasons, Two Mirrors and Three Vessels, are available from Sentai Filmworks, although the switch in companies led to them being released undubbed, and they’re not exactly cheap either, although Two Mirrors collection 1 can be found for mere pennies.  A manga adaptation by Miyuki Eto is available stateside from Del Rey, and can be found online for relatively cheap, although it’s been over five years since I read the first copy, so I can’t speak as to the quality.  A short-lived live action series ran for 12 episodes starting in 2006, and three further manga adaptations have not been released stateside, nor has the handheld video game.I first saw Hell Girl when the first two episodes aired in Gaiaonline.com’s long forgotten theater feature in 2007.  Funimation was airing a few shows there, but Hell girl was the one I became immediately addicted to.  I went out and bought the first DVD, and before long, I wound up watching it on it’s own several times through.  It quickly became one of my favorite shows as I gathered up each individual disk upon release, before eventually trading it all in for the thinpack to save room on my shelf.  I can easily see someone getting frustrated with the formulaic nature of the series, but for me, it just kept getting better and better.  Of course, even through my furious rewatchings of the first DVD, even I was able to recognize the pacing issues each episode had, as they could either flesh out the client, the tormentor, or the situation, but there was never enough time for all three...  And yet, somehow, my biggest regret about this series is that with so many interesting characters, we never get to check back on any of them.  Just one episode set in hell would be enough, really.  In any case, if you’re looking for a spooky anime to watch this October, this anthology of antipathetic animosity easily gets one of my first recommendations.  I give Hell girl an 8/10.', ""Well, it's, I think, psychological story in the most. It tries to show you haw can desperate people behave and how much do they want revenge.Main character is Enma Ai, Jigoku Shoujo. Bu she is not participating in story, other characters too (in majority of episodes). Ai has some lines which she always say and in the most of ceses, nothing more. Altought she's still very interesting charcter.If you don't like anime where in every episode is another story, and till half of season nothing is connecting - it's not for you. But still, even with this sitiation short stories from episodes are really interesting,...well thought and you can watch them with pleasure. You can also understand some characters (people) who you will see later.Art:Design is nice, at least in my opinion. Enma Ai looks mysteriously and with other things they did good work too.

It looks at the themes of revenge, sorrow, anger, pity and pain. Initially, the narrative is episodic. The story changes however when the Shibata family is introduced and it is now about a conflict between reason and emotion. Emotion ultimately wins. This anime focuses on the idea that morality is gray. It illustrates how human emotions obscure the mind. This is an important message that sometimes gets lost in the dynamics of the show.The animation is great. The visuals are great with large landscapes and a very multicolored cast. Often there are repetitive motif, e.g., the image of flowers...blooming from Ai’s kimono. Overall, it is striking.The soundtrack enhances the melancholic feel of the anime. It is appropriate for the themes. The opening song Sakasama no Chō suits the character Ai Enma perfectly. The use of interludes and dramatic music during revengeful scenes is an effective technique for establishing the tone of the emotional storyline.Nearly all characters are those profiting from deals with Ai. Each episode features various contractors including the youths and their perpetrators. These characters represent different human emotions. On the one hand, Ai Enma as well as the members of Shibata family are depicted with very dynamic and interesting personalities but the same cannot be said about Ai’s helpers because their characters are not developed so much.Generally speaking, this show is unlike the rest of revenge stories. It makes a point that the basis of revenge is quite often trivial and insubstantial. It’s interesting and its overall feel makes up for some flat character depictions.

I was somewhat correct in my assumptions.  Jigoku Shoujo is enjoyable, but the repetitiveness in each episode quickly gets boring.  Each episode stands alone, focusing on unrelated characters and situations that focus on bullying, deceit, abuse, blackmail, etc, and the inevitable premise due to the victims decision to pursue vengeance by sending their tormentor straight to hell at the cost of their own soul being destined for hell as well.Ai Enma\'s role is fairly small, despite being the focus of the series, and her major role...is to simply do her job without question.  Things only shift almost halfway into the series when a reporter gets involved and takes it upon himself to stop Ai, and somehow persuade these damaged individuals to not enter the covenant with Ai by pulling the thread.  This, too, gets a tad bit redundant after a while, but I stuck with the series, somewhat bored with the pattern, but still intrigued with the personal cases in each episode.What does make this series worth sticking with are the individual cases in each episode.  They\'re stand alone stories, and some of them are actually very good and gripping.  The series does a good job creating tension between the characters and using a variety of methods to display different types of evil, or sins, that are worthy of a boat ride to hell.

And the main characters niche is... wait for it... to go against the modus operandi of the show (and I mean it almost literally).Each story lasts exactly one episode, with the main character's overreaching plot throughout.Warning: this series is sufficiently dark, tragic, and depressing, if...that's not your cup of tea, then I recommend not watching it.

What I\'m about to write will be a bit spoilerish so be wary.As you know, the main story is about a girl who takes bad guys to hell after they were cursed by the victim.The main idea is fighting the morals: is it right to curse/kill bad people or no? Almost like Death Note.The problem is that series don\'t really explore it that well since every episode things end up the same way. The bad guy never admits the fault what is a bit refreshing though I really believe that there should be some exceptions.Victims are ready...to send people to Hell almost for everything and without even trying to do anything themselves about it! A lot of cases could be avoided if the victims actually tried something! There was one exception where the girl seemed to change her mind though when she saw a computer, the old idea of vengeance instantly came back. Every single person had pulled the string, is humanity really that dumb and ready to suffer for eternity just to make up for one bad moment?This whole set up was cool for the first like 8 episode but then it just got too repetitive.Angel Beats suffered because of lack of the episodes while Jigoku Shoujo suffers because of having too many of them.

A lot of cases could be avoided if the victims actually tried something! There was one exception where the girl seemed to change her mind though when she saw a computer, the old idea of vengeance instantly came back. Every single person had pulled the string, is humanity really that dumb and ready to suffer for eternity just to make up for one bad moment?This whole set up was cool for the first like 8 episode but then it just got too repetitive.Angel Beats suffered because of lack of the episodes while Jigoku Shoujo suffers because of having too many of them.

When the client summons her, she appears and explains how the revenge will work, and will give the client a straw doll that has a red string tied, and if the client unties it, the person he/she cursed will be sent to hell rightaway. However, he/she will be sent to hell as well, although it is after their death. When the cursed person is sent to hell, the client will have a tattoo in their chest, a mark that will prove they had a contract...with Ai, and will be sent to hell after their death.Each episode consist of different plot, revolving around the person who summoned her. Each episode is shown why  Ai got summoned by that certain person, some of the stories are really tragic and heartbreaking, it can make you cry. I consider this more of a tragic drama rather than a horror really, cuz it somewhat lacks horrifying scene (well some parts are shown how they will suffer in Hell, but the preview is really not that horrifying).The only drawback of this show is that there\'s a lot of mysteries that are left unanswered, and for 3 seasons, almost all of the episodes ended the same way-they always unties the red string of the straw doll.

I've always had a thing for stories that have a moral to the plot. And the people aleays get what they deserve at the end. No terrible deed goes unpunished. I love it and I'm addicted,  I've finally got season 2 and 3 and I will review the hell out of those too. This series is definitely one of my favorites. "", 'Lets begin with saying that I really like this anime. Although it’s an old one (it could be started in 2005 and ended in 2006, but it could also have been from 2006 to 2007. The web is not clear on that) it still holds up today.The story is about Enma Ai, but she is better known as Jigoku Shoujo, which means girl from hell. But saying that the story is about her, is not true. Every episode focuses on other characters. These people have been wronged in life, and seek revengeTo get their revenge, they go to a site (that weirdly enough...has the same name as the nickname of the protagonist) while its 0:00 hour, to request the death of the one that wronged them, and for them to be dragged to hell by Enma.But there is a steep price for wanting the revenge. When the person who asked for the murder dies, he/she will not go to heaven when they die, but will also end up in hellThe strength of this anime is the struggle the characters go trough. You see that the characters have trouble deciding if they actually want these people murdered (they souls will also go to hell, after all) I had moments that I had tears in my eyes while watching those people get wronged. And I had moments of pure joy when the people who wronged them got carried to hell.The building up to the moment when someone decides if they really want revenge is also done beautifully. You get why they want revenge, you feel happy for them that they get that said revenge, and at the same time you feel sorry, knowing that they will also end up in hellThere are however also some things that aren’t that good with the anime.Lets begin with the reason that I decided to watch this anime. I wanted a good horror anime, and I expected to have a lot of horror, and some action here and there. This is not what you get from the show. Don’t let the premise of people being dragged to hell fool you that this is an anime with lots of horror.I’m not saying that the lack of horror is a bad thing. I mean, I just said that I think that this is an great anime that knows how to hit your emotions. Its just something totally different than true horror anime. It has scary moments, yes, but not enough and not as scary enough to be called an horror animeAnother thing that isn’t that good about the anime, is sometimes the moments on when the show tries to make you feel something. What I mean with this, is that sometimes its to obvious that you should feel sorry or that you should cry, while these moments aren’t that moving. This, however, rarely happens, and isn’t that big of an issueAnother thing to note: if you want funny shows, then don’t watch this. If you want a lot of action, don’t watch this. If you want horror, don’t watch this. What I’m trying to say is that this show is definitely not for everybody. This is a ‘’feel’’ show, and if you don’t like crying or sudden shift of moods, then don’t watch this animeFor the people who like ‘’feel’’ shows, like to cry to movies, can appreciate good characters and story, and doesn’t mind the lack of action/horror or funny moments, watch this anime.

Its for you', ""At first, I was curious about the story of Hell Girl so I watch it...I actually got bored in the earlier episodes because the story and events keeps on repeating... there's always a victim and they die and they got a tattoo... there always the same.BUT when i watched the later episodes the story bloomed and there are new characters that are present in each episode(constant). So i didn't stop watching it... The last episode made me really cry..MUST WATCH!!! "", 'Someone you despise or causing you harm? Someone you wish you could just send to hell? Then your in luck! At midnight just look go online and look for the hell correspondence and enter the name of the person you hate most. Then hell correspondence will immediately come and sweep them off to hell...there is a price of course. You will be entitled to live out the rest of you mortal life...though when your time comes you too must join us here in the fiery underworld!Sounds like an interesting story doesn\'t it? Something a bit new, a bit different, a bit edgy? Well it is!...The first time, the second time...maybe even the third time. Though the fourth time? Fifth time? Sixth time? Yes I\'m sure you can pick up what the problem with this anime is...it\'s repetitive!Here we have a gem of an anime! And I really mean that! It\'s something new, has an interesting story, a character we want to learn more about, and even more characters come along and move the plot along. There are episodes that also add more depth to the whole situation. Why Ai is forced to ferry people to hell. How people had access to hell correspondence before the time of the internet. How Ai is forced to ferry people to hell weather they are good or bad. You don\'t have to be evil for Ai to drag you off to hell, once your name is entered that\'s it! There is also a man, who\'s daughter has some kind of connection to Ai, so he begins to investigate the hell correspondence while he and his daughter\'s lives are taken over by the whole thing.That right there is an amazing series! That right there is a 12 episode anime that is strong from beginning to end! And keeps you invested the whole way through! ....but...that\'s not the anime we have....no we have a 26 episode anime....filled with repetition.First we see Ai dragging people of too hell, but after episode 3 we keep seeing it over and over again! Then we see the man investigating Ai, and here I was getting excited! ""Okay"" I would say to myself ""Here must be where the action starts!"" well again it is interesting to see the man investigate what Ai is doing, but it gets a bit old after seeing him do the same thing for ten episodes. And here we do see the kind person who gets dragged to hell. He also comes across an artist who is obsessed with Ai. Though again these good episodes become few and far between.Then we come to the end, the part that just about kills me. The back story for Ai, and no I won\'t spoil anything don\'t worry! But here we have this character we have been building up for a good 20+ episodes! A mysterious character who drags people to hell, against both hers and the other\'s wills. So what is the best way to handle this person\'s back story?....why cram it into the last three or four episodes and hastily run through it of course! O and do a complete personality flip on her as well too! ...um hello?Oh and Ai\'s helpers? who were they? who knows? Why were they there? Why are they helping Ai drag people to hell as well?....well why should we care? The creators sure as hell didn\'t!Hell Girl is just one of those animes that frustrates me! Like Sacred Blacksmith or Kashi Mashi, here you have so much to do an interesting story! Here even more so then the other two because you have something totally new and engaging! And so much that just adds layers of complexity to this story! And this really wouldn\'t of taken much to make this one of those stand out anime classics like Death Note! Keep the interesting episodes, make it a 12 episode series, and add a bit more depth to the characters, rather then just having them take up space, and there you go! An anime worth anyone\'s time!Well I have not seen season 2 or 3 just yet, so maybe they are a bit of an improvement, though given the circumstances here I\'m tending to doubt it. Don\'t even waste your time on the manga! As for this, if you seem interested then I recommend this to those who can sit through the repetitive bore just for the tiny glimmers that shine through.

Though it might not hurt just to give this one a pass.', '<Note that this is a Review of Jigoku Shoujo Season 1 only>Jigoku Shoujo is one of those animes that you really have to be mature enough to appreciate fully. I watched it when I was younger and enjoyed it but having watched again years later I appreciate it even more for how it analyzes very dark topics, most notably the idea of revenge and the price one pays for it. Is Jigoku Shoujo a great anime? No but it most certainly is a very good one that is head and shoulders above anime that may be more popular.Story: 8The good news about most of the...series is that its episodic so you can watch most episodes out of order and not miss much. The bad news about this series is that its episodic so if you grew up hating ""monster of the week"" series then you might not enjoy Jigoku Shoujo for its stories. That being said even if you don\'t like the episodic format I highly recommend you watch the show in small doses at least because a number of the stories in this season are very clever and leave you with some troubling thoughts. Although for most of the stories there are fairly obvious villains tormenting poor little girls (yes most of the time it is little girls) there are also a number of episodes where the villain isnt that clear or there is no villain or where in the end the victim gets punished by the villain. In fact some of the best episodes in this season feature last second twists that make you question how worth it vengeance can be sometimes (the answer is very much worth it in some cases). Season 1 also subtly builds up to a confrontation between Ai and Hajime, one a vengeful spirit, and the other a man seeking to convince people that what Ai is doing is just wrong. The fact that we get to see Ai\'s origin story unfold in the last 3 episodes of the season are also very rewarding.Art: 7While the art and animation in Jigoku Shoujo is completely fine it probably wont win any awards for artistic design. There are a few nice shots of beautiful scenery and the artists deserve credit for coming up with pretty unique looking new character designs for each episode, the art of this series is good but not great.Sound: 7While the voice acting in this series is generally very good (impressive given the need for different voice actors each week for the non-leading roles), the soundtrack is hit or miss in season 1 (if memory serves they did a better job with the sound in later seasons). First of all the opening and closing songs really do not fit in with the tone of the series (yeah how often does that happen in anime *sarcasm*). At the same time though the soundtrack picks up during certain parts of each episode...especially the music that plays when Ai is summoned following a string being pulled off a doll and the music that plays right as Ai is about to condemn someone to hell. There are unfortunately a few parts where a musical cue or change in the soundtrack could have made a shocking moment even more impactful but these opportunities are occasionally missed...not often but often enough for me to notice.Character: 9The writers deserve a lot of credit for coming up with both interesting lead characters and mostly interesting weekly episodic characters. Enma Ai herself is deeply complex. She is a vengeful spirit forced to ferry people to hell based on the desire for vengeance held by other people but at the same time she herself is forbidden for acting on her own desires for vengeance and she must take people to hell regardless of if they deserve it or not. One particularly tear jerking scene near the end of the season has Ai taking a clearly good and innocent young woman to hell as she pleads for Ai to stop. We get to see just how complex Ai is at the end of the series.Sadly Ai\'s assistants are not that complex in season 1 but this is rectified in season 2 so it doesn\'t hurt the series too much. Also interesting are Hajime and Tsugumi. Though individually the two sometimes get in the way of the weekly drama (sometimes on purpose) together they have a very thought provoking debate about what Ai is doing and whether vengeance can sometimes be justified or not. Also Tsugumi is sometimes quite adorable in how she acts despite being a little girl.Finally lets not forget the episodic characters. In Season 1 most characters outside the main cast never show up for more than one episode. This means that every week the writers have to come up with new and interesting characters (including villains) for a new and interesting story. For the most part they succeed in this. While a few episodic characters are basically stereotypes (see bratty schoolgirl bully in episode 1) most of them are quite interesting and some of them are actually amazing (if you like dogs there are one or two episodes where you yourself might feel actual feelings of hatred towards an anime villain).Enjoyment: 9Maybe I am a bit messed up for saying this but overall I enjoyed Jigoku Shoujo even more than other anime including some that are objectively better than it. The episodic nature means you can come back and watch just your favorite stories if you want without missing much in the way of an overarching story (there is one but it doesn\'t really reveal itself in full until the last 3 episodes). If you like watching character\'s struggle with difficult questions then you should enjoy this series. If you are looking for something lighthearted or action packed this is not the anime for you.Overall: 8While Jigoku Shoujo certainly has its faults, they are but cracks in a remarkably engaging and thought provoking facade. As a series I am happy to see it get so much attention in terms of 4 seasons and an honest to God live action adaptation. Jigoku Shoujo is one of those shows that proves anime isn\'t just for kids and you can also make mature anime without resorting to language, super violence, or sexual content...so won\'t you try dying this once? series is that its episodic so you can watch most episodes out of order and not miss much.

Jigoku Shoujo is one of those shows that proves anime isn\'t just for kids and you can also make mature anime without resorting to language, super violence, or sexual content...so won\'t you try dying this once?', 'Although the story starts pretty well, it quickly became repetitive, though it didn\'t bother me since I liked the concept. But then the show introduced 2 new main characters : Hajime and Tsugumi.At first it was good, Tsugumi was a little annoying at times but she is 7 years old so it is understandable, and Hajime is an asshole but he was acknowledged as one. But as the story progressed, it started portraying Hajime as a great guy, who only did one mistake, even though that\'s the only thing that can\'t actually be blamed on him. Short reminder of his palmares as a ""great guy""...:As a husband : He is an absent man, claims to love his wife but will leave her at the first occasion without looking back, and is never sorry for what he does ; even 7 years later he still thinks he was justified and she was entirely in the wrong (not saying cheating is fine, I\'m just saying he is far from innocent).As a father : He is an irresponsible father who puts his daughter in danger by dragging her with him to confront being far out of their comprehension, all out of his sense of ""justice"". Other than that, he seems to at least provide her with what is needed to survive, but he doesn\'t look like he is much more present as a father than he was as a husband.As a person : Hajime is presented as a petty and angry man in his first interaction with his subordinates, in the past. He was rejected, and everyone should suffer because of it, of course. He is the type of man who will leaves his own wedding to take picture of a poor guy just living his life, all so he can publish it and makes money off their misery. 7 years later, at the beginning of the series, Hajime is a scum who gain money by blackmailing people and destroying lives.This person is the ""good guy"", and his point of view is supposed to be an alternative to Ai\'s. It could be understandable if he had a problem with Ai\'s contractor also being sent to hell, since most of them don\'t deserve it, or the fact that one doesn\'t actually have to be a bad person to be sent to hell, but that is not the case. No, Hajime just think that no one should be sent to hell, or even punished for that matter. Not yakuza, not rapist, not even serial killers. Because of course, every lives is precious.Now the reason I\'m speaking so much about him is because, he is a big weakness, for two reasons. First, since he is a scum and his brain doesn\'t work, Ai doesn\'t have any real moral adversary. We are not presented with 2 alternatives. It is either go to Ai for vengeance, or fully forgive the other since Hajime told you to do so. We are never presented with the alternatives of trying a better solution than contracting Ai, Hajime doesn\'t advocate for human\'s justice, he just says ""eh, let it go, it would be better"", but better for who, except the culprit ?  Not even once is a solution presented, it\'s either condamn the other to hell or forgive them. It\'s like the possibility of not taking revenge but not forgiving is never even brought, like the justice system doesn\'t exist in this world.Secondly, there is a parallel created between Hajime situation with Ayumi and Sentaro situation with Ai. Both cared for someone greatly, both were driven to do something irredeemable to said person, and both tried to move on from it. However, while Sentaro was a good man who, due to the fear of being executed with his father and the despair of the whole situation, was driven to do something horrible and never stopped repenting till his death, Hajime is a common asshole who did and still does horrible acts every day while never seeing anything wrong with it, and only repent for the one thing he was actually not responsible for. The parallel doesn\'t work, in fact they are opposites.Due to this, the whole point of the series about forgiveness vs hatred falls flat, because Ai appears as the only real solution, and the only way for the serie to make us think she is wrong is to have her litterally torture a 7 years old girl for hours. Thinking about it, there was plenty of things to say about her methods, about revenge itself, but this wasn\'t explored because Hajime wasn\'t good enough.This could have been a 8 or 9/10 if there had been actual moral debates, or if they had just decided to not talk about morals and just focus on the individual stories, but with Hajime here it just falls flats. Too bad I guess. :As a husband : He is an absent man, claims to love his wife but will leave her at the first occasion without looking back, and is never sorry for what he does ; even 7 years later he still thinks he was justified and she was entirely in the wrong (not saying cheating is fine, I\'m just saying he is far from innocent).As a father : He is an irresponsible father who puts his daughter in danger by dragging her with him to confront being far out of their comprehension, all out of his sense of ""justice"". Other than that, he seems to at least provide her with what is needed to survive, but he doesn\'t look like he is much more present as a father than he was as a husband.As a person : Hajime is presented as a petty and angry man in his first interaction with his subordinates, in the past. He was rejected, and everyone should suffer because of it, of course. He is the type of man who will leaves his own wedding to take picture of a poor guy just living his life, all so he can publish it and makes money off their misery. 7 years later, at the beginning of the series, Hajime is a scum who gain money by blackmailing people and destroying lives.This person is the ""good guy"", and his point of view is supposed to be an alternative to Ai\'s. It could be understandable if he had a problem with Ai\'s contractor also being sent to hell, since most of them don\'t deserve it, or the fact that one doesn\'t actually have to be a bad person to be sent to hell, but that is not the case. No, Hajime just think that no one should be sent to hell, or even punished for that matter. Not yakuza, not rapist, not even serial killers. Because of course, every lives is precious.Now the reason I\'m speaking so much about him is because, he is a big weakness, for two reasons. First, since he is a scum and his brain doesn\'t work, Ai doesn\'t have any real moral adversary. We are not presented with 2 alternatives. It is either go to Ai for vengeance, or fully forgive the other since Hajime told you to do so. We are never presented with the alternatives of trying a better solution than contracting Ai, Hajime doesn\'t advocate for human\'s justice, he just says ""eh, let it go, it would be better"", but better for who, except the culprit ?  Not even once is a solution presented, it\'s either condamn the other to hell or forgive them. It\'s like the possibility of not taking revenge but not forgiving is never even brought, like the justice system doesn\'t exist in this world.Secondly, there is a parallel created between Hajime situation with Ayumi and Sentaro situation with Ai. Both cared for someone greatly, both were driven to do something irredeemable to said person, and both tried to move on from it. However, while Sentaro was a good man who, due to the fear of being executed with his father and the despair of the whole situation, was driven to do something horrible and never stopped repenting till his death, Hajime is a common asshole who did and still does horrible acts every day while never seeing anything wrong with it, and only repent for the one thing he was actually not responsible for. The parallel doesn\'t work, in fact they are opposites.Due to this, the whole point of the series about forgiveness vs hatred falls flat, because Ai appears as the only real solution, and the only way for the serie to make us think she is wrong is to have her litterally torture a 7 years old girl for hours.

Too bad I guess.', ""I feel kinda sad after the last episode. Why? Because the question kept going on and on inside my mind: would I do it?

It's true that the art and sound are both are actually exceptional. Even the characters that are introduced are more often than not interesting. But the big problem with Jigoku Shoujo is one that is most often cited... and it's a BIG problem... there is absolutely no progression or variety in the story.So, let's take a break here and I'll admit something: I haven't gotten through more than half a dozen episodes. I just... I just couldn't! Life was wasting while I sat through 20-something minutes of the...exact same thing over and over (and over and over) again. To be fair, though, I will finish it and update this review if somehow it changes (which it seems does happen right at the very end).The truth of the problem with Jigoku Shoujo is that the repetition is outright lazy. I'm all for episodic shows, and I typically find them to have a greater rewatch value than ones with continuing story lines. But the reason for that is that with each episode you get a new story altogether, and in many of the episodes you get more insight to the common character(s). That's not the case with Jigoku Shoujo. With this show, the only difference is in the exposition. After that, it's the same plot progression, the same execution and, as pointed out before, even identical mechanics in the banishing part. For me, that made each episode worth about 5 minutes of new material. Personally, I don't think 20-something minutes of viewing time is worth 5 minutes of a new story. Perhaps the most irksome, though, is that the writers probably could have taken enough liberty with the story to actually give the views something, ANYTHING new after the victim and wrongdoer have been introduced.So, what's the point of repeating what's been said in other reviews? It's to stress just how defining the repetitive nature is of Jigoku Shoujo. Apparently some people don't have a problem with it as they are able to focus solely on the victim/wrongdoer combo for 20-something minutes. If you're the type who doesn't mind watching reruns over and over (and over and over) again, then none of this is likely to bother you. In that case, you'll probably really like this! However, if you're not sure, just be careful; maybe give it 3 episodes to decide if you can handle the repetition but, until further notice, I wouldn't put yourself through the torture if you're at the WTF?! stage by then. Also, I suspect Jigoku Shoujo may be easier to handle if the episodes are spaced apart. When I tried this show, I was doing 1-2 per day, which obviously was too much! However, I think that if I did 1 episode per week (which is how I'll retry it), it might be a lot easier to handle. And, if you're not sure about this show when you go into it... good luck! exact same thing over and over (and over and over) again.

Ai Enma the titular Hell Girl as she carries those who were cursed by people who seek revenge to the pits of hell, and in return, she claims their souls on the day they die for entering a covenant with her. All you have to do to get the person sent to hell (as well as yourself eventually) is to pull a red string and...the person immediately is sent into hell.The episodes are pretty formulaic, and you can watch any episode and not have to worry about missing out on anything. Some episodes were recycled in later seasons. But then again, many of the episodes were so similar that they seemed the same. As time goes by more characters who are somehow connected to Ai Enma join the cast. These companions had the best personalities and stood out the most because of how colorful they were, and for the various ways they took people into hell.Ai Enma, despite her stoicism, questions her job from time to time but is still highly effective as there is a never-ending supply of bad people to hunt down. Many people who ask for her Ai Enma’s help have very understandable reasons to do so and the majority of the characters who get sent into hell are very unsympathetic.The animation was pretty decent, and the art was very good. The music was pretty solid and the voice acting was decent. The atmosphere was dark and the more you watched it the more you root for Hell Girl and her companions to send people to hell. You know that the person is going to hell but the way they carry it off has a dark comedic flair. The world it isset in is pretty bleak and dark and pretty much almost everyone in the story is at some point going to be sent into hell due to how evil they were.Some of the “villains” weren’t really villains they were just innocent people being killed just because someone didn’t like them for the most pettiest reasons imaginable which is sort of breaking the premise as the anime is about sending bad people into hell.

On the Hell Link, you will be prompted to type the name of the person you hate the most and afterwards, you shall meet the Hell Girl.This anime... No! This series, created by Studio Deen, may be the best franchise in the psychological genre. Each episode, with a few exceptions, follows a person who is victimized by another constantly, maybe even down to the point of insanity, before learning about the Hell Link and making contact...with Ai Enma, the eponymous main character. When meeting Ai, she presents the victimized person with a straw doll that has a red ribbon tied around its neck. To banish their most hated person to Hell, they must pull the string off. However, the power to instantly send a person to Hell comes with a price: When the client's time comes, they too will go to Hell, so don't think of this power as a complete blessing to have.Most of the time, the red ribbon does get pulled off, sending the targeted person to Hell. Once that happens, Ai and her companions psychologically torture them with hallucinations until they can't take it anymore. From there, Ai transports them directly to Hell by ferry and the deed is done. It's just so satisfying to see bullies and criminals get what they truly deserve after all the atrocities they've committed.However, the real meat and potatoes start when we are introduced to Hajime Shibata and his daughter Tsugumi Shibata. One day, Ai and Tsugumi crossed paths while the latter was crossing a railroad. Ever since this encounter, Tsugumi is able to see what Ai sees whenever somebody requires the services of the Hell Link. Hajime takes advantage of the situation to try to prevent each client from sending their most hated person to Hell as he morally believes the Hell Link is wrong. That leaves questions to be asked. How was the Hell Link established? Where did the connection between the Shibatas and Ai come from? What is Ai's backstory? Of course, the answers to those questions are spoilers, so you'll just have to watch the anime for yourself if you want to know.I'd say the music for Hell Girl peaked at the very beginning. The opening song, The Inversed Butterfly is a masterpiece soundtrack; It may just be one of my favorite Japanese songs of all time, both inside and outside of anime. Even if you have no interest in watching Hell Girl, at least listen to the full song at least once. The ending theme, Basting fits the anime very well. Its tone is half chill, half somber capturing both feelings after seeing the victim finally getting their revenge. Now that their worst enemy is gone forever, the rest of their life should proceed without any fear. However, they can't be happy all the way as with a fire tattoo placed on their chest, they will always be reminded their soul is destined for Hell on the day of their death.This is all I can pretty much bring myself to type in to keep this review spoiler-free. Hell Girl is a very dark anime, giving us actual accurate portrayals of the bad side of humanity. I kid you not, what each victim goes through can happen to someone in real life. It can range from bullying, framing, or even as far as a woman punishing another woman for seeing her commit adultery just because she did a p*ss poor job closing the curtains for her windows. The psychological genre is definitely not for the faint of heart. Keep in mind that I watched this during my mid-20s. If you're younger than that or you really can't handle the genre, do me a favor and see the Recommend label mean that I like this anime. Like I said, the Hell Girl series is the best psychological work in my opinion. with Ai Enma, the eponymous main character. When meeting Ai, she presents the victimized person with a straw doll that has a red ribbon tied around its neck. To banish their most hated person to Hell, they must pull the string off. However, the power to instantly send a person to Hell comes with a price: When the client's time comes, they too will go to Hell, so don't think of this power as a complete blessing to have.Most of the time, the red ribbon does get pulled off, sending the targeted person to Hell. Once that happens, Ai and her companions psychologically torture them with hallucinations until they can't take it anymore. From there, Ai transports them directly to Hell by ferry and the deed is done. It's just so satisfying to see bullies and criminals get what they truly deserve after all the atrocities they've committed.However, the real meat and potatoes start when we are introduced to Hajime Shibata and his daughter Tsugumi Shibata. One day, Ai and Tsugumi crossed paths while the latter was crossing a railroad. Ever since this encounter, Tsugumi is able to see what Ai sees whenever somebody requires the services of the Hell Link. Hajime takes advantage of the situation to try to prevent each client from sending their most hated person to Hell as he morally believes the Hell Link is wrong. That leaves questions to be asked. How was the Hell Link established? Where did the connection between the Shibatas and Ai come from? What is Ai's backstory? Of course, the answers to those questions are spoilers, so you'll just have to watch the anime for yourself if you want to know.I'd say the music for Hell Girl peaked at the very beginning. The opening song, The Inversed Butterfly is a masterpiece soundtrack; It may just be one of my favorite Japanese songs of all time, both inside and outside of anime. Even if you have no interest in watching Hell Girl, at least listen to the full song at least once. The ending theme, Basting fits the anime very well. Its tone is half chill, half somber capturing both feelings after seeing the victim finally getting their revenge. Now that their worst enemy is gone forever, the rest of their life should proceed without any fear. However, they can't be happy all the way as with a fire tattoo placed on their chest, they will always be reminded their soul is destined for Hell on the day of their death.This is all I can pretty much bring myself to type in to keep this review spoiler-free.

Of course there is a price to sending your tormentors to hell.Story (6): To be completely honest the anime is the same thing over and over again, it lacks a plot change until around the 18th episode in. But if you do stay for the first 18 episodes you\'ll mostly likely enjoy the rest because you start to learn more about Hell Girl herself. Some of the episodes shined more than others but all in all they were decent.Art (9): It was really nice art nice and...sharp the character designs were all different you didn\'t really see anyone that looked like the same person in the last episode. And everyone looks beautiful, even the old people look good. And Hell Girl looks like the most beautiful thing in the world I always looked forward to her appearance in the episode. To me her eyes are just hypnotic.Sound (8): I borrowed the DVD of Hell Girl because my friend absolutely loves the series and owns the complete box set and on the title menu before you hit play the music is just epic and addicting, my friend and I would just leave it playing. But the OP and ED fit the series well and they sound good together just slow somber songs that shows the somber feel of the anime.Character (6): The characters are very basic when you look at the person you can tell what character they are going to be. You can always tell who is going to be who in every anime you watch but in Hell Girl you can really tell who is who, the way the character looks you can basically judge their character.Enjoyment (7): When I first started watching it I liked it a lot, I liked hearing about peoples problems and why they wanted revenge. But then the stories slowly got slower and slower. To me it went from these juicy episodes (1-10) to like ""We ran out of ideas and tried our best."" episodes (11-18). But all in all it was decent for the most part.Overall (7): I\'m only giving it a 7 because my friend made it sound like the greatest thing since sliced bread and over the years I\'ve heard nothing but good talk about Hell Girl. But to me it reminds me of the quote ""All that glitters is not gold,"" That\'s how I felt. I mean towards the end it did get better but too be honest I\'m only going to start season 2 and 3 for my friend. If it were up to me I\'d probably have stopped watching it a long time ago.

Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37027/Love_Live_Sunshine_The_School_Idol_Movie__Over_the_Rainbow,"['It\'s a heck of a lot better than the second season, but that ain\'t saying too much.As someone who still holds the original Love Live in somewhat high regard, Sunshine was quite frustrating to watch. The first season was decent, OK, but left a lot to be concerned about regarding its future. And sure enough, every single concern I had was present in the second season, with a few extra frustrations tossed in for maximum joy. The drama was overblown, so cloying, so far up its own arse that it thought minivans flying into the moon is apparently what idol fans were clamoring for. The...characters remained one-dimensional caricatures with minimal growth, save for perhaps Ruby\'s and Ria\'s involvement with one another, which was probably the season\'s one saving grace. So, yeah, a bit disappointed I was, perhaps one might say.And so comes the movie, Over the Rainbow, bringing the series back somewhat to its roots, serving as a reminder of what Sunshine should have been in the first place.Though there is plenty of drama here as per Sunshine routine, this time around it serves more as a companion to the quieter, sillier moments and the characters\' interactions with one another. Because they no longer have to spend every waking second freaking out about their school potentially shutting down, the girls of Aquors are free to finally do their own thing and focus on their own future rather than that of the school\'s. What will happen to Aquors now that the third years are graduating and leaving the group? Is it worth continuing Aquors without the full nine present? Can Rea move forward on her own now that her partner and role model has graduated from Saint Snow? These questions are far more compelling, far more human than something as artificial as ""well, the school might be shutting down, so I guess we have to be as popular as we can or whatever and scream about shining every ten seconds or so.""The result is that the drama hits, because it actually matters this time around. Though Over the Rainbow is still a bit too heavy for its own good (this is an anime about high school pop idols, after all...), the conclusions the characters come to feel like the natural destination for their story, and the bittersweet ending— the final concert in particular— carries a tinge of emotional weight similar to that of the original Love Live\'s ending. If you are easily moved, perhaps you might be on the verge of a tear or two, but in my case it was just too late to feel all that much.The musical performances (and I do mean \'musical\' musical, a la Grease or La La Land) are undoubtedly the high point of the movie; notably, the opening sequence near the train station, the girls gradually introducing themselves and speaking to the audience through lyric, was very cleverly choreographed and a catchy little song in itself. The animation is more of a mixed bag, as even with movie treatment the dances are mostly comprised of artificial-looking CG, not all too different from any typical episode of the TV series. The way the camera quickly zooms in and pans around is a lot more enthralling, however, and some of the stills and background shots (especially of the Italian cityscape) are stunning and on par with some of the best the industry has seen. But I guess Love Live has always been pretty palatable to the senses, hey?So, if, like me, you were critical of Sunshine but enjoyed the original series, Over The Rainbow ain\'t too bad. It feels closer to the original, better balancing the drama with the comedy and focusing more on what the viewers want— music and girls— rather than trying to wax philosophical and change your life through the sheer force of melodrama.If ever there is a third Love Live anime series, I\'d like to see them do something slightly different. We\'ve done this story twice now, identical format and all, so I can\'t really imagine a third time around would get people all that excited. Why not have all the girls start as first years together, so the story can run for longer instead of being reset every time a couple of the seniors inevitably graduate. Things could even continue beyond high school as they would all still be together. Heck, while we\'re at it, you could also lower the cast from nine down to five or six so that they all have more screen time and can get more fleshed-out. Just my ten cents.But if the upcoming All Stars mobile game is any indication, the next iteration of Love Live characters look to be more of the same.Not that it matters, I suppose, because I will play it, and I will enjoy it solely because there is Nico. characters remained one-dimensional caricatures with minimal growth, save for perhaps Ruby\'s and Ria\'s involvement with one another, which was probably the season\'s one saving grace.

Sunshine!! Over the Rainbow (or in short LLS:OTR) was quite a phenomenal movie. Though it didn't really do much new when it comes to Love Live's nature.The story makes zero sense. I won't spoil, but we get MORE drama throughout the movie that feels so out of place, and many flaws you can point out that make no sense. But if you're already used to Love Live!, you'll understand the basic concept does not make sense at all (Ex: Where the heck does the music come from?), and still a few...other contradictions.If we put the story aspect aside, we get a masterpiece of a movie. The songs and dances in the movie were amazing, especially with the constant switching between CGI and 2D, which I found to be done really well (especially if you compare it to the very first season of LL).The songs were really good overall, a few bangers, a few mediocre ones, it balances it out.The setting in general was really nice (Italy!), though it's quite a shame that like in µ's movie they didn't have way too much time abroad and went back to Japan to solve the rest of the series.The movie gave the finale we needed for the series, and I still have hope to see spinoffs or similar anime adaptations in the Love Live! universe.Oh, and by the way, if you're a 3rd years fan, this movie just hits the sweet spot that gives them quite some screen time.In general, if you're already a fan of the series, you're going to love the movie, but if you aren't really, you'll meet the same old flaws and problem yet again.And since I'm a huge fan, I rated it 10/10. other contradictions.If we put the story aspect aside, we get a masterpiece of a movie.

Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie Over the Rainbow gives us the resolutions that the anime series left us and did it BRILLIANTLY.Well the premise of this movie to even get Aquors to Italy is that Mari, Kanan and Dia have gone missing and Mari\'s mother tells the remaining to find Mari and Mari\'s mother will give them a huge sum of money if they...succeed, thus Italy but it\'s not as easy as it seems, but this plotline is only the base premise as Chika and the remaining Aquors have a bit of a problem both performance-wise and friendship-wise what with Mari, Kanan and Dia having graduated and it\'s affecting them harshly. Later on, Saint Snow comes in and much like Aquors\' breaking up, Saint Snow but more precisely Leah can\'t take it that Sarah is also graduating and is ALSO having problems forming an school idol group on her own.For characters themselves, Mari has taken focus for the first half of the movie what with Italy and all, but she gets some much needed development aside from being the wacky Engrish girl and sure....her development is to do with her mother thus family issues and as much as it\'s cliche, Mari\'s development was still decent and a nice foundation and push for the plot to move forward. Yoshiko\'s chunni gets her own due, yes for laughs but nonetheless. Hanamaru and Yoshiko seemed to be the comedic relief of the movie Yoshiko...being Yoshiko but Hanamaru gets the running gag of eating EVERYTHING in Italy. Kanan and Dia become essentially satellite characters to Mari for the first half of the movie but what with both of them having development from the anime series it kinda makes sense for Mari to take the spotlight as she needed it. Ruby much like Leah gets the same development with their older sisters but Ruby is at the end of it as she KNOWS and has moved forward whereas Leah is at the middle of it and finally given the resolution she got in this movie. Chika, Riko and You gets oddly enough the least amount of development with once again You getting the least out of the three. Chika being the de facto leader of the 6 remaining Aquors members and really she does most of the decision making for the movie, while Riko and You are the cheerleaders, You does have one other addition that of You\'s cousin, Tsuki who is a student of the main school that Uranohoshi\'s student have transferred to and much like You helps Aquors, oddly enough Tsuki got the development that You needed as Tsuki tags along with Aquors and later on finds how great being School Idols are and in turn making the main school to show that Uranohoshi is worth being in their school (instead of the branch school they got dumped into). Riko though is similar to You, screentime wise and ""yuri shipping goggles-wise"" got way more than You, as Riko interacts more with both Chika and Yoshiko. Once again You gets shafted.The animation done once again by Sunrise, well the background work was AMAZING especially during Aqours\' stay in Italy. The character designs and expressive facial animation was done to great and sometimes wacky results. Character designs-wise, though it\'s still consistent as the anime series, the movie gave Aquors are VARIETY of costumes for any time they change locations or a new time of day (seriously, their sets of costumes could fill up a rich mansion\'s closet!). The Live\'s CGI got better as well from the second season\'s anime series, though it\'s still obvious when they use CGI, they blended quite well to the point it\'s not distracting, just noticeable. All in all, Sunrise went ALL OUT for this movie\'s animation and for such a ""farewell"" movie, it was to be expected.Voice cast was back and great as always, with some standouts being Aina Suzuki as Mari because come on, while Yoshiko and Hanamaru\'s voice actress Aika Kobayashi and Kanako Takatsuki gets to go full ham or comedic and their one liners were great. Tsuki\'s voice actress who was uncredited (?) was pretty much the same cadence as Shuka Saitou voiced by You pretty much showing that Tsuki IS very much You\'s cousin. But all in all, since they not only voice the characters but the singing was great and with that. Aquors\' voice cast is back and better than ever in this movie so all in all. Great voice cast..as always.Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie Over the Rainbow did what u\'s couldn\'t with their movie and that is RESOLUTIONS and Over the Rainbow actually made it a tearful but satisfying resolution and farewell with Aquors and tied up loose ends from it\'s anime series and to that end makes it a much better constructed movie, yes it\'s similar to the u\'s movie at the start (main cast goes somewhere outside of Japan) and the 3rd Years have graduated and having to deal with it and to Over the Rainbow\'s end with characters have a mixed development to their resolutions, some little to nothing *cough* You the ever satellite character *cough* but Over the Rainbow nonetheless ENDS tying up ANY loose plotlines with it\'s characters the anime series left hanging, whereas u\'s movie gave us an open ended farewell and left it at that.u\'s anime series and movie was too happy go lucky, almost coincidental in how things ended up as to be status quo and got the series in a static limbo with its movie\'s finale, but to state, LA doesn\'t think u\'s movie is horrible as a result, that movie did what it did, yes with some flaws but it was a farewell just not a decent one, whereas Aquors from it\'s anime series dealt with being an idol group and with it\'s 3rd Years gradating soon in a much more logical way and with this movie gave us a proper farewell and resolutions that were established in the anime series.If you haven\'t noticed, LA was very satisfied with this movie as LA can see Aquors moving forward in earnest. Over the Rainbow...well went over the rainbow and once again, gave us a pretty satisfying, yet tearful farewell, what else would you want more for an idol movie than that showing that an idol group can happily move forward with no regrets. succeed, thus Italy but it\'s not as easy as it seems, but this plotline is only the base premise as Chika and the remaining Aquors have a bit of a problem both performance-wise and friendship-wise what with Mari, Kanan and Dia having graduated and it\'s affecting them harshly.

Sunshine! Series, this movie was a massive show. Eventhough i never watch the prequel before, because i just need this movie just for a refreshener, i can't say a bad word for these amazing music story. I may be too over reacted, but my point here was clear and exact to the main course, i love this movie!Following to the disclosure of the mqin school, they try to give a brand new school idol to the branch school on an abandoned building as a main school base. Like its written in...the synopsis based on MAL, the mission was simple. But, they failed first. Then had a great movement in the next scenery and so on. How heart-warming for me! Despite random activity happen for the next half of the movie, like goes to the Italy, prevent arranged marriage of Mari, even helping their solo rival Leah arise again, these movie can not lose its shine!Straight to the last performed, until their final music show, all of them match together in harmony. Aquors, now bring more fun to the new school citizen, and gladly received a welcome appreciation! I can't say other words rather than an incredible amount of sweet music, an amazing art and animation, a beautiful sounds performance by all of the VA, a wonderful story and well building to the characterization, just that words can flowing from my mind. I might be naives, giving too much score, straight to 10, to a non-watcher series before. However, after watching the first franchises of Love Live! School project in the first, my points shall be crystall and solid. Yes, i shall watch the anothers. But, for this solo movie, my 10 can granted all of my wish together as one.Thats all i can say for thiw short summary of review, as usual. Not much, i think. Even the last review can not be the same as this. But still, 10 per 10 for all of the sections was my final deduction. the synopsis based on MAL, the mission was simple. But, they failed first.

I don\'t think it\'s justified to call the Anime adaptations a cashgrab, but all of them so far have been pretty mediocre and anyone who has seen Love Live Sunshine (LLS) knows what the expect from the movie.If you happened to like LLS, that\'s great. You will probably like ""Over the Rainbow"" (OTR) too, as it does essentially nothing different from the TV series....If you didn\'t like the TV series, well that\'s too bad. You probably won\'t like OTR either. The movie managed to leave behind the forced drama about Aquors\' beloved school closing but at the same time it introduced new unnecessary drama.Like the TV series, the movie lives off mostly of the cute interactions between the members of Aquors. Everyone has retained their quirks and they are used for comedy throughout the movie. We get to see a lot of new musical performances which makes you feel like you\'re watching disney movie because the characters happen to sing and dance in the most unlikely of situations. Sometime during the movie it became clear to me that the story of the movie is just an excuse to show the characters\' new performances. This is also where the movie differs a bit from the TV series: There is no longer any driving force behind Aquors trying to perform as school idols. Heck, there is no longer any driving force behind the story at all. The TV series concluded it perfectly with Uranohoshi closing and merging with another school. And here we are in OTR, with Aquors thinking about how to continue their lives, now that Dia, Kanan and Mari have graduated.The trip to Italy could have been a great adventure if it hadn\'t been botchered by the reason of why Dia, Kanan and Mari disappeared. As it turns out, Mari\'s mother tries to force her into an arranged marriage to restrict her freedom. An interesting turn of events, but the way it\'s resolved is in typical LLS fashion: Mari convinces her mother to cancel the marriage if Mari can show her that she can make people happy while performing as a school idol. Of course, her mother agrees and Mari manages to persuade her later on. I know that drama has never been a strength of Love Live, but come on ... that whole arc was really laughable.Dragging through the movie is generic ganbatte talk. The characters are motivating each other a lot, but that\'s really only on a superficial level. It has been like that in the TV series as well and it\'s continuing in the movie. Combine this with the fact that there is no competition anymore and you may start wondering what kind of goal our characters have in mind. At the beginning of the movie, it is clear that due to Dia, Kanan and Mari having graduated, the remaining members of Aquors have trouble performing at their full potential due to lacking 3 members. Fast forward to the end of the movie, they suddenly are able to perform with only 6 members, despite having learned exactly nothing.Aside from Mari\'s arranged marriage, other subplots have been introduced during the movie as well. One example would be Leah from Saint Snow having trouble to assemble a new school idol unit, now that she can\'t perform with Sarah anymore. This subplot, like all others, was left severely underdeveloped and it\'s resolve was basically pulled out of thin air. A new character was introduced as well, You\'s cousin Tsuki, but she didn\'t really serve any purpose besides just exisiting.Music should be one of the greater strengths of Love Live, yet I find most of the songs to be pretty generic J-pop. I have no deeper attachment to any of Aquors\' members (neither to the Anime characters nor the real singers) and with the exception of ""Mirai Ticket"" I have not found myself to really enjoy any other of their songs. Maybe I\'m not the target audience of Love Live, but I don\'t see what makes the music any different from other idol groups.My rating of 4 may seem harsh, but you should put it into your own perspective. It\'s the same rating I gave the TV series because I think the movie is just ""as good"" or ""as bad"", depending on your perspective. As I said in the beginning, if you liked LLS you will probably like the movie too. But looking at LLS as a standalone Anime, I think it\'s just bad. It\'s bland characters, bad story, forced melodrama, repetitive comedy and average music all makes it a bad Anime for me. Sadly, the movie offers no real development and makes the same mistakes. That\'s why I think only fans of LLS will love it. It\'s certainly not made for a general audience. If you didn\'t like the TV series, well that\'s too bad. You probably won\'t like OTR either.

Wait, don't immediately think this movie will be boring. Its a banger. They have a new character. They have a new song. Not only that, we will also see how Aqours grow up without their 3rd year members and its really touch my heart.Story 10/10The story here for me is kinda relatable. I'm a 3rd year too and will graduate soon. Eventually we need to live by ourself and not relying to other. The story is not that complex but the meaning is. Sometimes i even forgot this is a music anime because...the story is so well made. Before i watch Love Live, i thought music anime is just about music and threw off everything unnecessary. And now my view is changed by Love Live.Art 10/10The art style is also same like their anime. Nothing special for the movie. But they really improve them CGI. It looks so smooth when they changing between CGI and normal art. They sing more frequently than before and i like it. Their dancing, choreography, and costume is look really good. Also don't forget how they draw  the background so beautifully. Its a brand new thing because half the movie didn't set in Japan.Sound 10/10Of course it would be perfect. The OP, ED, BGM, SFX, insert song, its all great. One of the main reason i want to watch this movie is because i watch Hop Stop Nonstop MV on YouTube. Why? Because its so beautiful and increase my curiosity how the story led to this song. And for the seiyuu, i give them a double thumbs up. If you think about it, they do the VA and also sing all the song that ever exist on both the movie and the anime. (please note that if you watch Hop Stop Nonstop MV you will get major spoiler of the movie)Character 10/10Even though this is a movie which is shorter than anime. They manage to make all the girls character development perfectly. Aqours, Saint Snow, and fellow Uranohoshi student have it too. I like how they are not focus on Aqours only. It is a hard task to make every characters bond with the viewer and they do it like a pro. For real tho, this movie speak to me on spiritual level. I'm currently facing one of the problem here and its so relatable. Well its not that i'm trying to be a school idol, but you got the point.Enjoyment 10/10This is the perfect ending for this anime. But don't sad, even though they are done with the anime, they didn't stop producing media to consume. You can listen to their song, you can watch their live show, or if you are a gamer you can play their game. Should you watch it? Well if you are into this kind of anime you can give it a try. But if you can't stand childish thing like overly reacted scene, i think this is a no good. But overall this is actually a good movie and I will definitely remember this series as that 'School Idol anime'.I'm really really satisfied by watching this movie. I've been craving it for months. I can't watch it at the time because i'm not finished with the anime yet. I do reccomend watching all season of the anime first if you want to watch this movie. Thats all i gotta say about this movie. Thank you for reading my review. the story is so well made.

The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow was an anticipated movie for many Love Live Sunshine fans. Using the same trope of ""Traveling Abroad"" just like the original Love Live series, they look to produce the same amount of closure in the franchise as well as the original did. However, this really wasn\'t the case sadly.______STORY: LLS Movie is an extended epilogue of Love Live! Sunshine!! 2nd Season. With the 3rd years graduating and the others merging in with another school, we look to see how they close the show. It started off nicely with the 1st and 2nd years struggling...to find their way without 3 members missing. However, the switch to the ""3rd years missing in Italy"" arc was out of nowhere and the result of the arc was worthless other than to showcase the ""trip abroad"" trope that the original did. Nothing really was given to the characters rather than the ""Friends got our back in everything"" concept.Then switching back to include Saint Snow\'s dilemma was rapid as well and didn\'t really help the main group of Aqours resolve their own problems until later on in the movie.The ending did feature a touching way to end off the series, but everything preceding this was clumsily directed and filled with filler. But I\'ll get to that in the ""Enjoyment"" section of this review.______ART: This movie showcased a vast improvement in it\'s art and animation compared to the 2nd season. The CG models of the girls performing are much better. Backdrops looked quite nice as well.______SOUND: Just take the same OST you got from previous Love Live anime but add in a few new original songs and you get this movie\'s soundtrack. I personally liked all of the songs although listening to Aqours\' singles, they sound quite similar and not so different from each other. Saint Snow\'s newest song was my standout pick for the soundtrack of the movie in my opinion.______CHARACTER: As an extension of my thoughts on the story, the way the movie was paced and directed felt sloppy and really didn\'t do much for any of the individual characters at all. Even as a group which left a mixed feeling for me when finishing the movie. The characters did showcase the tropes that made us love them from the first 2 seasons cause they did have standout moments of comedy and great character chemistry. But seeing as this movie **should** be a defining conclusion to the LL: Sunshine franchise. This felt like filler and that\'s disappointing.______ENJOYMENT: As per mentioned in the previous sections, my enjoyment of the movie was flawed due to the sloppy pacing of the story and underwhelming character growth mixed with the ""laugh out loud"" moments produced by the lovable girls of Love Live Sunshine. Seeing how they marketed this movie to be a ""crazy trip abroad"" type of movie and seeing the end result was disappointing in my opinion as the whole trip was pretty wasted potential.______FINAL THOUGHTS: Love Live! Sunshine!! The School Idol Movie: Over the Rainbow was a overall fine movie. As an extended epilogue to the 2nd season of Sunshine, this was a pretty underwhelming experience. However, for hardcore Love Live fans, this will definitely satisfy you for the comedic moments and good songs that the movie offers. If you have seen the trailer for this movie, don\'t expect much from the abroad trip or even the movie as a whole. You\'ll be disappointed, like I was.5/10 to find their way without 3 members missing.

I'm baffled that this whole thing was shoved into a movie instead of being the plot of the entire second season, which it could have easily accommodated (and the second season instead being a bland repetitive plot with no originality). The art and music are, of course, stellar and the characters are at their most extreme - which is good, because that's when Aquors feels most original, rather than their usual day to day not-quite-knock-offs of the Muse cast. Yoshiko and Mari get a lot of spotlight here and that's fair, because they're some of the most interesting...and original of the crew, unlike Hono- I mean Chika. The side characters are meaningless and I don't really understand their introduction but they're in the movie so little that I don't care. In all honesty, though, this movie is the thing to watch if you want the best of the Aquors experience without wasting your time on the bad pacing of their two seasons, the repetitive nature of plotlines, and at least it isn't a direct copy of the Muse movie, unlike the rest of the Aquors series. My hopes for the next group of girls being in any way new or original now that another anime has been confirmed isn't very high. and original of the crew, unlike Hono- I mean Chika.

My hopes for the next group of girls being in any way new or original now that another anime has been confirmed isn't very high."", ""I've held the Love Live series in high regard for years at this point and have went into each series cautiously and optimistically in mind to how the series got its start with School Idol Project. Of the many spin-offs and followups after SIF, Sunshine definitely had a rocky start as Aqours' biggest issue throughout Sunshine seemed to be establishing their own identity apart from the likes of Muse and in some way this movie gives them another chance in doing what season 1 was trying to do, but it still has it's own issues.Over the Rainbow follows up on the plot point with...the school that season 2 left off with and the 3rd years are naturally preparing for life after high school away from Aqours and the remaining 6 members struggle to function as a group knowing the 3rd years won't be with them going forward. This is the biggest plot point of the movie along with a continuation of school drama Aqours seeks to resolve following the closure of Uranohoshi Girl's High School in season 2, but it's not the only one as the film picks up a good few other narratives and attempts to provide some clarity on. If you're a fan of Sunshine then perhaps you'll be content with how it looks at all issues with heavy dramatization and solving those issues through configuring their emotions and everything else works alongside their own evolutions. You could say the overly dramatic approach to storytelling is a part of what makes this series what it is at this point and I'd be inclined to agree, but I didn't feel like it juggled the handful of plot points too well here. The trip that they take to seek out the 3rd years gets rendered pointless by it not being relevant other than mostly serving for a temporary setting. And like it the other plot points are either rushed towards a conclusion too soon or resolved a bit too easy in favor of the movie reaching a satisfying ending for everyone.Aqours themselves are all back and carrying the same cute quirks and traits as they've always had and along with them Saint Snow as well. Over the Rainbow somehow felt like it didn't do anyone in Aqours too much justice for anyone individually. Even for the few who get highlighted we're not given too much time to absorb ourselves in the drama because it gets solved quicker than it feel like it should've been. The few who'll get some seperate camera time get at least a little something in, but the rest seemingly get relegated to roles they already had from the TV series.(Like You being snubbed of screentime more than Chika & Rika, Hanamaru & Yoshiko acting as comic relief to varying degrees, and Ruby at least being able to synchronize & develop in a similar sense with Leah from Saint Snow over their sisters and idol performances with them)While it staggers with the story it does of course do great with everything else. The songs and performances are of course good as expected, may be so bold as to say I might have a new favorite Aqours song or two now from the movie. While I don't quite have an eye for details regarding things like CGI, there is nothing I have to say against it here because it's something Love Live does very well all around it's multiple series. The models always look good and the choreography for the dances seems impeccable, some of the best choreography in anime tends to come from this series. Also liked how the movie felt more like a musical too with how well they'll move from a scene then immediately transition into a performance.Over the Rainbow treads into the same familiar territory that it the Sunshine TV series does but for better and worse in various respects from both seasons, but if you liked Sunshine then you'll likely like the movie as well. The movie didn't quite feel like the farewell for Aqours that I hoped it would've been like with μ's but it felt like it did them just enough justice for me to walk away and feel like the series has concluded. But I did like that it ends on the same note that season 1 starts on, and rather than that goodbye like μ's had this felt simple and pleasant. While Aqours' overall tale was a bit rough having retread familiar territory and stumbling a bit on it's own spins it was still nice being with Aqours for the ride. the school that season 2 left off with and the 3rd years are naturally preparing for life after high school away from Aqours and the remaining 6 members struggle to function as a group knowing the 3rd years won't be with them going forward.

However, there are other ways in which it falls flat.Over the Rainbow is a movie with a good plot but with poor writing.Spoilers:So one of my biggest problems with the movie is just how absurd it all seems. The conflict and the early plot are actually pretty good, I like the dynamic with Mari and her mom fighting about her potential marriage and the fact that the third years ran away. However, the story wasn't executed the best. The characters range from...pleasant like Yoshiko to annoying like Hanamaru, who essentially does nothing but eat and whine. Then you get other characters like You that get no screentime because they decided it would be a good idea to include some annoying 1-dimensional copy of her who takes away some of her screentime. Kanan and Dia also don't get nearly enough screentime, I think it would have been kind of cool to see them talk more about their relationship with Mari. The music is phenomenal, as to be expected, especially Saint Snow. The art is pretty good although some of the design choices like the lips bug me a little (that may not bother you, it's more of a personal preference for me). The pacing isn't the best but it is better than the other LL movie, so I guess that's something. I don't really see what was essential about the girls going to Italy. They could have literally done the same story but just have the 3rd years go run away to Tokyo or something. Why Italy? Is it because Mari has family there? You can add that to the list of things that this movie never explains. I do like the conflict towards the end with Leah and Sarah, it's kind of a nice touch but I wish it had been built up to throughout the movie better, it's just kind of shoveled in there.Despite my critiques, this movie does do a lot of things right. It kept me invested, it had good music, the art was good, and it is, I suppose, a satisfying conclusion to Aqours' legacy. Not the best movie of all times, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it. pleasant like Yoshiko to annoying like Hanamaru, who essentially does nothing but eat and whine.

I watched it right after school idol project, and it just felt like an exact carbon copy with slightly different characters and circumstances, and I got a little tired of the forced overdramatic scenes.Coming back and watching this movie, I realize that\'s what made this series good in the first place. The drama is overdramatized and the ""touching"" moments are so cliche and stupid you could laugh, but honestly I still love it. It\'s not well written, but...despite that it still manages to be fun. This series still has some actually amazing music though, and the animation is surprisingly good too.Overall, this is basically just a trashy high school drama, but I still love it. despite that it still manages to be fun.

With a 1st episode that threw all convention out the window, it didn\'t take long for it to garner buzz within the anime community. While I entered with some second-hand knowledge of the involvement of zombies in the show\'s plot—due to the inescapable whispers coming down the grapevine—I assumed that the subject matter would have merely been treated as a backdrop for cute girls to get involved in silly, tension-less slapstick; with the overbearingly cutesy aesthetic that it was sporting on its cover photo being used as my basis for assessment....I was expecting something along the lines of 2015\'s Re-Kan, where the supernatural elements were just treated as a mere comedic gag, rather than anything integral to the narrative.And while the deceptive(troll) opening theme and most of the show\'s 1st episode run-time had me duped into believing my assumption, that premature assessment was quickly shattered with the show\'s ominous reveal towards the latter end of the episode. Of course, there were a few foretelling signs with the way some characters were acting and visual cues scattered throughout the episode, but I was still fooled nonetheless. With that being said, to get the most out of this title, I highly suggest you refrain from doing any research on it beforehand and just watch it blind. So unless you\'ve already watched the show or simply don\'t care, I advise you to stop reading this review any further. And with that warning in place, for everyone else, on with the show.The juxtaposition of ""cute girls doing cute things"" to zombie apocalypse was certainly an odd departure not often seen in anime. In fact, I don\'t recall anything going down that specific route at all. The closest point of comparison is magical girl shows that take a darker turn as it progresses (Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica), or shows that use sickeningly cute characters and slice-of-life moments before venturing into a bone-chilling bloodbath (Higurashi no Naku Koro ni). But as far as anything that follows directly in Gakkou\'s footsteps, I\'m drawing blanks. At the very least, I can say it\'s a unique experience.While the ""cute girls doing cute things"" formula is omnipresent throughout the show, it\'s the moments that it skews into a more unnerving, sinister tone that really makes it stand out. Like the hunting technique practiced by the Angela fish, Gurashi baits the viewer in with a warm, radiant glow surrounding its material, helping lower any defensive walls that might have been set in place. And in this brief instance that you\'re lulled into a carefree disposition, Gurashi proceeds to pull the rug from under you, as the illusion of comfort fizzles away into something more visceral and disturbing. Gurashi\'s ability to toy with the viewer\'s response goes beyond a simple bait-and-switch, it\'s a sleight-of-hand trick that not many storytellers are capable of executing well. While some of the tonal shifts throughout the show doesn\'t always transition to the best of its ability (due to improper cohesion between the polar opposite genres being played with), it still manages to keep you on your toes when ""shit hits the fan.""And perhaps the best illustration of this technique in motion can be seen when discussing the characters themselves.Yuki Takeya, our main lead, is a person only tethered to sanity thanks to the willingness of her friends to walk on eggshells in her presence. With such a fragile PTSD mindset that\'s standing at the edge of rational thought—the likes of which could be toppled with the slightest nudge; a great deal of the show\'s appeal comes from essentially watching a human ticking time-bomb that could be sent spiraling into madness at any given second. She\'s Gurashi\'s central focus and rightfully so, as she not only stands as a psychologically disturbed individual but more importantly, an embodiment of this very delicate duality between escapism and the harsh reality that this anime will come to be to known for. This topsy-turvy mental state was brought to life with visual cues that demanded the viewer\'s attention. Brightly lit hallways and classrooms teaming with jovial faces are singed away for dilapidated structures and bloodstained walls. We\'re forced to commandeer Yuki\'s point of view, watching the murky line between the happy past-life she chooses to embrace as her reality, while the actual truth she rejects—the bloody aftermath of what was once a loving school environment—be the reason that her mind is slowly being torn apart. The subconscious of a girl where only two options exist: either carry on living in denial or be permanently broken if made to face the truth of this post-apocalyptic zombie-infested world—the ultimate catch-22.And while Yuki\'s involvement brought the necessary intrigue needed to hook audiences in for more, I can\'t say the rest of the characters boasted the same ability. They were given episodes dedicated to fleshing out their backstory, but their personalities, from beginning to end, were rather one-note. At best, they had the basic requirements covered to carry the narrative but nothing noteworthy beyond that.But for everything that Gakkougurashi had going for it, there was a clear misunderstanding of the essentials needed to craft its content into a great show; more specifically, where to further its concept from being more than simply a novelty act. Today, we\'ll discuss the two major issues that prevented Gurashi from reaching the inner-circles of universal critical acclaim that it so desperately desires.The 1st major issue that quickly became apparent with each passing episode was the way the show handled Yuki\'s mental state. When dealing with a mentally disturbed individual, proper psychoanalysis and character exploration is needed to make the broken person\'s psyche believable. Without it, we\'re simply given a gimmick that\'s only viable on superficial terms. With Gurashi, we see the events that trigger the mental breakdown of the character, but it\'s never explored beyond face value. There\'s no actual introspection given to justify the way the character is presented. And sadly, because of this, it\'s reduced to only being used as a ploy for shock value and generating easy-to-consume entertainment. It may have been intended to be more than just that, but it just wasn\'t detailed enough to get that point across. Since all of the characters were already cookie-cutter stereotypes and no visible effort was shown to develop or add dimension to them, the show, as a result, often felt shallow.It didn\'t have the finesse of something like Perfect Blue, where we get a 1st person perspective into the mind of our protagonist as we experience her gradual breakdown between what\'s real and imaginary, playing out through the narrative and in her mannerisms. Nor was it like Abenobashi, where the internal strife of the main character was externalized into a visual metaphor for further inspection, while also dedicating time to flesh him out as a grief-stricken teen going through a phase of denial.""Show, don\'t tell"" and ""shock and awe"" were something Gurashi seem to struggle to distinguish between, which was ultimately the reason it was kept off the pedestal with those that did do this kind of character breakdown right. Simply put, it was a case of style over substance that became painfully obvious when the gimmick of the character\'s mental state was recycled every episode for entertainment value instead of thematic relevance.The 2nd major issue was the story progression itself, or should I stay, the lack thereof. If viewed as a character-driven narrative, it fell short of the mark (noted by the aforementioned problems I discussed), and if viewed as a plot-driven narrative, it was a monotonous dribble that repeated the same shtick every episode. It was ""moe"" antics followed by dark, demented slice-of-life on constant repeat. The reason this worked for shows like Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni was because of the commitment made after the plot twist. Once it revealed the major tonal shift to its viewers, it gradually leaned and stayed in the ""darker"" territory. There was no flip-flopping back and forth between cutesy and dark, which in turn added poignancy to the central conflict at hand. It kept moving forward to its inevitable destination and was never back-peddling. This was Gurashi\'s fatal flaw and ultimately what placed the final nail in its coffin. It simply spun its wheels in the mud, thinking it can depend on the same trick to carry it from beginning to end. And because of this, the show was always stuck in a state of stagnation. The only episodes that tried to break this cycle were the final ones, but by then, the damage was already done.Had Gurashi dedicated the effort necessary to make Yuki more than just a circus act for our amusement, or placed more effort in its narrative to avoid meandering in circles, it could have been one of the best highlights from 2015. But like many shows with an exciting premise, Gurashi just didn\'t know how to deliver in the end.While the plot twists and shock factor moments made the show a fun spectacle, I couldn\'t help but feel a lack of engagement. The moe aesthetic and sensationalized depiction of Yuki\'s damaged state stopped all chances of the severe moments of Gurashi from really having a firm grip on me. This was also the problem I had with Higurashi and Madoka Magica, despite their more successful rendition of this kind of storytelling. They too succumbed to this trigger-happy depiction of cuteness meet sinister. It\'s just something I can\'t see beyond an entertaining party trick. And since Gurashi kept jumping back and forth between lighthearted moe and demented slice-of-life, after a while, the novelty that had won it so much attention had quickly faded away; something that\'s made all the more self-evident from the lack of staying-power it\'s had among anime enthusiasts. It was enjoyable at times but only on a surface level, and in the end, left me more underwhelmed than satisfied.Gakkougurashi had the potential to make something that subverted the typical formula associated with the ""cute girls doing cute things"" setup but ultimately did nothing to capitalize off of it. Sadly, it\'s yet another case of a good premise underutilized and poorly handled. The right ingredients were there but at the end of the day, what was served up was a lukewarm dud. I was expecting something along the lines of 2015\'s Re-Kan, where the supernatural elements were just treated as a mere comedic gag, rather than anything integral to the narrative.And while the deceptive(troll) opening theme and most of the show\'s 1st episode run-time had me duped into believing my assumption, that premature assessment was quickly shattered with the show\'s ominous reveal towards the latter end of the episode.

Sadly, it\'s yet another case of a good premise underutilized and poorly handled. The right ingredients were there but at the end of the day, what was served up was a lukewarm dud.', 'If you have no idea what this show is about, you’re one of the lucky few that can still dive into this quirky ‘slice of life at school’ show blind. It’s mostly centred on antics and club events thought up by Yuki, guided by the athletic Kurumi and motherly Yuuri. You’ll either love Yuki, (she’s so crazy~) or empathise with Miki’s level-headed reactions to her; Miki acts as a foil to Yuki, providing some gravitas to the show. After one episode you will likely either want to drop it or watch the rest. If you don’t know anything about it, watch an episode before you...read the rest of the review.If you’re reading on past this paragraph I’m assuming that you’ve either finished the first episode or at least know what happens in it. It’s pretty much impossible to describe the show without giving away things that happen in the first episode, but I’ll avoid spoiling anything beyond that.If someone had come up with the idea of ‘moe horror’ I would have regarded it with the same suspicion that I would regard a ‘death-game harem’, or a ‘mecha romance’. It’s all well and good in theory, but if you try to keep a consistent tone while staying true to the concept you’re inevitably going to wind up with too much ‘harem’ and not enough ‘death-game’, or too much ‘moe’ and not enough ‘horror’ (or, to continue with the analogy, some really inorganic character development). To balance out the conflicting themes in this instance you really need some sort of excuse to violently flip between a light-hearted slice of life show and a dark post-apocalyptic horror without breaking the audience’s immersion. Fortunately, one method to making this strange transition between completely different tones work resides under Yuki’s cat-ear beanie. With what comes across as either complete insanity or a pathological determination to keep things happy and light-hearted, Yuki manages to get the other characters to forget about their situation, which in turn lulls the audience into that same sense of security. With such a setup, flipping the show back into a horror is as simple as cutting away from the mood Yuki has created.We soon discover that the show’s title is a clever pun in more ways than one. ‘Gakkougurashi’ follows the daily lives of a cast of mostly schoolgirls that are quite literally living at a school, flipping between their attempts to have fun and enjoy their lives on a day-to-day basis, on the one hand, and showing how each of them found themselves in such a situation, on the other.A significant portion of ‘School-Live!’ is spent on flashbacks, showing events that led up to their current situation. This approach takes away from the tangible sense of threat, but has the advantage of bringing the oh-so-rational Miki into the first episode (which is an amazing thing for people that aren’t a huge fan of Yuki). It’s a trade-off and a departure from the source material, which unfortunately leads to a few minor plot holes being ripped open from the fabric of the narrative. Given the context of the narrative presented, I was happy for them to spend plenty of time showing how the situation had come to be the way it was. That’s where most of the excitement of this setting should reasonably come from given the nature of the show. Once our protagonists have managed to find safety, the plot as it is generally needs to rely on their desperation or stupidity to inject any new threat into the narrative without the audience losing immersion, so focusing on the lead-up to their situation was a good idea overall.The characters vary widely in personality traits and outlook, and you’ll likely find that at least one of them has a mentality you can gel with. The power dynamic and relationships between the girls are multifaceted and interesting mainly because of what they represent. Yuuri holds an unspoken and uncontested authority over the group as a pre-designated maternal leader, Kurumi is a hot-headed badass that quickly resorts to violence, Yuki is a psychotic and emotionally manipulative idealist, Miki is a stoic and cold-shouldered pessimist, and Megu-nee is very similar to that clumsy yet lovable substitute teacher you likely once had: she panics, falls over, and drops things, and is ignored far too often by her students when they don’t need her help. From that melting pot of conflicting ideals and character archetypes comes a series of friendships built from necessity; built upon the cornerstone that is the hardship of their desperate situation.There’s a sense of self-awareness maintained in the writing throughout, whether it’s (quite literally) pointing to other works that it has drawn inspiration from (such as the movie ‘I am Legend’ and the novels of Stephen King), or lampshading apparent plot contrivances by having the characters ask questions the audience were themselves wondering about (viz. why is this school so oddly well prepared for what happened?). This is one of the biggest strengths of the show and a huge part of why I’m comfortable giving it a high score. The writers clearly knew the artistic context of what they were doing and had a reasonable sense of how the audience would react to what they were seeing.The art of ‘28 Moes Later’, however, was an unfortunate stumbling block that marred the show in some respects. I’m not against the ‘moe’ art design and see nothing intrinsically wrong with it (except that it’s being used so often in modern anime that any departure from it feels like a breath of fresh air). The problem is moments of laziness and inconsistency that were obvious enough to be distracting: the characters are occasionally drawn out of proportion or with slightly misplaced features. It’s not something I would normally bring up, but it’s an obvious bad sign when such mistakes are even apparent to people that aren’t looking for them.I briefly mentioned before that this show had departed from the source material in several respects. Some of these changes were worse than others. The inclusion of Miki in the first episode was a reasonably appropriate change from the manga; however, cutting out most of Miki’s character development by simplifying her backstory was a strange decision. If only they hadn’t included multiple episodes worth of drawn out sequences of events that did nothing to further the plot (viz. filler), we could have at the very least blamed the restrictions in episode length and number for biting the source material in the backstory! Speaking of backsides, that’s about how abruptly (and awkwardly) this show segues into fanservice. The artistic direction panders to its audience in this regard to the point where it gets in the way of the plot; the writers of the show seemed to hold contempt for the idea that there are only so many appropriate times and places for panty shots or getting changed into bikinis. Fortunately these moments don’t tend to occur in conjunction with the more ‘dark’ scenes, a plot contrivance that I’m more than happy to forgive when faced with the alternative (a brutal deconstruction in more ways than one). Suffice to say, if you’re put off by unnecessary fanservice you may find a few scenes cringeworthy. Most of it is well within the bounds of plausible deniability though, so it’s fair to bet that you won’t find it worth dropping the show over.Back to the positives, the OP of this series is a blast! Each episode the opening video is slightly (or dramatically) altered so that it’s full of Easter eggs and little pieces of foreshadowing. One of the fun things about following along with the show week by week as it aired was seeing the community pore over all the minor details and changes, most of which I wouldn’t have noticed otherwise! The ending songs ranged from ‘boring enough to skip’ to ‘delivering emotional crits’, depending on how well you’ve connected with the characters.‘Night of the Living Lolis’ is in some respects what you make of it, which is fitting given that one deeper theme brought up in the show is about the extent to which one can construct their own reality, and to what extent this functions as a tool for overcoming adversity. It’s a theme that’s there, but the onus is on the viewer to engage with that theme if they want to. No direct questions and answers about these things are thrust in the audience’s face, but how you engage with the aforementioned ideas will be made clear from what you think of the characters that espouse respective opinions on those same ideas through their conduct.After a middle arc easily described as wading through treacle, the final arc of ‘GG’ regains focus and the plot starts to lunge forward to an exciting conclusion, quelling any fears that the setting had been forgotten about. How much of an impact this show will have on you will come down in part to how willing you are to forgive plot contrivances due to being invested in the characters, although in your judgement of such things you’ll often be less disappointed if you give the writers the benefit of the doubt. For what it’s worth, rape alarms are that loud, rusty metal is that weak, generators do make noise, and shovels are heavy.If ‘not judging a book by its cover’ has equivalents in anime, one could be ‘not judging a show by its genre’. And while it certainly wasn’t many of the animators, at least someone from Lerche genuinely tried to make this work. At a first glance, Gakkougurashi! looks like the result of moe creeping into ever more unfitting genres and settings, but thanks to the great writing it truly showed signs of life even when it should have by all rights been dead on its feet. read the rest of the review.If you’re reading on past this paragraph I’m assuming that you’ve either finished the first episode or at least know what happens in it.

One of the fun things about following along with the show week by week as it aired was seeing the community pore over all the minor details and changes, most of which I wouldn’t have noticed otherwise! The ending songs ranged from ‘boring enough to skip’ to ‘delivering emotional crits’, depending on how well you’ve connected with the characters.‘Night of the Living Lolis’ is in some respects what you make of it, which is fitting given that one deeper theme brought up in the show is about the extent to which one can construct their own reality, and to what extent this functions as a tool for overcoming adversity. It’s a theme that’s there, but the onus is on the viewer to engage with that theme if they want to. No direct questions and answers about these things are thrust in the audience’s face, but how you engage with the aforementioned ideas will be made clear from what you think of the characters that espouse respective opinions on those same ideas through their conduct.After a middle arc easily described as wading through treacle, the final arc of ‘GG’ regains focus and the plot starts to lunge forward to an exciting conclusion, quelling any fears that the setting had been forgotten about. How much of an impact this show will have on you will come down in part to how willing you are to forgive plot contrivances due to being invested in the characters, although in your judgement of such things you’ll often be less disappointed if you give the writers the benefit of the doubt. For what it’s worth, rape alarms are that loud, rusty metal is that weak, generators do make noise, and shovels are heavy.If ‘not judging a book by its cover’ has equivalents in anime, one could be ‘not judging a show by its genre’. And while it certainly wasn’t many of the animators, at least someone from Lerche genuinely tried to make this work. At a first glance, Gakkougurashi! looks like the result of moe creeping into ever more unfitting genres and settings, but thanks to the great writing it truly showed signs of life even when it should have by all rights been dead on its feet.', 'Out of most of the anime of summer 2015, the one that keeps popping up time to time is the one and only ""Gakkou Gurashi"". I don\'t usually watch anime that is currently airing and most of the time I would watch it in English Dub, the reason why is because I would like to see the animation instead of the subtitles (however, some anime series, I do watch in English Sub such as this particular one). However, one of my friends recommended me this anime ""without any research"" (which I usually do) and after watching the first episode, I was completely glued to the...series.Now 12 episodes later I can now officially do a review of this particular series, the series that everyone was pretty much talking about. So I\'ll mention my personal opinions about it, what the company ""Lerche"" did great on and also mention what they need to work on, without further ado, let\'s review ""Gakkou Gurashi"".Story:The series talks about a club called ""The School Living Club"", a group of four girls and their young dog living in the school, however there\'s a reason why they are living in the school, which is explained in the anime (I\'ll give hints but no major spoilers ;))I have to admit that I was one of those people that liked the storyline ever since the first episode, there were some great things but at the same time there\'s flaws. So I\'ll mention them here.Pros:• Mainly focuses on the main characters, you get to know more about their backstory, how the club was developed and how the characters get along.• Each episode had a cliffhanger and makes the viewers want to know more about what will happen next in the series.• From the beginning to the end, it made you question about what will happen to the characters and so on until you watch the end and find out that most of the questions have been answered.Cons:• The Moe / comedy and dark themes do NOT mix. This is the one of those problems that people had when they were watching the series. It makes the viewers think if they\'re supposed to consider the series as a serious one or a comedy especially due to the situation.• There is a lot of filler moments in this series, moments that were very unnecessary, such as the comedy moments. They\'re supposed to deal with a serious situation, not moments where they\'re supposed to have fun and forget about what\'s happening around them, which happens often in the series.• Not going to say everything wasn\'t predictable, but there\'s certain things that were predictable, one of them being the school environment later on in the series. They did an excellent job making things unpredictable in the first episode but as the series goes on, you realize certain things that have been pointed out in the series.Art:Pros:• The series is unique and has its own art style.• The characters were well designed, the expressions for each of the characters shows the emotions for any situation and the creators developed great outfits for each character making them unique in certain ways.• The environments were done well as each environment expresses a certain mood, depending on the situation, if it\'s happy and cheerful, they make it like nothing happened, if its dark, they make it dark and gloomy.• If you compare the art between the manga and the anime, it is quite similar so they did manage to get the same type of art style as the manga.Con:• Like the story, Moe and dark themes don\'t work too well together. It would have been better if they stuck to one of them instead of both.Sound:Pro:• Each OST was done well, it expresses the moods of the situation, if the situation is a Moe moment, they have cheerful music playing, if it\'s a sad moment, they make the music sound very sad and so on and so forth.• The ending themes were okay too but the one theme that I\'ve enjoyed the most out of this series was the Opening. If all you heard was the Opening without seeing the intro, you would imagine this as a cheerful and catchy opening theme, you would never expect it to be dark anime series. If you watch the intro from the first episode, it looks like another ""slice of life"" anime, but as the series goes on, the intro changes but the song stays the same, I know there may be other anime that did the same thing but this is an amazing idea that I don\'t often see which makes the Opening even more enjoyable to watch. I always get excited whenever the intro came on because I always wanted to know what they\'re going to change next and what they\'ll change it into. It\'s a very enjoyable intro to watch and a very catchy song to listen to.Cons:I seriously have no cons for this anime when it comes to sound as personally the music was fine the way it was.Characters:Pros:• Each character has her own unique personality which makes each of the characters stand out from one another. (Examples: Yuki being the energetic and positive one, Miki being the serious one, Yuuri being the leader type and Kurumi being the cheerful type and the one with the shovel).• The minor characters are mentioned time to time,  we get an understanding of what the minor characters were like, both appearance and personality.Cons:• Like the soundtrack, I can\'t really complain about the characters.Enjoyment:Personally, I thought the show was pretty entertaining, sure it had some slow and mostly comedic moments but it had moments were it actually made you wonder about what will happen in the next episode. You hope for the best for each character as well as have concerns about the things around them. Characters and the soundtrack were awesome, the art is enjoyable to see however, the story should have been worked on a bit more.Overall, a very enjoyable series and I highly recommend people to watch Gakkou Gurashi. The series is only 12 episodes so you can completely watch it within a couple of days. It was enjoyable to watch and a possibly a great anime to watch over again.Overall: 8 / 10 series.Now 12 episodes later I can now officially do a review of this particular series, the series that everyone was pretty much talking about.

Then, there are some others that just goes there to get an education and nothing more. What about Takeya Yuki, a petite girl who just happens to be in love with school? If you think about it, there’s nothing really wrong with liking school. What’s wrong about this show is that the school Yuki is attending isn’t exactly what it seems. Welcome to Gakkou Gurashi (School-Live!), a show that comes with a bizarre twist. And by all means, it’s not exactly what it looks like…Or maybe it does at first. The animated series adapted by Lerche comes...from the manga of the same name. The series takes place in a school life setting where everything seems really normal at first. Or perhaps too normal. The first 20 or so minutes of the pilot episode establishes a school life style where Yuki is enjoying every minute of it. And really, why shouldn’t she be? She is with her friends, having fun, making memories, and just being a kid. Anyone who have trouble investing time into the typical slice of life with ‘cute girls doing cute things’ factor will likely feel annoyed. That is…until the ending. The twist comes with a zombie apocalypse. In essence, Gakkou Gurashi fuses together a bunch of oddball genres that includes school, slice of life, supernatural, and a bit of survival horror. Don’t take this the wrong way though. The show still retains its cuteness but explores a dark side of it that’s nothing like what your school may be.The storytelling of the show is structured in somewhat of a controversial way. As a manga reader, I will say that it is entertaining but still sways from faithfulness. The first episode makes changes while also introducing certain characters far too early than they should be. The overall tone of the story flows somewhat well in terms of content despite pacing issues. It shouldn’t be hard for anyone to figure out that something may be wrong through careful analysis. The background foreshadowing such as the bizarre words on the school’s chalkboard or gravestones should make the viewers scratch their head. Also, isn’t it just strange that everything seems a bit too simple at their school?A main part of the show also consists of the character cast. Yuki is the most prominent character in the series not because of her personality but because of some of her delusions. The show establishes an eerie message that perhaps she is hallucinating or building a delusional barrier around herself. The reality is that there are zombies are school, the classrooms are in shambles with windows shattered, hallways are barricaded, and death is a quite real. Yuki’s personality is also quite cheerful and sometimes is distracting for the audience. Similarly, some of her friends also plays along with her despite knowing the truth. They include Kurumi, Yuri, and Miki and all of them shows various skills when needed for survival. Their personalities ranges although all of them gets along quite well as friends. Kurumi is more of the fighter for the group with her handy shovel while Yuri plays more of a supportive role (the older sister type). Miki also adds support to help the other girls and even plays alongside Yuki as “Mii-kun”. As cute and colorful as this group is, the audience is still often reminded of what’s at stake. By the time the first episode ends, I think any anime original viewers will find it surprising in some ways by the false advertising and bait.On most terms of the show, it blends in a form of dark comedy. Sure on the surface, everything seems cherry but the reality is not so cute. The comedy on most part is what you will typically see from series about “cute girls doing cute things”. In essence, the show actually masks its true visage somewhat well with its humor if a viewer is unaware of the premise or coming into the show completely fresh. Meanwhile, Gakkou Gurashi exploits its darker elements with Yuki’s state of mind. Other characters also gets some of their background story told including Yuki’s friend “Mii-kun” and her teacher, Megumi. The show establishes fairly well that Yuki is overly fond of them. As such, it creates the false barrier about her state of mind. Throughout the show, it’s almost like Yuki is in a world of her own. Yuki continuously shows how much she loves school while the audience knows it’s more than just that. And by this execution, I guess it can be a hit or miss. Some people will find the series overly repetitive after a few episodes. Others may think that the comedy doesn’t mix well with the overlay of the story. Despite this, Gakkou Gurashi succeeds in keeping a thrilling story by adapting with the characters. The style of the show is obviously more than just a slice of life so it often crafts plot twists to make the audience anticipate for more.When it comes to artwork, there should be no surprise that the girls are designed to look cute. They all wear their regular school uniform with some variations. For instance, we have Yuki’s cat-like hat or Kurumi’s arm-warmers. Overly cute may sometimes become evident throughout the show especially with character expressions. In reality, the setting of the school is designed to look like it was the aftermath of an apocalypse. It conveys the message to the audience that nothing is normal. The zombies are designed to look horrific with their mindless rampage. Fan service also exists with swimsuits although most of it downplayed. Instead, it’s replace with violence with vague censorship. It’s also noticeable that the body language of the characters shows the audience of their conflicting feelings. Finally, I have to say that the show has a clever way of decorating its OP and ED theme songs along with its symbolisms.I can’t say the soundtrack is overly impressive but neither is it lacking. Somewhere in between, I think the soundtrack works especially to deliver that eerie feeling when it’s needed. Other times, its recycled usage of the lighthearted harmony is hardly memorable. Perhaps the most distinctive thing related to sound is the voices of the characters. Yuki is portrayed with a very energetic voice who is often on the lookout for fun at school. She genuinely loves school so her presence along with her voice brings in a cheery atmosphere. That is…there are moments when her breaks down in an almost mental-like state. For that, I’d say that her character is adapted well in terms of voice mannerism. Others in the show includes Kurumi’s tomboyish voice and Yuuri’s mature personality with a matching voice tone that is acceptable.To be honest, I’m not a big fan of school. For someone like Yuki, that’s an understatement. And for a show like Gakkou Gurashi, it’s about much more than the girls having fun and getting an education. Ever heard of the phrase, “when it’s too good to be true, it probably isn’t?” That’s what the show feels like. As such, don’t expect Gakkou Gurashi to be the typical slice of life with cute girls having their happy endings every episode. This is not a happy show. If you take a look at the physical attributes of their real school and environment, then it’s easy to see why. If you thought that Gakkou Gurashi is like colored rainbows with smiles and laughs, think again. from the manga of the same name.

Many people praised it for being unique, dark, and a fresh new take on the zombie genre. It has moe girls and zombies. 2 things to bait the anime community in. So how does this ""masterpiece"" hold up?Story: 4/10The story in this is so average. The story changes in tone shift from being a cute, moeshit, slice of life show from a dark and depressing Madoka Magica take. However, it does it horribly. There\'s no weight to either of these sides to the anime and it just...makes the anime seem lazy and lacking. Also how some episodes would just focus on moeshit rather than the actual story we all came it to see. It acts like it doesn\'t care at all. However, something I can say about the story is how it takes some risks. I was surprised by how this show deals with some tragedy and the way it does it is quite impressive. Doesn\'t excuse the story from being lackluster and bi-polar.Art: 5/10Lerche was everywhere spewing out shows in the Summer season. Too bad all of them were fucking trash but at least they had some decent art. I like how the characters movements are so fluid in some scenes and how their movements would change with the tone. For example, Kurumi attempting to kill some zombies would have pace that\'s quicker rather than usual when she\'s just standing in the slice of life would. I also like how well the color pallet would stick well with the tones as well. Keeping it dark and creepy when it needs to. But sadly, that\'s basically it. The art does nothing to stick out but instead it just blends in with other anime. Also, most of the animation is SO STILTED. All the characters mostly do is just stand around talking. It seems like they even forgot they were in this terrible show. Not much to say, the art and animation are just average.Sound: 4/10The voice actresses showed some emotion in their performances here and there but nothing really seemed to stick out as well. They at least tried I\'ll give them that. A good thing about the sound however is the music box that would play here and there and would sound like it\'s dying right at the end when something bad happens. Yes, music boxes have been done to death in anime, but it was still a nice touch. As for everything else? MOESHIT TO THE MAX. Nothing in the soundtrack stands out at all. It\'s the same shit we\'ve heard over and over and over again in other slice of life, cute girls doing cute things anime. Average.Character: 3/10Holy shit, where do I begin? These characters are so 2-dimensional. None of them have a personality nor do any of them develop.Yuki is just the same old ditzy girl we see in all anime before who acts like everything around her is fine. She has a personality but it\'s annoying and she does not develop.Kurumi is the tomboy who had to kill the love of her life (THAT IS NEVER BROUGHT UP AGAIN) who has no personality. She is a blank slate.Yuuri, the worst character, also has no personality. She\'s just there to make food and keep the club under protection. Another blank slate that doesn\'t develop. The anime tries and make her seem different and attempt to ""develop"" her by attempting to kill Kurumi when Kurumi is turning into a zombie. It was handled horribly since Kurumi and Yuuri barely shared a bond together so how are we supposed to care? I sure as hell know I didn\'t.Miki is an overprotective character who tried and seems like she cares for the club. Another blank slate who kinda develops but is done also horribly.Everyone else is a waste of your time. The characters are the worst part of the entire show.Enjoyment: 5/10Although it was painful to watch sometimes, I still kind of enjoyed this anime. I was still intrigued on everything that was going on and was just begging that this anime would get better, but nope.Overall:Gakkou Gurashi is a dumb, moeshit, same old slice of life show we\'ve seen a million of times in other series. The only thing that this show does different is that it has zombies. It has 1-dimensional characters, average art, a weak story that doesn\'t know what it wants to be, and a soundtrack that makes you want to drill your ears. You want a good slice of life show? Go watch Aria the Animation. At least that one has good characters, better art and a story that\'s actually well written. Stay away from this anime. It\'s just another show that goes into the trash just like every other anime from the Summer 2015 season. Lerche has fucked up big time.4/10 makes the anime seem lazy and lacking.

It\'s just another show that goes into the trash just like every other anime from the Summer 2015 season. Lerche has fucked up big time.4/10', ""First things first.

The first thing that you can think after seeing its genres will be: ""Slice of Life + Horror? What\'s that troll?"", and it\'s here that you are wrong, my friend; Gurashi Gakkou is probably the second anime (Puella Magi Madoka Magica the first one) that manages to use 2 genres completely different so well. It could be called Slice of Horror. The new generation of anime has begun! ╰༼=ಠਊಠ=༽╯That is why i like this anime so much, unique genres and characters. Don\'t get fooled...by the first 20 minutes of the anime, You will see only a group of girls who live at school and look for a dog dispersed in the school with moe moments/reactions, In any case i definitely do not recommend dropping the anime before the real story starts (at the end of the first episode you\'ll understand what i am talking about).Go to watch the first episode because from now on there will be spoilers.-Story: 9/10The story of the anime is great. The first thing you notice is this ""School-living club"", and here comes the mindfuck. The main character is mentally unstable, does not see what she has in front of her eyes. The anime is set in a post-apocalyptic world, oh wait, most of the characters ""are"" in a post-apocalypric world, Our Yuki is in a world friendly with her, where all are her friends and the school is perfectly normal. Obviously nothing of what she sees is true, yes, the school is surrounded by zombies. Here starts the adventures of our protagonists in a cruel world, Where errors are not allowed, only courage. Obviously, there\'s some mystery here and there that makes the anime more interesting.-Art: 8/10Not a lot to say here. The art is great, it works very well with the atmosphere of the anime. It\'s moe when there\'s the Slice of Life and scary when the horror scenes arrive. The zombies have a unique art, seem to be more shadows than zombies sometimes, but don\'t worry, there is a reasonTho the animation is not really great, just normal. It has a lot of issues, and you can see the frames sometimes but it doesn\'t matter, because it fits perfectly with the anime\'s atmosphere. Don\'t expect something Ufotable-like animation, Lerche had 3 shows this season so you can imagine...-Sound: 10/10Absolutely perfect. The OST fits perfectly with the anime. Outstanding in the horror moment, it\'s not your usual sound that you hear. The OP sequence is genial, cheerful music with zombies in the background, you don\'t see it everyday (i think). The ED sequence is more quiet, it could have been better, i don\'t deny it. The OST...reminds me sometimes a film, really great the concept, what you are watching: an anime; what you are hearing: a soundtrack of a film. It does a great job again because it shows the state of mind of the protagonist. It makes you feel anxious, happy, etc...-Character: 10/10This group of girls is perfect. There\'s the leader ""Yuuri"" that thinks about cooking, giving orders And the remaining resources, she has some interesting clothes that she puts on the uniform. Then there\'s the courageous ""Kurumi"" that kills zombies and rescues her friends. There\'s the quiet ""Miki"" that loves reading post-apocalyptic stories (especially of Stephen King), why not? And lastly we have our cheerful Yuki that lives in her world. Then there\'s Taroumaru...Taroumaru is a dog who cheers up the girls, play with them and has a great development with Yuki and Kurumi. He is not a character that you will love for sure but i think i like him...Oh wait! how could i forget about Megu-nee! i-i mean, Sakura-sensei. She is the closest person to Yuki and a good teacher that gives advices to students. Megu-nee is a character that everyone love.-Enjoyment: 8/10Fun and cute moments followed by scary moments. Even if there are zombies, in a dead city, this show sometimes makes you forget there are all these scary things, because nothing is better than a good comedy. IMO, the comedy/moeblob doesn\'t have always a good tempism, but...Oh well, in poor words, you\'ll have fun watching this show.-Overall: 9/10If you like Slice of Life, go to watch it, if you like Zombies and mysterious circumstances go to watch it, if you like both, why are you reading this review? Run! You will not regret watching this show. Gakkou Gurashi is an anime that has a new whole concept of a post-apocalyptic world.This show makes you smile and scares you at the same time, unique setting, don\'t you find it unique?

Gakkou Gurashi is an anime that has a new whole concept of a post-apocalyptic world.This show makes you smile and scares you at the same time, unique setting, don\'t you find it unique? I do.I am definitely enjoying Gakkou Gurashi a lot. AOTS (summer 2015) IMO.I hope you found this review helpful 〜(^∇^〜）', 'The idea of having cute girls in dark settings is nothing new to the world of anime, but especially after the record-breaking commercial success of Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica way back in 2011, there has been a particularly big outbreak of new anime trying to ride the same wave and get a good bang for their buck. But the problem with that is that it generally only results in the final product feeling similar yet inferior in comparison to earlier works following the same idea, as was made evident in shows like Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru and Genei wo Kakeru Taiyou for example.Gakkou Gurashi...is to me the first anime which actually succeeds in doing this in the last few years. It manages to provide the exact same kind of contrast between moe and despair that tugs on your heartstrings and keeps you on your toes, yet it does it in a completely different setting and an incomparable storyline.Now if you have not yet watched this anime, I would highly recommend you to at least watch the very first episode to its end without reading any further or getting yourself spoiled. It is something that you should really experience first-hand for yourself.Case in point, Gakkou Gurashi is initially shown from the eyes of the energetic high-schooler Takeya Yuki as a very stereotypical slice of life moe comedy following her and her friends living inside their school. And yes I literally mean living in, as their School Living Club\'s activities consist of always staying inside the school with the intention of ""growing closer to the school\'s many departments, foster self-governance and independence, and set an example for all to follow"". Thus they sleep in the school, take classes in school and play in school. Pretty straightforward. However as is revealed at the end of the first episode, this is nothing but a huge deception. Because in reality, the world which Gakkou Gurashi takes place in has already fallen to a zombie apocalypse, all the students other than the members of the School Living Club are already dead, and Yuki is completely mentally unstable and thus incapable of seeing the truth of her newfound reality for what it is. What makes this so great is the presentation. They manage to build the whole situation up so cleanly, so smoothly and with such perfect precision that it eventually hits you like a hammer when the truth is finally revealed. And you can\'t say it came out of nowhere either; the clues are clearly spread out throughout the first episode if you\'re paying attention.As fascinating as this opening was though, the real question following it was whether the story was actually sustainable from that point onwards. After all, when you drop that kind of bombshell in the very first episode, you better have something to offer for the remaining 11 episodes of the anime. Does Gakkou Gurashi accomplish this then? Well... yes and no. The rest of the story doesn\'t really rely on shock value quite as much, but instead takes a slower approach. The girls continue to live out their lives inside the barricaded school as they do their best to keep up the act that everything is fine and dandy in Yuki\'s presence in order to not break her mentally, try to find information about the zombie apocalypse and why/how it occurred, as well as simply staying alive. Occasionally they\'ll venture outside the safe zone and into hostile territory, but they never stay there any longer than necessary and they try to avoid direct combat if possible due to the risk of infection. So there isn\'t much in the way of bloodthirsty zombie bashing carnage in this show, but honestly I\'m very thankful for that because I find that to be one of the most mindless concepts in fiction. Don\'t expect Gakkou Gurashi to play out like Highschool of the Dead, because it doesn\'t.In theory I think this is a good decision, but if there is one thing which Gakkou Gurashi fails at, it is a certain aspect of its execution. You see although the contrast between the slice of life segments inside the school and the darker elements are very cool to see, it sadly doesn\'t balance them properly. Simply put, there is *way* too much focus on the slice of life part of the equation. As much as I like that kind of content in general, in Gakkou Gurashi\'s case it feels more out of place than anything else more often than not. When you\'ve just gotten some dramatic plot twist at the end of an episode, it feels rather annoying when the entirety of the episode thereafter is spent doing nothing at all. I mean yes, of course it\'s important to show off how the girls are trying to keep their spirits up in the desperate situation which they find themselves in, but it does it too much. It doesn\'t just come across as fleshing out the characters, but also quite frankly as wasting time. Especially when you put in an entire episode showing off the girls in their bikinis by the pool on the school\'s roof and even take the extra time to have the camera zoom in on their tits one by one, then it no longer classifies as contrast; it\'s purely fanservice. At that point there\'s just no room for sugarcoating it anymore.Now personally I don\'t really mind that part too much per se, but it doesn\'t change the fact that it is taking up a huge amount of time which could have been spent on actually progressing the story instead. As a result, when you look at the anime as a whole... it doesn\'t really advance very much from start to finish. About half the story lies in the last three episodes alone, and although those were certainly top tier, it doesn\'t excuse all the random stuff that happens (more like not happens) in the middle of the season. I mean imagine if the latter parts had been the middle ones instead; they\'d have had room for like 4 or so more episodes before the end. Though of course you can always pick up the manga instead if you want more content, but that\'s a different matter altogether and not really a valid excuse.In the end, Gakkou Gurashi is a thrilling anime which is sadly dragged down quite a bit by a single flaw. It stands out from the crowd due to its original combination of setting and execution; it has occasionally stellar directing, nasty cliffhangers, and interesting characters, but at the same time it doesn\'t focus on its own strengths properly which leads the viewers to just want the show to ""get on with it already"" a lot of the time. Even so though, the pros still heavily outweigh the cons, and the good points are what the anime will primarily be remembered for. And really, any series which can manage to leave such a solid impression on you as a viewer is a noteworthy anime in my mind. is to me the first anime which actually succeeds in doing this in the last few years.

In addition to that with the story, it\'s sort of like School Live borrowed lots of the shock and suspense elements from High School of the Dead and dulled it down a few levels to make it easier to watch. I think it was done that way so everything is not all in your face at once. School live takes things one step at a time and that\'s...what helps build up suspense. Moving on to arts and Characters, nothing too unique stands out about the characters, they are sort of like your generic anime girls. The typical stupid hyper girl and with pink hair purposely made to be cute and ""a hit with the fans."" The one mature classmate whose  job is to look out for everyone. The tough girl with the tom-boyish personality but is really a big softie, etc. School live isn\'t too bad, like all anime it has its obviously faults, but I\'m sure if you love cute girls trying to solve mysteries, plot twists, and violence then you\'re going to love School Live! what helps build up suspense.

Seeing as that is the case, this review will basically be all spoilers, so read at your own risk.I\'m gonna admit, this was one of the more enjoyable shows for me this season. I rate heavily on personal enjoyment, so for the most part, this series was high up on my seasonal watch queue. No, I did not like the characters although I do understand that they were meant as a contrast of the world they were living in. No, I didn\'t like the sudden, out of the blue tone shifts that the show presented....No, I didn\'t think that this show was tapping into the full potential of what it could have done, but hey, it was enjoyable, so I kept coming back.Now let\'s go to episode 11, shall we? This was, by far, the best episode School-Live! had put out. It felt like the characters were truly desperate, they were genuinely terrified, and that all hope seemed lost. They were struggling with just about everything and on the brink of death throughout the entire episode. Not only that, but holy shit was the music in this episode good. I\'d say around the 9 minute mark when the portable radio was played and the soft, enchanting singing started drifting out as you see the character\'s struggling to stay alive was phenomenal. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was extremely excited to see what episode 12 (the grand finale) would bring us.And it completely let me down. It was bullshit. I\'m about to list all the things awful about this episode, so be prepared for a shitstorm of complaining.First, it\'s not possible that Taromaru remembered Yuki and saved her life. It\'s a zombie. Everything leading up to that point would have suggested that, while the zombies are relatively aware, they do not have control over their actions, they act to kill. Taromaru saving Yuki would blatantly state that the zombies can control themselves and enact self-restraint, of which none do, let alone a dog which has about 1% of the mental capacity humans do.And then all it fucking took for the whole problem to solve itself was to say ""School\'s out, go home""?! Are you fucking kidding me?! That\'s just bullshit and I refuse to accept that. It was almost comical it was so overly simple and stupid. That is in no way how a zombie apocalypse story should end. Not only is it just utterly off tone with how the entire series went, it\'s just illogical. I cannot stress to you enough how bad this ending was. I\'m a perverse person. I wanted them all to die and for the series to end. I would have easily given this show a 9 and called it the best of the season. Unfortunately, School-Live! decided that they just weren\'t going to do that and instead opt for a cop-out.How were they to know that there was another dog down there? If I were in that situation I would\'ve just assumed the dog heard a noise and went down there because, let\'s be honest, it\'s a dog. That\'s what dogs do. There is no reason for them to have assumed that, and yet they did, so whatever.And the graduation ceremony. Oh man, the graduation ceremony. Don\'t even get me started (it should be evident that I\'m about to get started, it\'s an expression, leave a ""Helpful"" on my review please). Basically, they just decided that instead of closure, they were gonna go the Angel Beats! route and try to just make you cry as their way of forcing people to like the show. It was disgusting watching high school seniors cry at every slightly inspirational thing people said. And it dragged on for so fucking long. A solid 10 minutes were spent just saying goodbye and whatever else they felt like crying about.And finally, the last main problem I have with episode 12 is the lack of closure. So many things left unexplained. How did the outbreak first happen? What was Megu-nee\'s connection with it? Why did the girls in the school not just construct a ton of weapons so they wouldn\'t have to rely on that damn shovel for everything? Did they ever get to a safe-house? How do the zombies not starve and rot away? Why has nobody made any attempt to establish long-distance contact? Is the infection localized or is it on a global scale? Where are all the zombies in that final scene where they\'re just cruising down the highway and there\'s no one to be seen? And where the fuck are they going?This show just made me so mad after how well it set itself up to just dissolve into a mess of emotional crap that I cannot give it a recommendation and the only reason I give it a 7 is because of episode 11.Thank you for reading, and as always, feel free to tell me what you thought.

For sure it’s for kids again"" they say...Well, this is Madoka Magica version 2.0, where Promotional Posters and OPs will mislead you.Anyway, here is the review what I’m thinking about. *MINOR to MAJOR SPOILERS aheadI also feel the same way, thinking that this anime is just going to talk about slice of life and moeness at a world where people are infected and gone, but I was wrong,...this is more likely a survival mission for four girls to escape the already ruined city which I assumed Tokyo since one of the news broadcast is “Tokyo News” and the fact that we know that this apocalypse happen because of biological weapon used by one of the upper class or an elite organisation in japan for testing, which also includes the school where the four girls studied that had infected most of the citizens in that state. Should had been 5 survivors but ultimately sacrifice herself to save the girls from getting infected, that was where I got depressed real hard. So much of the scene had made me depressed, that I was planning to drop it or not but with strong heart I decide to continue because I had read the manga, though I could partly disagree that some part are not adapted. It is well adapted from the manga and there are some parts that are a bit loosely taken from the manga, but overall they did adapt well, just that I don’t like that they don’t include the most important part of the scene in each manga to the anime, well I could mostly agree due to the timeslot given and also the budget that a company had. Well, it’s great that we could learn how survival and teamwork is all about. It’s great that I can play Left4Dead again after 2 years of hiatus. Mostly, this series focuses on survival in school, graduation, Taroumaru and Megu-nee, which is “all but not all scenes” adapted from the manga. Also I got moved by Yuki’s speech towards the zombies which they all ultimately listen to her and went back where they belong and they all graduate from high school. And I do believe that there would be a strong indication of season 2 as if you watch after the ending credits where a girl holds a drawing of Yuki’s 4 group, but it’s just assuming as the manga is still ongoing.Now let’s talk about the animation and the art of this particular anime. Most of the works are all done by Studio Lerche, (remember Carnival Phantasm?) Anyway, the character designs are quite appealing and decent, I love how the situation and the surrounding the city looks like depicting that this story takes place on a post-zombie apocalypse where most of the buildings would be destroyed and all other shits. Anyway, the motion of the zombie, I wonder if I could call it as CGI, is pretty okay, from far it’s more like they are 3D version of zombie but for close up view, they are more like a 2D view. But overall, not much of complaints on the saturations and the smoothness of the animations and art of this anime.Another thing that made us mislead is the OP song video, watch closely as you progress throughout the episode, it keeps on changing right? I wonder if this should be in the story comment or sound but anyway let’s just move on, the OP song is really catchy and more like I don’t know how to explain it but I assume they just want to mislead us that this is a moe anime. Well, I do enjoy listen the OP since the title is “Friend Shitai” meaning that it might do with friends or anything. Other than that, most of the seiyuus are well selected, especially on Takeya Yuki and Ebisuzawa Kurumi, for Ebisuzawa Kurumi I was expecting Taneda Risa to voice acting her but it was Ozawa Ari instead voice acting her, kinda disappointed but she did great on voice acting her with the tomboyish voice act, Takeya Yuki is voiced by Iori Minase whom she voiced Hestia, she is really good at voicing cute voice for a 1996 liners. Miki-kun and Rii-san voice actors are also well voiced, it’s enjoyable to listen to all the 4 main characters voicesLet’s talk about the characters, I will only focus on 2 characters, so let’s begin.  Takeya Yuki, a student of 3-A is an airhead and a good girl student whom she really loves Megu-nee so much, she doesn’t really care about the zombie apocalypse the fact that she create an illusion herself to not seeing her what happen to the past and the current situation in the anime. I do understand her feelings that she wanted a good, enjoyable, school and everyday life and the fact that everything is gone she doesn’t want that to happen so instead she decide to illustrate from the real scene herself where everything is normal, which I kinda feel bad for her. But she does show her courage and has a strong heart even if she start to break down because what’s past is past, we do have to look at the future and she did give the best and heart feeling speech to everyone. Ebisuzawa Kurumi, a strong girl with her shovel carrying her back, her mission is survival and to protect all the four girls from getting infected, she do make comedic scenes which I enjoy. She is also the first girl to get bitten by Megu-nee, but she held strong and managed to survive the infection by antidote which doesn’t work properly leaving her half-human/zombie. But I’m glad she survive before being fully infected, if not, I would most likely to drop the 12th episode.So did I enjoy watching it? Well, from my perspective I do enjoy watching it, and this is the first series I have watched with a horror tag, and the 200th anime to be completed since I started watching anime last year. I do feel depressed after watching this anime as some the key characters had died for example Megu-nee and Taroumaru.  Even if it’s depressing, I’ve learn some good lessons regarding this anime, team working and survival instincts. This shows that, if we don’t learn how to survive then bad consequences would occur, so team work is important, leaving a person alone to do the job would be risky and is best to have two than one to prevent all problems. Glad I enjoy watching Gakkou Gurashi.Well I would recommend anyone to watch Gakkou Gurashi, yes it has comedy and kawaii scene too and those who are scared of killing, slashing or any violents don\'t worry, they blurred it out. Also, those who had already watched the Hollywood movies or shows like World War Z, I am Legend, Shawn of the dead, 28 days later, Walking dead and the games like last of us or left4dead, I would recommend you guys to watch this even if it has moe, but the main point is about zombie survival. So I do hope you guys enjoy watching it.Even if this maybe long and complete nonsense review, I wrote really hard and think hard with some to rewrite this review before posting it fully to the site. I hope this review would be helpful, that doesn’t mean I want to be in the top, but anyway happy watching~Well, morals to everyone: ""Don\'t judge an anime by its cover"", you never know what would happen next. this is more likely a survival mission for four girls to escape the already ruined city which I assumed Tokyo since one of the news broadcast is “Tokyo News” and the fact that we know that this apocalypse happen because of biological weapon used by one of the upper class or an elite organisation in japan for testing, which also includes the school where the four girls studied that had infected most of the citizens in that state.

The synopsis here is vague for a reason. Go in with an open mind and no expectations, and I think the viewer will have a much better experience. -~-I first encountered Gakkou Gurashi about 6 months ago- when it was announced as a Summer series anime. Reading the description, I got absolutely nothing from it- but a little more digging led to the discovery that it was a cross between moe and post apocalytpic with some emphasis on psychological narrative. I was immediately interested- as I\'d never...seen such a combination before, and it sounded like it might be cool.Cue the first episode- They say you can\'t have plot twists in the first episode... they were wrong.The setup and lead on with how we were seeing things versus in actuality were very surprising- shocking even. It had some of the most amazing framing and dissonance between the mental state of Yuki and her projection of reality I\'d seen- and I was hooked. The subtle imagery as Yuki and Miki ran through the school, culminating with that classroom shot was incredible. I don\'t want to say too much here, because it\'s best to not know anything, but I really thought I finally had a worthy successor to the moe-horror that Higurashi had established itself queen of... but all was not well.By the 4th or 5th episode, it was plain that Yuki\'s mental state and her way of dealing with (or not dealing with) the newly ruined world was not the focus of the show, but instead turned into this wishy washy dark and suspenseful tale one moment and slice of life cute-girls-doing-cute-things the next. While this type of flip flopping set up a really good vehicle for really hitting the viewer with the hard moments due to how light and fluffy it had been, Gakkou Gurashi still wasn\'t above typical moe/school show pitfalls. I mean, I get that school is in the name- School Live! being the closest English translation, but the inclusion of a pure fanservice episode at a KEY moment in the show, at the absolute climax was a horrible decision.When everything is on the line, and major decisions and changes are about to happen- why not just throw in a swimsuit episode? Because what we needed in a unique show was SOMETHING ELSE to make it just like every other anime involving schoolgirls- some good ol T&A.I can\'t stress enough how badly this wrecked the very tense and suspenseful atmosphere they had painstakingly built up - a real tragedy in an anime that  could have been something better.-----In a lesser show, there would have been a lot of pointless side characters introduced- but Gakkou Gurashi stays strong with an unchanging cast of four. With the focus on their interactions, we really get a feel for how these characters are as people, and actually care for them- something not many anime manage to achieve. While Yuki\'s incessant naiveté is grating at times, at the point when I got sickest of it- the mood changes, and her illusionary existence comes crashing down, prompting a great shift in the show.In the apocalypse, I think few people realize how important your health is. Often in such shows, the main characters are taken to heroic feats and ridiculous Deus Ex Machina moments because, well... they\'re the main characters and ""they can\'t die, hah!"" In this however, the sense of vulnerability is always looming. The characters remark over the course of the show how they realize that they can\'t stay at their school forever, and that there seems to be an ever increasing threat outside their tiny haven, and this gently increasing tension comes to a head at about the same time the sickening moe garbage was making my head hurt. The sense that the characters were in real danger and may die was there- and I genuinely expected deaths, I just had no idea whom. It was a really rewarding watch in that aspect, because the characters didn\'t just pull magic out of the hat, or develop supernatural powers. Gakkou Gurashi definitely stays very grounded, and I appreciated that very much.The ending left a bit to be desired though. It was the kind of feel good ending that probably everyone saw coming, and with the buildup to it, I was expecting a bit more given the dark conclusion it was foreshadowing.Side Note:One thing I\'ve discussed about zombie media is the portrayal of how the apocalypse came to be, and whether it takes one of three routes that form the basis for the conflict:1.\tThat Science did this! Biological weapon/genetic mutation experiments, who cares? It’s all vaguely scientific and intellectual sounding, so that’ll fool the teen demographic.2.\tA Wild Virus Appeared! Some mutated microbe that’s unaffected by any drug affects all but some small number of populace who, by plot convenience, don’t contract the illness.3.\tWho cares! Zombies are here and we have to destroy/evade/hide from them to survive!Thankfully, Gakkou Gurashi took route 3, but definitely with some shades of route 2. The subject of a virus and a planned response by the government was touched on, but it was never the forefront issue brought up as to why. Again, it doesn\'t really matter why the zombies are there- and it didn\'t need a pseudo scientific explanation to prove to me, the watcher, that it was that thought out. That part of the setting doesn\'t matter- it\'s how the characters DEAL with it that does. For the most part- they dealt with it. But then again, that\'s the conflict, isn\'t it? How does one deal with it?Scoring:Artwork and Animation: 6Consistently good, but not anything special- definitely some excellent single frame shots with great small details and framingSound and Voice Acting: 7Cutesy intro, cutesy outro, cutesy insert music, and cutesy VA. What else is there to say?Characters: 7Since we had a full season to get to know and examine the characters, they feel genuine and the audience is actually given enough fodder to decide whether they care about/like the characters.Story: 6Post Apocalyptia X moe, little bit of drama, some suspense, and enough Slice of Life to fill everyone\'s need for the mundane.Enjoyment: 6With the inclusion of a completely wasted fanservice episode and a few ""you idiot"" moments, that knocked it down a point. Strong beginning and a decent made up for it though.Overall: 6Recommend?If a departure from the typical moe blob show into a bit darker territory is something you might be interested in, why not? seen such a combination before, and it sounded like it might be cool.Cue the first episode- They say you can\'t have plot twists in the first episode... they were wrong.The setup and lead on with how we were seeing things versus in actuality were very surprising- shocking even.

(School-Live!) is not your average Slice of Life style anime. Following the life of Yuki Takeya, it seems that this would appear to be your average anime of a cheerful girl who enjoys school. However, this is but an illusion. In reality, society and humanity has fallen due to a zombie apocalypse. Four girls have banded together in their school to survive this ongoing nightmare, while trying to maintain their daily lives of being students. As the story progresses, each episode will mess with your thoughts and emotions gradually until the very end where it destroys you. The art is graphic in some scenes,...but overall very well made, as is the soundtrack. Each character is given their own ideals and ambitions, while at the same time keeping the similar to one another. Yuki is the playful, cheery girl. Miki is the quiet, stoic type. Yuuri (Rii) is the big sister and caretaker of the group. Kurumi is brave and adventurous, being the group's defender (thank you, Shovel Knight). After each episode, you'll be left with wanting more and more, trembling at the thought of what might happen next. Overall, Gakkougurashi! is a great (9/10) anime that deserves high recognition in being unique while not differentiating too much. but overall very well made, as is the soundtrack.

The main characters given to us are as flat as Paper Mario, and show no sign of difference to them, while being compared to the MOE narrative form of “cute girls, doing cute things” for some explicit reason. These characters are also a part of School Club called “the School Living Club.” (Let that sink in for a minute or so.) However,...as you continue watching, small hints of oddity can be gathered by the chilling sound effects and the dark iconography hidden in the show, which in turn, becomes the show’s staple force. To top it off, at the end of the first episode…when you least expect it, BOOM! The story reveals to you that this is not your ordinary MOE show, but a show of the dead, featuring, FOUR GIRLS, A DOG, AND 1 ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE! Did I forget to mention that one of the main characters is shown to be a crazy nut job who thinks everything is fine and dandy…if not…well you KNOW NOW! However, after completing the series, there are a few questions that may leave you in a questionable state including?Why was the building so well-prepared for the outbreak?Are there any drawbacks from the medicine used for Kurumi’s wound/who created it?During the club outing segment, after saving Miki, why didn’t they just leave?Why weren’t the Zombies formidable antagonists for the girls in the story?Why would they bring Yuki, if she was undergoing this emotional trauma?Why didn’t we get to know any information about Yuuri’s intake/past events with the Zombie Apocalypse?Well, I believe it’s time to jump into what I find to be the pros and cons of the ANIME adaptation of Gakkou Gurashi!Story-line:After revealing the true nature of the Anime’s plot after episode one, I wanted the story to focus on the character’s attempts to fight through the consequences or problems the story would inflict upon them while having the desire to escape because of the Zombie Apocalypse. For the most part, the story was able to balance the MOE traits with the horror aspects well, but there were some slight problems in the Anime where the peaceful, and light-hearted tones conflicted with the story’s horror side. A few examples would include:Example 1: Episode 2 - Where Kurumi is conflicted about something, and Yuki breaks the tension with the Test of Courage idea.Example 2: Episode 9 - Where they lose sight on the emergency manual situation to have some pool time.However, the instances where the combination was executed brilliantly would include:Example 1: When they were investigating the broadcasting room area in episode 8.Example 2: Now this is kinda a combination, but at the end of episode one with the camera angles on Yuki as we are revealed that the world is not what it seems to be – Episode 1In light of the events leading up to the climax of the series, I found it to be entertaining, but odd to some degree. The sequence of events are in no particular order, but seem to follow your standard narrative structure quite well. We are given an exposition that informs us about the situation the ladies are in, and then we’re given a few episodes which give hints of foreshadowing to various deaths, and some perspectives from at least two of the girls, being that of the bookworm Naoki Miki and our action girl Kurumi Ebisuzawa. The light-hearted moments with the girls having fun on the activities were adorable/enjoyable to watch, but sometimes it felt like they were dragged on to the point where I just wanted to see the gruesome, and darker elements which stem from its psychological portion! HECK, it’s labeled as a SEINEN Manga series for a reason now!However, the rise in suspense in episodes 10-11 were done well since they were able to capture the horror from the girl’s situation internally, and externally with the visuals, soundtrack, and the character’s facial expressions! Others and I may agree that the resolution of the show could have been a bit better, whether it be, one of the girls dying alongside Taroumaru, or that all of them could have died period. But, it makes sense by the logic given to us within the show, stating how the Zombies remember their previous lives/roles in society. Also, the fan service…and I will say no more on that note. Overall, the storyline had its cons and certainly had its pros, but it could have been better if the story focused heavily on the darker plot lines, while incorporating some interesting material from the Manga…*COUGH* Miki’s refusal to believe in Yuki’s dilemma! *COUGH* *HELICOPTER ARC*Characters:If I had to choose what character to talk about first, I’d choose Yuki Takeya. Yuki is the most energetic, airheaded, and surprisingly the oldest girl from the batch. To some, she could be viewed as bait for their zombie fishing rod because of the way she is presented in the show, but since she views the world to be equivalent to that of a bowl of Lucky Charms, instead of a walk on Elm Street, it transforms her from being the typical stock character to that of a more dynamic individual as the story progresses. Examples of this progress can be seen during:Example 1:  Use the carefree Yuki bits from episodes one and two here to explain her beginning! (Put In Small Box)Example 2: Then use the bits in episode 5/6/7/10/11/12 where Yuki is shown to have some type of change throughout each episode in terms of her internal structure.She may be a stereotypical girl fit for the Moe genre, and her joyful prescience in the Anime may have its good and bad instances during the important moments in an episode, but toward the second half of the show she starts to grasp the concept of reality as we draw near to the show’s resolution. A quick pro or con for this character would include, strong character development and how her personality keeps the others from going insane. Though, through some eyes she may be shallow/annoying during the critical moments of the show, and that she may not hold any defining characteristics to her character other than what’s given to her.Alright, for the next character we have Mrs. Shovel Knight, Kurumi Ebisuzawa. Kurumi is the most athletic, thick-headed, and active member of the club. To some people she could be classified as the “best girl” due to her tomboyish appearance. She’s also one of the only members, who actually fights off the Zombies in every situation, but one. In terms of characterization, Kurumi is very reliant and calm in desperate situations, but could be classified as an emotional character since she typically believes she can handle every situation on her own which later bites her in the arm…hehe. However, I found her backstory/flashback rather lackluster compared to another main character in the series. Her flashback included a love interest for a male character during her high-school track team days. Although it was able to bring out the action hero we know today, I felt that if the minor character was given more depth as the one I shall mention later on, then her flashback could have been a tad bit better. Overall, Kurumi is given great development after the fact, and thankfully, behind her shovel-like armor, she has emotional weaknesses to bring out the realistic quality to her character.If I asked you the question of, “Who do you think is Mecha’s Favorite character from the club,” and you answered Naoki Miki, then you will definitely be getting some goods in your stocking this year! Miki or Mii-kun as Yuki likes to call her, would have to be the most fragile, skeptical, and reserved member of the club. In terms of characterization, Miki can be looked as the foil or sidekick to Yuki’s character, since they both have differing viewpoints on the zombie infested world, which enhance the qualities of Yuki’s character largely. Miki’s flashback would have to be the best one throughout the entire run of the series, since we are able to understand her personal emotions rather than her being a yes woman. Being able to see who she was before the outbreak occurred, and having lost her friend Kei to the Zombie apocalypse. Plus, with the additive of the symbolic CD player of friendship, I was able to feel sympathetic toward her character more than the other club members. An example of this could be seen throughout episodes 4-5 during the Miki retrieval mini arc.{However, there’s a slight note I have to mention that most Manga fans would discuss as well and that’s after she is included. Miki isn’t shown to be as resilient as she was in the Manga, and in this case I would have loved to seen more personal conflicts between Yuuri and her rather than what was shown in the Anime. Was this scene that big of a deal,…not really? But it would have brought her character to life a tad bit more, but I’m pleased with the ending result that was portrayed in the Anime.}Now we reach the club’s final member, and that is Yuuri Wakasa aka OPPAI JUSTICE! Yuuri is the most mature, kind-hearted, and resourceful member of the group. She normally plays the big sister role of the club, but when all heck breaks lose, she loses her calm nature and begins to break down emotionally. As far as characterization goes, Yuuri really doesn’t have a backstory to go along with her character sadly, and some may consider her to be the worst of the group because of this. Yuuri does go through some emotional break downs near the ending of the story, but throughout the entire run of the series not much comes from her other than the stereotypical big sister traits seen in most Anime. However, she played her role quite well in the series, which didn’t bother me at all. Hopefully, a second season, if given, will be able to bring life to this character, than what was portrayed in this season.In terms of the minor characters including the clumsy, lovable teacher Sakura Megumi (Megu-nee), the animal mascot, Taroumaru, and Miki’s best friend, Kei, they all played key roles in supporting the characters and story, as it progressed. With the incorporation of Megumi’s character in the story, the series was able balance the peaceful and gloomy scenarios well. Also, Yuki’s character was driven by the fact that she didn’t want to remember the character’s death, and without it, I believe she would just be a female with no inner emotions. Her impact on the rest of the cast including Miki was strong, since she was an integral piece to their puzzle of compassion. Though, the only down side to Megu-nee’s character was the way her death was structured. If you’re the type of person who likes a death that is straightforward than you may have complications with this specific characterWith regards to the other two characters they share similar traits to that of one dimensional characters since they seem to be placed in the story, to satisfy the viewer or to enlighten a character trait for a member of our main cast. Spoiler, they both die, but Taroumaru’s death was better in my eyes.Sound-Track:The soundtrack for the series was standard, but memorable to my ears. The opening theme titled, “Friend Shitai” by Gakuen Seikatsubu is amazing and honestly catchy. It’s a great refresher and kick-starter for Gakkou Gurashi, even though the soundtrack doesn’t match the story’s premise in any way. Another highlight for this opening would be how the voice actresses who play the characters in the JP dub are actually the one’s singing the song.Speaking of the actresses, I found the JP voice acting to fit well with the characters. During the intense and joyous moments of the show, the voice acting seemed to be on point from what I recall from the program. Although when comparing the voice acting to other shows, it could be standard at most. However, I was able to obtain the general feel for each character, and I can’t really complain there.In regards to the three ending themes for this series, they fit perfectly, but are not really special or mind-blowing. Although, they grasp the sadness and happiness of the series, they don’t seem to memorable, unless, your like myself who downloads the song and consistently listens to it during the random times of the hour. However, if I did have to choose the best track out of the three, it would have to be “Afterglow” by Maon Kurosaki. While listening to the vocal cover and instruments play in the background you could feel the sadness obtained during the reveals in the show.On the other hand, there are some instances where the sound effects in the Anime are used during the most random moments. One to note would be in episode four when Miki suddenly notices Taroumaru fled the room, there’s an instance where a wind sound could be heard. Now it’s quite miniscule I know, but it seemed rather odd to me at the time. However, the OST for the critical and light-hearted moments fit well for the series.Example: Episode 6: When Miki asks Yuki, who’s Megu-nee?Animation:In terms of the art quality in Gakkou Gurashi, there wasn’t really much that bothered me, besides two things, and that would be the misplacement of certain facial features and the lovely use of computer animation or as the cool kids say CGI.What I mean by the misplacement of character features would include scenarios where the children are given no eyes, or are losing parts of their appearance. This can be shown during Yuki’s delusional moments. I understand it’s a part of the child-like art form, but in most instances some of the background characters are given features that show them as dolls or figurines. Now the only time I found this to fit well would be during the comical and embarrassing moments for the characters, but that’s about it.Example: The character bubbles seen during the child-like moments of the show and during the instances when they tell each other off, in a humorous manner.In terms of the use of CGI, the only complaint I have with it would have to be the zombies and sometimes the background character designs. The cars, buildings, scenery, etc. didn’t seem to bother me in any fashion, since they never change to the traditional animation style. Some series like Rwby, I feel, use computer animation well because their series started as CGI and remained CGI. However, with the zombies and people they often change from the computer animation and traditional animation style frequently, and I felt that it should’ve stayed true to one animation style.On the other hand, I didn’t seem to find any problems with the background elements of the series, or the artwork on the character’s appearances since they clashed well when the series decided to flip the mood, occasionally. Heck, even the dark color pallets on the zombies and the red bubbles that surrounded Kurumi and the other characters during their quarrel with the dead made me shiver in excitement. The animation was standard, but interesting in the slightest. The camera angles used in some of the scenes really hit home during the emotional and climatic moments of the show. A few examples would include:Example 1: The zoom in features on the faces of Yuuri/Yuki/Miki during their encounter with the zombies. – Episodes 5/6/10/11Example 2: The glass as it is falling down from the building because of the zombies gaining access into the school building. – Episode 10Don’t even get me started with the awesome foreshadowing elements they placed into the opening sequence of the series, because I believe I would like to take a deeper look into that predicament, in the near future of my YouTube Channel. (Why did you have to steal my thunder, Mother’s Basement!)Although I would have loved for there to be more fluid animation in the action scenes rather than some elongated still frames, I still felt the series had pretty decent animation, nonetheless.Enjoyment:Personally, while watching this series I was rather stoked to find out what would happen next, and re-watching the previous episode to find out the hidden artifacts of the real world was fun in itself. Does the series have its flaws? Absolutely. Would I recommend people who are new to Anime to watch it? Certainly. If I had the power to change anything from this series, what would I change? Honestly, the only way to fix the issues for this series would be, by stretching the series to at least 18 to 21 episodes to fit the source material in perfectly. Keeping true to one type of animation style rather than mixing both of them together, and maybe giving some of the characters a little more depth to make them connect with the audience more.Nevertheless, the series was able to provide the entertainment I was looking for in a show at the time, and I would definitely give it a re-watch sometime in the near future. as you continue watching, small hints of oddity can be gathered by the chilling sound effects and the dark iconography hidden in the show, which in turn, becomes the show’s staple force. To top it off, at the end of the first episode…when you least expect it, BOOM! The story reveals to you that this is not your ordinary MOE show, but a show of the dead, featuring, FOUR GIRLS, A DOG, AND 1 ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE! Did I forget to mention that one of the main characters is shown to be a crazy nut job who thinks everything is fine and dandy…if not…well you KNOW NOW! However, after completing the series, there are a few questions that may leave you in a questionable state including?Why was the building so well-prepared for the outbreak?Are there any drawbacks from the medicine used for Kurumi’s wound/who created it?During the club outing segment, after saving Miki, why didn’t they just leave?Why weren’t the Zombies formidable antagonists for the girls in the story?Why would they bring Yuki, if she was undergoing this emotional trauma?Why didn’t we get to know any information about Yuuri’s intake/past events with the Zombie Apocalypse?Well, I believe it’s time to jump into what I find to be the pros and cons of the ANIME adaptation of Gakkou Gurashi!Story-line:After revealing the true nature of the Anime’s plot after episode one, I wanted the story to focus on the character’s attempts to fight through the consequences or problems the story would inflict upon them while having the desire to escape because of the Zombie Apocalypse. For the most part, the story was able to balance the MOE traits with the horror aspects well, but there were some slight problems in the Anime where the peaceful, and light-hearted tones conflicted with the story’s horror side.

The two aspects being zombies and moe.However, in just the first episode, it shows how hard it is to coalesce moe and zombies together. Heavy symbolism and foreshadowing come into play to show just that. The star character, Takeya Yuki, cracks jokes and makes a fool. The other characters laugh at her as if they aren't in their current condition. In fact, the entirety of the cast doesn't show realistic reactions to their situations until late...into the series. This is not a plus because for a show that has characters facing psychological situations, what the viewer wants is to watch the characters in their realistic state of mind. Either that, or something that has a lot of action or horror, or similar subgenre.What I'm getting at is that Gakkougurashi is too flip-floppity with its storytelling. It lacks focus on what it wants to convey. There are scenes and complete episode setups that focus on the survivors' lives, playing and having fun, even though there's a constant struggle dealing with the zombie apocalypse they live in. Some of my favourite scenes with Yuuri talking with another character about the apocalypse were immediately followed by Yuki and her ridiculous moe, toning down the scene's serious mood.The art ε animation of the show is average of your typical moe anime. Sometimes the animation is lazily done with slide motions but that's not often. Other than that, there weren't many problems although I did see saw some slight computer animation (for the zombies) in the final episodes that were aesthetically odd.Personally, I thought the background music was exceptionally done and very fitting to the atmosphere. Sound effects weren't anything special but the voice acting was paired well with their respective characters, especially Yuuri and Miki. As for the ending songs, they were nice and gentle, bringing out the atmosphere of the series; there's not much to say about the opening.The characters, at first, were nothing too amazing but were actually the opposite: empty shells that didn't quite have personalities. However, as the series progressed, so did the characters. Growing goals and battling with internal conflicts. Yuki too, began to bud intentions and objectives. This was a huge bonus for a show that began to lose my interest.After finishing, I viewed Gakkougurashi as a worthwhile watch that attached me to its characters and made me want to watch more. Although I said that zombies and moe don't mix well, the first episode was full of necessary cliché moe scenes, successfully setting up the show with the reveal at the end. In fact, I almost cried at the end (poor Taroumaru!).To wrap up, the main problems I had with Gakkougurashi were its rather inappropriate usage of moe and unrealistic characters. Other than that, the show was mostly enjoyable up to its end.Final Score:6.5/10 into the series.

It was underlyingly twisted, which made this anime quite enjoyable, for the most part.Story: 7.5-ishWell the concept of the anime was pretty basic, however, it sure as hell did not start off that way. I was trolled really bad. But breaking it down, when you do get past episode 1, it's pretty much a zombie apocalypse and a bunch of girls trying to survive. What...makes this anime really interesting though, is the individual stories following the characters. It messed with you a bit, with all the plot twists. This was all really well done. They showed us how each character dealt with the whole situation  in their own way, which is defs a plus.BUTUnless you really like slice of life, the 'slice of life parts in between really distracted from the good creepy stuff about handling the zombies. This, and the comedy element of the anime. It was alright at times, however I don't think I ever really remember laughing out loud. It lightened up the anime for sure, but when the anime was really good, it was when they focused more on the disaster that these girls are constantly living in DANGER. Like, for a bunch of school girls who are really young, they act pretty calm (despite some being psychologically disturbed, I guess). But what about their family? Never touched that subject.Art: 7Not too shabby. What I really wished though, was to actually see some more gory elements of the zombies. They would seriously be so much scarier if they actually showed their faces at least once.Sound: 7-ishThe soundtrack itself I would give a 6. It wasn't memorable at all. The OP was really good. Had me trolled from the beginning.Character 7.5I liked all the characters in the anime, just the main, I had to warm up to her. At times she really got on my nerves. I didn't understand her happy-go-lucky personality and found it occasionally annoying, as it kind of just distracted from the really interesting bits. I get that she is just meant to be kawaii and silly to block out her fears and pain, but still, having to watch at least 10 episodes of it, I couldn't bear it very well. I just wanted her to FACE REALITY, and it was so frustrating when she couldn't.BUT.when she did, she was so much better. Her character development was a slow one, but by the end of the season, I did understand her situation. I did not hate her, despite her overly happy nature, but by the end of the anime, I still cared about her as the other characters always had. The other girls, I liked them all for different reasons. Their personality types were pretty standard, however all the decisions they had to make always left me on edge.Overall: 7If this anime had just cut the crap and focused solely on the psychological effects and of the apocalypse, they would have a much stronger story, However, it wouldn't really be the same. The slice of life put into this anime, juxtaposed with the deadly zombie apocalypse created quite disturbing concept. Overall, I did enjoy this anime and the ending opens up so many doors for new characters and uncovered secrets that still haven't been answered. The world is much larger than just the school.I would be excited for a second season, but if they didn't, I don't think I would be that upset either. makes this anime really interesting though, is the individual stories following the characters.

Sometimes the light grows weaker or stronger. What makes it change is the will of mankind, the will to believe that it is not over or that are things in this world worth struggling for everyday.If i were to compare our tale to a scenery I would say, an ocean of tears moved by a gust of happiness and laughter and lighted by the rays of hope that come and go as the day-night cycle goes on.Our protagonists are trying to resume their normal lives which they had...before the disaster had stricken. Each of them with different personalities support themselves on these hard times.Artwork is pretty standard. Nothing out of the ordinary with the slim and edgy characters being a bit of an eyesore, but that's just my taste. Same is to be said about the Soundworks, nothing stings the eye or enchants it.Characters are all different in most ways but they are all supportive, talkative. There is a noteable lack of an antagonist on this series, the only concern about their actions being their own feelings.Overall the combination of comedy,drama and tragedy make this a well made story, easily enjoyable and somewhat pleasant. I recommend it especially for people that have only started watching anime. before the disaster had stricken.

The manga it was adapted from juggled harrowing tension along with moe slice of life moments pretty well and the anime started out quite strongly. However, as the series dragged on it also began to fall apart, both as an adaptation of the manga and in terms of plot structure.I will first highlight how the anime compares with the manga as an adaptation before moving onto reviewing it as its own entity.The series had a very strong bait-and-switch episode 1, it lures you into...a sense of security before pulling back and revealing its dark nature all too well and I highly recommend watching the first episode- and maybe episode 3- if you have even the slightest interest in the series before reading the manga instead. The manga provides better characterization and pacing especially if compared with the anime whose pacing slowed to a complete crawl by episode 5 before suddenly accelerating at around episode 10.Character development for Miki and Yuuri has suffered considerably. Key moments to their arcs such as Miki warming up to Yuki and Yuuri's descent into madness aren't portrayed at all in the anime, unless if you consider Yuuri very briefly loosing it in episode 11 but even then she still picked herself up by episode 12 without any repercussions.This dog is given more screentime than it should have gotten and is arguably a bigger focus to the anime than some of the girls. The focus on Taroumaru is one change from the manga I'd rather the creators not have taken. Especially in the later episodes, the focus is shifted to Taroumaru's end of the spectrum, with the girls seemingly caring more for the stupid dog rather than themselves and their friends. At one point, an episode's plot hinges on Taroumaru's importance so much that the gravity of the girls' plight is weakened as a result.While its all too easy to blame the anime's fault entirely on Taroumaru, the fact is, even when judged on its own merit, the anime still falls flat on several occasions. Even with the focus on Taroumaru, the anime still had plenty of episodes to provide the girls with more characterization and to further contextualize theie situation. Instead, most of the episodes in the middle of the series, beginning with episode 4, focused more on the Slice of Life elements rather than the Survival elements.In the first few episodes, the Slice of Life moments were there to highlight the danger the girls are in, subverting standard cliches by juxtaposing them with the very real danger the girls face on a normal basis. However later episodes almost always completely focus on the Slice of Life elements, making the show less a twisted Survival Horror with Slice of Life elements to a Slice of Life show guest starring some zombies.And don't get me started on the gratuitous fanservice for this. Episode 4 and 5 had several disturbing shots of Miki in her lingerie, some low angle shots, and this really damaged any credibility to the emotional scene the show was trying to convey. Later episodes aren't much better, with shower scenes and beach episodes being the tip of the iceberg. Hell, there's a 20 second scene where the girls have a conversation with the camera focusing on their breasts the whole time. Classy.Not to say the anime is completely flawed though. There are a few good moments spread here and there. Episode 3 is a good example of what the show does best, creating a no-nonsense horror atmosphere is one of the show's biggest strengths and it serves to highlight how much of an improvement the anime would have been under better direction.As it stands, Gakkou Gurashi the anime is a poor adaptation and a weak anime on its own right. Reading the manga just reminds the viewer of how much of a wasted potential the anime is.4/10 Disappointing. a sense of security before pulling back and revealing its dark nature all too well and I highly recommend watching the first episode- and maybe episode 3- if you have even the slightest interest in the series before reading the manga instead.

You see this kind of thing happen with every anime Gen Urobuchi had part in despite his visual novels being of far better quality in all aspects.Gonna admit the first episode had a twist so outrageous it made me yell at the monitor but everything from that point just suffers from these HORRIBLE tonal shifts that make the series seem divided between 2 things, it fails so bad when it does this it\'s like having a meal solely of...cotton candy, jalapenos, and black coffee, its THAT bad.The cg zombies are just bad, i\'m lenient on cg but come on guys.Characters are ehh, something ambitious like a Nitro+ story needs more than 12 episodes to work, or the writing needs to be spot on, which it isn\'t here.I can\'t remember the music to save my life, probably because it couldn\'t keep up with the tonal shifts.The first episode is the only one you should see, but you should see it because it hits like a canon, but the follow up is the worst thing ive ever seen.

Out of them all though, School-Live! quickly became the most critically acclaimed, boosting sales of the manga by a massive 1000% following its animated premiere. This becomes even more impressive when you consider that director, Masaomi Ando, only has a couple other directorial credits to his name (Muv Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse/White Album 2). But does School-Live! live up to the hype? (No pun...intended, I swear.) That\'s of course up to you decide -- but I\'ll weigh in on it in just a few minutes.The anime, and a hefty portion of the manga, is mainly centered on the pink-haired, bubbly Yuki Takeya, who is so torn up by the event of a zombie outbreak that she has created a world in her head where literally nothing has changed. The first episode sets the stage for this anime absolutely perfectly, disguising the entire episode just how it would look from the perspective of Yuki. It isn\'t until the very last scene where we find out that everything we just watched was a gigantic hallucination and that the majority of the characters we saw were dead and...well, not gone. But you know what I mean. Everything from that point onward takes on a complete tonal shift. This is no longer the bright, joyous show we expected (Considering you went into blind, without any knowledge of what it really was). Instead, it\'s a psychological mess of how teenage girls handle being the last few people on what could be the entire planet. We don\'t really know yet.Each member of the School Living Club plays an important part in keeping the group a well-oiled machine. Take one of them away, and everything starts to fall apart. Yuki keeps the group motivated and hopeful. Yuuri is the wise, motherly figure that everyone looks up to. Miki brings reason and logic into the mixture. And Kurumi kills zombies with a shovel. (Needless to say, she is best-girl). The girls are dependent on each other for this entire series. I mean, how can you not when your friends are trying to kill you and eat you? That dependence, however, is great under these circumstances because the result winds up being packed with wonderful chemistry and sort of developmental paradox where each girl helps the next find something out about themselves. Not to mention, each one\'s style and attitude is so well-contrasted with the others that all viewers will be able to easily choose their favorite. There\'s none of that whole ""Otaku-Inner-Struggle (OIS for short, which is a disorder I just made up)"" where we have to fight between girls to decide on who the superior one is.The story starts off as just a tale of survival, but slowly builds up until more and more backstory in uncovered. The pacing, as far as this is concerned, is spot on. We get a ton of exposition and learn a little bit about each character before things start to get really weird. And I mean really weird. Not to mention, each doubt that viewers have -- each ""Well why is there still electricity?"" type question will not go unanswered. The story is well-written with those concerns in mind. I don\'t know if I\'ve ever watched something before where literally every single loophole is filled in. It\'s actually quite spectacular when you really think about it. There are so many skeptical notions you think up while watching this series, and all of them come to a satisfactory close just episodes later. In addition, the usage of suspense and subtle details hidden in the background will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire twenty-something minutes of each episode.This paragraph might get spoiler-heavy, so skip it if you haven\'t watched the series and still intend to do so. Up until the halfway-point of this series, when we find out that Megu-Nee has been dead this whole time (Which I totally called, by the way), the show is just pretty good at best. But when we find out that some of society knew this was coming, that\'s when this show gets great. It\'s not just school girls trying to survive and fend off zombies anymore. It\'s a thought provoking tale of how we might handle a situation like a zombie outbreak -- what we would do if we had reasonable suspicion that one might occur. And that raises thoughts like, ""Well, if we knew this might happen, why didn\'t we prevent it? What happened to everyone else? Why these four girls?"" Life or death situations in anime are great no matter what. But when those situations involve adolescents in a world where adults aren\'t even there for guidance, those are the times when that life or death stuff really shines. Seeing adolescents forced into growing up quicker just to conserve and fight for their own lives is significantly more impactful than having some huge, burly mech-fighter dude fighting another giant mech-warrior with his life on the line.In Summary:This is a damn good show. It\'s much better going into it like I did (Without any idea of what it\'s about) than going in with the knowledge that it will turn into a psychological thriller, but I guess that is now impossible considering you just read this review. Regardless, this easily snuck its way into my ""Top 10 Anime Series 2015"" just as I\'m sure it will for a lot of others. So to answer the question of ""Whether or not it lives up to the hype,"" the answer is yes. Yes it does.

I was not disappointed and it truly was a moe sol show---at the start. I noticed some out of place scenes but didn\'t pay much attention because I thought it was just an average studio making average mistakes.Then it happened.......=================THE REVIEW=================The studio has done a brilliant job in hooking its viewers with the 1st episode. The show\'s symbolism and subtle camera pans are done really well all throughout the series. I am usually someone who does not watch moe shows but the 1st episode really pulled me in. Sadly, the show suffers from poor pacing starting from Episode 3 instead of building up on the foundation that the 1st episode laid.The show switched to a 4-5 episode back story of an uninteresting character with an uninteresting past (except for Taroumaru!). Almost half of the show was used up for her.  The backstory of Megu-nee and Yuki, 2 pivotal characters, was also bare bones to give way to that flashback. It also felt like they overused the moe-sol segments for too many episodes. I think they could have used more episodes during their first few days so we could get invested in their relationships but they just used a ""tell do not show"" style which was kind of cheap.Fortunately, they got back on track during the last three episodes and it was a great roller coaster of emotions. Murphy\'s Law be damned!=================CHARACTERS=================The twin tail girl charmed me into watching this show and boy, was I not disappointed. Shovel girl--ahem--Kurumi is definitely best waifu material (did I do it right?). She is literally and figuratively, the group\'s guardian. She is a strong-willed dependable badass that supports the group from the frontlines. PTSD? Ha! Kurumi laughs and fights at the face of adversity!Yuki is the emotional support and Rii-san the stomach support (LOL). Really, all the characters are archetypes and it\'s pretty good how they leave and evolve as a character except for Rii-san who does not get any backstory at all. Well, at least she\'s good as a housewife.I\'m not even going to dig deep for Miki as I\'m still bitter about her abundant screentime. For taroumaru, that little ball of cuteness deserves pet of the year!=================VERDICT=================SPOILER!!!The show is a pretty good depiction of the anxiety and fears that teenagers feel as they take that first step into society. Replace the zombies with Adults trying to get the characters to conform to the norms; Megu-nee as that fond memory in your childhood that you cannot just let go; Taroumaru as a reminder of your innocent days;  the Apocalyptic zombie world as society full of uncertainties, disappointments, and despair; and the Graduation as a sign of that bold first step outside of your comfort zone and into a new world of unknowns.The first episode and the great attention in details makes me want to give this show a 10. Unfortunately, the flaws are glaring and it felt like it would be too unfair to give it my bias.so in the end I give it...7.4/10A show with great potential hampered by poor pacing, little character development with some characters, and too many moe-sol segments. =================THE REVIEW=================The studio has done a brilliant job in hooking its viewers with the 1st episode.

It is about a group of girls, trying to live off in the world affected by zombie Apocalypse.This Anime starts off as a Moe Anime, but gets dark in the First Episode itself. It isn\'t the zombies that make it dark.The only thing that sets it different from other Animes, is Yuki (Main Character) who refuses the accept the zombie Apocalypse and pretends everything is fine.She talks to her friends as if they are present, alive, and attending school just like she is. Unfortunately, they have all turned to...zombies.We see the reason for this peculiar behaviour explained in the last few episodes. The reason is sad and depressing. Although one might speculate it as a reaction to having lost her friends, there is something else to it.** Spoilers ahead : Don\'t read if you haven\'t watched the anime. 100% Recommended to watch **I haven\'t cried for so some time. After binge watching Your Lie in April, Clannad, followed by Violet Evergarden etc.., this Anime adds to the list.Characters:* Yuki : (Main Character) She has lost her friends, and someone really close to her. Megu-nee held her with love. She tries to keep her promise to Megu-nee of ""never losing the smile"", and thus ends up pretending everyone was alive and OK. Her loss drove her into insanity and thus she began to refuse the reality, and the moe nature originates.Though she might seem as a burden, It is important to remember, that we are trying to save humanity. If we were to ditch a non infected human, It won\'t make us different than the zombies.* Kurumi : She knows how to wield the sword (shovel in this case :p), and fight. She is only one who had thrown out her feelings and fear for the zombies and was able to kill them.* Yuri : She does practically nothing, but is the brains of the school-live! club.  Her uncanny resemblance to Megu-nee is gradually revealed though.(!Spoilers)* Miki : She is the only person not to have met Megu-nee. Atleast not till the end.* Megu-Nee : Teacher at this school.Ex Teacher at this school.Initially, she pops out of nowhere and only talks with Yuki. She can\'t hold stuff and says they are too heavy. No one else talks to her. Her teleporting herself into the car (Ep 4) was creepy. One can foresee, she isn\'t alive, and is just a mental image created by Yuki.She plays an important role in creating the school-live club and guiding it in the initial stages. She gets infected protecting the children, and turns into a zombie. Yuki was the only person, who could not accept it, and began her hallucinations.She tried to keep her promise of ""always smiling"".She was the guide in life and in death.I lost it when Yuki says ""Bye-Bye Megu-nee"".. :\'(Honourable Mentions:* Taroumaru : A dog, a friend and the second zombie to have helped the club. RIP. You shall be remembered for your bravery and loyal nature. RIP, my friend.* Zombies : They play a important role too. Zombies tend to remember the memories. The reason they hang around near school is that they loved to come to school. This love had been etched into their memories, and is the reason why they came to school everyday.Plot : This Anime is not much of Horror, but of Psychological and Slice of Life Genre.Both these elements are strong enough to make a good plot.The group of girls take shelter at the school, which surprisingly had lot of amenities like Solar powered electricity, rooftop garden (vegetables were grown), and what not. Perfect for taking shelter in a zombie Apocalypse.Is this a coincidence? No. The reason is also revealed later as to why the amenities were there in the first place.The girls spend their days living in the school, cooking food, cleaning, and routine checks and trips for rations etc.Yuki spends her time in classroom, being tutored by a delusional Megu-nee.Yuki\'s memory return gradually. And accepts the reality. Although she saw it with her own eyes, she refused to believe it. It was sad and depressing when Yuki talks to that door. :(It is ok to be sad for one\'s death. The important thing is to let goand not let your emotions take over to the extreme that you refuse to accept reality.(A similar message was given in the Anime : ""Another"" )*Episode specific*For people who feel they are just doing nothing, there isn\'t much to be done. A school is NOT equipped with killing equipments.Also, for those who say, why they returned to school, instead of going away, that\'s becaue- the school had electricity, water, food supplies.- Power was cut off at other places- They realized the potential of the school in keeping them alive. Any other place, they would have died earlier.- They thought the infection had spread to a very wide range. They might not be able to travel that distance with a car without getting out of fuel. (Remember power is cut, so gas stations are useless), unless they find a way to dig into the underground fuel tank.- They didn\'t knew of any other shelter places.So, it made sense to return back to school.Also, many people feel why they didn\'t go on a killing spree. It is important to remember that they are children. Murder is not a native instinct, especially not for a child.The story is excellent. And one of the unique zombie apocalypse.

We will start talking about the art. It is mainly made using too much moe and loli characters.Well that isn\'t so bad.The bad thing is the fact that the characters are around 17~18 yo ... yea... after you watch 5 mins you will wonder too ""Are they actually highschool students?"" Wtf is this bullshit?!?! In other words is kinda annoying if you see what the genres suggest this show will be about. . . Well other than that problem the background is really well made and...this anime has proved that they used this art style in order to attract the viewers easier to the story and make them relax.Continuing with the characters which are outstandingly made. Not that they are unique , not that they are special. They are just incredibly realistic and natural that perfectly fit and don\'t do stupid things out of their character! This show perfectly introduced you characters and their background how they ended in their situation and their problems which made them advance in their life.Additionally, not only it features their good and strong aspects but their opposite weaknesses.For example, A leader which is very kind,strong willed and with great influence to the followers has the fear of what future holds and if his plans succeed ! Let\'s not forget about the MC and its situation,but instead of me talking about this, i will let you find out for yourself!The music on the anime was great.Maybe one of the few anime that you carefully stayed and watched the OP and ED cause of the numerous of hints and hidden messages it had and you MUST discover them!!At the start, you will really question this anime? Like wtf is going one?THIS AIN\'T RIGHT!! yes. . . that will happen a lot dear friend. . .Each and every episode there will be more things to search for in order to ""unravel"" the mystery. In other words, the OP and ED was really interactive and very well though and deep. . .The story was really not something unique but not cliche either. It had its own aspects and authentic parts. What made it even better it was the details and the ways it was introduced. Really well written one. Worth praising and unforgettable! All the dots were slowly connected!!It had its twists and its bullshit moments.Magnificent setup! It has pretty good ways of drawing out emotions and it definitely contains Horror,Psychological and mystery as it suggest. Don\'t be fooled mongrels!! This is masterful at deceiving !!Moreover, this anime has many metaphoric scenes in order to pass some deep messages which is something you don\'t normally see and requires hard work in order to be used right !!------------------Personal Opinion and weakness-----------------------This anime planned everything out, foreshadowed, suggested, gestated, and culimated... but all of that setup leads to a series of serrendiptious contrivences. I feel a little gyped. It\'s like 28 weeks later all over again. Fabulous setup... and then everyone just goes stupid.Also the flashbacks and shinanegans? Like waddaEf. IS that needed? For the time being?Another spicy thing is that it had its ""Fan Service"" moments. Tho. . . no matter how annoyed it wasn\'t so bad... Why? Cause the moments lasted lower than 1 mins each and there were no ecchi jokes or meanigless unrealistic ""Ecchi"" scenes!! But there was they all time cliche Swimsuits episode. . .Yea fuck that obligatory ""Swimsuit"" episode. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE! Last but not least, there were moments when anime went complete retard mode and deactivated all kinds of logic it had. . . Especially in the last 2 episode. I don\'t imply that nothing made sense. I imply that the last 2 episodes were full of miracles and plot conveniences!! Not so bad as it sounds tho... no major flaw or something. . .All in all, this was a hell of a ride.The only problem is that it starts pretty slow and questionable and it selflessly destroy its image in the beginning! I mean it presents itself as SHIT,but inside there is gold!!This series is definitely one of the genuine and prototype series out there.Therefore im recommending it blindfolded to anyone.Personally this anime finished in 11 episodes for me.

And I really enjoyed the ending & series."", ""(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)[The first episode of the show is drastically improved if you go into it blind and so I recommend watching it before reading this review however it is not required for comprehension][Synopsis]: Takeya Yuki (Minase, Inori) along with her friends Kurumi (Ozawa, Ari), Yuuri (Ichimichi, Mao), and Miki (Takahashi, Rie) make up the School-Living club - a group of students that live out of the campus while attending classes and borrowing from the schools facilities. Though Yuki has yet to realize it, there is a concerning reason for the club's existence and though she loves going to...school, her daily routine may not be as it seems.[Characters]:The cast of Gakkougurashi is fairly small and primarily concerns the members of the School-Living club and their respective faculty member Megumi Sakura. The small cast makes a lot of sense for the show in my opinion and while the story is definitely focused on exploring the characters individually and their predicament, I feel like the show itself was ultimately more concerned with delivering thematically and visually - areas where it succeeded excessively. That being said, the cast was characterized to the point where they weren't any kind of negative influence on the show and there were more than a few strong character moments throughout the show's run.Yuki best represents the light-hearted, slice-of-life element of the show both through her perception of her surroundings and in how she interacts with the other members of the group. Her happy go-lucky attitude, her style of running from room to room, and her gag interactions with other students and her friends immediately set a sugar-sweet precedent that the show is then immediately able to dash expertly within the first episode and in this way Yuki provided a great deal of utility to the show and allowed it to play with its contrasting settings to a far greater length than it would otherwise have been able to.Kurumi is similarly childish and excitable however also represents a coming to terms with the environment of the show and her 'action-girl' status provides a go-to archetype to reinforce the stereotypical aspects of the show's design in order to inversely capitalize down the line. Yuuri is the eldest of Yuki's friends and while she acts the most adult-like as the president of the club she also seems to always have something boiling beneath the surface which was a character trait I enjoyed as it often was used to betray the attitude of her scenes while not doing so directly or in a hamfisted manner. Lastly, Miki is the youngest of the group and a newcomer to the club; due to her initial unfamiliarity with her fellow club-members, she offers an outsider's perspective on the group and their setting. She also has a good deal of emotional baggage and is one of the more sentimental characters in the show. Each of the characters do well enough to stand on their own though they also each offer great utility to the show in their characterization and they were great vehicles for some of its more intricate themes.[Art/Animation]:This category was where the show truly blew me away - the art of Gakkougurashi was creative, intelligent, and flexible and provided perhaps the greatest amount of intrigue above all else for me as a viewer. Firstly, the twin aesthetics of the show clash wonderfully - the hyper-moe cast against that of a rather classic zombie-horror setting. The horror of the show plays out a bit differently from other anime like Corpse Party where the violence and gore expresses it's reliance on shock value and the blatant nature of its delivery. Gakkougurashi uses its horror techniques more subtly and instead visually distances the horror action of the show with repeated cuts to black and hazy filters in order to add to the surrealness of the setting in juxtaposition to the previously established near-slice-of-life atmosphere. Furthermore, as the show continues, these horror images are better brought into focus as that side of the show becomes gradually more dominant and the surrealness of the setting is replaced with the underlying harsh reality of the girl's situation.Perhaps one of my favorite techniques used by the show and an area which I think speaks directly to the show's intelligence is that Gakkougurashi does not flaunt its horror images but instead allows them to exist in the background, almost unassumingly. A show of lesser design and direction would have moved heaven and hell to make sure these images reached the viewer and paraded them around instead of letting them occur naturally within the show. Along with this visual technique, the show also makes great use of depth-of-field in order to focus on certain shot elements and expert use of lighting and shadows.Gakkougurashi makes amazing use of color as well. The majority of the show's setting and it's character designs are extremely bright and in vibrant colors (pinks, whites, and greens) whereas the contrasting environment of the horror scenes are far darker and bleak to the point where the show can become drained of color entirely and is visually delivered through blacks and gray-tones. The palette and color tone of each scene is highly dynamic which helped express the stark contrast between the show's two moods. There is even intelligent work being done in Yuki's character design as her school uniform, which differs in color from that of her fellow club members, sets her apart on a visual level in an attempt to parallel her altered perception and difference in mindset from the other girls. The subtle changes in the opening of the show provide a good commentary of what is transpiring and being revealed each episode and was a point of interest at the beginning of each watch.[Story]:In so many words, Gakkougurashi is a show that is driven by an engaging, thematic juxtaposition. The disparity between the actions and activities of the girls and the world that they live in is the central focus of the show and by spending half its time establishing a feel-good atmosphere while simultaneously developing a twisted horror story full of tragedy and sentimentality the show operates in way unique to itself. There is a great juxtaposition between the mundane, every day things such as worrying about graduation and love interests against the abnormal horror setting at the heart of the show. Due to the disparity in perception in the case of Yuki, the cast of the show is allowed to return to it's slice of life roots far more often than it otherwise should be able to and in this way I found Gakkougurashi highly different in terms of progression from other shows that capitalize on presenting conflicting themes and moods such as Madoka and Yuuki Yuuna which, for the most part, have a major turning point in tone before embarking on something more complex and dark than their original premise. Gakkougurashi offers a continuous parallel between its two worlds that I found highly entertaining and clever.There is a good deal of subtext as a lot of the interactions early on can be explained in different ways after learning of their implications in future episodes and so there is entertaining retroactive work being done in terms of tone and sentiment among the characters. The story is presented somewhat non-linearly at first as it takes the time early on to delve into the individual backstories of each of the girls while fleshing out the setting at hand before progressing the plot towards its conclusion. The comedy of the show wasn't the strongest and I felt like it existed mostly for the purpose of, like many other attributes of the show, reinforcing one of the show's major genre elements rather than actually trying to deliver unique and genuine humor. It's a bit run of the mill in this regard however this allows the show to work better within the stereotypical setting that it tries to operate under and betray. The gag and comedic faces were very classic in their implementation to the point that one could even forget what they were watching because of the traditional environment and style they were delivered in.It is for a similar reason to my reasoning surrounding the show's comedy that I found myself quickly forgiving Gakkougurashi for its moe aesthetic and occasional fan-service scene such as it's classic 'beach episode' installment because they both furthered the show's thematic dichotomy. Additionally, there is hardly an episode that goes by without some attention paid to both sides of the show therein the viewer is never left alone with the slice-of-life atmosphere for too long. I see the fan-service as less of a play to get the viewers attention and more of an attempt to reinforce the stereotypical nature and environment of the light-hearted side of the story as to better contrast its ridiculousness with the darker themes and plot developments later in each episode.[Music]:The music fit the show extremely well and while I didn't feel like there were any stand-out songs in an objective sense, they worked extremely well with the visuals to present an intelligent and intricate setting. Gakkougurashi danced between the up-beat, ditzy music typical of the slice of life school setting and the grittier, darker music of the horror setting in interesting ways, sometimes confusing the two and subtly fading one into the other to amazing effect - corrupting the scene fantastically.[Final Thoughts and Rating]:Gakkougurashi was a show that hooked me from episode one with its unique tone and twisted setting. The intelligence of the show really shone through in its visual direction and kept me highly invested each week. The ending was satisfactory in some ways and unsatisfactory in others in that it didn't bother to deliver on a couple of key plot points that arose in the midsection of the show. I think the show would benefit greatly from another installment in order to continue the story however I am doubtful the second season could play with the theme and tone of the show in the same way and would have to either present an incredibly compelling story or bring something unique to the table once again.Rating: 8I gave Gakkougurashi an 8 because it kept me captivated from start to finish with its brilliant use of images, colors, and shot composition alongside an incredibly interesting thematic dichotomy which it played at excellently. The ending didn't quite live up to the rest of the show in my opinion and the stereotypical nature of the show, while incredibly important to its design and delivery, was stereotypical non-the-less and caused the show to drag slightly at times however I feel this was negligible.[Recommendations]:I would recommend Gakkougurashi to fans of horror who can find it in themselves to also tolerate a traditional slice of life school setting for a handful of episodes as the payoff is definitely worth it in this regard. Fans of genre twists where something pure and innocent becomes something darker would do well to pick up this show as the show really triumphed in this area though it presents a more continuous conversation between its contrasting genres than other shows I have seen. While the show does heavily concern zombies I wouldn't necessarily recommend the show to fans of zombie fiction based on this alone unless they fell into one of the previous categories - there isn't a great deal of characterization surrounding the zombies and therein they might not carry the same intrigue as other shows that involve them. school, her daily routine may not be as it seems.[Characters]:The cast of Gakkougurashi is fairly small and primarily concerns the members of the School-Living club and their respective faculty member Megumi Sakura. The small cast makes a lot of sense for the show in my opinion and while the story is definitely focused on exploring the characters individually and their predicament, I feel like the show itself was ultimately more concerned with delivering thematically and visually - areas where it succeeded excessively. That being said, the cast was characterized to the point where they weren't any kind of negative influence on the show and there were more than a few strong character moments throughout the show's run.Yuki best represents the light-hearted, slice-of-life element of the show both through her perception of her surroundings and in how she interacts with the other members of the group. Her happy go-lucky attitude, her style of running from room to room, and her gag interactions with other students and her friends immediately set a sugar-sweet precedent that the show is then immediately able to dash expertly within the first episode and in this way Yuki provided a great deal of utility to the show and allowed it to play with its contrasting settings to a far greater length than it would otherwise have been able to.Kurumi is similarly childish and excitable however also represents a coming to terms with the environment of the show and her 'action-girl' status provides a go-to archetype to reinforce the stereotypical aspects of the show's design in order to inversely capitalize down the line. Yuuri is the eldest of Yuki's friends and while she acts the most adult-like as the president of the club she also seems to always have something boiling beneath the surface which was a character trait I enjoyed as it often was used to betray the attitude of her scenes while not doing so directly or in a hamfisted manner. Lastly, Miki is the youngest of the group and a newcomer to the club; due to her initial unfamiliarity with her fellow club-members, she offers an outsider's perspective on the group and their setting. She also has a good deal of emotional baggage and is one of the more sentimental characters in the show. Each of the characters do well enough to stand on their own though they also each offer great utility to the show in their characterization and they were great vehicles for some of its more intricate themes.[Art/Animation]:This category was where the show truly blew me away - the art of Gakkougurashi was creative, intelligent, and flexible and provided perhaps the greatest amount of intrigue above all else for me as a viewer. Firstly, the twin aesthetics of the show clash wonderfully - the hyper-moe cast against that of a rather classic zombie-horror setting. The horror of the show plays out a bit differently from other anime like Corpse Party where the violence and gore expresses it's reliance on shock value and the blatant nature of its delivery. Gakkougurashi uses its horror techniques more subtly and instead visually distances the horror action of the show with repeated cuts to black and hazy filters in order to add to the surrealness of the setting in juxtaposition to the previously established near-slice-of-life atmosphere. Furthermore, as the show continues, these horror images are better brought into focus as that side of the show becomes gradually more dominant and the surrealness of the setting is replaced with the underlying harsh reality of the girl's situation.Perhaps one of my favorite techniques used by the show and an area which I think speaks directly to the show's intelligence is that Gakkougurashi does not flaunt its horror images but instead allows them to exist in the background, almost unassumingly. A show of lesser design and direction would have moved heaven and hell to make sure these images reached the viewer and paraded them around instead of letting them occur naturally within the show. Along with this visual technique, the show also makes great use of depth-of-field in order to focus on certain shot elements and expert use of lighting and shadows.Gakkougurashi makes amazing use of color as well. The majority of the show's setting and it's character designs are extremely bright and in vibrant colors (pinks, whites, and greens) whereas the contrasting environment of the horror scenes are far darker and bleak to the point where the show can become drained of color entirely and is visually delivered through blacks and gray-tones. The palette and color tone of each scene is highly dynamic which helped express the stark contrast between the show's two moods. There is even intelligent work being done in Yuki's character design as her school uniform, which differs in color from that of her fellow club members, sets her apart on a visual level in an attempt to parallel her altered perception and difference in mindset from the other girls. The subtle changes in the opening of the show provide a good commentary of what is transpiring and being revealed each episode and was a point of interest at the beginning of each watch.[Story]:In so many words, Gakkougurashi is a show that is driven by an engaging, thematic juxtaposition. The disparity between the actions and activities of the girls and the world that they live in is the central focus of the show and by spending half its time establishing a feel-good atmosphere while simultaneously developing a twisted horror story full of tragedy and sentimentality the show operates in way unique to itself. There is a great juxtaposition between the mundane, every day things such as worrying about graduation and love interests against the abnormal horror setting at the heart of the show. Due to the disparity in perception in the case of Yuki, the cast of the show is allowed to return to it's slice of life roots far more often than it otherwise should be able to and in this way I found Gakkougurashi highly different in terms of progression from other shows that capitalize on presenting conflicting themes and moods such as Madoka and Yuuki Yuuna which, for the most part, have a major turning point in tone before embarking on something more complex and dark than their original premise. Gakkougurashi offers a continuous parallel between its two worlds that I found highly entertaining and clever.There is a good deal of subtext as a lot of the interactions early on can be explained in different ways after learning of their implications in future episodes and so there is entertaining retroactive work being done in terms of tone and sentiment among the characters. The story is presented somewhat non-linearly at first as it takes the time early on to delve into the individual backstories of each of the girls while fleshing out the setting at hand before progressing the plot towards its conclusion. The comedy of the show wasn't the strongest and I felt like it existed mostly for the purpose of, like many other attributes of the show, reinforcing one of the show's major genre elements rather than actually trying to deliver unique and genuine humor. It's a bit run of the mill in this regard however this allows the show to work better within the stereotypical setting that it tries to operate under and betray. The gag and comedic faces were very classic in their implementation to the point that one could even forget what they were watching because of the traditional environment and style they were delivered in.It is for a similar reason to my reasoning surrounding the show's comedy that I found myself quickly forgiving Gakkougurashi for its moe aesthetic and occasional fan-service scene such as it's classic 'beach episode' installment because they both furthered the show's thematic dichotomy. Additionally, there is hardly an episode that goes by without some attention paid to both sides of the show therein the viewer is never left alone with the slice-of-life atmosphere for too long. I see the fan-service as less of a play to get the viewers attention and more of an attempt to reinforce the stereotypical nature and environment of the light-hearted side of the story as to better contrast its ridiculousness with the darker themes and plot developments later in each episode.[Music]:The music fit the show extremely well and while I didn't feel like there were any stand-out songs in an objective sense, they worked extremely well with the visuals to present an intelligent and intricate setting. Gakkougurashi danced between the up-beat, ditzy music typical of the slice of life school setting and the grittier, darker music of the horror setting in interesting ways, sometimes confusing the two and subtly fading one into the other to amazing effect - corrupting the scene fantastically.[Final Thoughts and Rating]:Gakkougurashi was a show that hooked me from episode one with its unique tone and twisted setting. The intelligence of the show really shone through in its visual direction and kept me highly invested each week. The ending was satisfactory in some ways and unsatisfactory in others in that it didn't bother to deliver on a couple of key plot points that arose in the midsection of the show. I think the show would benefit greatly from another installment in order to continue the story however I am doubtful the second season could play with the theme and tone of the show in the same way and would have to either present an incredibly compelling story or bring something unique to the table once again.Rating: 8I gave Gakkougurashi an 8 because it kept me captivated from start to finish with its brilliant use of images, colors, and shot composition alongside an incredibly interesting thematic dichotomy which it played at excellently. The ending didn't quite live up to the rest of the show in my opinion and the stereotypical nature of the show, while incredibly important to its design and delivery, was stereotypical non-the-less and caused the show to drag slightly at times however I feel this was negligible.[Recommendations]:I would recommend Gakkougurashi to fans of horror who can find it in themselves to also tolerate a traditional slice of life school setting for a handful of episodes as the payoff is definitely worth it in this regard. Fans of genre twists where something pure and innocent becomes something darker would do well to pick up this show as the show really triumphed in this area though it presents a more continuous conversation between its contrasting genres than other shows I have seen. While the show does heavily concern zombies I wouldn't necessarily recommend the show to fans of zombie fiction based on this alone unless they fell into one of the previous categories - there isn't a great deal of characterization surrounding the zombies and therein they might not carry the same intrigue as other shows that involve them."", '""Cute girls doing cute things."" I always cringe a little whenever I see those big eyed blobs of moe strike a pose and say something in their high pitched voice with a giant smile on their face. Makes me wanna bash their face in with a baseball bat (random Higurashi reference).I had kind of a similar reaction when I watched the first 15 minutes of Gakkou Gurashi! A girl wakes up in her bed in school and starts walking around with her dog. She then proceeds to have breakfast in her club room with the club members and then goes to attend class like any...other student would do. Apparently the Club\'s name is School Living Club and all the members live on the school premises and don\'t go home after school\'s over. Usual anime logic aside, it doesn\'t make much sense because first of all, no school authority will ever allow such a club to exist where you practically live at school. And then there\'s the dog. So, I tolerated that till the end of episode 1 and that\'s where the twist hit me the face. This pack of moe blobs is actually in a zombie apocalypse and the main character is delusional (I like how the hints were sprinkled around in the episode). Now this turns the whole moe routine on it\'s head. Instead of being cute/obnoxious, the whole thing becomes sad and pitiful. This excellent use of shock drew me into this anime.And the good thing about Gakkou Gurashi! is that they know HOW to transition between these dark and light atmospheres. The problem comes in with the story and pacing of the anime. While they spend plenty of time fleshing out their characters by providing all of them with their own separate backstories, the main plot remains at a standstill up until the very end. And that makes me a little frustrated because I\'m dying to know how this bunch of school girls are going to make it out of that school building? Will they wait till they are cornered or they\'re gonna take the initiative? And all of this isn\'t answered till the last couple episodes. Instead, what I get is more of that cute moe routine with more twists thrown in, which makes the middle portion of the anime slightly boring and frustrating. So, you do need a little bit of patience to chew through that part.As for the ending of the show, it is definitely interesting but they seemed to have forced the emotional atmosphere there. It\'s still good but it could have been better.Now, what Gakkou Gurashi! did great was how it dealt with it\'s characters. As I said before, they provide ample amount of backstories (interesting backstories) to all of their characters (except Wakasa Yuuri) so they\'re all fleshed out. The fact that Yuki is delusional adds a lot to all the characters around her and how they behave (imagine the psychological pressure). Of course, Yuki herself isn\'t always clueless either, she often tends to avoid or play dumb whenever the club members try to \'confront\' her. This is depicted very well by how they do her expressions at those times (how it shows up on her face). The same goes for all the other characters. They don\'t stick to a certain character trope and play it throughout the show. They all help each other and contribute in whatever way they can. What I didn\'t like about them was how none of them seemed to be worried about their families. And since the anime does not give us any other information about the outside world, we don\'t know any better than the characters themselves.The good thing here is that the characters question things around them which would have normally been labelled as mere coincidences. Like how the school has all the supplies and everything conveniently available. How the zombies seem to follow a certain pattern according to their previous lifestyle. On top of that, they don\'t go full hollywood mode and start killing zombies as if they were eagerly waiting for a zombie apocalypse to happen. They are a bunch of kids in school and they act like it. Though they can be surprisingly rational at times. With the exception of Yuuri (and maybe Taroumaru), all the characters did their part well for the kind of situation they were in (backstories and all).Compared to all the production messes during the summer season (Manglobe going bankrupt, ufotable messing up God Eater, Rokka no Yuusha\'s terrible fight sequences and CG, not to mention DBZ super), I\'d say the animation quality was nice. At least it was consistent throughout the show. The characters are fluid, the backgrounds are pretty. There is a nice balance between the light and dark tones and they handle the atmospheres well during those transitions. What I especially like is the subtle changes they made into the opening of the show as the plot progressed and several major plot twists were revealed. The ending sequence was okay. As for the soundtrack, I\'d say the usual - ""It was there, it was nice but not good enough for me to go out of my way to look for it"".So, Gakkou Gurashi! is a nice show and quite a different take on the whole Zombie Apocalypse scenario. Sure, it doesn\'t show you the shrewd ugliness of mankind or how the laws of physics change when it comes to boobie mechanics, but does give you an interesting scenario to think about. One that is isolated from the ugliness that humans would show in case of such scenario but at the same time close to being a realistic (and human) depiction of how a bunch of highschool girls would deal with such a situation. It is a bit idealistic and could get a little frustrating at times, I\'m just glad that anime tried something like this. So give this a shot, but go in with an open mind. other student would do.

So give this a shot, but go in with an open mind.', 'Gakkougurashi, or ""School-Live!"", might have the best pilot episode of any anime I have ever seen. Not in terms of plot or humour, but in the way it is written. The way the episode uses the audience\'s expectations (or lack there of) to it\'s advantage is nothing but pure brilliance. Just like a skilled magician it misdirects your attention in a way so that when you\'re rewatching it for a second time, it all suddenly seems obvious. Therefore, going into this anime blind is extremly rewarding.The story as a whole is very entertaining, but most importantly: satisfying (something a lot of other anime fails to...be). It is said that the most dangerous part of tightrope walking are the last few steps, and the same is true when telling a story. I could go on forever about shows that start out as great, only to f*ck it all up with an ending that leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. But thankfully; when Gakkougurashi ended, it felt right.No anime is perfect though, and with Gakkougurashi the flaws are with the main characters themselves. We never really get to know them, what you see is what you get. And considering the kind of situation these girls are in, I think it would\'ve been nice to learn at least a little about their backgrounds. For instance, why do they never talk about their families? Like, at all?!But besides that, the characters aren\'t bad, and the relationship between them is both portrayed and developed in a great, believable way. Both the art and sound is of the quality you should expect from a modern anime. And I also like the way the OP changes as the show goes on.To me, Gakkougurashi is a bit of a paradox. Because I can tell you one thing: it does not deserve the 10 rating. But despite that, I still kinda want to give it a 10 rating. And an anime that makes me wanna give it a 10, even though it doesn\'t really deserve a 10, definitely deserves a 10. be).

Spoilers ahead!)Gakkou Gurashi has this adorable little doggy named Taroumaru. A doggy that reminded me of my own. Her name is Mollie – with an “ie,” not a “y” – and she is the strongest pooch I have ever known.Born the runt of the litter, when Mollie was a few weeks old, she was no bigger than the palm of your hand. She did not walk around so much as she skipped, her unbelievably tiny legs allowing her to jump from one spot to the next. I remember thinking that a dog who was as small as...she was could not possibly exist. But her being there, daintily moving on the grass in front of us, was impossible to doubt. My mother, to this day, believes that we had saved Mollie, her miniature stature enough of a reason for her original owners to euthanize her.Her fur was pure white, her tail was stubby, and she had the slightest lazy eye that made her even cuter. Early on, she became scared of thunderstorms and fireworks, crying and shaking uncontrollably until someone in our family sat with her. She hated her cage (still hates it), incessantly complaining until she was set free once more. She loves to stretch her body as far as she can while getting belly rubs. And strangest of all, she simply has to run around in circles when playing, as if the rotations would boost her energy further.Mollie was in our life for little more than five months before she got very sick during her first December. She was admitted to the veterinary clinic; the diagnosis was kidney failure. The doctors thought she had no chance to live and actually had us bring her home. I can still see Mollie in the golden cage, her blissfully unaware of her condition. She was skipping and jumping on her favorite blanket, her tugging on her toys and barking playfully. My family and I were looking on, weeping.And then, like light snow drifting softly on Christmas Day, a miracle occurred. She survived. The medicine started to work and Mollie became healthy once more. At least, for a time: she would later have intestinal issues, tooth decay, and loss of hearing. But she has never given up. After years of difficulties, she is still trudging on. Sure, her hair has yellowed, her tail is longer, and her lazy eye is lazier than ever, but her tenacity has never wavered.Mollie is an amazing puppy, a trooper through and through. She is our Taroumaru. And as both showcase, sometimes when the situation is looking down, the best thing to do is smile.STORYGakkou Gurashi is an anime that cannot be taken at face value. Its exterior is purposefully misleading, the contents within contrasting how it presents itself both to those in and out of the loop. The anime understands that it occupies the area where the sunshine and the shadows cross, leveraging these two halves to the best of its ability, ultimately leading to positive results.The first episode sets the stage. Cute characters have fun hanging out together. A couple are normal, one wields a shovel, and the last is a big ball of energy. The playground is a typical school, with quirky classmates, loving teachers, and lax rules. It is fun for everyone involved, the time filled with silly antics and huge smiles, making it out to be like “any other slice-of-life show.” Then the plot twist occurs. This bait and switch, from boundless joy to horrifying truth, works on multiple levels. First, the actual point in time: rather than having it go from one extreme to the other, the calamity has already occurred. This places the focus on the characters and their current situation rather than on the turning point itself, strengthening these respective areas. Second, it forces the audience to reevaluate. Since what was given was portrayed one way, the twist causes the viewer to rethink what was actually going on, increasing investment in the show itself. Third and last, it pushes itself away from the norm. It is not all laughs, fun, and happiness; it is death, darkness, and despair. The anime is not a typical slice-of-life offering, but instead a twisted take on “cute girls doing cute things.”Atypical directions are common for narratives, as are dichotomies. In Gakkou Gurashi’s case, the dichotomy it creates – cute versus psychological – helps itself, each side accentuating the other. The characters having fun at the “pool” or holding a variety of relay events is adorable to watch, the bleak atmosphere furthering this feeling since it stands out so much from the gore and harshness that surrounds them. The opposite goes through the same effects: watching as the cast tries to block the rooftop door with boxes to protect themselves or seeing Yuki hiding in a maze of convenience store aisles to hide from a pursuer feels more dramatic and tense since the cuteness and the silly jokes gives way to these direr scenarios. Better yet, the show is not afraid to go completely one way or the other. One moment has Yuki imagining a wedding between Kurumi and “Shovel-kun” while the next has Yuuri contemplating putting the newly betrothed out of her misery. These instances are fine on their own but because they are coupled together, and because they are so contrasting, they are amplified and thus have a larger impact than they otherwise would.The instances are also not constructed using a linear timeline. Instead, the anime adopts a semi-non-chronological order. First it starts in the middle with the four main girls, goes forward slightly, then jumps back in time, then forward again, and eventually to a point beyond where the adventure began. Convoluted to an extent, but purposeful. This roundabout progression generates mystery and confusion, both caused through the jumbling of the events. The former because the out-of-order scenes hide information whereas the latter because it is harder to tell what is happening when. Together, and like the dichotomy the show so heavily leans on, the haphazard ordering heightens the drama.Gakkou Gurashi also covers its writing bases. Having the girls literally live in a school seems impossible. Without electricity, clean water, and attainable food, the likelihood that they would survive for more than a week or so is slim. But as the anime details, solar panels, water filters, and fresh crops turn the normal school into a sustainable mini-village. This happening is not convenient; the show explains how the building was specifically designed with the outbreak in mind. The zombies also follow the school-centric theme. Throughout the season, those infected were shown to remember their past lives. Some students would lounge around on the soccer field while others crowded the mall. Megumi’s diary clearly proves she is, to some degree, aware of who she was before. Therefore, the final solution to save the gang – Yuki broadcasting that the school-day was over (cleverly and metaphorically ending her, Yuuri’s, Kurumi’s, and Miki’s stay at the school as well) – was already gradually established, making the action again not a convenience but rather an inspired move.Oddly enough, the school and the zombies also reveal a glaring issue: a distinct lack of the past, specifically not showing more of before the outbreak. Outside of Megumi’s episode, little is given of the school, its students, and the relationships these two entities generated while they were still pure. The audience does not get to learn about the girl with a collar or see the jubilation of the various clubs. So when Yuki’s emotional farewell is given, it is not that emotional because the viewer was rarely given the opportunity to connect with the same aspects that Yuki had come to love. As such the moment, while sincere, loses power because the audience essentially does not – cannot – care for these parts.“Care” is a vital motif of the show. A teacher caring for her students. A regretful child caring for her dog. So Gakkou Gurashi begs the question: what should be cared about? In a situation where the past is gone, the present is harrowing, and the future is grim, the anime imparts a contextually not-so-simple message: “when life hands you lemons, make lemonade.” Life is hard. Often obstacles of the physical and mental variety hamper people on an everyday basis. So sometimes life can seem impossible to handle, unfair in the cards it deals. The girls of the anime obviously find themselves in a markedly more dangerous situation, but the same rule applies. They do not resign to pessimism. They do not believe that what remains of the world is hopeless. Even when they do – as is seen with Miki’s original predicament – they learn to take it one step at time, finding joy where presumably none exists. It might be trying on some bikinis for fun. It might be holding a graduation ceremony to commemorate a job well-done. It might be pitching a tent for a makeshift campfire outing. Or it might be something simpler, like reading an engaging novel or eating a favorite snack. Regardless of what is done, it is important to find the light in the darkness, to view the brighter side of life whenever possible, because then, and only then, will more goodness follow. For the girls of Gakkou Gurashi, their ability to always make that lemonade allowed them to find this goodness: lives worth living.The rest of the anime is filled with other ups – Miki’s near-death in the basement mirroring her time in the mall – and other downs – Kei’s supposed zombie self as a way to wrap up her plotline is somewhat sloppy – but considering how the anime keeps its focus almost entirely on the dualities it creates, the narrative concludes opposite to how it started: filled with positivity. That is to say, the girls of the school live…for now.ANIMATIONGakkou Gurashi continues its misleading tendencies through its visuals. In other words, the anime’s art and animation are stronger than “just another slice-of-life” would lead one to believe.Once again, the first episode alone is almost enough evidence to make a case for how powerful the anime is in its presentation. Drawing the other students devoid of features makes them there but distant. The small Easter-eggs scattered throughout are telling of the reality without outright talking. And the seemingly inconsequential details like the stacked desks and the broken windows are weird but not weird enough to make them standout. All of the signs exist for something being not-quite-right but are constructed in such a way as to not reveal the plot twist before the opportune moment.Many of the show’s moments also include other subtle artistic decisions that sum together to create intricate scenes. Tactics like having Megumi slide in from off-screen to conceal her status and refusing to reveal the eyes of the zombies to heighten their scariness are noteworthy for their simultaneous simplicity and execution.The camera direction also sees elevated execution, incorporating skewed shots to increase tension, up-close shots to capture the manic faces of the characters, and top-down ones to provide a perspective that showcases the cute girls in their broken environment. One shot in particular involves a sort of fish-eye lens, where Yuki’s head bends as the camera moves away from her to quickly relay her collapsing sanity. While used only once, it goes to show how inventive the anime gets with its cinematography.Inventiveness continues when the characters and their character designs are investigated. Yuuri is specifically crafted as older: her larger bust, her beauty mole near her right eye, and her beige sweater paint her as the more mature person that she is. Kurumi goes wacky. Besides wielding a shovel, her black-and-white sleeves, her purple twin-tails, and her kneepads act as a silly exterior that harbors a more distraught interior. Both girls are certainly interesting, since the personalities they maintain can easily be surmised through the designs they hold.The designs get even more interesting when it comes to Miki and Yuki. For Miki, she is rather plain, wearing the regular school uniform. Her short hair, blue eyes, and small frame give her a gender-neutral design for a reason: she is designed to be the most relatable. Her character goes through emotions that many people in this kind of situation could relate to, so having her appear slightly androgynous makes her more neutral gender-wise and thus more relatable. Yuki, though, takes the cake. Her pink hair, her lavender-and-white outfit, and her white wings on her backpack heavily contrast with not just the environment but also the other girls, making her completely standout. But it is her black hat that encapsulates all that she is. The hat’s little ears are cute yet the colors clearly contrast with her own design, matching the split her mind has undergone. Simultaneously, hats hide heads, concealing what lies beneath them. Yuki “places a hat” on reality through her mental blocking, hiding the truth of the situation to keep herself going. In other words, Yuki’s hat symbolizes her insanity. A hat should be a trivial item for any character, but in Yuki’s case, it provides a profound revelation on her character without having to know much about her. In short, her design is genius.While the actual animation does not reach the same level as Yuki’s character design, it still manages to remain above average throughout the season. Kurumi and Yuki often have the most movement of the bunch, due to the former’s fighting and the latter’s energy. Gakkou Gurashi also likes to employ comical and comic-like bubbles to add cuteness and to stock up on resources for more intensive scenes like those that adopt a grainy filter or when the characters are simply having fun together. Combined with hair ruffling, eye moving, and tail wagging, the anime’s attention to its animation never falters, thereby increasing its total execution.CHARACTERSIn a slice-of-life anime like Gakkou Gurashi, it is arguably the characters that have the most importance since the story being told is not necessarily captivating. Putting it differently, the cast have more weight to carry since the narrative surrounding them is more a setting than a driving force. The weight, though, is not equally distributed in the show, with Kurumi, Yuuri, Yuki, and Miki demonstrating various levels of strength and therefore execution.Kurumi receives a lot of her characterization early on. Before the outbreak, she had a crush, wanting nothing more than to form a romantic relationship with him. But he succumbed to the legion and, worse still, Kurumi was the one to take him down. This changes her: she alone fights and kills other zombies, distancing herself from them when she enters her battle-trance mode. She does not view the zombies as people. At least, she does not want to, since when she is met with the picture on a girl’s phone or she encounters Megumi, she wavers, losing her composure. At one point she makes a promise with Yuuri about putting each other out of their misery should either fail to protect themselves. How fitting, then, that she gets infected later on in the series, turning her into the kind of person that she came to despise. It turns into a battle of the mind rather than one of the body, the latter the type she had grown accustomed to.Kurumi’s character is the least interesting of the group (despite her wacky design) because the anime does not spend enough time exploring her traits. After learning about her connection to the situation and hatred of the zombies, she more or less gets pushed to the side, taking the spotlight on occasion to swing her shovel or to make an aforementioned promise. Otherwise, she is relegated to quips here and there without having too much impact until the end where her condition worsens. In a way, it is logical: Kurumi knows how to drive, fight, and scout. She is a utility, capable of completing a lot of the hard labor that the rest of the girls cannot. So when she is well, it is smooth sailing, but when she is literally couch-ridden, the group almost falls apart. What does not make sense, however, is the decision to forego showing more of her mental battle. The audience receives a clip of this during the early stages of her infection, but afterwards kicking and screaming is all that is seen, meaning in terms of development Kurumi receives very little. By the end, it is unclear whether or not she has gotten over her crush, how she feels towards the zombies now, and if her near-death experience affected her, leaving her character in an awkward position.Yuuri’s character fairs slightly better, if only because she has another – Megumi – to play off. Yuuri is the leader of the girls, motherly in her nature. She is strict yet caring, she knows how to cook, and she usually makes the more authoritative decisions. Interestingly, this is not a mantle that she necessarily wanted to uphold. Technically Megumi was the overseer, but following the teacher’s death, Yuuri took the reins, making sure she, Kurumi, Yuki, and Miki were kept safe within their makeshift club. She is not the strongest or the smartest or the silliest, but this is precisely why she best fits the leadership role since, more so than anyone, she knows what has to be done and can use those who are the strongest, smartest, and silliest to accomplish these goals.Yuuri looked up to Megumi, seeing the teacher as someone to emulate or at least follow, Megumi’s pure kindness a rare trait for anyone to have. So Yuuri takes the same path: she plays along with Yuki’s antics, she advises Kurumi to not overexert herself, and she talks privately with Miki to ease Miki’s conscious. She wants to be there for the girls in their time of need as best as she can, and therefore what she has more so than the others is a sense of calm. Yuuri’s strength is the ability to keep the group stable through her loving watch. This is why when she breaks down, she breaks down hard. She does not know how to handle the hectic final set of events because nobody is there to keep her calm. Seeing her in such a state is noticeable to the viewer; if Yuuri of all people cannot keep it together, it must truly be a dire situation. Similar to Kurumi, though, it is unclear how these events and their time at the school has changed her. At the minimum, she is thankful to Megumi for imprinting on her the same set of values, allowing her to keep her and the group from losing all hope.Hopeful is all that Yuki is. She is always smiling, her affable personality cute, fun, and kind. She has a deep affinity for the school, the teachers, and the students, loving life and all that it has to offer. Yuki seems almost too perfect on paper, which is exactly the case. Her persona is not really a ruse but a mental block. She is insane, to put it lightly. She has imaginary friends. She is capable of seeing and talking to her deceased teacher. She refuses to acknowledge that their current predicament is what it is, instead forcing her own reality at every turn. She is technically an older student but she is without a doubt the most childish out of the four of them, a dichotomy that aligns itself perfectly with her contrasting nature.Yuki’s behavior is intriguing because of how she and the others view it. Whether or not she is fully aware of her personality disorder is difficult to pinpoint; clearly she knew that what she was doing was wrong for her psyche – she says as much on the final rooftop scene – but throughout the season she seems blissfully unaware of the troubles surrounding them, solving chalkboard problems in a disheveled room. Kurumi, Yuuri, and Miki understand Yuki’s strangeness, but rather than forcing her to realize the truth they leverage her positivity. The other girls abuse Yuki’s ability to always keep things fresh and fun in order to keep themselves sane. In way, the three of them using Yuki as a motivational booster is demented and likewise insane. To an extent, she is nothing more than a tool, a convenient entity to get them through the day. It is messed up because they know they can help her but they do not. Luckily, Yuki is forced to come to terms with the real reality, saving the others and consequently growing up. To confirm this notion, she lays her symbolically psychological hat to rest, signifying that she has, in fact, graduated.Arguably though it is Miki, not Yuki, who is the strongest character of the anime. She garners a surprisingly large amount of screen-time, mostly because she has a completely separate plotline before it merges with the main one. During her subplot, she and her best friend Kei survived in a mall, with nothing but each other, Taroumaru, and a CD player. Miki was content with their hidey-hole, believing that surviving was enough. When Kei abandons her to pursue better prospects, she does not know what to do. Loneliness piles on, the CD player quickly becoming a symbol for the daily repetition she confined herself to and the repetitive feeling of being alone.Miki is eventually saved, but having lost Kei and having been away from people for so long, she does not immediately connect with the others. She saw Yuki as weird, and Kurumi and Yuuri as manipulative for keeping Yuki in said weird condition. Rather than goofing around, she felt that their time could be better utilized to continue what she had relegated herself to: surviving and nothing more. But after sending letters on balloons (and pigeons) and reconciling with Taroumaru, she slowly opens up, doing away with her reserved self and establishing relationships with the rest of the cast. Miki comes to follow the story’s main theme of finding the fun in life where none is had. As such, she develops from a lonely, critical young girl into a confident, lively woman, appreciating and understanding that there is more to life than simply surviving. Or as Miki puts it, “I lived, and it was all worthwhile.”At the center of the girls is Megumi. Megumi helped Kurumi, she mentored Yuuri, and she taught Yuki. Also, if it was not for her and keeping the original group together, Miki would never have had the opportunity to become more than she was. Megumi is the rock that connects them all, and through her, the characters’ theme comes to light: not being afraid to rely on others. While Megumi silently watches over them when she does move on, her absence highlights the importance of how nothing can be done alone. Each girl has their strengths and their weaknesses, each girl doing what she can to keep the group going. The group is a circular chain, each loop linked to the next, a missing link deforming the structure. They would not be as successful without each other; Kurumi’s slaying, Yuuri’s aiding, Yuki’s laughing, and Miki’s rationalizing work in tandem to keep their group thriving. They have Megumi to thank for bringing them together but only each other for continuing what she started. And as the conclusion depicts, the girls might have graduated, but they will continue to support and rely on one another no matter what may come.SOUNDThe opening theme is fantastic, encompassing all of the cuteness and adorableness that the anime contains. The fun little beat, the fast lyrics, and the switching vocalists make the piece pleasant to listen to both in and out of the anime. The piece builds up in the beginning, to give way to a catchy and back-and-forth tone that captures the same tempo that the anime also follows.The first ending theme is a mixture of happiness and sadness. The track itself is mellow, with background choirs and ambient sound effects that makes it a simple piece, and therefore a nice way to transition out of most of the episodes. The second ending goes decidedly darker, the chimes and clacking scary-sounding to match the anime’s atmosphere. As the piece proceeds the singer heavily carries the track until the instruments finally appear. Still, the vocalist nails her notes, achieving a finish with range and emotion that coincides with the saddened feel of the show itself. While the second ED does not trump the OP, it easily defeats the first ED, making one wonder why it was not used for the entirety of the season to begin with.The rest of the soundtrack is filled with exactly the types of pieces needed to fit the slice-of-life and horror aspects. The former is filled with xylophones and party tunes that lift the spirits whereas the latter is filled with melancholic piano pieces that lower the mood considerably. Nothing immediately stands out, but the OST performs at the necessary level to make the scenes it is used vibrant and depressing when needed.Voice acting reaches the same level, with solid performances for the cast but nothing downright noteworthy. Inori Minase as Yuki has quite the cute voice to expound her cute nature ten-fold. Mao Ichimichi as Yuuri speaks in a tone that only a mature woman could, fitting her personality well. And a special shout-out to Emiri Katou as Taroumaru for puppy barks and cries that could make anyone say “D’aww.”ENJOYMENTI sound like a monster for saying this, but I sort of wish all of the girls died, or at least all of them but Yuki. A tragic ending would have been poignant, a visceral and harsh reality that would be difficult to stomach after seeing the girls go through so much and have so much fun together. I was robbed of this – “robbed” because I honestly believed going in to the final episode that the anime was going to end on a heart-shattering note – leaving me a bit bitter.I think this is why Taroumaru’s death hit me harder than it should have because they tricked me once more. It seemed like he was hurt, sure, but he was eating and drinking. Then he passed away. At first, I was shaking my head, saddened that he died after everything that had happened. But the real kicker was on the roof. Yuki’s words, “He looked at you and said…’Thank you!’” while the screen flashbacked to Taroumaru’s tiny smile, made me cry right alongside Miki. It was a powerful moment not just because I was attached to the dog but because I could see and hear the pain in Miki’s face and voice. I hate goodbyes (something that frequenters of my material might know), so watching such a heartfelt goodbye escalated how much of a chord this struck with me.The rest of the show was still lovable even if my evil ending never came to fruition. Yuki was an extremely fun character, her undeniable cuteness and her never-ending smile giving her a charm that meshed nicely with her insanity. Again, I sound crazy, but part of the reason why I liked her so much was because she was insane, but now that that has technically been overcome, she loses a quirk to her that made her unique, something I am strangely not okay with. Still, Miki teasing Yuki in the shower about being her “senpai” and Yuki’s expressions matching Taromaru’s always put a smile on my face, so I suppose Yuki accomplished what she set out to do.Yuuri, Kurumi, and Miki were likewise hilarious. Yuuri’s gag with getting overly furious, Kurumi wanting to use “just the blunt end” for catching purposes, and Miki acting adorable whenever Yuki got too close for her comfort almost always gave me some kind of chuckle. Megumi, too, since the group ignoring her made her feel not wanted or respected, leading to some funny reactions on her part. The whole season was a lot of fun – despite all of the despair it contained – with the only other gripe besides the optimistic ending being that I have to patiently wait to see where the School Living Club goes next.Gakkou Gurashi is simultaneously a cutesy and thrilling ride. The narrative’s dichotomous nature, the art’s stellar direction, and the cast’s interesting characterizations create an anime that does reasonably well all around. The opening and ending themes, as well as the emotional moments – of the comedic and dramatic variety – further buffer the show. Life can certainly get one down. But this anime, like Mollie, makes it that much easier to smile.SUMMARYStory: Good, dualities throughout keep the narrative focused and purposeful but a lack of the past tampers the audience’s ability to emotionally connectAnimation: Great, intricate artistic direction keeps the art stunning, character designs are well-done, with Yuki’s being fantastic, and above average actual animationCharacters: Fine, Kurumi is bad, Yuuri is okay, Yuki is good, and Miki is great, with Megumi highlighting the theme of relying on othersSound: Fine, great OP, okay first ED, good second ED, okay OST, solid VA performancesEnjoyment: Good, cute, hilarious, and emotional, but I preferred a more tragic conclusionFinal Score: 7/10 she was could not possibly exist. But her being there, daintily moving on the grass in front of us, was impossible to doubt. My mother, to this day, believes that we had saved Mollie, her miniature stature enough of a reason for her original owners to euthanize her.Her fur was pure white, her tail was stubby, and she had the slightest lazy eye that made her even cuter. Early on, she became scared of thunderstorms and fireworks, crying and shaking uncontrollably until someone in our family sat with her. She hated her cage (still hates it), incessantly complaining until she was set free once more. She loves to stretch her body as far as she can while getting belly rubs. And strangest of all, she simply has to run around in circles when playing, as if the rotations would boost her energy further.Mollie was in our life for little more than five months before she got very sick during her first December. She was admitted to the veterinary clinic; the diagnosis was kidney failure. The doctors thought she had no chance to live and actually had us bring her home. I can still see Mollie in the golden cage, her blissfully unaware of her condition. She was skipping and jumping on her favorite blanket, her tugging on her toys and barking playfully. My family and I were looking on, weeping.And then, like light snow drifting softly on Christmas Day, a miracle occurred. She survived. The medicine started to work and Mollie became healthy once more. At least, for a time: she would later have intestinal issues, tooth decay, and loss of hearing. But she has never given up. After years of difficulties, she is still trudging on. Sure, her hair has yellowed, her tail is longer, and her lazy eye is lazier than ever, but her tenacity has never wavered.Mollie is an amazing puppy, a trooper through and through. She is our Taroumaru. And as both showcase, sometimes when the situation is looking down, the best thing to do is smile.STORYGakkou Gurashi is an anime that cannot be taken at face value. Its exterior is purposefully misleading, the contents within contrasting how it presents itself both to those in and out of the loop. The anime understands that it occupies the area where the sunshine and the shadows cross, leveraging these two halves to the best of its ability, ultimately leading to positive results.The first episode sets the stage. Cute characters have fun hanging out together. A couple are normal, one wields a shovel, and the last is a big ball of energy. The playground is a typical school, with quirky classmates, loving teachers, and lax rules. It is fun for everyone involved, the time filled with silly antics and huge smiles, making it out to be like “any other slice-of-life show.” Then the plot twist occurs. This bait and switch, from boundless joy to horrifying truth, works on multiple levels. First, the actual point in time: rather than having it go from one extreme to the other, the calamity has already occurred. This places the focus on the characters and their current situation rather than on the turning point itself, strengthening these respective areas. Second, it forces the audience to reevaluate. Since what was given was portrayed one way, the twist causes the viewer to rethink what was actually going on, increasing investment in the show itself. Third and last, it pushes itself away from the norm. It is not all laughs, fun, and happiness; it is death, darkness, and despair. The anime is not a typical slice-of-life offering, but instead a twisted take on “cute girls doing cute things.”Atypical directions are common for narratives, as are dichotomies. In Gakkou Gurashi’s case, the dichotomy it creates – cute versus psychological – helps itself, each side accentuating the other. The characters having fun at the “pool” or holding a variety of relay events is adorable to watch, the bleak atmosphere furthering this feeling since it stands out so much from the gore and harshness that surrounds them. The opposite goes through the same effects: watching as the cast tries to block the rooftop door with boxes to protect themselves or seeing Yuki hiding in a maze of convenience store aisles to hide from a pursuer feels more dramatic and tense since the cuteness and the silly jokes gives way to these direr scenarios. Better yet, the show is not afraid to go completely one way or the other. One moment has Yuki imagining a wedding between Kurumi and “Shovel-kun” while the next has Yuuri contemplating putting the newly betrothed out of her misery. These instances are fine on their own but because they are coupled together, and because they are so contrasting, they are amplified and thus have a larger impact than they otherwise would.The instances are also not constructed using a linear timeline. Instead, the anime adopts a semi-non-chronological order. First it starts in the middle with the four main girls, goes forward slightly, then jumps back in time, then forward again, and eventually to a point beyond where the adventure began. Convoluted to an extent, but purposeful. This roundabout progression generates mystery and confusion, both caused through the jumbling of the events. The former because the out-of-order scenes hide information whereas the latter because it is harder to tell what is happening when. Together, and like the dichotomy the show so heavily leans on, the haphazard ordering heightens the drama.Gakkou Gurashi also covers its writing bases. Having the girls literally live in a school seems impossible. Without electricity, clean water, and attainable food, the likelihood that they would survive for more than a week or so is slim. But as the anime details, solar panels, water filters, and fresh crops turn the normal school into a sustainable mini-village. This happening is not convenient; the show explains how the building was specifically designed with the outbreak in mind. The zombies also follow the school-centric theme. Throughout the season, those infected were shown to remember their past lives. Some students would lounge around on the soccer field while others crowded the mall. Megumi’s diary clearly proves she is, to some degree, aware of who she was before. Therefore, the final solution to save the gang – Yuki broadcasting that the school-day was over (cleverly and metaphorically ending her, Yuuri’s, Kurumi’s, and Miki’s stay at the school as well) – was already gradually established, making the action again not a convenience but rather an inspired move.Oddly enough, the school and the zombies also reveal a glaring issue: a distinct lack of the past, specifically not showing more of before the outbreak. Outside of Megumi’s episode, little is given of the school, its students, and the relationships these two entities generated while they were still pure. The audience does not get to learn about the girl with a collar or see the jubilation of the various clubs. So when Yuki’s emotional farewell is given, it is not that emotional because the viewer was rarely given the opportunity to connect with the same aspects that Yuki had come to love. As such the moment, while sincere, loses power because the audience essentially does not – cannot – care for these parts.“Care” is a vital motif of the show. A teacher caring for her students. A regretful child caring for her dog. So Gakkou Gurashi begs the question: what should be cared about? In a situation where the past is gone, the present is harrowing, and the future is grim, the anime imparts a contextually not-so-simple message: “when life hands you lemons, make lemonade.” Life is hard. Often obstacles of the physical and mental variety hamper people on an everyday basis. So sometimes life can seem impossible to handle, unfair in the cards it deals. The girls of the anime obviously find themselves in a markedly more dangerous situation, but the same rule applies. They do not resign to pessimism. They do not believe that what remains of the world is hopeless. Even when they do – as is seen with Miki’s original predicament – they learn to take it one step at time, finding joy where presumably none exists. It might be trying on some bikinis for fun. It might be holding a graduation ceremony to commemorate a job well-done. It might be pitching a tent for a makeshift campfire outing. Or it might be something simpler, like reading an engaging novel or eating a favorite snack. Regardless of what is done, it is important to find the light in the darkness, to view the brighter side of life whenever possible, because then, and only then, will more goodness follow. For the girls of Gakkou Gurashi, their ability to always make that lemonade allowed them to find this goodness: lives worth living.The rest of the anime is filled with other ups – Miki’s near-death in the basement mirroring her time in the mall – and other downs – Kei’s supposed zombie self as a way to wrap up her plotline is somewhat sloppy – but considering how the anime keeps its focus almost entirely on the dualities it creates, the narrative concludes opposite to how it started: filled with positivity. That is to say, the girls of the school live…for now.ANIMATIONGakkou Gurashi continues its misleading tendencies through its visuals. In other words, the anime’s art and animation are stronger than “just another slice-of-life” would lead one to believe.Once again, the first episode alone is almost enough evidence to make a case for how powerful the anime is in its presentation. Drawing the other students devoid of features makes them there but distant. The small Easter-eggs scattered throughout are telling of the reality without outright talking. And the seemingly inconsequential details like the stacked desks and the broken windows are weird but not weird enough to make them standout. All of the signs exist for something being not-quite-right but are constructed in such a way as to not reveal the plot twist before the opportune moment.Many of the show’s moments also include other subtle artistic decisions that sum together to create intricate scenes. Tactics like having Megumi slide in from off-screen to conceal her status and refusing to reveal the eyes of the zombies to heighten their scariness are noteworthy for their simultaneous simplicity and execution.The camera direction also sees elevated execution, incorporating skewed shots to increase tension, up-close shots to capture the manic faces of the characters, and top-down ones to provide a perspective that showcases the cute girls in their broken environment. One shot in particular involves a sort of fish-eye lens, where Yuki’s head bends as the camera moves away from her to quickly relay her collapsing sanity. While used only once, it goes to show how inventive the anime gets with its cinematography.Inventiveness continues when the characters and their character designs are investigated. Yuuri is specifically crafted as older: her larger bust, her beauty mole near her right eye, and her beige sweater paint her as the more mature person that she is. Kurumi goes wacky. Besides wielding a shovel, her black-and-white sleeves, her purple twin-tails, and her kneepads act as a silly exterior that harbors a more distraught interior. Both girls are certainly interesting, since the personalities they maintain can easily be surmised through the designs they hold.The designs get even more interesting when it comes to Miki and Yuki. For Miki, she is rather plain, wearing the regular school uniform. Her short hair, blue eyes, and small frame give her a gender-neutral design for a reason: she is designed to be the most relatable. Her character goes through emotions that many people in this kind of situation could relate to, so having her appear slightly androgynous makes her more neutral gender-wise and thus more relatable. Yuki, though, takes the cake. Her pink hair, her lavender-and-white outfit, and her white wings on her backpack heavily contrast with not just the environment but also the other girls, making her completely standout. But it is her black hat that encapsulates all that she is. The hat’s little ears are cute yet the colors clearly contrast with her own design, matching the split her mind has undergone. Simultaneously, hats hide heads, concealing what lies beneath them. Yuki “places a hat” on reality through her mental blocking, hiding the truth of the situation to keep herself going. In other words, Yuki’s hat symbolizes her insanity. A hat should be a trivial item for any character, but in Yuki’s case, it provides a profound revelation on her character without having to know much about her. In short, her design is genius.While the actual animation does not reach the same level as Yuki’s character design, it still manages to remain above average throughout the season. Kurumi and Yuki often have the most movement of the bunch, due to the former’s fighting and the latter’s energy. Gakkou Gurashi also likes to employ comical and comic-like bubbles to add cuteness and to stock up on resources for more intensive scenes like those that adopt a grainy filter or when the characters are simply having fun together. Combined with hair ruffling, eye moving, and tail wagging, the anime’s attention to its animation never falters, thereby increasing its total execution.CHARACTERSIn a slice-of-life anime like Gakkou Gurashi, it is arguably the characters that have the most importance since the story being told is not necessarily captivating.

She saw Yuki as weird, and Kurumi and Yuuri as manipulative for keeping Yuki in said weird condition. Rather than goofing around, she felt that their time could be better utilized to continue what she had relegated herself to: surviving and nothing more. But after sending letters on balloons (and pigeons) and reconciling with Taroumaru, she slowly opens up, doing away with her reserved self and establishing relationships with the rest of the cast. Miki comes to follow the story’s main theme of finding the fun in life where none is had. As such, she develops from a lonely, critical young girl into a confident, lively woman, appreciating and understanding that there is more to life than simply surviving. Or as Miki puts it, “I lived, and it was all worthwhile.”At the center of the girls is Megumi. Megumi helped Kurumi, she mentored Yuuri, and she taught Yuki. Also, if it was not for her and keeping the original group together, Miki would never have had the opportunity to become more than she was. Megumi is the rock that connects them all, and through her, the characters’ theme comes to light: not being afraid to rely on others. While Megumi silently watches over them when she does move on, her absence highlights the importance of how nothing can be done alone. Each girl has their strengths and their weaknesses, each girl doing what she can to keep the group going. The group is a circular chain, each loop linked to the next, a missing link deforming the structure. They would not be as successful without each other; Kurumi’s slaying, Yuuri’s aiding, Yuki’s laughing, and Miki’s rationalizing work in tandem to keep their group thriving. They have Megumi to thank for bringing them together but only each other for continuing what she started. And as the conclusion depicts, the girls might have graduated, but they will continue to support and rely on one another no matter what may come.SOUNDThe opening theme is fantastic, encompassing all of the cuteness and adorableness that the anime contains. The fun little beat, the fast lyrics, and the switching vocalists make the piece pleasant to listen to both in and out of the anime. The piece builds up in the beginning, to give way to a catchy and back-and-forth tone that captures the same tempo that the anime also follows.The first ending theme is a mixture of happiness and sadness. The track itself is mellow, with background choirs and ambient sound effects that makes it a simple piece, and therefore a nice way to transition out of most of the episodes. The second ending goes decidedly darker, the chimes and clacking scary-sounding to match the anime’s atmosphere. As the piece proceeds the singer heavily carries the track until the instruments finally appear. Still, the vocalist nails her notes, achieving a finish with range and emotion that coincides with the saddened feel of the show itself. While the second ED does not trump the OP, it easily defeats the first ED, making one wonder why it was not used for the entirety of the season to begin with.The rest of the soundtrack is filled with exactly the types of pieces needed to fit the slice-of-life and horror aspects. The former is filled with xylophones and party tunes that lift the spirits whereas the latter is filled with melancholic piano pieces that lower the mood considerably. Nothing immediately stands out, but the OST performs at the necessary level to make the scenes it is used vibrant and depressing when needed.Voice acting reaches the same level, with solid performances for the cast but nothing downright noteworthy. Inori Minase as Yuki has quite the cute voice to expound her cute nature ten-fold. Mao Ichimichi as Yuuri speaks in a tone that only a mature woman could, fitting her personality well. And a special shout-out to Emiri Katou as Taroumaru for puppy barks and cries that could make anyone say “D’aww.”ENJOYMENTI sound like a monster for saying this, but I sort of wish all of the girls died, or at least all of them but Yuki. A tragic ending would have been poignant, a visceral and harsh reality that would be difficult to stomach after seeing the girls go through so much and have so much fun together. I was robbed of this – “robbed” because I honestly believed going in to the final episode that the anime was going to end on a heart-shattering note – leaving me a bit bitter.I think this is why Taroumaru’s death hit me harder than it should have because they tricked me once more. It seemed like he was hurt, sure, but he was eating and drinking. Then he passed away. At first, I was shaking my head, saddened that he died after everything that had happened. But the real kicker was on the roof. Yuki’s words, “He looked at you and said…’Thank you!’” while the screen flashbacked to Taroumaru’s tiny smile, made me cry right alongside Miki. It was a powerful moment not just because I was attached to the dog but because I could see and hear the pain in Miki’s face and voice. I hate goodbyes (something that frequenters of my material might know), so watching such a heartfelt goodbye escalated how much of a chord this struck with me.The rest of the show was still lovable even if my evil ending never came to fruition. Yuki was an extremely fun character, her undeniable cuteness and her never-ending smile giving her a charm that meshed nicely with her insanity. Again, I sound crazy, but part of the reason why I liked her so much was because she was insane, but now that that has technically been overcome, she loses a quirk to her that made her unique, something I am strangely not okay with. Still, Miki teasing Yuki in the shower about being her “senpai” and Yuki’s expressions matching Taromaru’s always put a smile on my face, so I suppose Yuki accomplished what she set out to do.Yuuri, Kurumi, and Miki were likewise hilarious. Yuuri’s gag with getting overly furious, Kurumi wanting to use “just the blunt end” for catching purposes, and Miki acting adorable whenever Yuki got too close for her comfort almost always gave me some kind of chuckle. Megumi, too, since the group ignoring her made her feel not wanted or respected, leading to some funny reactions on her part. The whole season was a lot of fun – despite all of the despair it contained – with the only other gripe besides the optimistic ending being that I have to patiently wait to see where the School Living Club goes next.Gakkou Gurashi is simultaneously a cutesy and thrilling ride. The narrative’s dichotomous nature, the art’s stellar direction, and the cast’s interesting characterizations create an anime that does reasonably well all around. The opening and ending themes, as well as the emotional moments – of the comedic and dramatic variety – further buffer the show. Life can certainly get one down. But this anime, like Mollie, makes it that much easier to smile.SUMMARYStory: Good, dualities throughout keep the narrative focused and purposeful but a lack of the past tampers the audience’s ability to emotionally connectAnimation: Great, intricate artistic direction keeps the art stunning, character designs are well-done, with Yuki’s being fantastic, and above average actual animationCharacters: Fine, Kurumi is bad, Yuuri is okay, Yuki is good, and Miki is great, with Megumi highlighting the theme of relying on othersSound: Fine, great OP, okay first ED, good second ED, okay OST, solid VA performancesEnjoyment: Good, cute, hilarious, and emotional, but I preferred a more tragic conclusionFinal Score: 7/10', ""If anyone who hasn't heard of this show is looking for a light hearted 'Slice-of-Life' turn around and leave.

The concept of zombies in anime isn't touched all that much other than a certain elephant in the room [Highschool of...The Dead]. But the way this anime portrays it is quite interesting.The main character Yuki Takeya has seen (some shit) things, things that would drive most people to insanity. Yuki copes with this in her own way, by pretending its never happened. This show combines Slice of Life and light hearted conversations with a dark undertone that the apocalypse is happening all the mean while.As the anime comes to a close the apocalypse begins to take more control over the story than the fluffy slice of life- especially in the last episodes. Which are a grim reminder to the group that this is indeed the end of the world, and a foreboding sign to a tragedy is quite apparent if you're paying enough attention.To wrap things up if you want to watch this anime prepare to be sad, there are many elements of it that break you on the inside. From touching last words, to speeches, and everything in between (Including death). This anime may not be interesting to all groups but I hope you, the reader, enjoy it. The Dead].

I have no idea what others are gushing about giving all those 9s and 10s (because of manga? Then give the manga a 9 on 10, don\'t give anime a high grade on merits of the manga when it obviously doesn\'t deserve so!). This feels pretty damn mediocre to me, and DEFINITELY not as an anime of the season. There are far better contenders for that title IMO.Story - goes pretty much nowhere most of the time, there\'s way too much comedic relief and moeblob moments for a supposedly dark theme behind the story. If this is...subverting the zombie horror trope, it\'s not doing it right. I am constantly waiting for the moment when shit hits the fan and everybody needs to (wo)man the fuck up, but it doesn\'t happen at all until far too late into the season, at which point I completely lost any interest in the whole thing. I guess points of ""excitement"" are when Yuki\'s illusion breaks down, but it breaks down very rarely.At first, after episode 2, I though this had the potential of being something really good, going deep into psyche of Yuki (doesn\'t happen) and perhaps others (I guess that happens to an extent, but not enough). But nope. Moeblob slice-of-life. Not sure if that\'s your thing, but if it is, knock yourself out.As mentioned, I\'m constantly waiting for something CONCRETE to happen, some contact with outside world, some proper zombie shoveling (sic), but it just doesn\'t happen, which makes me wonder WTF is the script writer on about?!Art - pretty damn good all around. Wasted talent on a story badly handled.Sound - pretty good overall, but nothing special or something to remember. In the very rare thrilling moments of tension, sound does beef up the atmosphere nicely.Character - characters are pretty typical all around. Little to no development in any of them. We get some backstories, but that doesn\'t count as character development. Color me unimpressed here. Worst thing of all was the damn dog eating way too much screen time, artificially creating compassion - I didn\'t buy it. In fact it made me not care about the cast at all, so anything that could possibly happen to them, I wouldn\'t even blink. Just badly handled character writing.Enjoyment - I guess the only thing with which this anime managed to shock me is its complete lack of direction. It\'s quite hermetic, much like the main cast being trapped in that school. Shit, they had the ""outing"" episode, couldn\'t they drive that car farther away, try to go to another town, try to get some PROPER help? Nooooope, let\'s go back to school. Woo fucking hoo.I guess the only thing this anime somehow manages to make me is keep watching to see if something is finally going to fucking happen. And by the looks of it, next episode (ep 9) is going to somehow be a bikini episode. Wow. If I wanted that kind of fanservice, I\'d go watch Highschool Of The Dead. Even that has a better zombie story in its background!After watching the anime through, I\'ve left with a fairly sour taste in my mouth. Out of 12 episodes seen, I could count 4  or perhaps 5 that are absolutely worth watching, everything else is condensed filler the story would work completely well without.Overall - I am pretty underwhelmed.

I\'m sure they\'ll love it.(There will be SPOILERS in my review)[Story]: (7/10) (SPOILERS)Takeya Yuki is in love with the school. For her, it\'s a wonderful place, where she enjoys school activities, especially the activities of her club: School Life Club.Just like all the slice-of-life animes, nothing really happens in this show. All they do is laugh around, fool around like a typical high-school students, drink tea, participate in club activities, swim around in a pool and our protagonist chasing around a cute dog. That\'s...literally it, I can\'t expand on this anymore. Ok, think of the show as like K-On except the characters are different. The 2 shows are almost the same. Yuki = Yui, Kurumi = Azusa, Miki = Mio, Megu-nee = Sawako, you get the point. It\'s just a nice, soothing, relaxing anime that relieved my stress from real-life.Ok, I\'m done with the sarcasms. School Live! is in no way a cutesy slice-of-life show. The characters are actually living in a post-apocalyptic world where almost everyone is a zombie and the main characters barricaded themselves in a school. The first episode that was shown to us is just a big troll, showing us the typical high school life and the characters having fun. Basically, like Madoka except there\'s no magical girls here. There\'s a huge reason why that slice-of-life scene was shown in the first episode. It isn\'t just to shock the viewers. Well, that\'s one of the reasons but the main reason is it\'s got something to do with the Main Character\'s mentality. I\'ll explain more in the ""Characters"" categoryAfter the first episode, the show didn\'t really move forward. The entire first half of the show were flashbacks of how the epidemic started, how the characters got involved in it in the first place, and how they all met each other. I personally think the show did a great job building the characters in the first half.The second half of the show finally had the plot moving forward. They just show us how the characters cope with the mess that they\'re in and how they\'re living their everyday lives in a post apocalyptic world. In other words, it\'s just like I\'m watching a regular slice-of-life anime...except with zombies. I like the slice-of-life scenes. It portrays how the characters keeps their sanity after all the sh*t that they went through and how they keep having fun despite the fact that they\'re in a post-apocalyptic world. .There was one plot twist in the second half of the show that made me go ""Holy Mother of Jesus Christ"". This is honestly one of the best plot twists in the show. Before the plot twist occurs, watch out for Megu-nee and how the characters act around her.One last thing that I want to point out is the show\'s effective use of foreshadowing. Posting a picture would be a lot better but I\'ll just write a bunch of examples. Most of my examples were in the first episode. Firstly, the windows. Secondly, the cross at the school roof garden. Thirdly, the girls were worried about Yuki wandering around the school in broad daylight with a bunch of students. Fourth and lastly, the main characters didn\'t pay that much attention nor were they worried about Megu-nee that much. There are more Megu-nee foreshadowings but I\'m done.After all the positive points that I mentioned above, How could I rate the story a 7 you ask? The ending of the show killed it for me. It wasn\'t because of Tarumarou\'s death..It was because of that one scene. That one particular scene that I completely hate. That scene where they were supposed to die but Yuki pulled a ""deus-ex machina"" making all the zombies leave the school. They could have done it some other way but the way they did it in the anime was just complete bullsh*t to me. Some of you might think otherwise but this is how I feel about the ending.______________________________________________________________[Art/Animation]: (9/10)So who animated School Live?.......Lerche? I don\'t know that studio. Anyways, they did a great job with the show\'s visuals and animations. Especially the dark atmosphere that they were showing off. The zombie designs...ehh, looks ok. Not the scariest I\'ve ever seen but were they supposed to be scary in the first place? The character designs looks so ""moe"" but I\'m pretty sure they designed the characters like that on purpose.______________________________________________________________[Sound]: (8/10)I gotta say, the soundtrack that they used for both slice-of-life scenes and dark scenes was amazing. You guys already know how a theme should sound like whenever a slice-of-life scene is playing so I don\'t have to mention the slice-of-life themes. The themes used for the dark scenes, however, legitimately scared the shit out of me. Note that I decided to watch the show at night so when they revealed the post-apocalyptic world that they live in, I couldn\'t sleep for the whole night. It\'s like a happy background theme then suddenly, it becomes slow. You know, like one of those scary-ass nursery rhyme songs. Now the OP and ED theme song.The OP theme song is ""Friend Shitai"" by Gakuen Seikatsubu and the ED theme songs are  ""Harmonize Clover"" by Maon Kurosaki, ""We took each other\'s hand"" by Kaori Sawada and ""Afterglow"" by Maon Kurosaki. The OP theme song is one huge troll. The song is all happy and rainbows and it only fit in the first episode. As for the ED theme songs, I only liked the first one. The first ED theme song sounds like a dramatic song foreshadowing the character\'s fate. Except their fate was different than I expected. The 2nd ED theme song sounds decent. If it weren\'t for the singer, I would have liked it. Although, it was a nice song to use after a certain someone ""died"".______________________________________________________________[Characters]: (9/10)I feel like this is where the show shined...The characters.We have Yuki, the main character suffering from her own delusions because of the incident that occurred with Megu-ne. I honestly broke down when I saw what state of mentality Yuki is in. It\'s like she\'s suffering from the 5 stages of grief and hasn\'t moved past the first stage for a very long time.There\'s actually a reason....a good reason why Yuki is still delusional and hasn\'t accepted the fact that they\'re now in a post apocalyptic world and that Megu-ne is gone. Let me ask something..Is it wrong for the characters to keep Yuki in that state? If I were to answer this question, I would say no. I mean, the whole reason why the characters are still normal is because of her. The characters feared that by telling her the truth, it would cause Yuki to enter in a state of a long long depression. Without Yuki bringing fun to the group, they would all be insane right now. Some of you might think the characters were being selfish for keeping Yuki in that mental state. Honestly, there\'s no right answers to my question. It all depends on your morality.Then we have the rest of the main characters which are Kurumi, an energetic girl and the only character on the group who can fight off the zombies. Then there\'s Miki, also the student of Megurigaoka Private High School and was found by Yuki\'s group on the mall. She has a friend named Kei and her whereabouts are unknown. Then there\'s Yuuri, the leader of the club (group) and most mature character in the group. Finally, there\'s Megu-nee, who suffered the most unfortunate fate in the show. What I like about the characters is the way they act and think which are almost realistic.______________________________________________________________[Enjoyment]: (8/10)For the most part, I enjoyed the show not only for it\'s slice-of-life moments but also because of the shock and fear factor of the show. I wish I could say the same thing for the ending episode.______________________________________________________________[VERDICT]""School Live!"" is a good survival anime that portrays the characters in an almost realistic way and also explores the main character\'s mental state. The shock and fear factor of the show is also one of the one of the reasons why I enjoyed the show. Unfortunately, the show suffered from a ""Happy Ending Syndrome"". I don\'t have a big problem with the happy endings but if that\'s where the story seems to be going then stick with it instead of bringing in some magical god just so he can bless the characters with unbelievable powers that they can use to escape the inescapable situation.[OVERALL]: (8/10)Pros:+Great Story for the majority of the series+Great Visuals and Animations+Scary Dark Atmosphere+Great Soundtrack+Theme used for the scary parts of the show are legit scary+Characters are portrayed almost realistically+First half used to build the character+Effective use of ForeshadowingCons:-""Happy Ending Syndrome""-Some Unnecessary Fanservice Scenes. literally it, I can\'t expand on this anymore.

This is an anime that you should not judge by its cover, I was hooked after the first episode having never read the manga, and I loved this anime. I came closer to crying more so than, I can remember out of any movie, book or show that I have seen. And that is not form the plot or story being unbearable, I am not going to say more so as to not do the whole spoiler alert.  It completely restored and repaired the damage that had been done to my love of the zombie genre. All of the...shows and cut rate just plain awful zombie movies and shows that have flooded the market in the last few years had all but made me want to give up on the whole zombie genre, I have been a fan since I was a child and watched the Romero films the original dawn and day of the dead. Then came the fad that people realized that a zombie movie was the cheaper of the horror movies to make and the market was flooded with crap, beginning with the remake of day of the dead. Then the walking dead went and turned the whole plot line into something like an American soap opera, there is a time to end a story, instead of dragging it way beyond any kind of sense. But with that being said I would love to see at least one more season of gakkou gurashi! the content is there in the manga the introduction to other characters and more plot, this one deserves another season a lot more than the 22nd season of the walking dead. shows and cut rate just plain awful zombie movies and shows that have flooded the market in the last few years had all but made me want to give up on the whole zombie genre, I have been a fan since I was a child and watched the Romero films the original dawn and day of the dead.

For this review I will be focusing on story, Characters and my enjoyment. [In order for me to write this review, I will have to give out a spoiler since a major plot twist happens in the first episode]Story:The story of gakkougurashi is fairly simple. A zombie apocalypse takes place and traps a group of students in a school house. However the twist is that the protagonist sees the world as if everything around her is normal. I loved this show! the story telling was remarkable and some moments were so effective that I was...genuinely crying. If you are looking forward to shedding a tear or two then give gakkougurashi a try.Characters:The characters of gakkougurashi are very likable. This show likes to do a little thing with it's characters. At the beginning, this show gets you to adore it's characters with some very cute and playful scenes, and then afterwards as the story progresses, the show puts it's characters into dangerous situations. Even if the character is a zombie, the show will make you care so much for that zombie that you wouldn't know who to root for.Enjoyement: I enjoyed Gakkougurashi, a lot and I am not forgetting it any time sooner. The only problem I had with this show is the puppy, there was this puppy in this show who was very cute, but the puppy was stupid. He was the cause for a lot of the situations that the main characters were put into. Every time the puppy would wander of on his own and the characters would need to find him. However I cared for the puppy more than I expected to, towards the end. genuinely crying.

Too moe that I got a nosebleed!Well...Until you see the end of the first episode.It may seem like a moeblob anime, but actually, it's a horror anime with cute girls fighting against zombies... Except for one girl. Her name is Yuki Takeya. She sees school as a normal school with students... No zombies... No dangerous thingies! So basically, she's a happy-go-lucky girl with no problems with life. While she go imagine the school as a happy thing, her friends play along with her while they're fighting off...zombies. She totally does nothing. Except for the last episode I guess.The story is pretty good, it had many good cliffhangers and plot twists.Art is good because it's made in 2015. Obviously.Opening was one of the things that I kept my eyes on as it changes after something interesting happen!Ending was good too. However.The characters are pretty interesting, their traits are pretty different than any anime since it's horror.I enjoyed it a lot. But still,I gave it a 8 for Yuki. zombies.

But the one that mainly stood out to me was GakkouGurashi. This anime was getting a lot of praise and a few of my friends were telling me to watch it. So one day, I sat down and turned on the first episode.The first thing I noticed was that this was a moeblob anime. There are a lot of those out there so I was already wondering why this one stood out the most. It...was cute, funny and enjoyable. But once I saw  the end of the first episode, I realized why this stood out. I was left shocked, freaked out, but continued to watch the show. And by god was it worth it.GakkouGurashi tells the story of Yuki, who lives at her school with her friends Kurumi, Yurri, Miki and their teacher  Sakura in the School Living club.

However,it gets better as the episodes go on. This anime is good, and is enjoyable. Its only 12 episodes, but the manga is still ongoing so if you are done with the anime read  the manga.Story Line9/10-NO SPOILERS. Yuki is a young girl living in a school with her friends, Kurumi, Miki, and Yuuri. they all part of a school living club. Yuki is in love with school, well in her head. Why? Find out. In her school, nothing is human....The story line is confusing. However, its a...clever idea. Having a Slice of Life anime have a Horror story line is crazy. But it worked. Its enjoyable, and silly. The story line switches with dark mature themes, to happy, cute themes. That is wierd, and thats why the story is a 9 instend of a 10, but its still fun to watch.Characters9/10-There arent many characters in this anime, only 4 main ones. However thats not even close to say that their bad. The 4 main characters are all girls, but their funny, cute, and can be brave at times. They all help each other, and try to stay strong when something bad has happen. The character delvopment is good, but not the best. At least they are all fun characters. One of the characters, Miki, has a really upsetting back story, which makes her one of the best characters.Sound Track9/10-This anime has a very good amount of music. The opening theme is good, very catchy. Almost all of the music fits the anime very well. Gakkou Gurashi! has a sound track that is catchy, and cute. Like the anime. The dark music is creepy, and could be better, because it isnt the best.(Not because its creepy, but because it isnt that great).Art10/10-Gakkou Gurashi! has amazing colors. The bright colors fits the characters perfectly. The The dark colors fit the dark, upsetting part of the anime very well. The character design is great, and is very well made.(It fits the characters well).

But its combination is rare, a Dark Slice of Life anime.The story introduced themselves as a Little Light in the Dark, at least it\'s not the typical Slice of Life Moe, but the psychological trauma, and their emotional support to each other makes this anime better than most of the Slice of Life Moe series.The story is very predictable, the setting is light, with few action and psychological scene, but the only thing that I can\'t...predict is the realization of DelusionsThe pacing is really good, they were able adapt it well to fit the anime timeline.Though I thought it was dark, but it\'s 70% Light and 30% dark. And the slice of life will make you smile, but that smile will disappear when the trouble comes, with few suspense, action, psychological action(the use of sound to evade zombies)So far, I\'ve only seen Flashback, Deus ex machina(only once for Miki Naoki), Foreshadowing, Plot twist, First-person Narration and the best Ticking clock scenario, as their literary techniques(from wiki).The ending is not the Best, but it was able to close the anime(with the Front 13, Back 9[just search it on google]) To be Honest, I watched the last episode on RAW, but that will not hinder the Last episode review. Honestly It ended like Angel Beats, but the most interesting in the last episode, They Have used their Feeling and Emotions to Drive out the Zombies(which is illogical) and there\'s also an Epic Scene where A Hero will die not as a Zombie, but as a Hero(just decipher it in your own) If you\'re fond of Philosophical(if you can grasp it, then you\'re with me.) Slice of Life(moe) with a Zombie(I can\'t call it horror nor dark, it\'s really light) then you will love this.- Art - 5 [they hold back on its gore and dark aspects]The art is Moe, a child like anime characters despite of their age.But I think the Mangaka tried to express Cute little characters in dangerous situation with horrified faces, but was able to Smile and to be Happy even in the amidst of the Effects and dangers the ChaosAt least the art was able to make it GORE, but it\'s still lacking, and the Anime focused on the Cute side of it.There\'s a mixed CGI on it, the cars, but nothing more.The anime was able to adapt better in terms of Art Quality, but in terms of Dark Originality of it, they were able to produce the 70% in the anime.Throughout the episode 1-11, they were able to maintain smooth art.The background is really GOOD, that\'s one of the best art in this series, it\'s really bloody, they didn\'t hold back in the background.The character design is MOE, They were able to meet the standard of it, but the irony of this production, they are the ones who makesRanpo Kitan: Game of Laplace and made Danganronpa which is the same as Horror but the opposite of MOE.The Character Design is not unique, they are MOE, or child like character but the age is different, though it\'s common in our country(it\'s full of lolis here)- Sound - 3 [there\'s nothing Horror at All, it\'s just for MOE]The Voice Actress were able to make the Cutest voice in this anime.And they don\'t need to adapt for the role they were given.But I think the Voice Actress have Improved, but a little in this anime.But it would be fun, if the non-japanese VA can play this with a cute voice.But the background music is not the best in this anime, it was good in Slice of Life scenes, but not on Horror or Thrilling scenes, they\'ve used Diminished chords or the Devil Chords but the Infra Sound, or the Feel sound is not used, and One Punch Man BGM is way better in terms of Horror.I always try to catch the music and hears its expression, but for this one, it still lacks, it\'s more like a Deep Thought Provoking Sound rather than Horror.I think I will used their OST or BGM for Thought Provoking Mangas.I like the opening, it\'s light and Fluffy, and The ending is Dramatic which fits the mood after watching a Light mixed Dark element in an episode.And in terms of OP/ED, Though I can Listen to it, it\'s not catchy, if you want to repeat the op, but the ed is ok to add in my phone. But as a Musician, the op and the ed are not catchy, or it\'s not worth for playing it for a Cover. I would love to make an AMV for this using Rock with Dark and Metal Elements on it.- Characters - 5 [MOE girls are Developed, but only on the last 2 EP]The Characters are very well done, they have strengths and Resolves to live, their only weakness is Flashbacks of Tragedy and Psychological Disorder or Delusional disorder. But the normal weakness for the people, Zombie Trauma, is not present here.The characters were able to portray realistic actions in the zombie apocalypse situation, but at the same time, they were able to Smile and Laugh, which is not Present for the many people who lives in this world.I can relate to the characters, Unlike Games and Manga that Uses Guns, Bats, and other tools to kill zombies, They have used the Sound to evade Zombies, which is the best when it comes to Survival Tactic. They were able to Support their Emotional Needs, which is one of the Best message in this series, which lacks in many people that lives in reality. And the best so far: Be Happy in times of Chaos, which is illogical. But also my personality in real life.The characters did improved, but it\'s just a small factor in terms of Character Development, but they can adapt in the situation very fast.Only Four people are currently present in this Anime.And their enemies, of coarse the Zombies, which made the Clock Ticking Scenario.There\'s no supporting character that lives, but for a single Girl.They\'ve only used First Person Narration, or the characters shown in the screen in the scene that are present are the ones who narrate themselves.I disliked the taste of the majority of japanese boys, which is MOE[cute girls], But for the Characters in this anime, I liked them so much, that they were able to show the Philosophical Value of Happiness in times of Trouble, which is the situation they lived in.Though I think I will forget about them, because I\'m not into MOE- Enjoyment - 4 [not into light if it has dark elements on it]Those people who loves Cute Girls with an Aspect of School, Slice of Life, will love this. But for the people who Loves Horror, Mystery, Psychological, will not love this, They can watch this, but not as a their taste, and most of them Will hate this anime. But for a Person who watches Anime that Loves to apply things from an anime in Real Life situations, then this is a masterpiece, they were able to show LIGHT in the DARK, and there\'s only one ""Deus ex Machina"" present here(ex. One Punch Man)This is anime is good for newbies in both Horror and Anime, but not for Horror lovers.I think I will not re-watch the whole anime, but for the sake of its Philosophical Values, I will watch some scenes that has epic lines and quotes.I think it is still enjoyable to re-watch the whole anime, but for me, I have to look for another anime.It\'s better to remember it as a LIGHT MOE ANIME. than DARK MOE ANIME, it\'s good but It\'s still lacks in many ways to call this a Great Anime.It\'s good as a cup of tea for Horror, Mystery, Psychological lovers and it\'s intense for School, Slice of Life lovers. but As a person who watches anime for Real Life situation, then this is really good in terms Lessons that can be applied in Real Life Situations, like when you have to Adapt quickly in times of trouble, Psychological Recovery, if you\'re not really happy in your current life, because of many problems, and Lastly, is to SMILE in the times of Disaster and its effect.- Overall - 4 [decent show with few philosophical values yet...]This anime was able to its four elements in a Decent Way, but it should have been Better if the ART and the SOUND was able to portray the mood. The Horror aspects is Missing that could Have Been better because of the ART and SOUND that were underestimated. I Judge According to How it was Done, not Story and Characters Only. This is a Decent Anime which I rate 4/10 or not BAD on how it was DONE.- Worth - 4 [worth for being cute, that\'s all]This is an Over Rated Anime, because of its surprise that it brought to us, but I think we have to lessen that Deserving praise. In terms of Logical rating, I would give this 4/10, which was able to bring some thing new yet unsatisfied results for me. But in terms of Real Life Lessons and Application(treat the zombies as your problems) then I would give this a High Rating, I would give it an 6/10 which deserves it. It\'s up to you if you want to watch it.  It\'s an Anime for those who has soft spots for cute girls.My Real Thoughts are the ones on the [ words input ] I Don\'t want to change it any longer, It\'s gonna take long before I changed It... predict is the realization of DelusionsThe pacing is really good, they were able adapt it well to fit the anime timeline.Though I thought it was dark, but it\'s 70% Light and 30% dark.

But for a Person who watches Anime that Loves to apply things from an anime in Real Life situations, then this is a masterpiece, they were able to show LIGHT in the DARK, and there\'s only one ""Deus ex Machina"" present here(ex. One Punch Man)This is anime is good for newbies in both Horror and Anime, but not for Horror lovers.I think I will not re-watch the whole anime, but for the sake of its Philosophical Values, I will watch some scenes that has epic lines and quotes.I think it is still enjoyable to re-watch the whole anime, but for me, I have to look for another anime.It\'s better to remember it as a LIGHT MOE ANIME. than DARK MOE ANIME, it\'s good but It\'s still lacks in many ways to call this a Great Anime.It\'s good as a cup of tea for Horror, Mystery, Psychological lovers and it\'s intense for School, Slice of Life lovers. but As a person who watches anime for Real Life situation, then this is really good in terms Lessons that can be applied in Real Life Situations, like when you have to Adapt quickly in times of trouble, Psychological Recovery, if you\'re not really happy in your current life, because of many problems, and Lastly, is to SMILE in the times of Disaster and its effect.- Overall - 4 [decent show with few philosophical values yet...]This anime was able to its four elements in a Decent Way, but it should have been Better if the ART and the SOUND was able to portray the mood. The Horror aspects is Missing that could Have Been better because of the ART and SOUND that were underestimated. I Judge According to How it was Done, not Story and Characters Only. This is a Decent Anime which I rate 4/10 or not BAD on how it was DONE.- Worth - 4 [worth for being cute, that\'s all]This is an Over Rated Anime, because of its surprise that it brought to us, but I think we have to lessen that Deserving praise. In terms of Logical rating, I would give this 4/10, which was able to bring some thing new yet unsatisfied results for me. But in terms of Real Life Lessons and Application(treat the zombies as your problems) then I would give this a High Rating, I would give it an 6/10 which deserves it. It\'s up to you if you want to watch it.  It\'s an Anime for those who has soft spots for cute girls.My Real Thoughts are the ones on the [ words input ] I Don\'t want to change it any longer, It\'s gonna take long before I changed It...', ""In a world of trailers, promos, and an especially-quick grapevine, it's nearly impossible to go into a show or movie without knowing its general premise, or even possible spoilers. Upon hearing  a recommendation, most would first do the research to determine whether the time commitment is worth it. While this is an understandable practice, for Gakkougurashi (School Live!), I suggest you resist this urge and start watching the first episode knowing as little as possible. I offer only my strong recommendation to watch at least the twenty minutes of slice-of-life with the Living-At-School Club in episode one, without stopping. If you are against the...episodic nature of slice-of-life, know that this anime is more story-based. If you are completely unimpressed after that, it's probably not worth your time. If you are still on the fence, I'd suggest you watch at least six episodes before making your verdict.Personally, I went in with this much knowledge, and it greatly enhanced my viewing experience. While many of the good things I have to say about Gakkougurashi do not depend on this at all, I do believe that when consuming entertainment, one would want to, well, maximize their capacity to be entertained. Now, if you haven't watched it yet, please do not read any further. Happy viewing!https://animekisa.tv/gakkou-gurashi!-episode-1~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~No review could possibly be written for this show without addressing episode one. A common criticism is that the “reveal” at the end comes off as some kind of “shock,” much like the theatrics shown in the pilot episode of Re:Zero. I argue the opposite: while it may come as a large contrast, if you were paying attention to certain quirks in the earlier parts of the episode, it’s not a terribly surprising result. Slightly off-putting details such as the barricade, hardtack, or even the premise of the Living-At-School Club itself are laced out like a trail of breadcrumbs, planted as uncertain seeds in your mind to be confirmed. If you rewatch the episode, the contrasting reality can actually better explain what you are seeing initially.For GakkouGurashi, the devil is in the details. There are two (maybe three) definitive “twists” in these twelve episodes, but, as aforementioned, they come across more as “creeping realizations” that are confirmed. The pacing on these realizations is excellent — they don’t come out of the blue, but they also leave trust to the viewer, not suffering the classic anime pitfall of making things painfully obvious by literally explaining everything to you. It is for this reason that I think “going in blind” greatly contributes to your enjoyment, as you can experience the satisfaction of realizing yourself the nature of certain quirks.While I encourage you to watch Gakkou as I prescribed to properly enjoy these “reveals,” it is but one enhancement you can make to augment your viewing experience. The show makes a clear effort to address any subconscious questions that would otherwise be called a “plot hole” or an “oversight.” Sometimes they are directly answered by the progression of the show; sometimes they are acknowledged, but left in the open in a way that suggests it will be answered further down the line. Again, I think this a great boon for the show; it leaves the viewer to simmer in the implications it presents, but not in a manner too perplexing. It is a feat that requires a great attention to detail.This attention to detail is universal for the show’s production, not just the story or pacing. The art needs to be solid in order to provide for the visual contrast that is usually the first thing recognized by the viewer. The music may sometimes eerily warp to alert the viewer that something is amiss. The opening famously changes its backdrop every episode to better reflect the reality revealed by the plot’s progression, but even in the lyrics or the title of the song, there are hidden double meanings (e.g. “Shitai”, which can also mean corpse). I regard *that* scene in episode six as one of the greatest scenes I’ve ever watched: the setup: the unraveling of the setting, Yuki’s terrifying, colorless eyes, and the off-key music, combined with the crashing realization that proceeds. To reiterate, the devil is in the details.Gakkou is not without flaws. For example, I think it’s understandable that you find this show intolerable if you cannot stand moe, CGDCT, etc., as some of the contrasting slice-of-life scenes are very much so befitting that genre. Since I’ve watched quite a bit of slice-of-life, this is probably something I would’ve dropped if it wasn’t for technical details and poignant contrast. Personally, I was hooked after seeing the girls think that hardtack was delicious in the first episode. However, I wouldn’t even say that details or theatrics are Gakkou’s greatest strength.These theatrics, if not supplemented by meaningful content, are just that — theatrics. The show would more closely align with my opinions of most modern shounen if it were just a loosely correlated amalgamation of well-produced, animated plot devices — meaningless. We revisit a question from watching the first episode: Why are we shown a zombie apocalypse show disguised as a slice-of-life in the first place? Is there any purpose to this other than being edgy?The answer to this, as you may realize while watching the show, is in the psychology of the characters. We are constantly juxtaposed the slice-of-life genre against horror as a result of Yuki being, for lack of a better word, delusional. And we quickly realize that viewing a bleak survival situation as Living-at-School Club is a coping mechanism for not only Yuki, but the other girls as well. For me, Gakkou addressed two major metaphysical points:The first is how human nature really reacts to such circumstances: cowardly for the most part. Yuki’s cope is disheartening to watch given dramatic irony as the episodes progress, but it is believable with a completely valid explanation. What’s more interesting is how her peers not only tolerate, but necessitate, this farce themselves to keep a routine and survive. The characters themselves acknowledge that they would’ve given up a long time ago if it weren’t for the club. This sad reality of human nature is a breath of fresh air in anime, where characters such as Eren and Mikasa at the start of their character arc seem to quickly gain a sense of fearlessness in the face of death. While I think Attack on Titan actually does a good job with this portrayal overall, it’s not properly fleshed out in the way that Gakkou does with its main characters: showing the girls’ initial reaction, their response to cope, and moving on from that.This segues nicely into my second point, which is how we confront reality. It takes Yuki and her original group many harsh reminders to gain a sense of urgency: finding another classmate, water contamination, and Kurumi getting bitten. At some point, we have to leave our bubble, and sometimes, life doesn’t wait for us to get comfortable first. Our characters in Gakkou have to fight their PTSD, fear, and penchant for normalcy to gain the courage to move forward. Yuki especially must grow from her carefree attitude, and this is the difficult character progression journey portrayed in the show. I’d always wondered how a character like Yui from “K-On!’ would truly react to an icy reality far from their discernable comfort value, and Gakkou certainly provides an interesting take.These were themes that personally stood out to me, but they may differ for you. Characters just ... grow, instead of talk about growing in a post-arc monologue like Aesop’s Fables. That means we, the viewers, are free to interpret what the creator has given us. Gakkou presents the story in masterful fashion, with clear psychological underpinnings, but it is up to you to determine meaning from it. episodic nature of slice-of-life, know that this anime is more story-based.

By taking two different items and setting them against each other, it can multiply the overall value and effect of the product versus those two items being standalone. It can make paintings have a captivating appearance, give food a memorable flavor, and, in the case of movies and television, give a unique experience that makes it stick to the minds of the audiences watching. There is, however, a catch to this: the right amount of each item must be balanced against each...other lest one overpower the other or it turn away potential customers/viewers/etc. So how does the use of contrast affect the anime School-Live? The answer is important - after all, it\'s what the entire show hinges on.School-Live is an anime that wishes to contrast two different atmospheres, cute and creepy, in its 12 episode runtime. It combines a cute high-school slice of life show with that of a zombie apocalypse. The reveal that there\'s horror in something charming is sometimes hidden from the viewer to make the turn of events more shocking, but in the case of School-Live, it\'s its worst kept secret. The show\'s synopsis, poster, and tags all give away what\'s happening. Even before the big reveal, it\'s pretty clear that something\'s wrong inside the show\'s world.  That said, the show\'s use of zombies isn\'t really where the main focus lies. Instead, it uses this as a tool to test the survival, and psychological skills, of our main protagonists.Each character is given a slight role to the group. Kurumi is the twin-tailed fighter of the group and uses her trusty shovel to fight off the occasional zombie rush. Yuuri serves as an organization leader of the group and is shown keeping down a list of supplies as well as ""approve"" of certain events. Miki is the newcomer and though she is the youngest of the group of girls, she is the smartest and most practical of the group. Finally, there\'s Yuki, the chipper voice of morale and mascot of the show. A black hat with cat ears is worn over her head filled with ideas of what to do during the group\'s downtime. Together they make the ""School-Life"" club, a club dedicated to doing what they can to ""help"" other groups and make school the best place to be. The price for this dedication is to stay on school grounds at all times, but considering what\'s going on outside, it can hardly be considered a downside.Of course, the club the 4 girls form isn\'t really an official club - rather, it\'s the way that they help keep their sanity in check. The supernatural fear outside combined with the claustrophobic environment inside can get to a person, so pretending to have ever-popular school events such as a sports day and field trips can break the monotony of survival. This is where the show wishes to use its contrast. It shows a typical school life setting against the fear of a horrific death. Every event is limited not by a school budget or time, but rather what the girls have on hand. Throw in the chance of something horrific happening during each day in their fortress and you\'ve got a show that certainly finds a place for itself.Those looking for a chance to see some intense girl-on-zombie fighting will be sorely disappointed. Sure, Kurumi swings a shovel a few times but it never focuses on the action. Instead, it offers two alternatives: goofing off and twisted tales. The former is to deliver the ""cute"" half of the show\'s contrast (as well as attract the audience who enjoy idle, silly fun). The latter is the core strength of the show, as we get to see how these girls truly feel about the events that have occurred and the fears of what the future may bring. Yuki is the obvious choice for this category, as she simply pretends nothing went wrong and thinks every day is another fun and fantastic day at school. I do find her to be a bit immature, though. She\'s a senior in high school, and yet I feel like I\'m watching a kids show when she performs her antics. Miki is for my money the best of the cast. Her story is a personal one, much like the others, but the emotions feel amplified as a result of the lack of interactions she gets as well as the isolation she has from the rest of the world. The main cast get a school and make up fun activities - during Miki\'s origins, we get none of that and instead get a greater fear of the unknown. It\'s arguably the greatest moment of the show.With these details in mind, does School-Live find a balance between its two genres? For some viewers it does, but I can\'t say it did for me. The show has a habit of pointing out a few flaws in their own show but ultimately struggle to answer them. The biggest example of this include part of the field trip episode. There\'s danger looming all around and, especially later in the show, a fear of supply management as resources start to dwindle down. Yet there\'s enough time for swimsuits to be tried on. The excuse ""We are girls, after all"" doesn\'t really work here and suggests that the show is also trying to attract an audience via alternative means. A better strategy would be to stock up on more of the zombie\'s weaknesses (sound and light based items, such as glowsticks and child alarms).  Another example stems from how coincidental everything is. With the school\'s vast amount of natural resources,  it definitely feels apt for survival. This seems to be hinted at something greater, but not enough detail is given. A good question to answer would be how long do the zombies live for? Right now, I am to believe they are immortal unless they are explicitly killed. In the end, it\'s a supernatural story so anything the author wants can be put into place. This latter point is only minor, since this is the first part of the story. However, a little enticement for the future can go a long way with keeping people interested - it comes off as more credible than trying on swimsuits.The ultimate issue will lie with the audience. I enjoy some slice-of-life but it\'s not a genre I can say is my favorite. Sure, it\'s cute watching the girls run around and make stupid jokes, but I really don\'t gain too much from it. I\'d much rather see a form of progress across the city or more of what\'s happened with the world rather than be confined in the halls of the school. Considering that\'s half of the show\'s appeal, it\'s quite clear that I\'m not meant for the show\'s audience. That said, it\'d be foolish for me not to admit it\'s a necessary evil. Had the show entirely be focused on the mystery and horror, it probably would\'ve received more criticisms of shock value and wouldn\'t have found as large a fanbase. That\'s really the takeaway of using the contrast strategy - the balance in the creator\'s eye may be imbalanced in the eye\'s of the viewer. That\'s why we all have different likes and dislikes, after all.The animation studio behind School-Live is Lerche. There are a few shortcuts here and there (the CG zombies in one scene being the #1 shortcut) but they do a fairly good job. Bright, cutesy colors for when everything\'s fine and shades of purple, black and dull gray for when zombies are involved. Arguably the scariest thing about this show may be the character\'s eyes - their irises are a bright ring that contains a dark colored pupil. They\'re sort of unsettling to look at. The music for the show consists of goofy, lighthearted pieces and some dramatic tones - mood music, mainly. It sports a catchy OP ""Friend Shitai"" and a relaxed ED ""Harmonize Clover"" to end episodes on a lighter note (with the tongue-in-cheek ""Good Night"" displayed after the end of early episodes). The real grab would be the moody piano piece ""We took each other\'s hand"", used perfectly for Miki\'s scenes and again amplifying her backstory. The voice acting is also good. The seiyuus know how to deliver a dramatic scene or a scream when needed. Yuki\'s is a bit too ""bubbly"" for me, but it\'s appropriate for her character.Overall, I give School-Live a 6/10. It\'s a show that\'s not for everyone - again, this is a show for people who want a slice-of-life AND a bit of psychological horror. If you\'re more in the former camp and don\'t mind a darker show, this will probably be the anime for you. If you\'re more in the latter camp, I\'d advise to pass on this one unless you need something a bit lighter, as strange as that sounds. School-Live is a short and interesting watch that shows that even a strange contrast can give a show staying power.Do you like or dislike this anime?

If you haven\'t watched it, are you encouraged to watch it or not? Leave a comment on my profile telling me what you think of the anime and/or my review.Thanks for reading and have a blessed day!', 'I recently re-watched school-live, and honestly I enjoyed it just as much as I did the fist time and thought I might as well make a review on it. This is my first review so please bear with me lol, and this review will contain spoilers for the end of episode 1.Story- 8Zombie apocalypse is a premise that has been done many times before, but school-live differs from the standard ordeal by presenting itself to just be a cute school slice of life at first. I think that the way this twist was done was very effective, leaving only tiny hints in the majority of...the first episode to the true nature of the series, before revealing it all at the end. There are several more plot twists throughout the series, and although upon re-watch they are more predictable, the execution of them is fantastic. The show also has very good foreshadowing, which is again more noticeable upon re-watch.However, there are some parts of the show that may seem filler like to some, for example there\'s one episode where most of it is just the main cast going swimming. In my opinion, it strengthened the viewers attachment to the characters, making the following episodes more emotional, but overall there were only a few minutes that contributed to the actual plot. There are also some moments that can be seen as plot convenience, especially part of the ending was underwhelming as the solution to the problem at hand was so simple.I do have a problem with Miki being introduced in the first episode instead of later on, I think it would\'ve been better paced if it started with Yuki, Kurumi, Yuuri and Megumi at first, then introduce Miki in a future episode.Art/Animation- 7Although nothing stellar, I believe that cute, ""moe"" art style worked really well and juxtaposed the dark theme of the show. The character designs are very nice and suited each characters personality. When the show got darker in tone, the art reflected that which was appreciated, and the visuals for the opening gradually got darker which made for a nice touch. There really isn\'t much to say about the animation, nothing amazing but not bad either, just standard, and fortunately it was consistent.Sound-9I really loved the soundtrack for this anime, it had both upbeat but also mellow tunes, used accurately which contributed to the atmosphere the show was going for. Personally, my favourite track was ""We took each other\'s hand"". It\'s a beautiful track that was also used in one of the credits, and was first used during Miki\'s backstory. The vocals are soothing and the lyrics have a meaning behind them, also relating to some themes of the anime. In contrast to this, you have ""Mezame no Waltz"", an upbeat track used throughout the series, usually in the more slice-of-life parts. This track to me is a nice change of pace from the overall grim tone of the anime. The soundtrack uses a range of different instruments, played together cohesively to create music I really love.Characters- 8At first the main cast seem to be your typical school slice of life characters, such as Yuuri being the mother of the group and Yuki being the cheerful one who is always full of energy. For the most part this is true, but each character goes through their own internal struggle, making them more three dimensional and causing the viewer to feel more attached to the characters. In my opinion, Yuki is the most well written out of the four, with her being too traumatised to realise the reality of the situation, but she has a strong resolve and is incredibly brave, which is what makes her more admirable. Their personalities together make a lovable main cast. There\'s also the side characters; I loved Megumi so much, knowing that she\'d always care for the girls and would do anything to keep them safe was really heartwarming. Kei was also great, deciding to take action instead of just sitting back and watch everything unfold. Furthermore, she contributed a lot to Miki\'s development- they were such a great duo.Enjoyment- 9This is honestly such a great anime to watch, having its fair share of both cheerful and grim moments. I was hesitant to watch it at first as I usually don\'t like horror, but I\'m glad I did and episode 1 still remains as one of my favourite episodes out of all of the anime I\'ve watched. I\'m invested enough in the story line and characters to want to buy the manga and see how the story ends.Overall- 8Overall I believe school-live to be an enjoyable take on the zombie apocalypse genre, and I highly recommend to people who are looking for a twist on cute girls doing cute things, or just someone looking for a good psychological drama in general. the first episode to the true nature of the series, before revealing it all at the end.

This review contains spoilers.STORY - 7ART - 8SOUND - 9CHARACTER - 8ENJOYMENT - 9Without a doubt, Gakkou Gurashi hit me hard. I took a dive into the show with some knowledge of its unconventional twist while still expecting a less serious, more silly vibe just because it looked cute, but that was too optimistic of me. Yeah...too optimistic, indeed.It all started in a happy-go-lucky kind of way. A new day welcomes the child-like Yuki as she readies herself to emanate happiness once more in her beloved school, which happens to be her living place too. But that\'s inherent for all the members of the...School Living Club: a club dedicated in activities encouraging self-governance and independence. Anyway, it\'s a peachy place, and the familiar sweetness fills my heart up. Maybe even a bit too much, but Yuki kept distracting me with her bright energy. Energy that\'s pleasant enough to take her cute club members and friends along. Energy that\'s lively enough to chase after an adorably smart dog. An energy that\'s deceiving enough to completely alter her perception of the real world—a world of a zombie outbreak—and from there on, the sweetness takes on a different taste.A bittersweet kind. And it\'s heavy to take in.That revelation was palpable to me, despite me already knowing about the walking dead setting. It was an instant make-over. What should\'ve been a school full of youthful bliss has become a gloomy haven—a club room barricaded against the infected dangers that constantly surround these girls. Their peers are the undead. The atmosphere stifles with a seriousness way too different to that of the exam period. And Yuki\'s rosy view on life hints of a deeper trauma that\'s desperately trying to cover up the jarring truths.It\'s these juxtapositions, thanks to the first episode\'s subversion, that Gakkou Gurashi heavily relies on to mould its part-moe, part-horror story. At its greatest, the duality is highly effective in terms of creating an emotional resonance within me, which I\'ll go into soon. But the show is also threading on a delicate balance between dark and cute here. With the significance of its flashbacks and subtle uncovering of truths to gradually reveal information of how the world came to be, where the girls came from, and the severity of their circumstances, having to be distracted by the more carefree slices-of-life doesn\'t bode too well with my immersion. In other words, the show sometimes ends up mixing comedy into seriousness rather intrusively.That said, being intrusive is the show\'s minor downside as when the situation is appropriate, which is for the most part, the bittersweetness accentuates the sweeter feelings to heart-tugging levels. From the hardships, a tight-knit friendship is strengthened between all the members of the School Living Club. And with friendship, the hopeful spirit to survive is brought about, where living becomes much more meaningful than giving up. The fact that the girls try to live their lives just like any other day, despite the cruel world, is the main reason why I\'ve become so attached to them. At the same time though, that very attachment also aches the heart; ever more heavily as Yuki\'s psychosis slowly shatters away to reveal the poignant realities and as the dangers begin to lumber into their fragile safety.Visually speaking, Gakkou Gurashi constructs its art with the same contrast I\'ve been talking about: you have the cutely designed girls—and a dog—living in a school environment reduced to a post-apocalyptic look. Zombies reflected on the broken window panes. Zombies stumbling about in the distant backdrops. The visual is a reminder of the harsh bittersweetness that constantly challenges Yuki\'s brighter delusions. Even more so, the way Lerche utilizes censoring—at most showing only blood and corpses—proves effective in getting its harrowing message across. The subsequent implications between scenes are enough for me to draw my own conclusions and leave behind a void in the stomach kind of feeling that draws out all positivity; positivity that could only come back by the more endearing interactions and expressions in the slice-of-life moments.Now, I don\'t think the show had to necessarily employ a moe aesthetic. The girls could\'ve been designed any other way and the overall story won\'t change, but as someone who adores the cute girls style, they probably wanted to intensify the emotions from people like me. Which I\'ll just say has worked way too well.With sorrow in mind, the soundtracks further elicit the brighter and darker feelings. There\'s this one musical box theme, ""Kyou wa Oyasuminasai"" translated as ""Good Night For Now"", that really defines the show\'s auditory experience, where it has the sweet nostalgia that\'s pleasant to the ears, but the steady rhythmic notes—like the thump thump thump noises of heartbeats—sound distressing at the same time. These kinds of melancholic pieces play throughout the show and if my heavy responses are any proof, they are important components in the show\'s crafting of emotions alongside the voice-acting.At times, sweet. At the other, bitter. But most certainly, bittersweet. Gakkou Gurashi has been one emotional roller coaster that tugged hard at my heartstrings. While not without its flawed distractions, it\'s still a show that narrates why hardships and zombie apocalypse is a duo that will never leave the rule of storytelling. So much so, that by the end of it all, I just want these girls to leave this nightmare and have sweet dreams once more.For a warm rest is what they deserve after their many struggles.

I liked the way that we saw the world from Yuki's perspective and that created an interesting dynamic to introduce more plot twists which genuinely surprised me, and dam the plot twists are surprising as hell.I adored the soundtrack for this anime as it greatly made scenes more emotional. The OP's and ED's were amazing with great attention to detail within each one. Also, the way the OP changed based on where you were in the story...was a really nice touch. The OP also has tons of symbolism with the items displayed around the characters when they pop up showing their personal characters and Yuki's being particularly deep.The characters were lovable from the start and become increasable likable further on in the series. There's Yuki the airhead carefree one, Kurumi the tomboy, Miki the reserved one and Yuuri the reliable older sister. There is a type of character for most people so there will hopefully be at least one character you'll get attached to in the series. Yuki is by far my favourite. Not only is she the most interesting character in the series with her delusions but she's also the one who has the most foreshadowing, depth, symbolism surrounding her. In the OP, in the designs, in the series, Yuki is always the one who has something to her that shows she's different and I love her so much more because of it.I loved this anime over other animes such as High school of the Dead because it felt more realistic, not in art style but in which the way the girls react in the situation, as they don't have unrealistic resources like army weapons and so on. The art style helped keep a perfect balance between cute anime girls and horror apocalypse. Its visually appealing while also being horrifying when it needs to be. Big props to the animators.Of course, I can't talk about this anime without gushing over how symbolic and deep it is. School Live has sooooo many deep meanings behind the stuff in it that after finishing it I searched it all up and absolutely loved the series even more because of it. Learning about all the subtle symbolism such as how Yuki's outfit is a different colour to everyone else to show she's different from them or how Yuki's hat is a symbolism of how she cuts herself off from the real world and how she's stuck in her delusion (Which is perfectly used in a way at the very end making School Live have one of the most satisfying ends in all of anime.) Yuki has by far the most symbolism to her and it makes her all the more my best girl. She's this cute generic girl on the outside but a pretty complicated girl when you get to know her better. I love how they use Yuki as the POV for most of the series and use her pov to contrast it with the other's pov to reveal plot twists. Because you genuinely get the sense that everything is ok when you're with Yuki and you get sucked into her world of happiness only to be forcefully reminded of what the world is really like when the scene switches to the girls without Yuki. Absolutely love how Yuki is a great pillar of moral support for the group and is essential to their survival. Enough to make Yuuri insanely pissed when someone even utters the suggestion of telling Yuki the truth. I can't stop gushing over these characters and this series.Honestly, the masterful crafting of this series is amazing and makes it my favourite anime series of all time. I've read some of the manga and how they differ and every single change and decision made to change it into the anime was an amazing one. The anime has so much more symbolism than the manga and makes decisions to change events such as the very final arc to masterful success. It felt so much more impactful towards the end of the anime than it did in the manga and I can say with confidence that whoever was in charge of making the manga to anime adaptation deserves humungous praise and respect.The ending for the anime was unforgettable and left me in tears with a smile on my face for a long time afterward. I bought the series on DVD the second I finished watching it.I would re-watch this in a heartbeat. 10/10 genuine masterpiece. was a really nice touch.

If you expect a moe slice of life anime, you will be surprised at the survival horror. If you expect it to be a full-blown horror show, you will be surprised that it is a moe slice of life show nonetheless. When not being threatened by zombies, the girls do their best to enjoy the...life they have with whatever possibilities they have. Gakkou Gurashi does not work on twists alone, it also has story progress, which is something even many ""normal"" slice of life anime miss out on.10/10Art:Moe is not everyones cup of tea, I don\'t have a problem with that though. Here it is used as heavy contrast to the horror elements, not unlike the way Madoka was planned out. But since it\'s still a slice of life anime, it also works the usual way. As a very nice bonus, there are several hints thrown into episode one towards the big reveal as well as a constantly changing opening.9/10Sound:I really liked the background music in Gakkou Gurashi, as well as the voice acting (though I have to admit they did play into stereotypes). The bubbly happy opening theme stuck ot more and more as the visuals for it changed and the tone got more serious towards the end. It actually ended up being more disturbing than cute, which is probably a good thing. The ending songs were very touchy, though nothing that stuck inside my head for long.8/10Characters:The girls started out as stock slice of life characters, but over the course of the show, they were able to show more facets than what they seemed to be at first glance. I wouldn\'t go so far saying they have hidden depths (except maybe Yuki), but they were enjoyably not the fixed stereotypes they could have been. The most important thing however, is that I cared about their well-being. Everytime something bad happened to them, I felt really sad. This includes the dog.9/10Enjoyment:I loved this anime. I laughed and cried, sometimes within minutes of each other and I hoped that everything would turn out okay. It is not often that an anime grabs me like this one did. Maybe my rating is influenced by my emotional involvement while watching, but can this really be an argument against it? You may be put off by the mixture of two so different genres, but if you don\'t have a problem with that, Gakkou Gurashi is an anime you won\'t regret watching. If you\'ve read the manga and are a purist, you will also find changes you may not like, but this review is about the anime, not how it was adapted.10/10Overall:9.2/10 life they have with whatever possibilities they have.

Megurigaoka High School has become overrun with zombies after being hit by a biological weapon created by the Randall Corporation and covered up by the government who uses the school and it’s unique resources as a shelter. Four girls, their teacher, and their dog are at some point, the last living survivors and strive to find a way out alive. Personally, I’ve never had a show create such a lasting impact on me like this has. I hate horror but the cute art style gave me the nerve to watch it. The...gory imagery, psychological twist and turns, and the raw emotion of the characters are second to none. The protagonist Yuki is at the center of the series as the beacon of hope to the rest of the girls however, she is still living in the past. After a certain event that took place during the zombie plague, Yuri started to envision her life as it was prior to the outbreak. The others are planning their survival and fending off zombies while Yuki continues to go to class in a torn up and bloodied room with no teachers and no students under the impression that none of this ever happened. She believes they’re all just in a school living club with their teacher and pet but school living means more than just camping on campus- they’re literally the only living people in their school and potentially the whole town. gory imagery, psychological twist and turns, and the raw emotion of the characters are second to none.

So I stopped right there, and watched the first episode with little to no prior knowledge. If you are reading this review prior to watching this anime trying to decide if it is worth your time, I would advise you not look too much into it, but simply stop reading now and watch the first episode and make you decision based on that.With that out of the way I'll get on with the review.Is...something unenjoyable simply due to it being too predictable? I think that this is something that will be the difference between really enjoying this show and becoming frustrated with it for some. I've definitely been frustrated with it in the past in some shows, like every twist in turn I saw coming a mile away. However for this anime, where I'll say I saw most of the twists coming (aside from that first one, dayuuum). I think that this was a conscious decision by the writers of the show. There was lots of foreshadowing floating around just begging to be noticed. And I think in some ways, that actually added to the show for me. Just like when you read a book, or poetry, foreshadowing within a piece of work can really enhance its effect. Long story short, I think that a predictable story still has the potential to be a good one.Story: 6The story in this show was, not the most intricate I've ever seen, nor the most original. However it was certainly enjoyable. Some of the finer points of what the hell is going on are left unanswered at the end of this series, but that was never really the focus of this show to begin with, and the story really isn't where this show shines. Much of the time the story doesn't focus on the impending zombie apocalypse outside their doorstep, but more on the day to day living, struggles, and psychological issues that have ensued in the aftermath, and how they learn to move on and live a happy life regardless. Not to say that there isn't any zombie killing and drama, because you will have your fill of that I assure you. I won't say much else about what happens other than that the ending doesn't really leave you hanging, but it could definitely use a little bit more work or direction as to what comes next.Art: 8The art in this show was consistent and well animated. There is also one or two scenes that stick out in my mind where they really went out of their way to leave an impression.Sound: 6I honestly can't say I noticed the soundtrack in very many scenes during this anime aside from a few, but I think it suited it well in the scenes I did notice it. Also I must say the OP was very enjoyable, I normally skip OPs but this one I watched almost every time.Character: 9Now this I think is where the show really leaves its mark. The show has a rather small cast of characters, ranging from the airhead (and mentally unstable) Yuki, Kurumi (Shovel-chan), Yuuri (Responsible big sister type), Megu-nee (Teacher), and Mii-kun (Intellectual). They balance each other out quite well. And I must say that their interactions were all very enjoyable to watch. Now Yuki in particular will either drive you nuts or you will adore her. I certainly enjoyed watching her bubbly, ridiculous, and at times, downright crazy statements and interactions with others. There was more than one time where I fully expected her to go full psycho mode and just start kicking some zombie ass, despite her rather small size and friendly nature. Yuki was the character that I think really made this show excellent.Overall I think that this show was a good watch, but the ending could've used a bit more work, or closure. something unenjoyable simply due to it being too predictable? I think that this is something that will be the difference between really enjoying this show and becoming frustrated with it for some. I've definitely been frustrated with it in the past in some shows, like every twist in turn I saw coming a mile away. However for this anime, where I'll say I saw most of the twists coming (aside from that first one, dayuuum). I think that this was a conscious decision by the writers of the show. There was lots of foreshadowing floating around just begging to be noticed. And I think in some ways, that actually added to the show for me. Just like when you read a book, or poetry, foreshadowing within a piece of work can really enhance its effect. Long story short, I think that a predictable story still has the potential to be a good one.Story: 6The story in this show was, not the most intricate I've ever seen, nor the most original. However it was certainly enjoyable.

However, if you didn\'t, you might have the opportunity of going into this series without having the first episode\'s twist revealed. So you might want to head in and check that out first. Like, you might like the whole twist, despite the rate I\'ve given this series and knowing the theme is relevant to what I\'ll continue with.If you\'re reading this paragraph then I\'ll assume that you did. Do you like the theme that the anime has presented? Yes? Then you should...give this adaptation\'s manga instead a try. I\'ll explain why, as I\'ve done a check up on the differences between the manga series and the anime series.The anime\'s story tried to strengthen the cutsey/moe-ish factor of the show by a fuckton. To do that the show has done certain changes which left out a bunch of scenes where the conflict between some characters has been underwhelmed or totally removed, some events were changed to be more lighthearted or simply replaced with some more slice of life-ish moments. Some moments that define the mental state of the main character better as well as some mental breakdowns were removed from the show. Some events were rearranged to fit the cutsey aspect of the show better and make it be more lighthearted. And on top of all that since they thought the cutsey factor will sell and because we\'ve got girls in the show, you like girls right???, they also added a beach (a pool episode but not really) to it. And due to all of these factors this, the anime will feel lacking and kinda skewered.In order to succeed in selling a character that lives in a certain state of mind, you\'ve gotta detail their state of mind as much as possible and the anime\'s description of the main character\'s state of mind is simply... accepted by her peers. It is never really explained properly why. The explanation given to us is really, it cheers us up. But in the manga it actually is a little more complex than that. I can\'t go into more detail because of spoilers here, but note that the manga has given more important details to make her state easier to understand and accept. Her state of mind fuels the tragedy in the series and her struggles. All these things to give depth to her character, and even the characters around her since the effect and the impact her state has on them is also more explored in the manga, all of that, replaced with cutsey moments.The pacing of the series is all damaged, in order for the anime to get serious due to all the changes they\'ve done to the source material it had for a good while to appeal to flashbacks in order to describe the current state of how things are, making it seem as the worst has passed and they\'re making the best out of a bad situation and living somewhat casually at the current time. In the manga, the pacing is better. And the worst part is that the pacing makes the final events of the series feel completely convenient, from a casual watcher of zombie series\' standpoint. There are some things will feel awfully convenient happening. Like, no, stupidly convenient. Like, shoplifting something, being caught, and you asking ""Can I steal this PLEASE?"". And they\'re like, yeah sure. Then you leave, yay, free shit. I again obviously can\'t give details on this, because spoilers.So what can you expect from the anime itself? A story that doesn\'t describe its characters and the struggles they went through properly, banking on the fact it\'s cute and hoping that it\'s cuteness will be a catalyst to an impactful ending, banking on a couple things that are very likely to market. Is that the same case from the manga? Well, I can say the story takes itself more seriously, and things won\'t feel nearly as convenient there. There\'s some skipped content in the anime. (a bunch of chapters actually, consecutive even for a bunch of them) There\'s a character in the series (The dog) that is merely an episodic chapter in the manga series which in the anime is pretty much part of the main cast. The dog is anything but an integral part of the group. And something that will happen to the dog is explained way better rather than not at all.To put it quite frankly, the things the anime has done quite well are its intro that gets progressively more fucked up as the series progressed, which I thought was a nifty touch, but I can\'t say I am a fan of the moe artstyle, or the slice of life-ish moments that took away development from the characters and the group as a whole the manga had. Anything else? The serious moments were done mostly well, but the series is mostly killed by its pacing. As I\'ve said, when it\'s not in flashbacks, it seems like they\'re living somewhat of a peaceful life and the worst has already passed, making it all the more ridiculous how by its end, everything that will happen will simply feel convenient. And while the manga also tries to look cute, it does not do it at the cost of telling a more complete story about the characters.If you want a more solid story with better characterization and better focus on the characters and of the theme this anime has, just go for the manga. The manga is decent, it explores the impact someone delusional and why they\'re delusional overall impacts the group, and the view of everyone on it and the impact this has on them. The anime tries to exploit this mental state as a tool towards building slice of life-ish moments that took away from the story. The manga tells a more natural, better paced, not nearly banking as much on the ""please notice me I\'m cute"" factor. The problems of the group and characters are solved with less convenience even though there\'s some of that inside of the manga too. The world will be described better than in the show and in this particular type of setting, knowing the dangers of the world is very important. Overall I\'d say the anime adaptation was an adaptation mostly ruined by marketing tactics. The manga series while not incredible, it still does a decent job with its theme and it uses its strengths mostly right.However, if you\'re not interested in the theme or just don\'t want to bother with the manga, you could just avoid this series entirely. The reason I compared it with the manga so much is to explain why the adaptation was bad and if you are really into the theme, you have a far better alternative. I can\'t recommend you going into the anime for any reason, in good faith, when you have a better alternative for the same story in a different format. give this adaptation\'s manga instead a try.

Many studios have tried, often to little avail. Instead of moments that instill dread into our hearts, we’re left with predictable setups, uninspired monsters, or an over-dependence on gore. It appears that anime is just not a good medium to really freak people out.As such, Gakkou Gurashi is trying a different angle. Reminiscent of Madoka Magika, it isn’t trying to unsettle viewers by being incredibly scary. Instead, it tries to be only somewhat scary, but within an otherwise completely unscary setting. And so we have one of the more unusual matchups in...recent years: typical moe schoolgirl fluff... and zombies.EXECUTIONGakkou Gurashi has been an incredibly polarizing show. I feel that the crux of the controversy is due to the fact that, despite its twist, Gakkou Gurashi is still a show where “cute girls do cute things” at heart.To understand why some people really like Gakkou-- and why others really dislike it-- we need to look at the show’s main theme: denial of reality. While it is shown early on that Yuki takes the theme to an extreme extent, all of the other main characters are guilty of it as well. For instance, the girls could break Yuki away from her fantasies-- they even admit that they would be able to. But they don’t. Why? Because Yuki’s cheery demeanor would vanish. So let’s make sure Yuki stays happy instead, because if she’s so happy, then things can’t possible be that bad, right?To further this delusion, the girls try to live life as usual. They’re not sleeping at school because it’s a safe haven, but because they’re part of a School-Life Club. They’re not foraging for supplies, they’re going on a field trip. Hey, I have an idea! Let’s write messages and tie them to balloons! Let’s have a fight with water guns! Let’s have races in the hallway! If anything, they’re acting even more upbeat and bubbly than usual, because that’s all that’s keeping away reality.And this is where, for many, the show falters. There is a large chunk of screentime given to these schoolgirls acting like, well, schoolgirls. This leads to a whole lot of moe fluff that, while it advances the setting, does absolutely nothing to advance the plot. And for those who cannot stand the genre, or the show’s stagnant story, there are many valid complaints to be had against Gakkou Gurashi.But for those who don’t mind the set-up as much, it definitely does a lot to make the horror hit harder. I don’t want to delve into spoilers, but I will say this: Gakkou Gurashi is really, really dire. With every episode, things are looking more and more helpless. And no matter how much you may want to go along with the cast’s beliefs that everything is going to turn out alright, you won’t be able to get away from the feeling that every bit of happiness is just another sign that things are going to go horribly wrong. And that’s not something you come across in an anime very often. recent years: typical moe schoolgirl fluff... and zombies.EXECUTIONGakkou Gurashi has been an incredibly polarizing show.

And that’s not something you come across in an anime very often.', ""Gakkou Gurashi Review:First time reviewHere’s what I think about Gakkou Gurashi, Gakkou Gurashi is amazing but it could’ve been done better.At first I didn’t pay much attention to this series, so I just put it on my watch list. When I finally watched the first episode, I crapped my pants. I watched this show without knowing anything about it, I didn’t know the genre, I didn’t watch the trailer, and I never see any screenshot (the summary is misleading), so it was a real shock for me and it makes me wanting more.Now here’s the problem with the following episodes, they aren’t consistent. The episodes...jumping back and forth between flashback and present times, throwing us off from the main plot (“is this still flashback episode?”, “is this present time?”, “wait, this is present time but still in a flashback”, like that). But it doesn’t mean that they’re bad episodes instead they are all great.The flashback shows the event before it all happens, with Megumi’s and Miki’s point of view, and I loved the way they handle these episodes with a great pacing building up to the climax while introducing us to the characters and how does the climax hit them real hard. The rest of the episodes are the typical moe slice of life show, where some of them are pretty boring but it’s still gives you a few laugh and smiles while deepening the characters.Now for the characters there’s Kurumi she’s the muscle in the group, there’s Yuri she’s the leader of the group but her character is bland in the anime compared to the manga version (which unfortunate because she’s an interesting character), Miki is the newest member of the group (she’s the only character that doesn’t comes to an agreement with Yuki’s condition at first but as the story progresses she’s starting to accept and tries to help her in a way), Megumi she’s the teacher in the group and I say that she’s the best teacher I’ve ever seen, her love to the students are really admirable willing to sacrifice herself for her student safety, Taroumaru is a dog, at first he’s annoying and act as a liability in the group but later we see that he helped the group several times.Now for me Yuki is the strongest character in this show her delivery in episode 1 proves that, her insanity doesn’t just affect the group but it also affects the audience who watch this show. It makes the audience on edge and having trust issues throughout the episodes. We also learnt that her insanity is what keeps the group sane (explained in another flashback episode), when they put it like that it makes sense, are you willing to live in a world where the only thing you can think of is to survive? Or are you willing to live in a world where you can smile even if the world is ruined? These reason is what makes Yuki’s character meaningful. At episode 11 & 12 is where her character shines, where she finally overcomes her delusion, we would expect her to breakdown and becoming more of a liability but instead it’s the opposite. She managed to save all of her friends (kind of), she’s willing to fight, she helps her friends overcome their sadness and she even gives us the audience a wonderful message.but here’s the problem that I have with the final episode, it took the whole episode 11 to build up the climaxes and it ends in a satisfying cliffhanger but later in episode 12 all problems were solved in just around 5 minutes with a solution that are to convenient.The music in this show are great especially the OP, the OP is catchy and upbeat with a very cheerful visual style but as the show progresses the visuals getting darker, darker and darker accompanied with the same upbeat and catchy song this OP works well. The ED is just there nothing really special only in a couple of episodes where the ED stands out. In episode 1 where they reveal the dark secret of this show it uses a music box as the theme song which is very fitting giving us the audience a sense of dread, confusion, relaxing, and depression all in one that was well done. For the slice of life part, the music doesn’t stand up at all it’s just there to serve some scenes but when the show become darker that’s where the music really hits the nail.The art style of this show really fits the atmosphere, when it’s dark the color pellet are grayish and dark but when it’s not the color pellet are all bright and colorful. Now for the zombie design is a bit questionable, it’s because they cover the zombies with a purple aura to restrict the violence and gore in the show, which confuses me why since this show needs that aspect. (because the manga is really gory)So overall Gakkou Gurashi is a great show, that has a great characters, great story, and great execution. I watched the anime first and when the anime finished I read the manga but I didn’t read it too far I just read it to the same point as the show, I want to watch the anime first. The manga for me is better but it has a really bad execution and the anime managed to fix this by adding lots of changes which is great but it also loses its consistency. I recommend people to watch this show, it is a must. it's just that this anime doesn't have enough recognition which i find it really unfortunate (like a few of my favorite YouTube anime reviewer didn't even review this show or mention anything about this show which is disappointing to me) jumping back and forth between flashback and present times, throwing us off from the main plot (“is this still flashback episode?”, “is this present time?”, “wait, this is present time but still in a flashback”, like that).

For example, the decision to make Miki confront zombie Megumi not only is the less interesting option to make; but also goes against the supposed message of ""moving on"" from the show. has none of the girls have or even seem to acknowledge the need to kill Megumi zombie.Actually, the show contradicting its own message also happens when Yuuri refuses to kill Kurumi and...that\'s completely okay having no consequences at all. This could be an option to be made and even be interpreted as the ""right choice"", but brushing it off with just some cliff hanger of Yuuri almost killing her and then one or two scenes of her crying does not explore any theme and would be better off NOT PUT on the show at all if you\'re not going to do anything with it.The final monologues about ""how we need to move on and everything has to come to an end"" really misses to hit due to this repeated refusal of the show to show us that.Yuki refusal to believe on what happened was also a very VERY cool concept, but it was so poorly and I mean REALLY POORLY executed, it never builded the tension that the show so desperatly tired to create.I also felt that there was a loss of focus on what character should be the main one. While I understand the need to make Miki an outsider so she can confront Yuki and we can get more context without a full info dump; it was too stretched out for us to see, know more and even process Yuki as the actual main character.Overall, there were really good and cool ideas, but left more to be desired for. that\'s completely okay having no consequences at all. This could be an option to be made and even be interpreted as the ""right choice"", but brushing it off with just some cliff hanger of Yuuri almost killing her and then one or two scenes of her crying does not explore any theme and would be better off NOT PUT on the show at all if you\'re not going to do anything with it.The final monologues about ""how we need to move on and everything has to come to an end"" really misses to hit due to this repeated refusal of the show to show us that.Yuki refusal to believe on what happened was also a very VERY cool concept, but it was so poorly and I mean REALLY POORLY executed, it never builded the tension that the show so desperatly tired to create.I also felt that there was a loss of focus on what character should be the main one.

So just a heads up, and I\'ll try not to spoil as much as I can.This anime took me on a roller coaster of emotions. Laughter, sorrow, and utter fear. Gakkou Gurashi (School-Live) is a slice-of-life, moe-filled anime with a dark twist. It is the first anime that made me feel actually connect/relate to the characters while enjoying the story at the same time. For me, School-Live will always have an impact on me as a great anime, I guess I can say that it...gave me back a heart, and then ripped it out again. Also, you know how people who love reading books say that a book gives them an experience of an entire different world? Gakkou Gurashi is a perfect example of that, for me at least. This might sound weird but I was knocked with a refreshing sense of reality while at the same time feeling as if I was in a different world with the characters in this anime.Like all things, nothing is perfect. This anime has both pros and cons, an example for a con is that there are some parts that aren\'t very well thought out and just don\'t make any sense, as well as them not including some very important scenes in the anime from the manga that would\'ve helped us better understand the story. Though there are many pros as well! Some of the scenes are portrayed better here than in the manga imo, the characters are lovable, and an art style that is so cute I just cannot take it.I don\'t know if this review helped convince you in anyway at all but I hope it did. It hurts to see this anime not getting the recognition it deserves, so if you can please share it with other people. I think I\'m getting off topic-Anyway, you should definitely watch this anime!

Story is, frankly speaking, rather standard issue, but it is worth a glimpse for it's atypical main cast and problem approach.this anime does NOT have:-shallow characters. They may not have a full psychoanalysis conducted, since, you know, ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE takes place, maybe? Calling them shallow is just stupid.-actual gore-zombie shots. as in, they're censored when they don't need to be shown. It is not bothersome though, just picture...a moaning, shambling corpse clad in aura of darkness.-much fighting scenes-obnoxious fanservice. the only instance i recall is when they wear swimsuits for cleaning water tank and when they bathe the dog in underwear.So, this is not a story about zombie apocalypse with HS girls in it, but rather about HS girls coping with zombie apocalypse. a moaning, shambling corpse clad in aura of darkness.-much fighting scenes-obnoxious fanservice. the only instance i recall is when they wear swimsuits for cleaning water tank and when they bathe the dog in underwear.So, this is not a story about zombie apocalypse with HS girls in it, but rather about HS girls coping with zombie apocalypse."", 'Warning! Long read! Scroll down to last paragraph for summary.As a fan of dark, psychological anime, I initially despaired upon completion of Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica that I’d never find anything quite up to par. These worries evaporated when I completed the first episode of Gakkou Gurashi.Although it may seem initially just like cute girls doing cute things, don’t let the cover or the first 20 minutes of the first episode fool you. Gakkou Gurashi is in fact an express train to the dark and sometimes horrifying with plenty of feel stops along the way.From the first episode, Gakkou Gurashi seemed like...a great anime. With cutesy art, characters and theme songs, despite knowing that there was a ‘dark twist’ to the story didn’t prepare me for the last scene. It’s a pity that nothing is completely perfect. Gakkou Gurashi has it’s share of flaws and it disappointed me at times, however it remains an anime I would recommend to my peers nonetheless.Firstly, aesthetic value is high. Although the art isn’t particularly mind-blowing, it’s very cutesy and visually pleasing. One downside is that even the teacher, Megumi “Megu-nee” Sakura looks hardly older than her students, however this is easily forgiven. The colours are bright and vivid, the lines are clean and cute and the contrast is big when we view the world as it really is versus Yuki’s delusionary P-O-V. There are a few minor but annoying hiccups, such as the illogical orientation of the ears on Yuki’s hat when her head is turned, however animation is otherwise smooth and pleasant. The zombies are also well animated, gory and disturbing without being graphic at all. In fact, I would even say that Gakkou Gurashi makes good use of the idea that the unseen is scarier than the seen, leaving the viewer to imagine what truly lies behind those ominous shadows.As a whole, the anime manages to remain disturbing on a psychological level without any particularly graphic scenes, which I greatly appreciated. And let’s just also mention that despite the characters all appearing like lolis, they actually had chests, something more gratifying than I thought it would be.Gakkou Gurashi’s art, somewhat simple yet still very pleasing and enjoyable, is well deserving of an 7/10.In terms of sound, Gakkou Gurashi is also a job well-done. Although the OP and ED weren’t quite my taste, I found that they complemented the anime quite well. Just like in the infamous Madoka, the cutesy OP has a great impact during later episodes that greatly contributes to the dark, psychological nature of the anime. Think someone giggling during a particularly violent scene of a horror movie.Voice actors were also high tier. Without overdoing the sugary moe aspect of the anime, each VA’s voice suits her character perfectly. Except for, well, poor Megu-nee, who once again sounds way too young.I was, however, disappointed with the background music. Though not lacking, I found the background tracks just as unnoticeable as Megu-nee (something akin to a ""running gag"" in the anime) and was even under the impression that Gakkou Gurashi had none. Background tracks are a tricky thing to get right, and tracks that draw away from the dialogue are undesirable, however to have them so unnoticeable is not right either.Somewhat weaker than the aspect of art, 6.5/10 is a reasonable score for the sound. Although it’s not something about which I say “wow!” like I have in some other anime, it’s still rather satisfying.The story is, in my opinion, the strongest part of Gakkou Gurashi. Although the premise is rather simple, the story-telling is superb. Admittedly, the pace got a little slow during some of the middle episodes, mostly during some more moe-type events, however this is well balanced out when the anime returns to the story at hand. Foreshadowing was mixed in perfectly: small elements are hidden into each episode without being too hard to notice - perfect for the amateur detective within.The first episodes were certainly the best in terms of pacing, and it is disappointing that the rest of the anime couldn’t quite keep up the excellent standards. However, I still thoroughly enjoyed every episode, and the psychological horror factor was pleasantly strong and unique. For once, we have a dark anime involving high school girls that doesn’t rely on bouncing breasts, graphic murders, a harem or a revised script of Madoka Magica.All in all, despite it’s flaws, I find Gakkou Gurashi to be an incredibly fresh-feeling anime. With twists, plenty of “oh my god, what?!” moments and some moe thrown in to the mix, Gakkou Gurashi’s plot is certainly a prime example of simple excellence. One does not need a huge, 100% original plot with confusing twists and turns to earn a good 8/10.However, Gakkou Gurashi disappoints in the aspect of characters, which is, in my opinion, the most important element in any anime. Although the characters are in no way boring, annoying or overly stereotyped, they retain a “I’ve seen this so many times before"" feel. You have the cute and clumsy type A protagonist, the strong ‘fighter’ one, the motherly one, the serious one and the one whose lack of presence is their main, some might even argue only, defining feature. In terms of twists, the biggest twist one can find in any character of Gakkou Gurashi is that they are actually a lot less mentally stable than other characters assume, which isn’t exactly shocking or particularly valuable to the plot as far as I know. Perhaps its for this reason that I found the moe episodes a bit of a bore. Although Yuki’s hallucinations are an interesting element, she, along with the rest of the cast, bring little to the anime as a whole. This anime would have earned a much higher score if it wasn’t for the bland characters, which earns only 5/10 for me.Despite all it’s flaws, I still enjoyed Gakkou Gurashi and it was one of the more interesting anime of this season that I think everyone who likes dark, psychological anime with a bit of horror mixed in should definitely give a go. The characters, background tracks, pacing in later episodes and moe moments were on the disappointing side, however as a whole the plot, execution, voice work and art were very much satisfying and up to par of what I expect of, well, any anime. In terms of enjoyment alone, I would award this anime a 7/10. Although as the anime progressed, it did not remain as ‘wow!’ as I found it during the first two episodes, I don’t regret ranting on to my friends about this amazing new anime that I had started watching the night before, fiercely recommending it to them.Overall, this anime is well worth a watch.Average score: 6.7/10 (rounded to a 7) a great anime.

However, he probably didn\'t realize that an interesting idea ain\'t worth jack shit if you don\'t develop and expand upon it. As a result, we get Gakkou Gurashi.While interesting at first, this show ended up feeling half-assed and lazy. Its more unique aspects are introduced solely as a gimmicky selling point and was never capitalized on as the show waddles awkwardly between cutesy moe and edgy horror. I don\'t think the show itself even knows what it wants to...be. It\'s neither dark, gritty nor realistic enough to be a compelling horror, but neither is it fun and lighthearted enough to be a slice-of-life either. By the end, this entire show feels like one big sloppy mess of somewhat interesting ideas loosely strung together with blood, spit and moe. Absolutely no cohesion nor depth - just novelty and shock factor.But the depth and development - or lack thereof - is not the only subpar thing about this show. It genuinely could have thrived off of its barebones premise alone if only the characters weren\'t so goddamn boring and generic.Even if a show\'s writing fails to develop on its own premise, it can still be decent provided that its characters are decently interesting and entertaining to watch.But in Gakkou Gurashi, I do not give a single fuck about any one of the characters.Not Yuki. Not Yuuri. Not Miki. Not Kurumi. Not even the fucking dog.They can all go die for all I care because they do not have a single shred of individuality nor charisma about them. I really think that these characters are the ultimate symbol of Gakkou Gurashi\'s identity crisis, of its internal conflict and indecisiveness towards whether it wants to be a moe slice of life or a post-apocalyptic horror. Even Yuki, the most promising character, was never really properly explored nor developed. Her unique ""trait"" ends up being just another one-hit-wonder gimmick swept along in the sea of gimmicks that makes up this show. When you boil these characters down, they\'re all just generic moe tropes who got shoehorned into an oh-so-dark-and-tragic setting. That\'s it. They don\'t really do anything. They don\'t abandon their humanity to butcher zombies nor develop baser human desires for sex nor do they betray one another nor sacrifice themselves or any of that juicy stuff. Not in Gakkou Gurashi. These boring-ass characters are only there just to bitch, cry and whine. It never feels like they\'re making any kind of radical or substantial decisions, nor are they plunged into any extreme scenarios that would force them to step outside their comfort zones and make decisions they would usually not make. Instead, they just act really laid-back, fucking around on top of the school rooftop like nothing\'s happening. At the end of the day, no matter how this show tries to fucking hide it, these characters are ultimately just cute girls doing cute things, with maybe a bit of edginess, angst, and melodrama sprinkled on top. This is not really innovative or anything. Angst and melodrama are already ubiquitous enough among slice-of-life shows. What\'s your excuse, Gakkou Gurashi?Oh and btw, a certain character acted like a complete retard towards the end, causing contrived angst and melodrama to ensue.What\'s worse is that all of this tension and conflict are resolved in one fell swoop through one convenient plot device. This solution wasn\'t really mind-blowing or anything, and the show could have done it way earlier and save the audience the anguish of sitting through 12 episodes of trashy moe and pseudo-horror clusterfuck. Up to that point, the show has been barely passable with its writing - neither too dumb nor too smart. I was willing to give the show a 6 but because of this dipshit plot development, down to a 5 you go you piece of shit.TLDR: This show\'s lazy writing plays it too safe and never wants to push anything, to make anything extreme or interesting. The characters and their emotions; the plot developments; the setting - all of them are ultimately bland and pointless, not worth giving a damn about.Art:The art design is slightly above average, boasting a vibrant color palette but bland  character design and visual style. Also, it really toned down the more gory aspects of its story, soft-censoring or completely omitting scenes showing blood and violence. In other words, the artstyle is an awkward cross between visceral and cute, neither fully embracing one nor the other. Once again, this just goes to show how half-assed Gakkou Gurashi is, with no real identity or substance to add flavor to its premise.Sound:The sound design is surprisingly good. Many of the background tracks are extremely creepy and manages to perfectly set the tone every time. It\'s a shame, though, that it\'s wasted on the mediocre writing.Enjoyment:5/10You know what? I just had more fun typing up this review than I ever had in my 4 hours of watching this anime.Overall:5/10 be.

I just had more fun typing up this review than I ever had in my 4 hours of watching this anime.Overall:5/10', '-CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS-Okay first of all let me make it perfectly clear that I have never ever read the manga and just recently heard about this anime from a Top Horror Anime List on  Youtube. On this list it was depicted as something more cutesy like K-on or even God may I say it, Lucky Star (no offence to the people that like that show of course). So this made me very, very, VERY curious of why a show with enough moe to officially kill off Fuko from Clannad, would be on such a list. Though when I watched it I was completely astounded...by how much a show can trick you!12 EPISODESStory: 9At first glance this show seems to have a story any other slice of life comedy. Usually in many comedies like this the characters are put into weird situations in order to appeal to their audience, and in this case they use a very unrealistic club. Enter the School Living club where 4 lucky girls live their days completely and utterly at school, along with their advising teacher.  In this club they go through their daily lives just like they do at home and even to the point that they do literally sleep at school. This club is also in charge of helping out other clubs as well as taking care of the school\'s dog, if thats what you wanna call that fur ball. Though by the end of episode one your whole take of this breath of fresh air is turned completely upside down, one word, ZOMBIES. Here\'s the kicker, their is a major twist to how they actually introduce this.Art: 9The art itself is very vibrant and well moe. The art reminds me of a cross between Rolling Girls, and Charlotte. The characters are especially well drawn with fluid animation. One of my favorite things about it would probably be the way they do both the comedy scenes between all the main characters, and then the fighting scenes where all the tones become much darker. The anime itself is directed by Masaomi Ando who was involved with the storyboards of both Accel World and Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse, which you can definitely see the similarities in visuals, animation, and art style. One of the other things I need to mention is you probably need to watch the opening every time, because with each episode the opening slightly changes due to the events of the last episode and even gives you hints on what will happen in the current episode.Sound: 7The music itself is decent nothing magnificent. The opening is a very catchy song. One of the other tracks that also stands out would probably be the soundtrack that translates over as ""Day Good Night,"" which is a soft music box melody and sometimes piano. Its usually played during more of the dramatic and more dark scenes.Character: 8Here I will summarize the 5 main characters of the show.Yuki Takeya- She\'s the shows main protagonist as well as the comic relief. She\'s very naive and even looks the youngest out of the group with her black kitty hat and pink socks. She\'s the baby of the group as well as the anchor that holds down all hope of stability among her and her friends even though she doesnt know it. She loves school and cares deeply for all of her friends.Kurumi Ebisuzawa- Is the typical tsundere of the group. I guess you could say she\'s the brawn of the group who is constantly tasked with the harder jobs among her and her friends. Her weapon of choice though is a shovel. lolYūri Wakasa- The big sister of the group who is also the president of the club. She is usually the most mature and level headed of the group but can be scary when provoked, especially by the dog.Miki Naoki- The brains of the group who acts more distant due to the fact she hasnt known the other girls as long. Shes kind and well mannered, but doesn\'t agree with the other girls decisions. She is in the grade below the other girls.Megumi Sakura- The advising teacher and founder of the School Living Club. She is very friendly with her students and tends to get closer to them more then other teachers due to the fact that she is young. She would do anything to insure that her students are safe.Taromaru- The club pet and trouble maker.Enjoyment/Overall: 9.5This anime is probably in my official top ten list. It combines horror, comedy, slice of life, and moe in a way that I don\'t think has ever been done. It\'s so funny and so sad at the same time and can even make you laugh and send shivers down your spine in one episode. If you like a combination of HighSchool of the Dead and Madoka Magica this anime is for you, without the unneeded fan service though. So yeah I highly recommend this show and give in a solid 9 overall. I\'d probably give it a 10 if they make a season 2 that builds off the first season and makes the show even better by how much a show can trick you!12 EPISODESStory: 9At first glance this show seems to have a story any other slice of life comedy.

She\'s very naive and even looks the youngest out of the group with her black kitty hat and pink socks. She\'s the baby of the group as well as the anchor that holds down all hope of stability among her and her friends even though she doesnt know it. She loves school and cares deeply for all of her friends.Kurumi Ebisuzawa- Is the typical tsundere of the group. I guess you could say she\'s the brawn of the group who is constantly tasked with the harder jobs among her and her friends. Her weapon of choice though is a shovel. lolYūri Wakasa- The big sister of the group who is also the president of the club. She is usually the most mature and level headed of the group but can be scary when provoked, especially by the dog.Miki Naoki- The brains of the group who acts more distant due to the fact she hasnt known the other girls as long. Shes kind and well mannered, but doesn\'t agree with the other girls decisions. She is in the grade below the other girls.Megumi Sakura- The advising teacher and founder of the School Living Club. She is very friendly with her students and tends to get closer to them more then other teachers due to the fact that she is young. She would do anything to insure that her students are safe.Taromaru- The club pet and trouble maker.Enjoyment/Overall: 9.5This anime is probably in my official top ten list. It combines horror, comedy, slice of life, and moe in a way that I don\'t think has ever been done. It\'s so funny and so sad at the same time and can even make you laugh and send shivers down your spine in one episode. If you like a combination of HighSchool of the Dead and Madoka Magica this anime is for you, without the unneeded fan service though. So yeah I highly recommend this show and give in a solid 9 overall. I\'d probably give it a 10 if they make a season 2 that builds off the first season and makes the show even better', ""This is a SPOILER FREE review!Okay,now that I assured you that nothing will be spoiled in this review let's start out with the first episode.We are being introduced to the main girl from the bunch,Yuki.Yuki is a funny high school girl,who loves all her friends,has no care in the world and enjoys her time in school.Although she doesn't like to study that much,and solve math problems in her classes,she still likes her teacher Megune who really tries to teach the uninterested Yuki.We get to meet the school live club,and their members Kurumi,Miki and Yuuri.We follow their lives in this 12 episode anime.Sadly MAL screwed up...and already spoiled the setting of the anime,I swear this anime had one of the best first episodes of the first year if you went in blindly..Story: 7/10A generic trapped in the zombie apocalypse scenario,but featuring 4 cute girls and a dog.I read the manga and the anime did a really really good job of following it and added some amazing details to the adaptation.Good story but a bit too generic I'd say.Art:8/10One of the strongest parts is the well done animation and art.You will see a lot of foreshadowing during the episodes,also great addition of details in lots of scenes.Really well done except I don't like moe girls and that art style,but for some reason it went well.Sound:8/10The sound really added up to the whole experience,and made the anime more uncomfortable for the viewers(in a good way)to show the situation in which the girls are right now.Great voice acting,and I loved the background music used through the anime.Also catchy opening and a melancholy infused ending paired really well.By the way the op and ed change almost every ep so I recommend watching them every timeCharacter: 7/10I think some of the characters needed more development and that's why I didn't rate it too high.Except the main girl Yuki and Miki,the other two girls didn't show any progress.Kurumi is probably the most popular from the cast because of how badass she is with her shovel,aka the shove knight of the group,but I'm dissapointed a bit that she was just the muscle of the group and nothing more.I could talk a lot about the mental progress of Yuki and Miki but since this is a spoiler free review I'd like for you people to enjoy the show without knowing much.Enjoyment:Between 6-7To be honest I couldn't enjoy the show.I liked it a lot,but it was just too much for me because the show is a bit heavy for the feels.Young teenagers shouldn't go through this..I'm sorry Yuki,Miki,Kurumi,Yuuri.You didn't deserve this.I wouldn't recommend you this show if you're feeling depressed,or feeling sad from other reasons because for me the show felt a bit like the movie The Road,it just isnt good for your health and your mood.It is a good anime ,but watch it if you have a prepared comedy after each episode.Thanks for reading,Dark. and already spoiled the setting of the anime,I swear this anime had one of the best first episodes of the first year if you went in blindly..Story: 7/10A generic

If you want to be very shocked from the revelation in the first episode, stay away for now and read the review once you\'ve watched the first episode. If you haven\'t and will continue to read the review, let me tell you, YOU\'VE BEEN WARNED.)Remember Puella Magi Madoka Magica, which looked cute on the outside but had a dark twist on the inside? Well, Gakkou Gurashi is like that. One character completely denies that the dark twist is even happening, though, making this series even more of a mix of moe and...horror. I first heard of Gakkou Gurashi from a fellow MAL user whose review of the manga I have read, and when I found out there was an upcoming anime adaptation, I was pretty excited. Needless to say, this anime has not let me down.Let\'s talk about what Gakkou Gurashi is about; Yuki Takeya is a 3rd-year high school student who really loves her school. She hates studying, but she still has fun at school, with her friends and teachers. The best part, for her, is her club, the School Living Club, where the club literally lives at school. The other members are Kurumi Ebisuzawa, Yuuri Wakasa (a.k.a. Rii-san), Miki Naoki (a.k.a. Mii-kun), and Megumi Sakura (a.k.a., Megu-nee, she\'s the club\'s adviser). Oh, and don\'t forget the dog, Taroumaru. Okay, here comes the dark twist; truth is, the entire School Living Club are survivors of the zombie apocalypse. Yuki is completely oblivious to this fact, though, and she continues to live her school life as if there\'s nothing wrong in the world.Yeah, I warned you. Let me ask you this, though; how the heck am I supposed to explain what this anime is about without spoiling it?!Anyway, let\'s admit it, people. The zombie apocalypse theme has been used over and over again in many different formats, and with this anime and High School of the Dead, anime is no exception. Of course, there are plenty of moe anime, too. Combine those two, and it\'s actually a better mix than you may expect. There are plenty of horrific moments, but the moe elements that this anime has give us a bit of a break from those horrific moments. The characters are very fun to follow, too, and they gain a decent amount of development.The animation is very good. It\'s not the best animation, but it definitely knows when to use bright colors and dark colors; it really sets the tone of the anime. The music is also good. The OP, ""Friend Shitai"", remains the same throughout the entire anime, but what we see as it plays gradually changes as the series goes on. While this is good, whenever the opening plays, I just can\'t help but think, ""Okay, we know that this is not just some moe anime, so KILL THE HAPPY MUSIC ALREADY."" Both of the EDs are quite nice, too, especially ""Afterglow"" by Maon Kurosaki. I just loved that song!Overall, Gakkou Gurashi was an enjoyable anime. If you like both moe and zombies, watching this will give you a satisfaction to see both at once. Just don\'t think it\'s just one of them, though, because it\'s actually a mix of each other. horror.

When you start to watch a show that\'s supposed to be about the twists and turns and you\'re just sitting there predicting what\'s about to happen and getting it right, the show has failed to entertain me. I\'m about to get some messages telling me how I\'m wrong and how this show was ""ZOMG so dark and deceiving and KEWL and TOO DEEP FOR U TO UNDERSTAND"", but I don\'t care. Sorry not sorry.Look, I liked the first episode. But I wish I had stopped right after the first episode. That episode on its own would\'ve left me...satisfied, but it just kept going and getting more and more hard to watch. And not because of blood and guts.I adore slice of life anime. ""Azumanga Daioh"", ""Nichijou"", and ""Strawberry Marshmallow"" are some of my favorite series. Heck, I even tolerated ""Lucky Star"" well enough (except Patty. I hate Patty.

They keep saying how she is their ray of hope and how they can\'t possibly tell her anything that happens, but allowing someone to stay in denial in such a serious situation is NOT GOING TO HELP, IT IS GOING TO HARM.And you might be thinking of arguing with, ""yeah, Gingy, but when serious stuff happens, we can\'t let kids know. We have to distract them and keep them from knowing the darkness of the world"". Yeah, because they\'re kids. Yuki is the same age as the other girls, so why they keep putting her in denial makes little to no sense. She\'s not a child.I really tried to like this show. I really did.

It's nice to see a zombie show that isn't just entirely rolling in despair and horror but predictable plot twists, gimmicky devices and being over-hyped left me feeling like it was trying too hard to be different and overly emotional.You get a pretty good sense of what you're in for after the first episode which lleaves off with a good amount of tension and excitement but it feels like that fell short in the following episodes as we see more of the same without any real forward...momentum. A good chunk of the drama and conflict comes from flashbacks that explain how we got to the current events but serve more to make future plot twists predictable. It's not bad, it's actually pretty enjoyable but I think there was room for so much more.Sometimes the art felt like it relied too heavily on darkened filters and the contrast between cute and dark to force emotion. However, there were some pretty incredible things thrown in with subtle changes to the openings and endings each week as well as small, hidden gems tucked away into scenes that made the art interesting in it's own way.The characters do grow, they do face hardship and they do have to overcome something in themselves. I'm likely in the minority here but, even with that, I didn't find them enjoyable. It felt like they were too stereotypical to me and I didn't really find myself worrying about what could possibly happen to any of them.I am glad I caught this and I think it's likely one of the only zombie shows I'll watch all the way through. It's a good anime and it's worth picking up. I just wish they would trade in some of the gimmicks for a little more polish. momentum.

Not only...the girls are faced with an apocalypse at their hand, they also have to worry about the more pressing aftermath of the apocalypse: their infected classmates. Yet despite having these elements at play, the girls still find themselves reminiscing and reenacting their light-hearted highschool life which seemingly went unaffected by this disaster. This is why calling it a deconstruction of the SOL Moe genre is a little difficult, because as the viewer you get a good perspective of whatever is happening outside, yet inside the School-life clubroom, the girls never fail to enjoy their touching story of a rather atypical highschool life. It’s two different story that, when presented and interacts together, everything seemingly connect with each other to give form to an amazing narration and a deep level of suspense which pulls the viewer in to see how the story develops.A cool thing about Gakkougurashi is how the character interaction played out. Initially being introduced as typical archetypes, the girls are then placed into situations where their skills and knowledge interact with each other, ensuring each other’s survival and all the while forming an even bigger bond between them. Without each other covering for one another’s back after coming to an understanding of their weak and strong points, they wouldn’t have made it in one piece.As if it wasn’t hinted enough by all of the girls’ desire to graduate, Gakkougurashi is ultimately an anime about moving on. It isn’t about trying to be most badass zombie slayer, nor was it about betrayal and survival of the fittest, in fact, the anime version intentionally avoided this kind of subject because in one of the early chapter of the manga, there was a scene where Kurumi assumes that Yuuri has abandoned her because of the reluctant expression on her face as she looks a way while Kurumi was asking for help, only for such a thought to be interrupted by Yuuri’s clever method of exploiting the zombie’s attraction to sound. Obviously, this scene was rewritten to be cut out from the anime series, and for good reasons too, because something like that would have been perfect foreshadowing for themes of betrayals in a more extreme situation, but that’s not the point of the anime Gakkougurashi.Thematically, this is why the highschool club setting works so naturally well with Gakkougurashi: the girls doesn’t want to move on because the life that they knew so well was unexpectantly robbed of. Them staying behind in their highschool wasn’t just because of the convenience in which it provided but also because that it is presented to be the closet and most important thing to them before the world came tumbling down.The graduation in the final episode is full of meanings to support this sense of acceptance and moving on too, because graduation in itself is the act of moving away from an important time in your life, by holding a graduation for the girls, it essentially delivers a power message telling that they have also graduated from their need to rely on the highschool to cope with the world (of course, the more important reason here is because of the previous zombie invasion)Hell, every other visual representation in the final episode even supports this.  Especially Miki who finally find her friend who is unfortunately already infected but despite both her and the ending theme “We Took Each Other’s Hand” talks of regret of letting go of an important individual, she gave her a sad glance with a slight teary eye but did not carry a stronger emotion on her face, showing that she have come to terms with the way that this new world have to function in. And of course, all of this happened with the school standing behind their back as they make their way outside of the gate in search of the next survival base, having already grown stronger and moved on from their highschool life, ready for the outside world. the girls are faced with an apocalypse at their hand, they also have to worry about the more pressing aftermath of the apocalypse: their infected classmates.

Needless to say I was surprised and intrigued, so I resigned myself to wait the season out in anticipation of watching the series in bulk in a binge-watch situation in order to get the most out of it; in the end, I\'m pleased, interested, and satisfied with the end result.Story: Well, it\'s a black/white story of a group of characters being thrust into a dire situation that has a bit of mystery and a good dose of psychological trauma, all presented with a sort...of sugary glaze of ""moe,"" art, dialogue, and interaction. It can be freely argued that this mix doesn\'t work out well, but as a fan of David Lynch and Todd Solondz styled films, I can easily say I like the staggered mix of normality and trauma; it\'s not perfect, but the comedy is there as a set-up for a newer serious bit. I like that. The formula works for me.Art: It\'s ""moe,"" style throughout; nothing else to really say about that. The characters are drawn lively and the occasional moments of ""service,"" which do happen, (I will not deny this,) are, in my opinion, easily disregarded if you are watching this open-minded and looking for story. Animation is good, period.Sound: The intro is a trap, haha. I like that juxtaposition. The outro\'s vary, and I think there are about four different ones; each corresponds with ending emotion of the parent episode. I would like to point out that there are some moments, (helps to watch with head-phones for this effect,) that the music or sound corresponds with the viewers emotions. Think, ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" piano notes, though obviously not as profound. Just good arrangement, overall .Character: Well, with a group of girls, in anime, you get the usual mix, but I think that Yuki and Miki are the ones you should focus on. Miki is a natural foil to Yuki and it\'s interesting to watch their relationship evolve. The other supporters are good, and do also add the development and understanding of the relationships between characters, but if you are looking for a good contrast focus on the former two.Enjoyment: I like trasngressive film, I like deconstruction, and I like nice characters being tossed into difficult situations. I was satisfied with this showing. It almost brought back memories of,""When they Cry,"" with the fun art and dark story. I find that this show delivers on surprise value when you go in oblivious. The last 3 episodes, if you like the characters, should help elicit some emotion; tears may be too much, but I definitely felt a lump in my throat during the last episode, especially.Overall: This series was a surprise. I knew after previewing the first episode that I would want to watch this in my usual binge style and at the end of the day I was satisfied. The ending may feel a bit of a drag, but just put your feelings in the passenger seat and enjoy the last scene that leads towards hope and the future.

(School-Live!) shifts perspectives and situations at will, making for a unique experience that has the ability to leave viewers unsure of whether or not to smile or hold their breath.""A line drawn in blood, separating reality from fantasy.""Here are the show\'s genre tags: horror, mystery, psychological, school, and slice of life. This is easily one of the most contradictory, creative anime I\'ve watched in a while, but it blends all these genres together into a shocking combination. Many people, myself included, have seen better fight scenes, better jokes, better story lines. To say that Gakkougurashi does any of these with an expert\'s precision would...be false, but I found none of the story elements to be unbearable or cringeworthy. While some of the action or chase scenes seemed to be plot convenient or unrealistic, nothing seemed out of place. The story seems solid, and it definitely foreshadows future events well and forces the watcher to make connections.""Two palettes—light in one hand, and dark in the other.""After a while, it becomes easy to discern between ""Yuki vision"" and normal vision. I found myself unsure of which version of the world I was seeing: something imagined, or something real. Bright colors and cute characters are in stark contrast with the shadows, gore, and quote-unquote citizens lurking around every corner. Character designs are pleasant and memorable (Kurumi is my personal favorite), and fine details hint at plot elements and whatnot. One thing to watch out for is the opening and ending sequences. As the story progresses, so do they.""From cheerful to grim, and some dark foreshadowing.""Music and sound effects are a vital part of any film.

However, Gakkougurashi has the same problem as another very popular title: ""Clannad: Afterstory"". If you\'ve seen it, think back to that episode, where they insensitively played the cheerful ending song right after a major turning point in the story? If you don\'t know what I\'m thinking about, imagine someone cracking jokes and singing happily during a funeral progression where everyone else is mourning. If that metaphor doesn\'t do it, then I\'ll say it bluntly; it\'s normally a good idea to change the music to fit the current point in the story. The cheerfulness of the ending and next-episode preview break tension in the story, but bring the show full circle from slice of life to slice of life.

Don\'t be mad if the show adds insult to injury through song.""Yuki, Kurumi, Yuuri, Miki, Megumi, and Taroumaru.""The characters are what I consider the most important part of this anime, much like all others. It\'s not unusual to have a cast of four girls, usually filling out the main categories. Fortunately, none of the characters overdo clichéd stereotypes or archetypes. Four high-school girls, a teacher, and a dog are stuck in a post-apocalyptic world. None have any particular survival skills: Yuki is eternally cheerful and Kurumi can swing a shovel, but they\'re all ""mostly average"". What I find interesting, and the most rewarding aspect of the show, is the psychological interaction that goes on between the characters, their environment, and themselves. Escaping a harsh reality, making difficult decisions, being forced to make and break bonds... They\'re all common themes of a post-apocalyptic horror show. While the characters\' personalities aren\'t explored in depth, what redeems them is their relationships and emotions with the others. You can see the reasons behind their behavior, the things that are holding them back. An individual\'s logic and common sense say one thing, but their experiences and feelings may say another.""To enjoy, even while knowing the truth.""Whether or not this show is enjoyable is a moot point. Sure, it\'s a slice of life about school and cute girls and fun. It\'s also a horrifying story with extremely dark events. I found it hard to enjoy the casual and relaxed parts of the episode because of the previous\' events being on my mind. It definitely isn\'t a bad show, or one that isn\'t entertaining or gripping, because trust me—I found Gakkougurashi very, very interesting.

So well, that the serious side (spoiler: its zombies.) could have made a refreshing survival series on its own.The Moe moe highschool fun part greatly benefits from the setting (confined to highschool) but even so, it might be able to stand on its own against all the other such anime.So, it is the best of both worlds, complimenting each other, and making a delicious series.Animation is adorable/grim, solid, the pacing is devilishly well done (encourages...binge-watching), the depth of story is well researched, and it is simply convincing, with no need for suspension of disbelief. Highly enjoyable and unexpectedly clever binge-watching), the depth of story is well researched, and it is simply convincing, with no need for suspension of disbelief. Highly enjoyable and unexpectedly clever', 'Quick Disclaimer. Due to the nature of the show, I\'d highly recommend you at least watch episode 1 of Gakkou Gurashi if you haven\'t already, because in able to talk about the plot and stuff, it is near impossible to talk about this show without spoiling the twist that happens in the first episode. So be warned.People give the moe artstyle a bad rap. Yeah, sometimes it is nice to have some grittier backgrounds or character designs, but if it fits the setting well, than there really isn\'t wrong with it. It may not be your thing, but it isn\'t inherently bad. However, there are...a select few shows that take this artstyle and subvert it by making the viewer think you are watching a ""cute girl doing cute things"" anime. Gakkou Gurashi is definitely one of those shows, and for the most part, it makes it work.The best thing about this show is that it uses it\'s artstyle and it\'s slice of life moments to amplify the serious nature of the show. You could interpret the slice of life scenes in Gakkou Gurashi to be just that, slice of life. However, I think the major purpose of the slice of life scenes is subtly hinting that the characters are trying to put on a facade in a bad situation. Try to put a smile on your face to hide the fear that you have. The artstyle works in the same way. I wouldn\'tve been as creeped out if the character designs were more realistic or the artstyle wasn\'t bright (it does tone itself down when it needs to). When comparing the light and fluffy stuff like this to the stuff that is actually going on in the plot, it makes for some really unsettling scenes I could just be optimistic about this, but this is what I think the creator\'s intent was, and except for a few parts in the last 3 or so episodes, it works brilliantly.This setup with the artstyle and designs would not have worked if there weren\'t any decent dramatic and tense moments to accompany the slight hysteria that the former brings. And while these moments were a little few and far between, just a little, they actually work at making you feel a little uneasy, something that anime horror just doesn\'t do well most of the time.One last thing about the setting. I really appreciate the fact that the creators focused on the characters and their experience within a zombie apocalypse instead of actually focusing on the zombie apocalypse. The zombie genre is so overblown nowadays that we know basically what happens: get supplies, run from zombies and bad people, watch people you love die, etc. Gakkou Gurashi realizes that you know the basics of the zombie apocalypse setting and can jump right into the stories of the characters without needing to info dump about zombie apocalypses.The characters are a little bit disappointing honestly, but not by much. The characters aren\'t actually bad, but I feel that since there were only 5 actual characters that needed developing that they could have done a better job with them.The main focus, Yuki, was handled well, and how her whole dilemna surfaces, as well as how she deals with, was handled tactfully.Mii-kun really wasn\'t much of an interesting character, but her development was handled decently enough. Her backstory episodes were incredibly well done, though.Kurumi is easily the fan favourite of the series, and it\'s easy to see why. She kicks zombies asses with a shovel, what else could you possible want?Megu-nee was a decent character, but I feel her ""twist"" was handled poorly. They foreshadowed it so much to the point where it was obvious 4 episodes before it actually happened. Subtlety is definitely one the shows weaker points, which is evident with this character.And Yuuri Wakasa. Honestly, there isn\'t much to talk about with her. She is the least focused on and therefore the least interesting character. She has big knockers though, so who cares!Since I\'ve basically already talked about the art, let\'s move onto sound. The soundtrack really is not memorable, except for one absolutely heartwrenching song that replaces the ED in episode 4. It\'s a brilliant sendoff for that particular episode, and the song itself is both bleak and beautiful at the same time. It sounds like that slow 50\'s music, and it is just amazing.And I guess I have to talk about the opening as well. The song isn\'t really that great, but I have to give credit to Lerche for changing the animation for the opening as the anime went along. When a major key plot point arises in an episode, most likely the anime will accommodate for it in the animation for the next episode\'s opening sequence, which was a nice touch.Gakkou Gurashi does something that horror anime rarely does right, which is make you feel scared. When a dramatic scene pops up, you can feel the uneasiness come over you, at least a little bit anyways. This is one of the few adaptations that I can say improved over the manga in at least a few spots. Lerche did a great job adapting it up until the last 3 or so episodes. Those episodes felt either too rushed or too heavy on the SoL to really be that impactful to me. Also, there was way too much reliance on Deus Ex Machina for me to really give praise to the ending of this anime. There haven\'t been many good anime that have come out of 2015, but this is definitely one of them.

Second Season please.', '|||SOME SPOILERS|||Gakkougurashi! is an anime that deceives first impressions. It presents itself in the first episode as a generic moeblob SoL. However, by the second episode we realize that the show is in fact zombie/horror. The interplay of the two genres is the most unique aspect yet the biggest downfall of Gakkougurashi.From the beginning of the second episode, it is evident that the contrast of moe-horror is put there to shock us, and it is is in fact quite disturbing to see the delusions of the main character, Yuki, as she attends empty, blood-smeared classrooms and talks to characters who aren\'t there. Her energetic...and cheerful attitudes to the zombie apocalypse that she is unaware of are sometimes chilling, but most of the time they\'re simply annoying, as if the creators are trying to say ""this is a placeholder for a generic moe thing to say/do"".The biggest shortcoming of Gakkougurashi! is below the level of story/art/sound/character... It has proven that MoeSoL does not mix with zombie horror without a little direction. Take this keeping in mind that ""mix"" =/= ""transition"". While Madoka is an anime that transitions from innocent to dark, Gakkougurashi! continues to alternate genres throughout the show. This creates a surprisingly jarring experience and causes mental exclamations such as, ""Why are you cleaning the Effing water tank and treating it like a pool/bath/beach episode? There\'s survival shist to do!"" I think that he MoeSoL parts would have been a lot more interesting if they were designed to be ""creepy"" and ""fake"" (what I mean by ""direction""), but they are actually very generic and some are hopelessly sentimental such as the graduation scene. I understand what was trying to be achieved, but the execution falls into the (unfortunately) deep chasm before its goal.STORY:Gakkougurashi is a character-driven anime and doesn\'t really have a story except for the characters holding out against zombies and using their school as a shelter. Instead we\'ll focus on the storytelling style itself, which is generally done well. The handling of the timeline is done in a way that allows the teacher, Megu-nee, to be both in the story and absent from it at once; the structure of ""middle-beginning-end"" suits the show well and the Megu-nee plot twist is done well enough to become one of the two high points of the show (the other being episode 11). I don\'t mind flashbacks, and there are a lot in this show. However, they simply didn\'t fill in enough of the backstory to be worthwhile. STORY: 7/10ART:The animation didn\'t stick out as either good or bad. As long as it isn\'t noticeably bad, I never have a problem with animation. The art style is fine as well, and suits the cutesy setting. The thing that makes the art distinct is the color palette during flashbacks and during the higher-risk parts of the show. The washed-out color never really gets old for me, and the backdrops have a lot of detail which really contribute to the general mood. ART: 8/10SOUND:Sound is similar to art as in there\'s generally no problem if it works. There was nothing that stuck out in neither a good sense nor a bad sense. The OP is kind of meh, but I reckon they\'re taking the piss out of upbeat SoL openings. Music matters a lot more to me than art (my two favorite shows Kill La Kill and Cowboy Bebop have great soundtracks) and more time into sound would have probably resulted in a stronger show. SOUND: 7/10CHARACTER:The characters are generally not done well and all of them lack depth. However, my biggest problem is with Yuki herself, who is obviously mentally broken. The show wants us to take for granted that the only symptom of this is that she hallucinates people to life. Not only does the show not realistically explain how or when this happened (Because PTSD? Just after Megu-nee died?), it also assumes that she is perfectly normal otherwise. Anybody can tell that this is just odd, and the show could have had a lot of fun with creepy scenes(say, of Yuki alone in a classroom muttering to herself and covered in blood tearing the limbs off a teddy bear or whatever.) There are also times when it looks like Yuki finally sees a hole in her delusion and will begin to see the world for what it really is. This never happens and she comes in the next scene perfectly well and her delusion still as intact as ever. Mii-kun, in my opinion, is a great character who\'s complexity could have been explored a lot more. We are simply served up a semi-yuri relationship with another girl, Kei, who is soon killed and that is the basis for our character. The whole concept of ""beyond just living"" could have been a more prominent theme of Mii-kun\'s character and the show. The other two characters, Yuuri and Kurumi, had minimal backstory and were generally boring. Megu-nee is probably an interesting character but her role is kind of implied to be outside the setting of the show. CHARACTER: 5/10CONCLUSION:Gakkougurashi! is a show that is greater than the sum of its parts. What we\'re given is a unique idea and good concept that is executed generally okay. The show, while it has its flaws, managed to keep me engaged through its moments of twistedness and suspense, and kept me guessing what would happen next and who the characters were (I\'m still guessing). I\'m not going to lie. I did shed a tear at various parts of the show as some parts were truly sad, and I did feel a connection to the characters. Gakkougurashi! is an anime which has done an admirable job attempting to explore unique concepts. I hope shows in the future will build upon this concept.GAKKOUGURASHI!:  7/10 and cheerful attitudes to the zombie apocalypse that she is unaware of are sometimes chilling, but most of the time they\'re simply annoying, as if the creators are trying to say ""this is a placeholder for a generic moe thing to say/do"".The biggest shortcoming of Gakkougurashi! is below the level of story/art/sound/character...

I was not so lucky. But don\'t worry if you really want to read a review, there are no spoilers here.This series is what i would call ""GENRE BREAKING"" Gakkougurashi is to slice of life moe what Puella Magi Madoka Magica was to magical girl anime.This is a slice of life moe series to be sure with the typical school setting, but what makes it unique is the situation in which...these main characters have found themselves. Everything starts off as you\'d expect, bright and cheery. But sooner or later you begin to realize something is amiss, and when you do you\'ll also realize all the quirky and fun activities these girls take part in have a much more important purpose than simply having a fun and youthful school life. They start off fairly subtle with it but by about the mid point of episode 1 most people should begin to catch on to what might be happening with the visual cues. That is if the fact that they live at school and have a dog aren\'t enough of a clue already.The art is as you would expect from this genre of show, bright and colorful with fairly a simplistic art style along with some stereotypical character designs.In terms of writing they also use some fairly common character archetypes of this genre. From the the lead character whose a clumsy playful idiot, to the sporty fighter girl, calm collected and mature for her age motherly girl, the girl whose always worried, to the friendly teacher who really has no leverage as an authority figure, they hit most of the clichés. Oh, and also the trouble making sidekick pet.The music isn\'t particularly special but they do hit the right tunes to top off every moment.All in all it\'s a refreshing twist on a pretty stale genre. While it does stay bright and cheery for the most part, it gets a little deep and depressing at times. I absolutely recommend you give it a chance even if and especially if you absolutely despise moe. these main characters have found themselves.

From the the lead character whose a clumsy playful idiot, to the sporty fighter girl, calm collected and mature for her age motherly girl, the girl whose always worried, to the friendly teacher who really has no leverage as an authority figure, they hit most of the clichés. Oh, and also the trouble making sidekick pet.The music isn\'t particularly special but they do hit the right tunes to top off every moment.All in all it\'s a refreshing twist on a pretty stale genre. While it does stay bright and cheery for the most part, it gets a little deep and depressing at times. I absolutely recommend you give it a chance even if and especially if you absolutely despise moe.', 'The mixing of genres is a very common thing in works of fiction, but it goes without saying that they won’t always mix well. You could look at that peanut butter and chocolate, and say that it’s a great idea, but the peanut butter coated chocolate probably won’t be as big a success as the chocolate-coated peanut butter. What I’m saying with this delicious analogy, is that a bit of consideration needs to go into what you’re crafting, and if you put too much of one thing where you should have put another, then the end product isn’t going to be very good. In the...case of Gakkou Gurashi, the same thing can be said, and the question that shall be answered here, is whether we have a new merger on our hand.The story begins in Japan, because why wouldn’t it? A group of girls is a part of The School Live club, and lives in the school, as the name may suggest. Already this premise is strange, and it’s hard to imagine what sort of intentions will be behind it, until we get to the end of the first episode and see why living in the school is so crucial. It turns out that a zombie apocalypse has occurred, and these four girls and living in a well-equipped school, because they have little other choice.  At this point this are more or less a mix of two much-overused things, moe and zombies, but what really hooks you with the show is the psyche of one of the characters.Enter Takeda Yuki, our main character, and the typically bubbly girl you expect from this type of show. Through the first episode, we are literally led on a chase as we follow Yuki through the building (chasing a dog) and her behavior is markedly different from that of her lower classmate. It turns out that the zombie apocalypse has broken the poor girl, and in the relative safety of the school, she has forged a bubble around herself, living in an illusion where everything is all right, and anyone who might be dead, is actually alive. This premise is what roped me into the show, as I pondered when this girl broke and whether or not she’d remain that way and it gets increasingly interesting as we see how the other club members react. For once, the zombie apocalypse is taking a different approach, and it offers something that’s worth the time, unfortunately, the moe doesn’t really blend with that well, and so it feels like a lot our time is wasted.Where we should arguably have focused on navigating the deadly lifestyle, with a girl who doesn’t see the death, we are instead wrapped in her illusion with her, and can only glimpses the hostile world through breaks in her psyche. This is imaginative in a sense. It arguably places us in Yuki’s feet, and that would theoretically increase our immersion, but instead it feels like a waste of time, and too much of that time is paid to her delusion than to the world. Ultimately, the genres aren’t mixed. They’re kept in the same room as one another, but they occupy different sides, and when the do decide to talk; one is noticeably louder than the other is. It is interesting to see how the delusions manifest, but because they can manifest in a safe area (or in a place where we already know nothing is at stake), the anime is allowed to deliver its moe ham-fistedly with very rare moments where the natures join hand.Ultimately, Gakkou Gurashi had the potential to be something great, but preoccupations with other things present an unavoidable roadblock. It’s worth the watch to see how two entirely different things can come together, and as a cautionary display of how they come together poorly. It does have some interesting elements, but they seem worthless in the greater scheme of the project.

""Oh, another cute girls doing cute stuff."" but it\'s NOT. This show unexpectedly surprised me. I really enjoyed watching it til\' the end. The characters are likable and lovely. I love the osts of it as well. I just wish the ""ghosts"" were drawn more detailed like it was in the manga. But nonetheless, it was really good. I hope this will get a season 2 though but you can read the manga ^^...So, if you like some plot twists.. I totally recommend this one. I know you\'ll enjoyed it as much as I did.

If you want the full experience that this show has to offer, then I would suggest not reading ANY reviews, this one included, until you\'ve watched this series. In fact, don\'t even read anything beyond the plot synopsis, not even the genres.

What initially appears to be a slice of life loli fest becomes, by the end of the first episode, a psychological horror. It centers around the ""school living club"" (later revealed to be the survivors of the outside apocalypse), and their daily activities.STORY (7/10):The zombie apocalypse trope is hardly anything new. School life anime is also not original to this show. This plot\'s strength lies in hugely subverting the viewer\'s expectations. The producers cleverly leave hints about how not everything is what it seems before the huge reveal at episode 1. This is the first plot twist, though it is not the last. The change in plot truly keeps you on your toes and makes the show really rather unpredictable. Furthermore, the plot twists themselves are presented in such a way that they are shocking revelations rather than just underwhelming reveals. I was incredibly impressed by the way the plot was utilised and presented, and this was easily one of the major strengths of this series.However, I do have 2 complaints which unfortunately detract from an otherwise impressive story. Firstly, there was far too much filler. I get it, the contrast between the horrifying apocalypse and the quaint school life needs the slice of life element to work. However, this sometimes seems to be at the expense of progressing the plot. Unlike real slice of life anime, this anime does have a plot, and while the filler often successfully lulls you into a false sense of security to hammer home the horror of the plot twists, there was so much that the plot was, for a large part of the series, just stagnant.This brings me to my next issue: the ending. After the dynamic events of episode 11, we see a very sudden cooldown and the final episode offers little conclusion whatsoever. If you\'ve read the manga you may agree that there was perhaps a better stopping point (I won\'t say exactly what as I want to avoid spoilers where possible), which couldn\'t be reached because, as aforementioned, there was just far too much filler for the plot to progress to this point. The last episode itself was even just nonsense filler which did little to progress the plot other than to offer some kind of weak conclusion to the series. Even some explanation for the events of the series (which, in my opinion, is much better expanded upon in the manga) would have been good. What they do at the end, where they\'re going, what the future has to hold is massively uncertain in the given ending.These are 2 major issues are a huge shame, because they should have been easy to fix, and the rest of the plot is generally well executed.ART (9/10):The art is quite appropriate for this series. It is an art style reminiscent of many more innocent, slice of life type shows and this lulls the audience into a false sense of security, which again makes the plot twists even more shocking. In stark contrast, the zombies are grotesque and creepy. It is a contrast that works nicely in tandem with the overarching ""moe slice of life, except not really"" theme.The atmosphere given by the art also changes based on the mood very effectively, and makes the slice of life aspect more believable, and the horror aspect more eerie.Something that was a big plus for me was the attention to detail in the opening. Little details change every week based on the events. This was a really nice touch and not something you\'ll see often.SOUND (10/10):The sound was very well done. Good voice acting, with convincingly quaint tracks for the slice of life moments in contrast to much more sinister sounding tracks during the eerier moments, with distortions and sounds switching through ears being effective enough to almost make you nauseous. Very effective sound overallCHARACTER (6/10):The characters themselves were fine. You had many of the stereotypical slice of life character categories which fool the audience into believing that this really is a slice of life. However, there is little to be said aside from this. One character in particular, the main character herself, is really rather annoying. Although her delusions are what brings interest to the plot, the actions that result from said delusions can be really rather frustrating simply because of how nonsensical and counterproductive they are. She is so beyond a liability that you have to feel sorry for the other characters. Speaking of the other characters, although they are fairly stereotypical, they’re certainly likable.ENJOYMENT (8/10):Although the filler could get boring, the sense of unease kept me constantly on edge throughout my viewing of this series. You never could quite predict when the next gut-wrenching reveal out outburst could occur, and it made for really quite the eerie atmosphere.

I have never been a fan of these Emotional tugging stories. I'm also not a fan of the overused genre of Zombies. But i forced myself into this so i wouldn't keep putting this off. I did very much enjoy this in the end but i probably wouldn't want to watch it again if asked.It is one of those show's that are good and fun to watch the first time. But once you know everything then it doesn't...have the same effect as your first time watching it.I'v never really enjoyed Zombie media's, Just because i find it so unrealistic it's unbearable. I can suspend my disbelief that Zombies start appearing. But i find it annoying that when you think of it. The military of any Post Cold War nation shouldn't have too many problems. Places like Japan,America,Russia, Ect... They all have armored vehicles that no human would be able to tear apart. The Lightly Armored Humvee's wouldn't have any problem. Let alone Massive Tanks. Helicopters and Planes are way above the ground and don't have to worry, Unless the Zombies get their hands on Stinger missiles. I doubt any Army would even deploy Infantry troops. This is something that just bugs me about how every Zombie media i'v seen has the Military unable to do anything.~~Spoilers~~Everyone said's you should go into certain Animes and Manga's blind.

It's not that surprising.It is nice how they have the MC have these delusions that the world is still the same and nothing is wrong.There are some things i didn't like. Such as the characters ( Kei & Megumi ) Both being dead. I really wished that Megumi was still alive. Such as her being zombiefied but still able to operate as a normal human or even have her saved by the vaccine in the end. Same With Kei. We are given a glimpse of what looks like Kei as a zombie when the cast leaves the school.I get wanting to be serious. But i honestly think the show may have benefited better if those two were both alive in the end or at least Megumi.This show does put you on the edge of your seat. You never know what's actually gonna happen. Any moment one of the characters have a real chance of dying. This is even made more extreme when we have a character who is living in her own fantasy world. Completely oblivious to the zombies, Means she can get herself into danger any moment.

Granted, I had been spoilered for the basic premise so knew what I was getting into on that front, but regardless, thought it would be handled sloppily and immaturely (like some others I could mention).I’m glad I was wrong. It’s really hard to say without spoiling, but I’m going to try on the off chance that you’ve read this without actually reading the synopsis on MAL first.The characters were developed well, some more than...others. I will say I really didn’t like Yuki, the MC, but I could understand her. (It really didn’t feel like she was a high school student though.) The other 3 main characters started off quite one-dimensional but gained more depth simply as more of the surroundings were explored, and you could get a better glimpse of what they were dealing with on a daily basis. They did grow as people through their struggles, Yuuri-San in particular felt much older than her age sometimes. The backstory was brought in at exactly the right time, and to amazing effect.I felt that the premise it was actually handled quite realistically (not that I’ve ever experienced anything remotely like what happened in this anime, but it was consistent with other decent literature I’ve read on the subject). Your perspective really changes once you realise that everything they do, all their cute antics, are just to maintain a semblance of normality that will allow them to retain their sanity, and it makes you wonder if you would do as well in their shoes. (Oops, that was kind of a spoiler, but an unavoidable one.)Sound was good and art was good. No complaints on either of those two. Normally I’m not one for the ‘cutsey’ art style, but I can understand why it was needed here.There was quite a big shift in tone right at the very end. It was nice (if a bit rushed), but it also undermined a lot of the build up in the rest of the show. Maybe I just found it disappointing because I was expecting it to take a vastly different turn. Either way, it felt a little out of place, and did make me lower my score a notch.But all in all, this anime was a pretty good attempt at its genre. Why didn’t I rate it higher? Because I didn’t think it was THAT good. It didn’t feel like a masterpiece or anything. The series was enjoyable, but there wasn’t much to it apart from the premise (though, in its defence, I don’t think there was meant to be). And whilst I liked the characters and thought their stories were done well, the show didn’t make me that emotionally invested in them. Yes, I could appreciate them, and empathize with them to an extent, but nothing similar to what I felt in Shinsekai Yori or Zankyou no Terror. It was more a feeling of dread for their situation, an ‘insert yourself’ anime. Which is great, but as it’s not what the show was aiming for, it wasn’t a positive here.Still, let me reiterate, it did impress me for what it was (enough to give it a 7, anyway), and I’d recommend you give it a go if you like cute girls dealing with the struggles of daily life - and then some.

I honestly wish I could have given it a slightly higher score, however, problems with a few of the characters, a bit of the story, and a few minor things with the art prevent me from awarding it that.First off, the characters. It took me a while to realize this, but most of the...characters don't have much going for them. Yuki is an exception due to her unique situation, and Miki, although defiantly not the best character, also has some decent development. However, characters like Kurumi and especially Yuri don't have the best development and are almost completely cliché. They don't have enough focus on their backstories, development, and just how they act and change (or well....development.) With this said, Kurumi was still a fun character to watch and had slight development to her. As for Yuri......meh.The story was good. I, for the most part don't have much to complain about except for one thing that really bugged me. I can't really go into much details because spoilers....so I will say this.I was slightly confused with what Yuki's was thinking was during the mid point of the series (involves her freaking out and running out of the room after the mall trip.)I hope you guys who seen it know what I'm talking. I'm trying extremely hard to avoid any spoilers.Also, some people found later plot twists slightly obvious. I wasn't one of them, but I could see why someone would think this.The music was good. It fit the mood and the op was KAWAII! The art was good and consistent, but my goodness there was one scene where an emotional moment was high by fan service. (I'm specifically talking about that scene with Miki and her friend in the mall.) I'm not against fan service, but that was a scene where Miki really should have worn pants or her usual skirt. However, in the grand scheme of things, this isn't major.In general, this series was good although has a few issues that should have been smoothed out. Despite these flaws, I have no problems in fully recommending school-liv... I mean Gakkou Gurashi characters don't have much going for them.

Despite these flaws, I have no problems in fully recommending school-liv... I mean Gakkou Gurashi"", ""So admittedly, I primarily want to focus on one common criticism of the show rather than offer a normal review. I recommend Gakkou Gurashi to anyone, it's very well directed, has a generally strong cast, offers a satisfying emotional payoff, and is very bingeable. It's well made art and I think it has one of the most interesting premises and first episodes in the medium of anime. If you want to know more of my specific feelings on the show, be warned that everything below contains spoilers and is much easier to understand with the full context of the show.--SPOILERS--There is a common critique of...this show, that its blend of moe and horror create too much of a contrast and leave the viewer distracted from what they perceive to be more pressing matters. Now, I cannot convince one to begin liking something that didn't necessarily resonate with them. But I do want to play critical defense for this show, particularly on this point. I believe that Gakkou Gurashi, a show about four moe characters creating a school club to distract themselves from a bitter reality, entirely relies on its cast attempting to emulate what would be an otherwise harmless slice of life venture.Gakkou Gurashi is about escapism and not forgetting what's really important. But because the main protagonist, Yuki Takeya, falls into a state of PTSD induced psychosis, she creates a delusion that rejects their reality of a zombie apocalypse. As a result, these two themes are at odds with one another throughout the show. Because escapism inherently rejects reality, falling too deep into escapism will ultimately result in losing a grip on what's important. However, escapism is also how the group maintain their sanity. Yuki's mind reacting to her trauma is a defense mechanism and the group use Yuki as a lens so that, they too, don't have to face a constant state of depression, anxiety, etc. So while escapism eventually leads to losing one's self, it's also somewhat of a necessity to get through life on a day to day basis.The show's themes are directly tied to the show's genre and atmosphere. The horror, this being the zombies and apocalypse, are a representation of reality. The slice of life, this being club activities and light hearted comedy, are a representation of escapism. The reason this is the case, is that Gakkou Gurashi recognizes a need for both. Without escapism or dreaming of a better life, one may easily slip into nihilism as they find the world to be unfairly cruel. Without accepting reality, one may find themselves eventually forgetting what's truly important.So then, what does Gakkou Gurashi have to say, ultimately? By the end, it becomes much more clear. Reality will always exist around you, no matter how far you fall into escapism, reality will eventually come crashing down around you and when it does, it's up to you to face it. Throughout the entirety of the show, zombies are constantly visable in the background or reflected off glass. By episode 10, the zombies pour into the school. By episode 11, zombies destroy what was their home the entire show, and divide everyone.But because Yuki is able to realize that her friends are what matter most, she's able to open the literal/metaphorical door and cross over into reality in order to save the club. Yuki realizes the club, her vehicle for escapism, cannot exist without its members. By the final episode, Yuki is not only able to remember important things she'd forgotten, but she's also able to relay what she had learned from her revelation.Putting on a smile when one doesn't need to, betrays one's true feelings. By bottling up these feelings, one loses touch with what matters to them. Essentially, putting on a facade to act as if everything is ok, is not only a rejection of one's literal reality, but also the reality of one's honest feelings. To embrace reality is to reach emotional maturity.That is the lesson I saw in Gakkou Gurashi. But the delivery of such a message works because it's done through an empathetic approach. The show illustrates that moments of escape are necessary and showcases why someone would fall into escapism. It's not met with harsh criticism, but its main character, Yuki, reaching a logical conclusion and growing as a person from her experience. Gakkou Gurashi conveys its message naturally with a strong emotional payoff, a delivery and payoff that could not exist without the genre dichotomy. So while I can understand if someone did not enjoy the show juxtaposing these flavors, I think it's important to realize that the show could not exist or reach its conclusion without doing so.There's also plenty more to recognize, in terms of the direction, when the message of the show is understood. Upon reflection/rewatches, I began to notice consistent visual motifs such as light being enveloped by darkness, shots from outside of windows looking in, flowers slowly dying as the show progresses, as well as hard cuts from tender moments to somber/shocking imagery. There are many moments where the reality of their situation tries to rear its decomposing head, either being in distant background shots or on the opposite side of a window, to as subtle as the number of footsteps being heard in particular moments. Realizing the purpose of the slice of life scenes also allow for moments like the dress up montage to make perfect sense.It's the show, itself, distracting viewers from the reality of the situation to indulge in a bit of escapism along with the girls. Assuming the viewer allows themself to experience these moments from the perspective of its cast, then the moments where Yuki breaks out of delusion become more concerning and leave the viewer questioning whether or not they should want Yuki to stay in a delusional state. This puts the viewer in the same moral quandry as the rest of the group, debating whether or not they should aid Yuki in indulgence and how its selfish to do so but, at the same time, difficult to decide how it should be addressed.Again, these elements of the story exist as a result of Gakkou Gurashi's blending of genre. I could add more to these details, believe me. I never even touched on how zombies function, Kurumi dehumanizing the zombies, Yuuri's facade paralleling Yuki's, and how all of that relates the show's thematic core. There is more to unpack. However, I think I've made my case.-There is no such thing as a perfect show, what matters to me, is how much a show can accomplish. Gakkou Gurashi provides an experience that's equally endearing and funny as well as, grim and depressive. I've never had a show slam me with an emotional reaction so strongly, consistently, and repeatedly. I've never been so thoroughly impressed by a show's attention to detail and how that detail tied itself to the themes and emotional core of the show. I will fully admit, Gakkou Gurashi is a show made for me, it's not going to resonate with everyone, but I'll be damned if I leave this show unfairly criticized for accomplishing what it set out to do. Whether or not you end up enjoying the ride, I hope you can at least recongnize the strength of its craftsmanship. this show, that its blend of moe and horror create too much of a contrast and leave the viewer distracted from what they perceive to be more pressing matters.

(The Anime is even better if you dont read anything about it and just watch it - test subject was my sister xDD)I loved the characters which are really cute and lovely drawn.The best - and probably also the scariest thing about the Anime is the Anime opening, that changes every episode (so make sure you don't skip it!).And if...you think this Anime is really boring at the start and think is is just a regular school Anime with cute little girls that love their school life - keep watching. It will change soon. you think this Anime is really boring at the start and think is is just a regular school Anime with cute little girls that love their school life - keep watching.

It wasnt like it was amazing or it was total crap but it was just plain.Also the zombies looked like huge piles of poop which could\'ve been improved.The same applies for sound.There wasnt any soundtrack which was creepy af.Character: 4The first thing I would\'ve done if I were in such a situation is to take that freaking shovel and kill that pink head and that useless dog.I mean they only exist to consume food supplies and bring trouble.And it was surprising to find Shovel-chan not doing that.I also learned that you can drive a car just my playing NFS line of games.Seriously who the heck would think ""There are zombies outside,lets clean the tank and have a swim in the pool.""There were not many characters but that pink head was really annoying.But also it was fun watching her as her mental insanity made this anime more interesting.Enjoyment: 7This anime sure had its moments but honestly I an never imagine anyone ever doing the stuff that these girls do while in such a situation.The ending was actually pretty good,not the song but the way they perfectly summarize stuff in those pictures while the credits were rolling.These minute details made this anime enjoyable.Overall: 7This anime is not for all audiences.Not many people may like a depressing(apparently) show like this one but overall if you overlook the stupid stuff they do in the first few episodes, it turns out to be quite interesting.Also Mii-kun looked exactly like totsuka saika ;) . what the actual f are these girls are doing in such a situation,I mean there was an episode where they go to a mall to get some supplies but later end up in a shop buying dresses.The first 5 to 6 episodes were not that good where they do stuff like that while having zombies waiting at the school\'s main door,sounds fun.But later around 8th or 9th episode it gets darker.Also most of the comments for this anime on the site I watched said that it was depressing but I dont think it was that depressing to the extent that you start crying after watching it(I maybe wrong on this one due to my ability to remain emotionless to a large extent).The ending was kind of unsatisfying, more like your mainstream happy happy ending\' although it would have been much better if everyone died in the end.Art and Sound: 5The art was ok.

The story has a very good concept and is executed very well anyway. the cause of the conflict is still a mystery it makes me more excited to watch it. Many of the past are unexpected so it always gives interesting surprises. Shows that touch my feelings or even make me shed tears are always worth 10/10.

This show is very well done, even if it fails a bit as an adaptation. I'm more of a manga person myself so I'd say read the manga. The detailed drawings add a lot more.You can't avoid spoilers when reviewing this show so GO WATCH IT BLINDStory- 10I already love zombie stories and the idea of camping out in a school during the apocalypse is already a good setup. The story is less about killing zombies and gore, and more about the daily activities of the gang as they try to shelter Yuki. Whenever they have...to face zombies or something horribly depressing and traumatic happens, your heart will drop and you may burst into tears. This show has its lighthearted moments to keep it interesting and to keep the story from becoming so depressing that you can't watch it anymore. That's not to say that it's lighthearted. It walks the line very well and I appulade the creators for being able to pull that off.One of the characters is there from the beginning when in the manga they show up in the second volume. Having them from the start makes the mall scene lose some oomph.Art- 8A solid 8. The cutesy style of the main characters contrasts well with the dreary backdrops. Comparing to the manga, the emotions in the anime can be a little less intense but I can't really fault the animators for that. The animation is nice. Nothing too experimental or amazing, but good enough to not be jarring.Sound- 6The sound design doesn't really stick out in any way. The opening is very average and annoying, but purposefully so. I wonder what it would be like to go in entirely blind. The opening would definitely give you the idea that its a cute moe anime and then all of the sudden you get hit with zombies.Characters- 9None of the characters fit my taste exactly. They are a lot more mellow to fit the strangely iyashikei (and dark as hell) vibes.Yuki acts very cute and cheery. She's the kind of character that I would probably punch if she didn't have depth. (SPOILERS) However once you find out that everything is a delusion and its just her trying to block out trauma, she becomes a character that I genuinely want to protect. Her breaks in her delusions are heart wrenching. She's such a well written character.Kurumi is a tough girl who falls a bit into the schoolgirl thug category. Her obvious concern for her fellow friends is very touching. Not one of my favorites but she's great nonetheless.Ri is kind of the caring MILF character. I don't remember her standing out, but she wasn't an unpleasant character.Naoki is my favorite of the core characters. Her personality is your usual shy, withdrawn type which can be cute out of context. Once you know why she's more withdrawn *inhales deeply* its no longer cute. I don't remember if they had this scene in the anime, but the second volume includes a scene at the start that gives me chills. I get that dark gut feeling ya know. Ugh I just love NaokiMegumi is pretty similar to Ri. I like her for giving Yuki support throughout.Enjoyment- 10An obvious 10. This show is easy to just sit down and binge. It takes you through the motions.The anime doesn't really reach my top ten but the manga is definitely in my top ten.

But it also has its horror elements you know with the zombies but not just that when ever a scene starts to get scary the lighting of the whole show changes from bright and colorful to dul and eary.

The show in my opoin combinds these factors in so well thats it's turly amazing.The last couple of episodes are the most intense epiodes i have ever seen in a show. It goes from happy to scary to down right depressing. I won't spoil the ending for you sences it's just too good to miss. The ending of the show does become happy after the sad moment happens but dang man.Over all this show is just an amazing show and I highly recommend if you haven't seen it yet to go and give it a watch. Heck even if you did you should still give it a watch again that's how good this show is!I give School live a 10 out of 10!!!

I don't think knowing the twist or not knowing the twist of the first episode made any difference in my overall experience with the show.So thoughts on the show? I thought it was fine. It had the potential to be more but it was fine enough.Some things didn't like:I think far too much of the show's focus was put into Yuki's delusion. Don't get me wrong, I really do...think it's interesting to explore the mind of someone who's gone through a psychotic break during an apocalypse but I don't think the show handled it the best. The events leading up to Yuki's psychotic break were shown through flashbacks. Now that in itself would be fine, but we don't get a real insight into Yuki's past until the final few episodes. I think if we were shown more flashbacks through the other girls' perspectives maybe shown in conjunction with the false memory Yuki could have come up with to cope, I think that would have been much more interesting. But what we got was very little by comparison.This is a smaller criticism but Miki would have made more sense to be written as a girl who wasn't from the school the show takes place in. After a certain point, Miki starts questioning the true function of the school as it seems unreasonably high-tech and perfectly suited for this exact apocalypse. As I said, this is a smaller complaint, but why would Miki just then start questioning the true motives of a school she had presumably already been attending for some time? If she were a true outsider, it would make more sense for her to be suspicious of the school as she wouldn't have been from there.Also, I think the censorship of the gore was to the show's detriment. I don't think I was genuinely worried or scared for the girls at any moment in the show. The zombies don't feel like an omnipresent threat to the girls. For most of the series, there are zombies right outside the school grounds but you never really feel like the girls are in any immediate danger. And then when the girls are near the zombies, they're able to navigate around them with ease. The only exceptions are when any of the girls find themselves surrounded by the zombies. And even then, you don't have any sense that the girls are in any sort of danger because the zombies aren't lunging at any of the girls. Furthermore, never seeing any of the zombie's full faces or bodies in detail also made it difficult to perceive them as a threat to the girls. Overall, it left me feeling like there was a lack of stacks for most of the show.I could find more to pick apart from the show but like I said initially. I think it's fine for what it is. Would I watch it again? Probably not. This is a very safe anime, with very little challenge to walk away with. think it's interesting to explore the mind of someone who's gone through a psychotic break during an apocalypse but I don't think the show handled it the best.

Please watch episode 5 if you didn't because it will help you understand this review.Have you ever wanted to spook yourself? Ever wanted to get a lot of waifus? Or maybe wanted to have some cuteness and spookiness? This anime is for you! Gakkou Gurashi tells a story of a fourteen-year-old girl named Yuki. Yuki is a cute girl that is miserably failing her class, being in a club with her friends, and also has a cute dog! And also has a hot teacher. Let me get into the point of this review really quickly.Story: 7/10Gakkou Gurashi is a zombie anime with not-so-cutesy...elements already. Everything starts off in a mall. The fucking mall where everyone gets infected by the virus. People then start eating each other. Hear me out, I love zombie animes, and Gakkou Gurashi is a perfect example for this one.Art: 6The art of the anime is very cute and great and it had so much potential, but it wasn't beautiful as much. I don't mind though. It did make the anime a lot creepier too.Sound: 10Dear God, the sound of this anime is so great and beautiful. Go upon, and listen to the endings. Not the opening. To the endings. The opening will spoil you so don't watch it early because I did the mistake!Character: 6All of the characters in the anime weren't bad. They were all good, they weren't annoying and they weren't so typical. They had a lot of great designs. The thing that cons in me in this anime is, is that Moes don't really come up with a dark anime. I'm sorry but it was a minus for me to this one.Thought, our moes were very cute and beautiful and did some cute things!Enjoyment: 10This anime hit me very differently. It isn't really that cutesy as you can possibly imagine. It made me laugh, scream, pee, cry, and be happy. The lack of the deepness of the show was dropping me into tears and cries.Summary time~Overall: 10GakkouGurashi is an anime that will possibly make you cry and think if we are valuable.

Slice of life aspects felt too dominating. The psychological horror aspects felt too weak. There was very little tension or stress in the majority of the episodes. Little exploration of how the characters respond to their predicament besides on a shallow level. They had a cool thing going on with one of the girls. I would've liked to seen how the other girls cope with maintaining a facade of normality around her while dealing with survival related stress and hormones. There was really no character development for half of the major characters despite a majority of the episodes...dedicated to telling their backstories.Felt like a moe blob slice of life with some zombies. This took me off guard a bit because I came into watching this expecting a lot of psychological horror. Still mildly enjoyable but it could've been more. dedicated to telling their backstories.Felt like a moe blob slice of life with some zombies.

Because this review will spoil the first episode. This anime in general is full of surprises, it looks simply on the outside, but the story has a deeper meaning to it.The Video Review is up on my Channel, but here is the written Review.Story - 9/10Our story starts as 4 generic moe school girls are spending their time at school. There is an airhead, tomboy, serious girl and a big sister, also there is a dog. Sounds pretty generic so far, here is the twist, they form the...School Living Club meaning they live at their school. Wait why do they live at their school? Everything seems fine at the start, but then reality kicks and it turns out these girls are living in a zombie apocalypse. How’s that for a twist.  The story tells the beautiful and hopeful story of 4 girls trying to enjoy their last days of school. What I mean is despite, the circumstances the girls live in, they try to go on about their lives as normal as possible as if nothing happens, and it tells this beautiful story that no matter how bad things are, there is always hope. The reason why the girls try to act normal as possible, is because Yuki has pretty much lost it, and decides to not to see the reality of all the bad things, however, because of her joyous personality, the other girls play along with her, as it also gives them that needed break from the horrors.Now the story is not told exactly in order, so the pacing feels off, but at the same time it felt like it was done on purpose to really throw us off. There is a mixture of light hearted plots to more serious intense plots, but during the light hearted moments, it really feels like it was dragging on, because the interesting parts of the plot are during the dark and serious times. Also the ending felt too convenient, and there is quite a bit of plot holes in the ending, but overall the story is executed very well, with twists and turns.Characters - 9/10The main character is Yuki Takeya, a cheerful, airheaded childish girl. Funny enough she is oldest out all the main girls, and she is an upperclassmen, while the others a underclassmen. The biggest difference about her character is that she doesn’t see the world for it is, and still thinks everything is normal in her eyes, and the first episode pulled this off perfectly, as we got to see what Yuki sees before we the reality of the world. She doesn’t possess any particular talent, but her presence is much needed for the rest of the group, as she provides the them with relief, as they take a break from the apocalypse. And I love her character development, because as the show goes on, she starts to notice reality as we draw closer to the conclusion, and it’s plainly visible how strong she grows, after her initial appearance.Kurumi Ebisuzawa, aka best girl, is the tomboy of the group. While also being the dedicated badass. She is usually sent on doing the more dangerous stuff, because she is quickest to adapt to the situation. With her trusty shovel, she protects the group from the zombies. I love how she is shown to be the strongest one of the group, which she is, but she is also at the same time vulnerable, because deep down, she is still just a young girl, and we get to see what breaks her.Yuuri Wakasa plays the big sister role of the School Living Club, while also the club’s president. She acts as all motherly towards everyone, as she is usually very calm and mature. She cooks for everyone and keeps all their supplies and resources in check. Even though she puts up a strong and resilient front, when she breaks down, she really breaks down mentally; she is probably, surprisingly the most unstable member of group.Miki Naoki, is the last member of the School Living club, as she joined last. Her past is revealed later along the line. She plays the role of the straight girl, she doesn’t understand Yuki’s situation entirely and is confused whenever around her. When the group first picks up Miki, she is initially shy and fragile, however over the course, she gains more confidence around her, as she finds something to fight for, and realises what she has.The other supporting characters are Taomaru a dog, the group picked up along with Miki. And Megumi Sakura, their teacher, who suggested the idea of forming the club in the first place. I love the fact that all the characters play a role of helping each other out, and it’s those interactions really bring out the best of each character, and it shows how their relationship affects their decisions and personalities. I love the fact we get to see what breaks the characters, because these girl’s put on a deceiving cute, cheerful front.Animation and Sound - 8/10, 7/10If there is one thing that is very noticeable about the art style is that it’s really deceiving and clever. The characters and world is drawn in a very cutesy and moe art. The characters all look moe, and it’s very contradicting to the whole apocalypse atmosphere. What I love about the art is how it separates Yuki, from everything else. Something noticeable is Yuki’s outfit, which bright pink whereas the others a green, and if you were to index them, the green outfits become pink, while the pink becomes green, it’s so cleverly done and hidden. Unfortunately there is not a lot of zombie action, in fact the majority of the time, you don’t see the zombie clearly. Again this also done cleverly, the zombies are covered in black clouds at first, but as the anime goes on towards the end, they become clearer, indicating that Yuki, is drawing closer to reality, and it’s amazing how they did that with the art. There are simple animations, but the art style in general, is all they really need to give impact. The only thing I don’t like what the animation decides to do from time to time is show fan service, especially if it’s either supposed to be an emotion scene or just for the sake of doing it, because, the art style does not benefit from fan service.The score of anime is ok, and it does its job, there is some nice soothing music along the line, but nothing really stands out and adds to the atmosphere of scenes. The opening is quite enjoyable if you like upbeat music, it’s very cute and upbeat which is a contrast to the show in general, however, I do like how the opening animation changes each time as we draw closer to the finale. The endings are a much slower paced and fits very well with the show. Both song have this sad vibe towards them, but at the same time it lifts your hopes up, and somewhat becomes a happy song about hope. And I love that about endings, giving signs of hope.Enjoyment - 9/10At first I did not care that this anime looked cute and moe, because I don’t mind the art style at all. But the fact that they were able to surprise me from the very first episode with that twist, I was all in to watch every episode as soon as it came out. Because I really want to know how these girls are surviving. And at the same time it tells a beautiful story of hope. There is quite a bit of slice of life moments, which can drag on, leaving you waiting for the more interesting serious parts of the show. But I would consider the genre a slice of life first, before it’s a supernatural horror. The characters are really entertaining to watch, and it’s good to see how each one of them develop over the course of the anime, by trying to survive in their dire situation. Even though the slice of life moments drag on sometimes, they are much needed to show us that their still hope, even facing dangerous situation. And I love this anime for that.Verdict - 8.5As we draw closer to the end of the review, I give the story a 9. Because the story is beautiful and I love stories about hope. The fact the twist at episode 1 pulled me into the show immediately. It’s definitely an interesting and unique concept, that pulls off their twists very cleverly. There are moments that drag, and the ending felt a bit overly convenient, but it’s still a good story in general.For the animation and sound, I give it a 8 and 7. The animation and art style is cleverly done, contrasting the moe art style to the horror theme. The way they show Yuki’s vision is done so cleverly as well. The animation is simple and there is a quite a bit of unnecessary fan service. The soundtrack is nothing special, and nothing really stands out. But I love the upbeat opening, and the sad to happy endings of the anime.The characters get a 9 from me. Every character is shown a soft side, but they are also shown a weak side. And they all play part in each other’s lives and given plenty of development of the course, by showing all their strengths and weaknesses.For my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 9. From the very episode twist, I was hooked onto the show. I like my moe once in a while, but when they throw this wrench in my face, I couldn’t keep my eyes of screen and was excited for every episode every week. I love stories about hope, and the characters development was very interesting.So for the overall score after rounding it up, I give School-Live! an awesome score 8.5/10. It was my  favourite anime of the Summer 2015 season. I recommend this anime to any fans of the moe genre, because despite the twist, it has enough elements from that genre to be enjoyable. I recommend this anime fans who are looking for a story of hope and supernatural fans at the same time. It’s not necessarily a horror, but it has elements to it which adds to the atmosphere.

It’s not necessarily a horror, but it has elements to it which adds to the atmosphere.', 'Gakkougurashi is about a group of girls who found shelter during a zombie invasion in their school, with one of them suffering denialism and living a normal school life.First, without any spoiler:Overall I\'d say that the series is fine but not very original; it doesn\'t take any risk. The main protagonists are schoolgirls and they have to deal with zombies... It sounds just like the beginning of a bad joke. It\'s easy for us weeaboo to feel worried about schoolgirls as we\'re used to see them literally everywhere.Surprisingly enough though, it is a really serious show that can sometimes be really sad or stressful and...that\'s a really good point. Moreover the soundtracks help a lot and aren\'t just there to fill the ""sound environment"".The characters are interesting and quite human; it also was a good surprise. They are mentally suffering of the result of the apocalypse and not just thinking of it as a pain in the ass. They are scared, depressed or even having some kind of PTSD.One more thing about the show in a whole is that not everything is explained to the spectator right after something happens, leaving the spectator making it\'s own theories using real hints, not too obvious, but still interesting.And finally, the end is satisfying. I will not say here if it\'s good or bad, just that the end... exists. As a spectator, the end let\'s you with a feeling of fulfillment; you do not especially need another season to feel satisfied.I personally really enjoyed the show, but I know that I\'m not really a demanding spectator. Still I think that from an objective point of view, or at least the least subjective possible, the show is worth giving a try despite it being quite clumsy or unoriginal. It still has a plot that can be interesting as we see the characters trying to survive, keep the mood up as much as possible and dealing with the constant denial of Yuki.That\'s all for the review without spoiler, thank you for reading me all this way, I hope I\'ve been helpful !I must apologize for the mistakes I\'ve most likely made as I\'m not from an English speaking country.Now with MAJOR spoilers:I\'ve warned you.Well, I found the end okay, but I wasn\'t fully satisfied about it. Again it feels to me like whoever came up with it took the easy path by letting everyone survive. Okay Taroumaru dies. But he suffers from another problem, he is a bit too much of a Deus Ex Machina, as he saves Yuki despite having been bitten. I know that zombies keep something about their habits from their life, but if I recall correctly Taroumaru was pretty keen on jumping to the face of Yuki right ?Even his death doesn\'t feel right, as he gets back from being a zombie just to be able to die in Miki\'s arms.And OF COURSE, the vaccine. How convenient ! All this story about the basement and the bio-weapons scared me a little for the end of the show and it seems I was right about it.And finally for the epilogue, how the heck did Sakura Megumi know about the other shelters ?Shortly I feel like the end is just a bunch of really convenient coincidences for the characters that were not really welcome for the viewer.During the 11th episode I was expecting that everyone would eventually tragically die... I would\'ve been so down for the following days that my familly would constantly be asking me why, but still I would have preferred that as it might have been a really sad end with much feels without any compromise. Insead Taroumaru died and they left a TOTALLY EMPTY SCHOOL WITHOUT ANY ZOMBIE, SERIOUSLY ! How incoherent it was that the zombies did not come back.Thank you for reading !! that\'s a really good point. Moreover the soundtracks help a lot and aren\'t just there to fill the ""sound environment"".The characters are interesting and quite human; it also was a good surprise. They are mentally suffering of the result of the apocalypse and not just thinking of it as a pain in the ass. They are scared, depressed or even having some kind of PTSD.One more thing about the show in a whole is that not everything is explained to the spectator right after something happens, leaving the spectator making it\'s own theories using real hints, not too obvious, but still interesting.And finally, the end is satisfying. I will not say here if it\'s good or bad, just that the end... exists.

It's certainly not the first anime to try and contrast cute girls and horror. It might be the first zombie apocalypse slice-of-life show, though I wouldn't quote me on that. The first episode has a predictable bait-and-switch setup. It initially seems like a cutesy slice-of-life comedy where four young girls do fun things as part of the school life club, but it's revealed that the fun atmosphere is all part of the main character, Takeya Yuki's, delusion, and most of the club's activities are for survival...or distraction in the midst of a zombie apocalypse which has left them stranded in a school swarmed by the walking dead. There are a few other twists thrown into the story, which you don't need precognition to anticipate, but ultimately this is simply your typical cute girls doing cute things show, where in this case not everything that happens to the girls in question is good.So why dare I give this a 5, and not a 4 or a 3? That's because of the presentation. I wasn't joking in my Ranpo Kitan review that Lerche seemed to put more effort into the production of this anime than the mystery author tribute. They seemed to put some thought into how they could visually represent the differences between 'reality' and Yuki's deluded version of it, and that extends to changes in the OP and ED animations as the series goes on. Also, while the setup is gimmicky and honestly stupid, it does result in some more in-depth development of the girls' personalities that makes it more engaging to watch than it would otherwise be. or distraction in the midst of a zombie apocalypse which has left them stranded in a school swarmed by the walking dead.

Hate reading perfect 10 reviews cause it feels like you are reading some fanatical propaganda or something...unfortunately I can't help it, this thing deserves it.Ok now if you have no idea what this anime is about just watch it, at least the first ep and then see if you like it. Otherwise SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS:The reason this thing is a PERFECT 10 (yah it is not perfect but it is easily one of my favourite anime) is that it surprises. Anime is absolutely surprising when you first see one. If you watch a movie from Ukraine (this won't work if...you are actually from Ukraine, so to all Ukrainians reading this pretend I said Iceland) that movie will be surprising, the different perspective of the different country makes their popular culture different (duh). But as you continue to consume that popular culture, patterns emerge and woah do patterns emerge with anime...it takes only a couple of minutes (often seconds) into a 1st ep and I know what is going to happen, whose pantsu are gonna be seen by who and which boring nice guy teenager is gonna turn into the best mech pilot/super or magic powered hero and kill all the bad guys, agonizing over his actions all the while etcetera and so forth.However, this anime goes about things differently. Sure it has tropes: swimsuit episode in a zombie apocalypse (nice shoehorning) and the characters could be taken from just about any slice of life school anime out there BUT it put this slice of life school light comedy right in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. It did not go full dark and moody and depressing either it just keeps on riding the line between these two genres and switching between them at will. This is what makes this anime so original.There was no point in this anime where I got bored or despaired over the story or character direction, I thoroughly enjoyed all of it and if that doesn't make it a 10 then I do not know what does. you are actually from Ukraine, so to all Ukrainians reading this pretend I said Iceland) that movie will be surprising, the different perspective of the different country makes their popular culture different (duh).

The reason being? Well that goes in turn with the genre of horror. To state it simply, the story seems cutesy at first but the harsh reality sits in when you learn the truth towards the end of episode 1.--------------------------------------------Opening-Lets start with one of the first things that plays an importance in the show. That is the opening. Friend Shitai by...Gakuen Seikatsubu. This is an opening that changes throughout the show, getting worse and worse the more you learn about characters and events. It begins by showing off a cute opening to go along with the song. A happy outlook where everything is normal and seems like it\'s going to be another generic comedy/slice-of-life series of school girls. But this is where it changes. As time goes on the school changes to it\'s broken down reality, zombies flooding more and more each episode to signify the final episode, the four shots of different characters changing because of their outcome in the story. If you want to learn more about the opening, watch Mother\'s Basement on youtube since watching the series normally you don\'t really notice the small changes or if you skip it you definitely don\'t.--------------------------------------------Characters-With the opening out of the way, the next thing should be the characters as that is what you need for the story to happen. Lets go through them individually for what they do for the story and what is good but also bad about them, starting with the main character Yuki.Yuki Takeya is a third year though she may not look like one nor have the smarts to seem like one. Along with the three other girls, she is the major key role to the story due to the fact that her mental trauma is what makes this series look like a cute show. It was seen through her eyes that the place is perfect still when the harsh reality is that it isn\'t. Why is that? Well the fact that she had witness the death of someone close and needed to forget, making it seem like everything is okay. This is a common occurrence for people who go through so much trauma, like the death of family or horrible things that I won\'t name. They turn to changing their reality so the situation fits what would make them happy, something that Yuki does. It really does make the plot twists in the show more memorable as there are signs slowly coming before that hint towards things. This trauma is explore throughout the series as the reality she tries pushing away slowly breaks down the fake one to make her face what truly is there, making her take the biggest growth in order to save her friends. The reality is to forget the one she lost, the one who she made this fake reality for in order to keep her ""alive"". But not all things work out well like that and so she is forced to make a decision. The bad things that come from her character is mainly how she interacts with others. It seemed like before the events of the story, she really was the same type of person which is a bit hard to understand how she came to be where she is in school with her below average thought level and care-free attitude but it\'s not something that effects the story.Megumi Sakura, a teacher at the school. If we are to talk about Yuki then we must talk about Megumi, or Megu-nee as Yuki calls her. She is a caring teacher, one who wants to make students lives easier and be the teacher they rely on, the friend to students. This of course makes her employer upset at this fact but it really is a believable personality and one that moves the story along a little. Megu-nee is the the closest to Yuki with the fact that Megu-nee is who Yuki\'s trauma is from. Her fate is one that isn\'t shown for most of the show but there are subtle hints when with another character. She does play a pivotal role within the story as she\'s the one who helps start the club, helps the students out, and in the end lets the story continue onwards after the first season. The bad thing with her character tends to be that some of the things within the story don\'t seem a bit... plausible as of course she\'s a figment of Yuki\'s mind meaning no one else can hear her.Yuuri Wakasa is the president of the club and another third year at the school. She tends to be the more big sister or care taker type who needs to be rational but in reality her mind is as hurt as others. Her character doesn\'t play too much of a role despite being the voice of reason in some cases, though those cases can easily be swayed by the loving Yuki. The definite bad side to her character is that she\'s the rational one. The trope with them tends to be that they\'re strong until they go beyond the point of breaking and go back to normal in most cases. This is the case for Yuuri as a massive thing in the story happens but when it ends she\'s all back to normal as if nothing happened.Kurumi Ebisuwaza is the final third year of the group and is the strength of the girls. In the sense, Kurumi is a tomboy like girl who carries a shovel used to protect her and the other girls with despite her small frame. Not much goes into the anime on why or how she can wield it with ease while their underclassmen couldn\'t. Other than that, she has no real difference from what I could tell that she\'s any more different than Yuuri. She along with Yuuri both are too happy and just like Yuki, Kurumi has a bit of trauma that does get explored during the show at least. So it does give reason why she sees the monsters as foggy shadows rather than the monsters they are. Something bad about her though is that she doesn\'t have much of a personality besides that, nothing to truly make her ""unique"". If she was more of the angry personality or had the personality that the underclassmen has, it would be a bit more believable.Miki Naoki is the underclassmen, a second year, who despite being there from the start in reality joins the group much later which you learn why more later in the show. She has the personality traits of someone who sees the harsh reality and doesn\'t like the fact the others play along with Yuki, though this thought does seem to change somewhat as time goes on. Her character is a bit weak in that sense though since it makes her a bit too uptight, even though they are in a bit of an apocalypse situation. Despite that, her personality came before even meeting the main cast which makes things worse since her growth doesn\'t happen much throughout the story until the final episode.Taromaru is the puppy which the girls encounter meeting Miki. Taromaru is the lovig puppy that in most shows don\'t have a purpose besides just being there. This is one the big things that will be said, but the anime and manga differ with Taromaru. In the anime he\'s there throughout most of the show, his fate being sealed in the final episode whereas in the manga he doesn\'t meet his end but instead is kept as the monster he became. The anime did have a better thing going with him due to the fact that you grow more attached to Taromaru and when the final episode comes you are given the emotions that weren\'t there in the manga. This is one of the main changes of the story in the anime I am okay with. The only bad thing I will say is besides the fact of the emotional outcome in the anime and the point of leading the girls to Miki, Taromaru served no other purpose to the story.Overall the characters I will say are for the most part good enough for a story like this. Not many beside Yuki get character growth but some do at least get back stories explored which is a good substitute for it.--------------------------------------------Story-I won\'t say much about the story so I don\'t completely ruin it, though with my previous points in the characters and opening I might\'ve spoiled enough. The major thing I will say is that when going from the anime to the manga it does differ and you will notice it if you reread the chapters the show was adapted from. This is okay since really you should read the manga from the beginning anyway as most anime never fully adapt everything, but sometimes this also can lead to bad things in the show. For School-Live! though I will say the changes made don\'t majorly affect the outcome but even enhance it as stated with my character discussion for Taromaru. Had another season be made though, it makes me wonder if they would keep these changes or not but we won\'t know as no announcement in the past 6ish years since the show came out has any talk of another season been done. Overall though I will say the story for the most part is enjoyable enough for the theme it does set. It\'s meant to be a story of girls living in a bad world who need to survive, whether it\'s head on or by putting of false walls to hide the truth.--------------------------------------------Art-School-Live! was done by Lerche Studio which is also known for other amazing works such as Assassination Classroom or Danganronpa. The art style works well for this type of series since it\'s meant to give off that cute feeling with the girls as no guy characters are really shown off in the show. But that\'s where the downside is. The cute side brings down the horror elements and in the anime it\'s no different. The monsters are often hidden with shadows or the foggy shadow as seen through Kurumi\'s eyes. If they would\'ve upped the monster factor a bit with certain scenes it would\'ve been a lot better but nonetheless it didn\'t have much of an impact on the story as there wasn\'t much animation issues as with other anime have had. If done by any other studio I\'m not quite sure it would have given me the same feelings as with Lerche\'s animation. But how does it compare to the manga? Well it\'s almost completely similar. Of course there are some differences since animation is a bit more hands on work and needs to be done with the thought of the character\'s movement whereas in manga not many authors think about how it would work if animated. The character designs are pretty much similar though much more vibrant in the anime than in the manga.--------------------------------------------Overall Enjoyment-I enjoyed this series from start to end. It was somewhat generic in some aspects while also turning the whole horror side upside down with its twists. It made me want to continue on with the manga, which not every anime I have watched has done. It gave me emotions as well, things like sadness or hopefulness or even shock, that wasn\'t expected when going into a series like this. If you have nothing spoiled about the show and you can express your feelings easier when watching things that are animated, then you might feel the same things as me. Would I watch it again? This is a show I would. There are details you can only notice with a second viewing if you don\'t watch them via videos online from other people\'s perspectives. Would I recommend this show to others? Absolutely. Especially to the ones who enjoy horror or things with plot twists. But of course that means I won\'t explain much besides ""it\'s a show about cute girls living in a school but it\'s not always like that"".---------------------------------------------Thank you for reading my review and again, sorry I made it so long!

I don't know anything about the manga, other then it differs slightly, but I wished the anime hadn't been as vanilla on the whole as it was.  Compare this to similar shows like Higurashi and Yuki Yuna, I felt that this anime got the moe girls combined with...the 'wtf' moments down, but failed to maintain it's strength over the entire show.

It was logical for this type of anime. I have to admit that I kinda felt sad and nostalgic seeing how they 'graduated' and left the school to continue with their lives.

After the first episode, you can kinda get a grab on what's going to happen. Plus you know that most likely none of the main characters will die, (well the ones alive won't).

The strong contrast between the character design and the world building is what helped gain its popularity.In terms of story and it\'s development, there isn\'t much to go along. It is very restricted to a ""slice of life"" theme. Although I am  going to admit that I was surprised by a few plot twists/ revelations. I am hoping that there will be a second season because like most 12-episode long anime, this one is open-ended.Now, onto the characters. I...found myself not liking the main protagonist, Yuki. I get it, she has a psychological condition and she\'s the sunshine amidst their storm but she is the most unreliable idiot ever. I know! She\'s written like that. It\'s supposed to be cute and endearing. Well it\'s not. I feel sorry for Kurumi, Rii and Miki for always ALWAYS keeping her ass out of danger. I don\'t really mind the other characters but for some reason they remind me of K-On! Yuki is the more annoying version of Yui; Rii for Mugi; Kurumi for Ritsu and Miki is a mix of Azusa and Mio. I don\'t know.Next let\'s talk about the animation and art style. Scratching the rage inducing Yuki, I think the art is garbage on this one. I just don\'t know if I got the censored version but would it kill the creators to do a proper zombie instead of just animating a dark aura around them? Too me it\'s a little (LOT) lazy. Most of the scene where there are a lot of zombies are also blurry/ out of focus. Come on! I think I can handle a little gore.Lastly, is the anime good? The answer is both yes and no. Yes, because I admit that some of the scenes are very heartbreaking to watch. I didn\'t expect to bawl my eyes out in the last two episodes but I did. No, because of the lazy animation, lack of character and story development.If you watch Gakkougurashi without knowing that it is a deconstructed slice of life then the anime might blow you away. But since I knew from the start that it is not what it seems I kind of raised my expectations a little higher and got disappointed.

The misleading first episode sets up the entire atmosphere for a series that isn't afraid to take risks in surprising the audience.The majority of people are already aware of the show's surprise twist at the end of the first episode (if not and you like a good shock, please stop reading here): this seemingly cutesy slice-of-life takes place during a zombie apocalypse, in which the main girl has deluded herself into thinking that her school life is going on as normal. The rest of her friends, the remaining survivors from her school, go...along with her delusion out of the fear of completely mentally breaking her.At times, the realization as an audience member that what you're seeing is a delusion makes for some surprising dark comedy. The main girl innocently runs through the halls, unable to see the broken glass, blood-stained windows, or hear the moans of the turned students outside.Of course, it also helps that the show would make a good SoL on its own. If it didn't have interesting characters or good comedy, then 3/4ths of the show would be boring, and the more serious moments wouldn't be as powerful.When the show does turn dark and serious, it's very intense. If you got bored with The Walking Dead after a while, don't worry: this is like the early seasons where you understood what was going on and were fully captivated by the peril the characters were on. If you still like The Walking Dead, even better.

This story deals with the topics of apocalypse, death, survival, coping and moving on in a way that made me feel satisfied with this experience.Story: 8/10If the plot of the show could be summarized in one sentence, it would be this: Cute anime girls trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. This anime is literally that. It deals with four girls in a private high school who are stuck inside within two floors of the...school, all while one of them is living a delusion that everyone is fine and alive, while this isn\'t true. There are a few episodes that feel like a filler episode, but they end up having a key moment to the plot and the progression of the series. Either way, the story runs smoothly, and my favorite episode has to be Episode 3 where it gives a bit of an explanation about how the outbreak started.Art: 9/10One of the things that I genuinely loved of this series was the contrasting art styles. The girls are portrayed with bright and shiny colors, filled with life, while THEY (This is how the Zombies are regarded as) are filled with dark colors along with an aura of death and dark colors. Not to mention, there\'s also the grainy, old movie art style that is done with scenes showing the past. One thing I did enjoy of the art was the intro, where the art style in the first episode did an animation of a bright and cheery setting, much like any other SoL anime, but as the anime progresses, the borders look more grainy and old, the school is shown as decaying, and the girls basically showing signs of sadness and despair. The art style is one that is bound to be remembered for years to come.Sound: 10/10The music used for this series was amazing in my opinion. Seeing the intro for the first time gave me a sense of cheerfulness with how upbeat it was, but as the episodes progressed, with me knowing what was really going on, I felt uneasy with the song, knowing it didn\'t fit with the situation, but it gave a sense of irony with the whole show. One of my favorite songs from anime came from the 5th episode of the series and it was the ED that played when Miki listens to her friend\'s CD player and the song that came with it gave a sad, depressing, sulky tone to the end of the episode, which fit perfectly with the series itself. The song reminds me of the songs sung by Mary Elizabeth McGwynn from the Silent Hill series- sad, depressing and dark, but it fits the setting of the game. That song gave me the exact same feeling to the example I just mentioned.Character: 8/10In this anime, there\'s essentially 6 characters: Yuki who is a cheerful girl who is curious and cooperative with the club activities she is given, but she is actually mentally unstable and living in a delusion of her life, due to her mental breakdown from the initial outbreak. Kurumi is basically the person with strength in the group, using a shovel to defend herself and is normally sent to do riskier missions for the group. Yuri is the ""president"" of the club and has a motherly figure to the other girls, but she is actually mentally fragile, becoming more and more unstable as things worsen. Miki is an underclassmen that is calm and pretty much a bookworm. Taromaru is a puppy who is the mascot of the club and is pretty much a member of the club. Finally, the last character is Megumi-Sensei who is the club adviser and shows a kind nature to the girls, but is constantly interrupted by the girls (This is explained in the anime). What is so good about the characters is how they change as the show goes on. This is especially the case of Yuki, who acts childish due to her delusions in the beginning, but ends up letting go of her delusions and makes an attempt to become a more useful member of the group.Enjoyment: 9/10This series made me hooked after the first episode since you get to see how they survived for a period of time after the outbreak. As I mentioned, the animation and music of this series was one I genuinely enjoyed, the plot was unique to the genres of horror and slice of life, and I enjoyed seeing the characters change as things worsen.Overall: 9/10This is an anime that I personally think is underrated, considering the symbolism that occurs throughout the series (especially in the final episode), I felt invested in the characters, hoping that they would survive and I give a lot of props and credits to the people who animated this series, which the contrast in art style is one I personally will remember for a while.

It\'s worth the time.', 'This anime is honestly amazing it has the perfect blend of Moe and Story that I just can\'t help but appreciate... even in the horrible environment they\'re forced to live in they still manage to keep a cute atmosphere and deliver an actual plot that\'s quite interesting, the Moe and very serious plot balance each other out and it never feels like they decided to ditch the story simply so they can include more silly and dumb gimmicks. Not to mention the plot has a very serious tone like dealing with mental health disorders so having a Moe aspect and being able to make it...work and not feel like they\'re just trying to say ""Hey something really tragic happened, but here\'s some moe to make it all better!"" is really impressive, they used the moe not to cover up this serious tone but to show how some of the characters deal with the horrors they\'ve had to see. The ""Moe"" was there to move the plot forward and show how the main character was slowly coming to grips with reality and was starting to finally move forward after being stuck in the same spot unable to move on...Definitely check this anime out if you haven\'t already, it has some of the most lovable characters I\'ve ever seen and well there\'s only a little Moe that\'s always a good thing to have for most people, however prepare for a train-ride of emotions and make sure you go into this anime knowing it\'s going to get a very serious tone and some of the thing\'s that happen may not be very pleasant for all viewers however if you\'re fine with some more heavier topics than this anime is perfect for you. work and not feel like they\'re just trying to say ""Hey something really tragic happened, but here\'s some moe to make it all better!"" is really impressive, they used the moe not to cover up this serious tone but to show how some of the characters deal with the horrors they\'ve had to see.

Look, I know some things about myself and one of them is if I had to choose I prefer BAD anime over anime that are painstakingly slow and boring. For that reason only I\'ve not ended on a score quite as low as I ended up giving Serial Experiments Lain or Texhnolyze, where each 23~ minute episode felt like an hour and I had to actively take steps to fight off falling asleep, but make no mistake about it- this anime is really, really bad.There is very, very little plot to speak of or advancement of said plot whatsoever. In just 12...short episodes of runtime there\'s gotta be, generously, AT MOST 3 episodes worth of plot advancement and I think it\'s almost certainly less than that. There\'s a setting and there are characters but there isn\'t actually a plot. There are very few events or things that actually happen, there are no explanations provided for any aspect of this world and there\'s no goal, no path to achieve that goal, no anything.The main characters are just about the worst zombie apocalypse survivors I\'ve ever seen in any work of fiction. Their stupidity and non-believability far exceeds suspension of disbelief. They are shown to have an entire section of a school full of supplies to work with INCLUDING A BIN OF BASEBALL BATS IN THEIR MAIN CLUB ROOM and yet they choose to walk around completely unarmed and defenseless save one girl who opts to carry a shovel instead of a bat. This includes when leaving school grounds and going to a completely unknown location where they don\'t have barriers set up or any form of built-in protection. When visiting said area, a mall, on a ""field trip"", which is unbelievably stupid and dangerous in and of itself, not all the girls bring backpacks or containers to carry supplies and then they do not bother filling up the backpacks or the car that they did bring. Food, weapons and other invaluable survival tools are passed up on when they could easily be carried or brought along. There is zero urgency and zero fighting for survival. Back at school the girls (ultra conveniently, as with every other aspect of this paper thin plot) have access to a nearly fully stocked school store with tons of canned goods, candy and non-perishables. They do not make frequent supply runs here, they do not fill their backpacks up when they do go here and they do not expand their barrier to encompass this area within their territory. These are just a handful of countless examples of the idiocy and non-believability of the characters and their situation, but it\'s far beyond the point of being an oversight and well into the territory of being offensive to my sensibility.Perhaps the most egregious thing that happened in this show, and this really did leave me just about speechless and not in a good way, is how the girls ""defeated"" the zombie invasion in their school. This belongs in a parody anime, but it presents it to us entirely in earnest and is to be taken on face value. Get ready... One of the girls goes on the school\'s intercom system and announces that school is over for the day and the zombies should leave and come back tomorrow. And just like that, as if they\'d just heard the word of God himself, the zombies do indeed stop what they\'re doing, turn around and walk right out the door and out the front gate. Problem solved! To ask me to accept this on face value is far, far beyond the amount of leeway I can give an anime. Forget The Walking Dead, Resident Evil or The Last of Us- if I have to be in a zombie apocalypse drop me in THIS world. All you have to do to not get eaten is politely ask the zombies to leave! EZPZ, why didn\'t Lee and Clementine or Joel and Ellie think of that?Strictly because the anime is visually nice, particularly for being 8 years old at the time of this writing and giving specific praise to the way they presented the zombies, and for the aforementioned reason of it wasn\'t the slowest, most boring, ""feels like a complete slog to get through"" thing I\'ve ever watched this anime lands for me at a GENEROUS 5, and it\'s not the single worst anime I\'ve ever seen in my entire life, but it\'s COMFORTABLY in the bottom 20. There\'s no demographic of fan I would recommend this to. No matter what you\'re looking for- zombies, slice of life, horror, whatever- there\'s many other shows that do it a lot better.

When visiting said area, a mall, on a ""field trip"", which is unbelievably stupid and dangerous in and of itself, not all the girls bring backpacks or containers to carry supplies and then they do not bother filling up the backpacks or the car that they did bring. Food, weapons and other invaluable survival tools are passed up on when they could easily be carried or brought along. There is zero urgency and zero fighting for survival. Back at school the girls (ultra conveniently, as with every other aspect of this paper thin plot) have access to a nearly fully stocked school store with tons of canned goods, candy and non-perishables. They do not make frequent supply runs here, they do not fill their backpacks up when they do go here and they do not expand their barrier to encompass this area within their territory. These are just a handful of countless examples of the idiocy and non-believability of the characters and their situation, but it\'s far beyond the point of being an oversight and well into the territory of being offensive to my sensibility.Perhaps the most egregious thing that happened in this show, and this really did leave me just about speechless and not in a good way, is how the girls ""defeated"" the zombie invasion in their school. This belongs in a parody anime, but it presents it to us entirely in earnest and is to be taken on face value. Get ready... One of the girls goes on the school\'s intercom system and announces that school is over for the day and the zombies should leave and come back tomorrow. And just like that, as if they\'d just heard the word of God himself, the zombies do indeed stop what they\'re doing, turn around and walk right out the door and out the front gate. Problem solved! To ask me to accept this on face value is far, far beyond the amount of leeway I can give an anime. Forget The Walking Dead, Resident Evil or The Last of Us- if I have to be in a zombie apocalypse drop me in THIS world. All you have to do to not get eaten is politely ask the zombies to leave! EZPZ, why didn\'t Lee and Clementine or Joel and Ellie think of that?Strictly because the anime is visually nice, particularly for being 8 years old at the time of this writing and giving specific praise to the way they presented the zombies, and for the aforementioned reason of it wasn\'t the slowest, most boring, ""feels like a complete slog to get through"" thing I\'ve ever watched this anime lands for me at a GENEROUS 5, and it\'s not the single worst anime I\'ve ever seen in my entire life, but it\'s COMFORTABLY in the bottom 20. There\'s no demographic of fan I would recommend this to. No matter what you\'re looking for- zombies, slice of life, horror, whatever- there\'s many other shows that do it a lot better. Pass.OBJECTIVE RATING- 4.5-5PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 5', ""Definite spoilers as I will be pointing out some flaws with the story.Story: 4This is what happens when you try to blend moeh and horror, you end up with something that's really neither with too many plot devices.So we're presented with the concept of 'living' vs 'survival'. When all is hopeless, is it more important to survival as long as you can, or to try to live out the remaining time you have? Thrown into an apocalyptic situation, the girls have chosen to try to 'live' by pretending as often as they can that they're just living at school. However, this premise only works because...of all the plot convenience thrust onto them in that the school has all these facilities which allows them such a lifestyle as well as their few numbers which allows them to 'live' for a good amount of time.The zombies are atrociously slow and are pretty weak as well, as a high school girl can quite easily dispatch them, which brings the question why are there no other survivors. Secondly, it seems that the zombie apocalypse was something that was expected, or at the very least, prepared for, which begs the other question of why no other teachers survived.When the girls do wander outside their safe zone, for some reason, they think it's a smart idea to bring Yuki along, who has become disillusioned with reality due to trauma. And somehow, despite being an immense liability where Yuki basically has to be counselled during and after any encounter, they make it out every time.Overall, a suspension of disbelief cannot be held for long due to convenient plot devices.Art: 7I would have rated this higher if it were not for the poor implemented CGI. CGI is used sparsely, but when it's used, it's so obvious that it breaks the tension. An example of good CGI is in Kantai Collection. I found the lighter, happier backgrounds to be quite average compared to the darker and bloodied backgrounds. The characters themselves are more of the typical moeh designs in that they're brightly lit but their overall texture feels a bit flat.Sound: 7Didn't really like the OP nor ED, voice acting was pretty standard so not impressed or disappointed there.Character: 6Basically everyone has trauma... which is fine. Except when both Kurumi and Yuuri seems to encourage Yuki's state of mind it's a real wonder how they manage to live for so long. The only real person of interest is Miki as she recognises both the importance of maintaining an optimistic attitude but also a realistic attitude at the same time.Enjoyment: 7The moeh/cutesy parts of the story weren't really that cute and actually made me lose interest at times. The darker parts were definitely more interesting, especially when Yuki was absent and the sane members of the group had to discuss their survival and resource woes.Overall: 6By combing both cute parts and horror parts, I felt like it ended up diluting both. Too much of the story seems to rely on plot conveniences (such as in ep 11 when lightning strikes and wipes out the roof which signifies that they will have to move on afterwards) and just doesn't have the power to maintain a suspension of disbelief. of all the plot convenience thrust onto them in that the school has all these facilities which allows them such a lifestyle as well as their few numbers which allows them to 'live' for a good amount of time.The zombies are atrociously slow and are pretty weak as well, as a high school girl can quite easily dispatch them, which brings the question why are there no other survivors.

The ending spurred me into action, I\'ve never written any reviews before this one but I ""needed"" to express my total disgust for this series. Not only the amalgamation of such a disparity of genres results as forced, bland and unimaginative, but it truly tops itself when in the last two episodes the most obnoxious developments occur and the only demise in this whole fallacious mess is the one that made less sense and truly took a toll on my sanity....Despite an interesting start, you will be quickly disappointed by one-note only characters and problems, absurdly developed solutions to the most critical conditions, ""power of friendship and love"" put in the most hideous of places, magically appearing, conveniently placed plot devices at the right time, and senseless casualties.Do youself a favour and bury this utter disappointment in the deepest recesses of Tartarus where this abomination rightfully resides.

The same studio behind Given, Konohana Kitan and the Danganronpa anime. So, they have a pretty solid record as far as their output I've seen goes. It's based off of a manga by Kaihou Norimitsu. Will this horror anime follow Lerche's positive trend?Story:I will be giving some minor spoilers for the first episode here. Our narrative is set at Megurigaoka\xa0High school where the school living club does their best to survive and actually live during a zombie apocalypse. The story is based around them going on excursions to find supplies, reinforcing their position and trying to have...fun like ordinary school girls. It's a unique blend of slice of life with zombie survival.The worst part of the story is that the ending feels a little abrupt and incomplete. Overall it does work for the aesthetic and with the genre blend but it does feel like it should have had more to it. There's also a flashback sequence pretty early on that they try to make tense even though you already know what comes from it. Although there is a degree to which Yuki's mental state makes it a little more tense since we have already had it established that she doesn't always see things as they are and the idea that something may have happened that we don't know about is always there with her.The real strength of this anime stems from Yuki. To be specific, we learn in the first episode that Yuki's mind has broken a bit from the situation. She sees things differently from the way they actually are and the anime plays with her unreliability to create tension, open up fun situations and drop some clever plot twists on the viewer. It's actually executed pretty brilliantly. Both because they set the stage immediately in the first episode and because every one of the plot twists they pull makes sense when you look at them retrospectively. And even though the anime keeps things on the lighter side it still has some really tragic moments and it keeps the zombie threat looming so that those moments are never entirely unexpected. The anime also does a great job of balancing the types of scenes. What they like to do is sandwich the scenes that are exceptionally tense or sad between happier, more lighthearted scenes so that you always have time to process things.Characters:There are six major characters in this series. Yuki, Miki, Yuuri, Kuruki, Taroumaru (the tiny dog) & their teacher Megu-nee. In many ways they resemble a typical slice of life cast but the anime adds extra complexity with themes of trauma suffered during difficult times and their ongoing struggle to stay cheerful. There are a lot of strong dynamics in this as well. The one issue is that they don't always delve into the characters' minds as deeply as they could. Especially where Yuuri is concerned.Art:The artwork, like the anime itself, is a strange mixture of gruesome imagery with the zombies themselves and the damage they've caused along with cutesy imagery. The character designs themselves are on the cute side and there are quite a few scenes that are just cute slice of life sequences. Which kind of makes the gruesome sequences even more disturbing. I will say that I kind of wish they'd drawn Taroumaru to look like an actual dog instead of a vaguely dog-like blob.Sound:Lerche got some really talented actresses. Minase Inori, Ozawa Ari, Takahashi Rie, Ichimichi Mao & Kayano Ai are all really good. I do like the music as well. The theme tune is cutesy but with some unsettling undercurrents which pretty perfectly sums up the series.Ho-yay:There's a good amount. We do get the usual slice of life thing where the girls are pretty physically affectionate with each other and it can come across as Yuririffic.Areas of Improvement:1. I do think they could have used more time to make a more satisfying ending with better pacing.2. It might help to have a little more insight into Yuuri's mind.3. I would like to see the dog character look more like an actual dog.Final Thoughts:I liked this anime a lot. It made me really sad at points and there were times I had to stop watching to let things settle but it was really well done. I don't normally like zombie stuff since most of it follows the same basic story, has the same cast of survivor archetypes and tropes but this one successfully revitalises that tired formula simply by merging it with another genre that you wouldn't think it would go with.

I'm going to give Gakkougurashi a solid 8/10."", 'Gakkougurashi, meaning “School Live”, is a relatively notorious series in the anime community for its plot twists and dark subject matter. Many compare it to the critically acclaimed Madoka Magica, as both start off as happy, go-lucky “cute girls doing cute things” shows, but quickly delve into something much darker. Those who are unfamiliar with Gakkougurashi, I’m going to have to restate the obvious that almost every other review on this site has already established…don’t read any further and watch the first episode now without any spoilers. I promise, you won’t regret it.If you’re reading this, then I’m going to assume that you have...either already finished the first episode/series or don’t care about being spoiled.The entire “school living club” premise that the series is based on is nothing but a fabrication created by the fragile Yuki Takeya, who began experiencing delusions as a coping mechanism for the dystopian world around her. In reality, her and three other girls, one teacher and a loyal dog named Taroumaru are in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. Stuck in the school with nowhere else to grow, our main heroines have to resort to growing crops, bashing zombies with gardening shovels and barricading exits with desks and chairs.Story:Now, the premise of Gakkougurashi is quite interesting. Nowadays, you’ll find that most of the unique or interesting ideas have already been used. A lot of the current anime all tell the same story except with one tiny twist that doesn’t really change anything. I’d have to say that nothing like this has ever been done before. Gakkougurashi is the first anime to lire you in with the promise of moe and marshmallows only to completely shatter your hopes and dreams with a zombie apocalypse. While the idea is genius and I still thoroughly enjoyed the show, there is way too much filler for it to be considered a true horror.Yes, there is plenty of gore and zombies crawling around on the floor. Yes, there are tons of tears and psychological mind f*ck moments. But most of those don’t even happen until the very end of the story. They are sprinkled so gradually into the series that you can almost forget that they’re there. In between the flashbacks where we find out how Miki was rescued and when Kurumi gets bitten, there are at least three whole episodes of filler. To genuinely compliment the story, the moments where there actually is angst are incredibly well-written. And there’s hardly any fanservice. That is a HUGE plus for me.Characters:Most of the characters in Gakkougurashi rely on single character archetypes. You can’t really expect much from anime characters these days, as most of them can be boiled down to one or two traits. It was honestly Yuuri who made me angry. Her entire character was basically boiled down to “kind and caring big sister character who will kill you if you disobey her rules”. I have to admit that the arc with Kurumi was a nice touch and helped me feel for her character, but otherwise, she was the only character I disliked.Yuki was incredibly unique for a few reasons. While she starts off as your typical genki girl, once her true mindset is revealed, she becomes a much more interesting character with tons of depth. I believe that it’s very possible that Yuki has some form of anxiety disorder or PTSD (leaning more towards the latter). It’s very rare that we get such well-written characters with mental disorders, and her sweetness towards her friends just made me love her more.Kurumi and Miki are also incredible characters. I was drawn to Megu-nee from the beginning strictly because of her design, and even if her personality is a bit cliche, I ended up loving her the most and the revelation that she was actually one of Yuki’s delusions and had been infected a long time ago literally KILLED ME.Taroumaru is a dog. That sells it for me. I sobbed hysterically when he died and if you don’t do the same then you’re probably already a zombie.Art:The art and animation is fine. Nothing too special, nothing groundbreaking. It does what it’s supposed to do and manages to not look too awkward. One of the things I found unique about the art was the changes in color palette. For example, when we were experiencing the world through Yuki’s perspective, everything was bright and colorful. However, through everyone else’s perspective, the world was dreary and dark, tainted with the blood of past students and the rust of scattered desks. It added a nice touch, even if it wasn’t too noticeable first watch.Sound:The background music and the ending were fine. The opening was a catchy song with an awesome theme animation to boot. I really loved how small details were added to the opening every new episode. In the very beginning, the school looks completely normal, but in the final episode, you can see zombies milling around the school, blood staining the walls and boarded up windows. The changes are so small that you probably won’t every notice until you see a side by side comparison. It will blow your mind.Final rating: Even if Gakkougurashi did have quite a few flaws, it was still an enjoyable watch with plenty of twists that set it apart from your average horror or slice of life. The characters were all likable, the plot twists were foreshadowed and nothing every seemed like shock value, and the art and sound were solid. If you liked Madoka Magica or other similar shows, I highly recommend this to you. I doubt that anything will ever surpass Madoka Magica, but Gakkougurashi seems like a worthy contender. either already finished the first episode/series or don’t care about being spoiled.The entire “school living club” premise that the series is based on is nothing but a fabrication created by the fragile Yuki Takeya, who began experiencing delusions as a coping mechanism for the dystopian world around her.

I doubt that anything will ever surpass Madoka Magica, but Gakkougurashi seems like a worthy contender.', ""Gakkougurashi (or School-Live) is one of those shows best experienced blind. If you're seeing this review, and considering watching this show, you should absolutely go watch it and come back. You'll see what I mean after just one episode.As such, it is very hard to discuss this show without majorly spoiling the key premise, so your spoiler warning has been issued.---Thematically, Gakkougurashi seems to be a love letter to western zombie media. The series plays with a lot of zombie invasion tropes and settings, and is genuinely invested in its premise, giving the audience lots of clue as to the cause and solution to the...zombie invasion. Lots of scenes in this show appear to directly mirror common zombie movie tropes, such as the shopping centre invasion, the driving sequences, and the character who carries a shovel for self-defence.Where this show truly shines, though, is how it deconstructs these tropes. Western zombie media has a tendency to lean towards the anarchic side of man - during the apocalypse, society breaks down, and often this is a good thing for our protagonist, who likes to beat people to death with a baseball bat. In Gakkougurashi, our driving force is not anarchy, but hope for a better, more stable future.This is manifest in our main protagonist, the happy-go-lucky Yuki Takeya, who appears to be completely unaware of the impending end due to her trauma-induced psychosis. Yuki's ability to continue to walk around, find fun, and be carefree in any other show would be a death sentence. The show knows this, the characters know this, and as such the audience knows it. Where Gakkougurashi shines is in its ability to convince you otherwise. The other characters turn to Yuki when they're at their lowest, rely on her to be a beacon of positivity when everything else feels dull and not worth living for. Yuki is not useless - in fact, she's the reason these characters are still going, and still fighting to live despite impossible odds. She represents an idea far greater than her actions without even realising.The show does not take this lens uncritically. Yuki's positivity is induced by her psychosis, a result of a severe and devastating loss she takes towards the middle of the show (which, by the way, was one of the most shocking mid-season twists I've ever had the pleasure of watching pan out). The characters are aware that Yuki is suffering, and also that with this mentality comes a lot of genuine danger - but the risks, to them, outweigh their need for comfort, and so they let Yuki live in her bubble for the run of the show. The apocalypse is a lose - lose game for everyone, and taking away Yuki's ability to live outside it would be just as cruel and unjust.Overall, I gave Gakkougurashi an 8. It isn't a perfect show - some episodes grew a little dull, and the overall animation and writing quality kind of dipped up and down. However, it is definitely a must-watch just for its ability to make you care, and make you really put yourself in the place of the characters. All the decisions made by everyone feel justified, and all of the tense moments will genuinely put you on edge. The School-Living club not only survive, but thrive, with each of the members caring deeply about one another.Also the opening changes in every episode were genuinely delightful.8/10 zombie invasion.

So yeah, without spoiling the show, I think it\'s great, and would recommend you give it a watch.SPOILER SECTIONNow time for the real review. I only watched the amine once, so if I forget some things please forgive me lol. That being said I found the story to be really interesting for the most part. The twist in episode one that this show was a horror had me hooked, and for the most part the story stays really interesting. It\'s very suspenseful and really had me worried for the four main...characters. Tho even in a 12 episode show there is somehow still some filler where the girls do basic school stuff and nothing really happens, like the pool episode for example. Ik it\'s there because it shows the lengths that Yuuri, Kurumi and Miki will go to keep Yuki\'s mental health in check, but it still feels as the story slows down during some episodes. The artwork is amazing, it goes for a very cute art style with some disturbing imagery and I feel it does it really well, and the theme song\'s art changing while the song stays that same upbeat tune is an amazing touch in my opinion. The soundtrack is beautiful, the song ""We took each other\'s hand"" is amazing and actually makes me cry. I also really liked all of the main characters, and the stores of the four main girls, as well as the heartbreaking story of Megumi Sakrua, just got to me. Tho it does have the trope of having a dog character be there just to die, I feel it was handled reasonably well in context. Also, besides Kei, most side characters are just kinda there, I looked on the wiki to make sure I didn\'t spell any of the characters\' names wrong and I forgot Akiko even existed.

I thought this was just a slice-of-life title at first since I didn\'t watch the genre and it completely surprised me. Even if I had known what to expect, the surprise probably would have been just as great.Whereas the premise deliberately wants to give you the wrong idea at first, the story quickly takes off and you are confronted with the truth of what happened. Due to the changes from the manga, the anime adaptation has a much slower pacing, more moe but also a more mysterious atmosphere, especially because of the protagonist. And this...is exactly the strength of this work. The illustration of various traumatic events and how this can burden people. I think in its genre area, he has been able to convince me very much and I have finished watching it in just 2 days.However, it has of course been a very obvious problem that very little has happened in the anime. It was a combination of events and various everyday experiences that have been relatively boring and have harmed the atmosphere very much. By this spontaneous change between gloomy and colorful.After I finished watching the anime and had a somewhat positive impression, I likewise read the manga from start to finish.[For those who want to start the manga and know the difference]- The manga is much darker than the anime but has less of a mysterious atmosphere.- The flow is different (Miki\'s presence in the anime was switched and her background was shown later, in the manga it had normal flow).- The story of the dog was only a short background that didn\'t even take up half a chapter.- Everything after the episode with Kurumi\'s expedition to the basement (and the consequences) has a different flow in the manga.- The anime ended around chapter 20, as that\'s where the storyline diverges from the anime.[Story 4]The story presents a usual apocalyptic setting of a zombie invasion as you know it. This time only from the perspective of some ""moe schoolgirls"" who are trapped and now have to settle for their current lives.The focus is both on the atmosphere of their interaction with the ""undead"" and also how they overcome their fears and problems.Unfortunately, it crossed too much with the colorful look in the anime, so the contrast became too obvious.The ending on the other hand was mostly disappointing, the result of how the school was cleared and lives was saved in the end was trite. The explanation in the manga was much better. Though of course, both have been chock full of plot armor.[Characters 5]I like what the author tried to do here, especially later in the manga. Unfortunately, too many points were deleted in the anime and new ones were added to create more drama. This resulted in questionable plots (like the dog arc) and weak overdramatization. I liked Yuki\'s personality and how she tried to confront reality, even if the realization of it didn\'t reach the quality I would have liked.Kurumi was the usual strong character of the group, armed with the best weapon in the multiverse ""The Shovel"", she showed no mercy with the undead. She was my favorite character, but only because she convinced me well as a mascot.Yurii, on the other hand, could hardly shine in the anime, since her whole character arc started later. Other than that, she was almost just your typical ""ara"" girl.Miki was the second serious character of the group and possessed only adult traits to contrast with Yuki.Megu was a plain nice teacher, though she was given a much more interesting character arc in the anime than in the manga. This is the only positive change.I would have deleted all those ""moe elements"", they were just distracting. However, the characters nonetheless worked well and added a certain charm to the plot.[Music 5]The osts are average. Only the gloomy atmosphere of some scenes was discreetly underscored.The intro is musically very bizarre, but at the same time well chosen. It conveys an interesting change and has a relaxing effect on the viewers, while the episode conveys the exact opposite. At least as long as it doesn\'t become an everyday episode.[Animation 5]Apart from the unnecessary censorship, the animations are average. The biggest positive praise goes to the often mentioned ""atmosphere"" created here thanks to the setting, music, and animation. It is undoubtedly one of the most depressing I\'ve ever seen, although the anime doesn\'t seem that way at all.[Conclusion]It has been a very interesting experience and I will personally remember the anime very positively. Even if it has not been too convincing in terms of quality.Every fan of the anime. however, I recommend it to read the manga.[Enjoyment 7] is exactly the strength of this work.

The teacher died and Yuki started imagening things like they were- talking with the teacher that died- that is why she is so disturbed. They make up things to keep her happy.That really shows something with their friendship from the start, she gets emotinal support as she supports them with her smile. That really makes them keep going!Second;...The art style in this is very much... Let's say surprising in a good way!- It's great with its dramatic moments and the sense of how disturbed they- especially Yuki got under all this time in the School!Third; Nothing was bad about it, the story really kept on being good, it made sense till the end. Everything about it was just aswesome, great!Do I reccommend watching this?; Yes! If you like psychological and horror anime, this is a good watch, especially if you don't have much time!

I want to preface this review by saying that the impact of what this series has to offer is better realized if the viewer goes in blind. With that said, concept only takes a series so far, and while this one has quite the interesting concept, it doesn\'t nearly reach its full potential.IF YOU\'VE READ THE SYNOPSIS YOU ALREADY KNOW, BUT JUST IN CASE, FROM HERE ON OUT THERE MAY BE MINOR SPOILERSSchool-Live! follows the lives of the School Living Club, a club consisting of four students and one teacher...(as well as a dog), as they go about various club activities. This club isn\'t like any other club however. It\'s the only club, and its members are seemingly the only survivors of a zombie outbreak. Our main character, Yuki, doesn\'t seem to realize what kind of situation they are in, as she attends classes in empty, beaten down classrooms. She plans School Living Club events, all the while, the other survivors, Kurumi, Miki, Yuuri, and Megu-nee try to come to grips with their situation and how to potentially survive.The best way to describe this series would be ""Psychological-infused Moe"". The main focus is split between the girls being concerned about Yuki and her current state, and the zombies and how they plan to survive. The problem is that these two tones don\'t mesh very well together. Had this series focused on one or the other it could have excelled. Unfortunately, splitting its time between both causes both aspects, and ultimately the plot as a whole, to suffer. The zombies never feel like a legitimate threat, and a plot device used later on in the series feels all but shoehorned in in an effort to give the plot more depth. Meanwhile, the moe aspect of the series lacks as well, as characters come off more as annoying than cute.Aside from Miki, the viewers learn next to nothing about any of the characters, making it very hard to emotionally invest in any of them. Their reliance on one another becoming the driving force behind what makes them want to make it out alive. The girls actively try to keep Yuki from losing it, and she returns the favor, although she doesn\'t realize it. This is about as far as the characters come.

(Heck, I dropped K-On early on! Generally, I just need something more than just  cute girls doing cute things.) The only way this could have appealed to me is knowing the twist that\'s brilliantly setup and revealed in the first episode. So yes, I didn\'t go into this blind but this is the kind of show you can enjoy watching even after knowing about its twists and ends.To begin with the aspects I definitely liked from the...show: First, the characters. While the main character, Yuki, does get annoying and grating in the beginning. Like Miki, possibly the most level-headed character on the show, she will start to grow on you. With only a cast of 4-5 people, it would be pretty hard to mess up giving them character development in the span of 12 episodes. Fortunately, Gakkougurashi! knows how to show their personalities in it all. I would have liked to learn more about Yuuri (since Miki, Kurumi, and Yuki had their own time to shine so to speak) but while her backstory wasn\'t completely divulged, the middle-latter part of the series gave us a solid look into how she thinks and her personality.Second, can we talk about the soundtrack? It\'s not the usual kind that I generally rave about but the sound design and soundtrack is just so well-done in this series. When it\'s not being its usual peppy self, there\'s a Corpse Party or rather horror J-RPG game feel to it that\'s very fitting. Not to mention, in certain scenes where the background music is dropped or slowed down to a disturbing tempo and tone, it just gives me the chills! It heightened the mood and feel of the series, that\'s for sure. I wondered before how horror anime can scare me, while I didn\'t exactly get scared shitless from this one, it\'s definitely eerie and unsettling.Third, the story! I loved the premise and definitely wasn\'t disappointed with how its executed. It was a blend of cutesy SoL (which I learned that I later didn\'t mind too much,) and a bleak post-apocalyptic vibe to it. Honestly, if it were up to me, I\'d like more of the latter rather than the former as I feel like it weighs the story down a bit pacing-wise.There are some moments when I wanted to slap the club members upright in the head and say ""Is this really the time for this?!"" but it\'s part of its charm. I would have ranked it higher and liked it even more if after the reveal, there was more seriousness introduced early on instead of easing us into it by the middle of the season. But I liked the second half for what it is when they delved further into how each character survived and why their school is the way it is.Overall, I\'m glad I took the time to watch this series. It has been recommended to me a few times and they\'re pretty much spot-on with the recommendation. If you\'re anything like me who is looking for something more than just ""cute"" (there\'s this one scene that broke me in the series where I just went ""k-k-kawaii!!!"" though so beware!) and who are fans of seeing people survive in bleak post-apocalyptic settings, then watch this!It\'s definitely not a perfect show (the pacing can be frustrating but it\'s not too bad - I\'m just not really a fan of the cutesy stuff) but it will entertain, make you laugh, break your heart, and even make you cry. Will it be memorable? Not entirely. But in the end, it\'s a good watch! show: First, the characters. While the main character, Yuki, does get annoying and grating in the beginning.

It has been recommended to me a few times and they\'re pretty much spot-on with the recommendation. If you\'re anything like me who is looking for something more than just ""cute"" (there\'s this one scene that broke me in the series where I just went ""k-k-kawaii!!!"" though so beware!) and who are fans of seeing people survive in bleak post-apocalyptic settings, then watch this!It\'s definitely not a perfect show (the pacing can be frustrating but it\'s not too bad - I\'m just not really a fan of the cutesy stuff) but it will entertain, make you laugh, break your heart, and even make you cry. Will it be memorable? Not entirely. But in the end, it\'s a good watch!', ""School-Live is definetly one of my top 3 from this season, It has zombies, it has moe, it has comedy, it has drama and somehow everything worked together perfectly to make one of the best atmospheres nowdays and they managed to get the best finale from this summer season BY FAR, I swear to god I'm out of fucking tears, WHY?, WHY DID THAT HAD TO... Anyways... Lemme chill out for a sec... *long sigh* Okay, back to normal. It's characters are unique and really lovely, It's story is pretty messed up and while it makes you smile and laugh, 5 seconds later it makes...you cry like a bitch. I'm really looking forward to the second season. I'm not even going to say I recommed this anime, if you didn't watch it yet... you MUST watch it RIGHT NOW. you cry like a bitch.

But that\'s okay, because they have lots of food, water, a swimming pool, a garden on the roof, and tons of space to run around in. The school is set up wonderfully for people to live in round the clock, it has solar power in case the power grid goes down, its own water filtration system,...and a fun science room.This anime has some really good characters, includingYuki: The carefree character that just wants to have fun and LOVES schoolShovel Girl: She carries around a shovel everywhere she goes, surprisingly nobody says anything to her about thatLeader girl: The Club president, runs the garden and cooks the meals, makes everything run smoothlyBook Girl: A new recruit to the group, is getting used to their situations and Yuki\'s anticsMeegu na: The adviser for the club, she does all the paperwork to keep everything official. She is the voice of reason for Yuki, but is mostly ignored by the other characters.Doggo: He runs around and gets into mischief, he can even open doors and interrupts classes.The intro is pretty good, the slight changes throughout the anime break it away from the normal ""cute girls doing cute things"" intros that just show off the characters and call it good.Ive watched this anime twice, and it is much better the second time around, once you know all of its secrets, it makes the whole thing much better to watch from the beginning and see how the anime works around those secrets and makes them actually obvious if you know what your looking for.Sometimes I do think that this school is a little over prepared though, its like they built this thing to survive a apocalypse or something.Was a 7, now an 8/10 after watching it again.But don\'t worry about the girls, I\'m sure they are doing fine. and a fun science room.This anime has some really good characters, includingYuki: The carefree character that just wants to have fun and LOVES schoolShovel Girl: She carries around a shovel everywhere she goes, surprisingly nobody says anything to her about thatLeader girl: The Club president, runs the garden and cooks the meals, makes everything run smoothlyBook Girl: A new recruit to the group, is getting used to their situations and Yuki\'s anticsMeegu na: The adviser for the club, she does all the paperwork to keep everything official.

Weird is not automatically bad and I love a lot of weird things, but ""Gakkougurashi!"" is weird for wrong reasons. It has an amazing premise which is butchered for the first half of the season and you constantly find yourself shaking your head in disbelief that somebody could ruin such a good idea with so many irritating characters and cringe moments. Fan service also feels very awkward and forced. It\'s like they couldn\'t decide should they make something ultra serious or make something lighthearted, so they made something which has both elements. And for the first half (and even a...little bit later, if you manage to last till then) you will keep asking yourself what went wrong. Last few episodes, particularly the last two really redeem the whole series with some moments which will make you teary eyed a little. I think those last two episodes sum the whole premise of the series really nicely. There are some great and positive messages hidden in this mess, but the problems with pacing, cringe inducing characters and moments ruins the fun and relaxation this series could have given to the viewers. Therefore, I can\'t, in my right mind recommend this anime to anyone but to the fans of the genre (don\'t know what would the genre even be). 6/10!

The end of the first episode contains one of those major twists that are best experienced blind. If you have no idea what you\'re getting into... All I can say is that it\'s a great show, and you should absolutely go experience at least that first episode for yourself before reading any reviews.If you\'re still here...I went into this one already knowing the twist that comes at the end of the first episode: that this series that\'s supposedly just a lighthearted slice of life romp with a bunch of cute girls who just love their school soooo much that they want to...live there full-time... actually takes place during a zombie apocalypse. It was knowledge of this twist that drew me in, and I wasn\'t disappointed. Over the course of 12 episodes, this series went from ""Well, that sounds like an interesting idea"" to ""This is one of the best anime I\'ve ever seen.""The whole zombie apocalypse aspect is able to be a spoiler of sorts... because the trauma of the experience has led to our adorable, high-spirited main protagonist retreating into a world of delusions where the school is still running as it should. That was the aspect that really drew me in, because I love those types of psychological stories. The other survivors just can\'t bring themselves to wake her up. And so we still get to experience all the lighthearted slice of life tropes... like pool days, field trips, and summer night tests of courage... only all those things are covers for more practical things, like obtaining supplies from less secure areas of the school.The way Gakkougurashi! maintained this balance throughout was one of its best points for me. I tend to gravitate towards darker shows. Ordinary slice of life tends to lose my interest. Every event does have a darker tint to it, but the cute moments were still enjoyable. We spend the whole series heading towards a final conflict even Yuki can\'t hallucinate her way out of, but her positive attitude also plays a role in keeping the other girls going. The hidden practical nature of every adventure kept me from being too impatient for Yuki to finally snap out of it.But without a doubt, the absolute strongest high point of this series were the characters. Watching Ri watch over them all and try to keep the worst of her worries to herself... Kurumi\'s self-sacrificing nature... Miki\'s determination to grow into a stronger person who can do her part... Even Yuki\'s innocence... Learning that she just feels everything too keenly to accept that this horror has really happened and taken someone she loved from her... Every one of the girls goes on a journey throughout these 12 episodes, and each one gets a chance to reach their highest-- and lowest-- point. Nothing is more important to me in a show than the characters, and that was something Gakkougurashi! definitely got right.The conclusion is a liiiiitle open-ended, but still left me with a feeling of triumph. And if I have any one complaint, it\'s the censorship surrounding the zombies, especially as I\'ve just realized this show IS rated R. (As I was watching it, I figured it was just to keep the rating down or something.)

and horror yeah not exactly a great combination yet somehow School Live made it work pretty damn well.The story begins with Yuki Takeya and her friends who are part of the School Living Club  so basically they live at school however underneath the cute exterior there is a more darker situation happening around them.First off let me start by saying this show will in some cases mindfu*k you because the first episode was executed perfectly it made me think this was just a cute girl's anime,...but no the end shows the real world in a zombie apocalypse which was definitely a surprise.Despite the moe aspect you get from the girls this can be a suspenseful anime since they are school girls it's going to be difficult taking on zombies especially when those zombies used to be your friends and classmates so seeing this group of characters taking upon the challenge of surviving this nightmare was genuinely terrifying, luckily since they are moe looking girls there are moments when the show goes into that cute mood, but it always reminds you of the dark life they have to survive in.The story does take it's time to develop giving us episodes of the girls or some of them messing around while avoiding Zombies, but it also gives us backstory on specific characters too since the group wasn't always like this from the get go and as the story progresses it gets darker and darker as the girls start finding out that the Government and even the school knew this was going to happen eventually which is why their school was so well equipped for such an event.I like how the story also takes a different kind of approach with the Zombies as most zombie shows like High School of the Dead show them as vicious monsters whereas School Live shows them in a way where the zombies actually react to certain things like when Yuki announces for all the students to go home the zombies actually left the school which shows that they have some kind of memory from before they were turned into zombies, this was something that really interested me since we haven't seen zombies shown in a way like this very often.Now there aren't a huge array of characters and all of them are female which is interesting seeing as their school girls you shouldn't expect them to go on a killing rampage so instead they try the best they can to survive with what they have.Yuki Takeya is the main girl and is the most unusual of the group, she loves school and is pretty the glue that keeps the group together, she has a very positive personality always coming up with ideas to make everyone feel happy especially when the mood feels down however behind that happy face is a very traumatised girl who has created her own illusions where all the damage and carnage doesn't exist to her and she thinks that everything is still normal, she is a pretty complex character and does go through a lot of stuff, but you can't help respect her happy attitude in a dead world.Yuuri Wakasa is the president of the School Living Club, she pretty much takes care of the living jobs like cooking, electricity and even lessons, her personality is very calm and mature though serious as she cares greatly for the others although there are times when she does get angry when Yuki or the others start messing around.Kurumi Ebisuzawa is the one who does the more dangerous missions like taking on Zombies or even driving a car, you'll never see her without a shovel which everyone jokes is her boyfriend however she is a mature girl and acts very calm even in difficult situations which the others look up to since she is one who does all the fighting for them, though like Yuki in some ways she is also scarred from the horror's she's seen yet carries on fighting instead of putting a barrier around her.Miki Naoki is the newest member of the group, she originally wasn't with the group instead she was holed up in a mall with her friend until the others found her, Miki is a kind and shy girl though finds it difficult to put up with Yuki's illusions yet she is close friends with her as Yuki calls her Mi-Kun since she is older and tries to act mature for her so she can make her happy.Taroumaru is the clubs pet who was found just shortly before Miki as he had holed up with her until he wandered off and found the others which he lead to Miki, he is definitely a free spirit often running around and causing havoc for the others, but he is a loyal friend and has even helped them multiple times.Megumi Sakura is the club advisor and the only teacher left in the school, she is a sweet person and originally lead the girls after the apocalypse started, she is highly looked up to by Yuki and teaches her from time to time along with keeping the others in check.Sadly since this a zombie show there are deaths, not gonna reveal who dies, but I would keep a look out because it can be pretty sad when someone does end up dying.The artstyle surprisingly worked despite the character models being in the moe criteria it actually fitted with the whole horror setting and probably made it more terrifying because you wouldn't want to see cute girls being torn apart by zombies, the detailing between the illusions and the real life was really good and terrifying as seeing a squeaky clean room suddenly turn into a blooded mess would send shivers down my spine sometimes, the school was nicely designed too as you had the normal areas where the girls usually were and then you had a secret area that they didn't know about which reminded me a lot of secret areas you see in zombie games like Resident Evil.The horror, mystery and Psychological aspects were done very well because these 3 mix in together to give you a pretty confusing time as there are multiple points that make you think is this real or is that real and a prime example is Yuki's illusions which for the first half really do throw you off especially when it shows Megumi who is a big part of these illusions, but you eventually come to understand why Yuki does this, whenever the anime does show zombies it mainly keeps them silhouetted or has a gloomy blaze around them which does make them pretty scary whenever the girls encounter them.The school and Slice of Life aspects help to give you a breather from the horror moments, but these parts can be genuinely sweet and entertaining because you really see the connection these girls have along with the different feelings they go through as they question the life their in and whether it'll get better so you really become attached to these characters and really hope things get better for them, although this aspect is a little ruined by the sneaky bits of fanservice put in like random underwear being shown and a pool episode, I like my fanservice, but in this style it just doesn't fit I mean this isn't High School of the Dead.Overall this is a great zombie type anime that really delves into the psychological impact it can have on people and the horrors they have to go through, so if you're looking for an interesting zombie show that also has cute girls then you'll probably enjoy this. but no the end shows the real world in a zombie apocalypse which was definitely a surprise.Despite the moe aspect you get from the girls this can be a suspenseful anime since they are school girls it's going to be difficult taking on zombies especially when those zombies used to be your friends and classmates so seeing this group of characters taking upon the challenge of surviving this nightmare was genuinely terrifying, luckily since they are moe looking girls there are moments when the show goes into that cute mood, but it always reminds you of the dark life they have to survive in.The story does take it's time to develop giving us episodes of the girls or some of them messing around while avoiding Zombies, but it also gives us backstory on specific characters too since the group wasn't always like this from the get go and as the story progresses it gets darker and darker as the girls start finding out that the Government and even the school knew this was going to happen eventually which is why their school was so well equipped for such an event.I like how the story also takes a different kind of approach with the Zombies as most zombie shows like High School of the Dead show them as vicious monsters whereas School Live shows them in a way where the zombies actually react to certain things like when Yuki announces for all the students to go home the zombies actually left the school which shows that they have some kind of memory from before they were turned into zombies, this was something that really interested me since we haven't seen zombies shown in a way like this very often.Now there aren't a huge array of characters and all of them are female which is interesting seeing as their school girls you shouldn't expect them to go on a killing rampage so instead they try the best they can to survive with what they have.Yuki Takeya is the main girl and is the most unusual of the group, she loves school and is pretty the glue that keeps the group together, she has a very positive personality always coming up with ideas to make everyone feel happy especially when the mood feels down however behind that happy face is a very traumatised girl who has created her own illusions where all the damage and carnage doesn't exist to her and she thinks that everything is still normal, she is a pretty complex character and does go through a lot of stuff, but you can't help respect her happy attitude in a dead world.Yuuri Wakasa is the president of the School Living Club, she pretty much takes care of the living jobs like cooking, electricity and even lessons, her personality is very calm and mature though serious as she cares greatly for the others although there are times when she does get angry when Yuki or the others start messing around.Kurumi Ebisuzawa is the one who does the more dangerous missions like taking on Zombies or even driving a car, you'll never see her without a shovel which everyone jokes is her boyfriend however she is a mature girl and acts very calm even in difficult situations which the others look up to since she is one who does all the fighting for them, though like Yuki in some ways she is also scarred from the horror's she's seen yet carries on fighting instead of putting a barrier around her.Miki Naoki is the newest member of the group, she originally wasn't with the group instead she was holed up in a mall with her friend until the others found her, Miki is a kind and shy girl though finds it difficult to put up with Yuki's illusions yet she is close friends with her as Yuki calls her Mi-Kun since she is older and tries to act mature for her so she can make her happy.Taroumaru is the clubs pet who was found just shortly before Miki as he had holed up with her until he wandered off and found the others which he lead to Miki, he is definitely a free spirit often running around and causing havoc for the others, but he is a loyal friend and has even helped them multiple times.Megumi Sakura is the club advisor and the only teacher left in the school, she is a sweet person and originally lead the girls after the apocalypse started, she is highly looked up to by Yuki and teaches her from time to time along with keeping the others in check.Sadly since this a zombie show there are deaths, not gonna reveal who dies, but I would keep a look out because it can be pretty sad when someone does end up dying.The artstyle surprisingly worked despite the character models being in the moe criteria it actually fitted with the whole horror setting and probably made it more terrifying because you wouldn't want to see cute girls being torn apart by zombies, the detailing between the illusions and the real life was really good and terrifying as seeing a squeaky clean room suddenly turn into a blooded mess would send shivers down my spine sometimes, the school was nicely designed too as you had the normal areas where the girls usually were and then you had a secret area that they didn't know about which reminded me a lot of secret areas you see in zombie games like Resident Evil.The horror, mystery and Psychological aspects were done very well because these 3 mix in together to give you a pretty confusing time as there are multiple points that make you think is this real or is that real and a prime example is Yuki's illusions which for the first half really do throw you off especially when it shows Megumi who is a big part of these illusions, but you eventually come to understand why Yuki does this, whenever the anime does show zombies it mainly keeps them silhouetted or has a gloomy blaze around them which does make them pretty scary whenever the girls encounter them.The school and Slice of Life aspects help to give you a breather from the horror moments, but these parts can be genuinely sweet and entertaining because you really see the connection these girls have along with the different feelings they go through as they question the life their in and whether it'll

Nothing bad ever happens and they're just enjoying the spring time of their youth to the fullest. Everything is fine.Okay so I'm assuming from this point on that if you're reading this review you know what this show's really about. Zombies apocalypse but everything's fine. It's not the first show to have sharp tone shifts and rug pulling moments that leave you questioning how dark things actually are going to get. But I've seen all of Higurashi so unfortunately I found none of what this show had to offer particularly shocking. I think...if I wasn't making constant comparisons I may have been able to get more invested.That's not to say the show is completely unoriginal or bad, just for me personally having seen another show tackle the same kind of dark tone shifts in an otherwise lighthearted setting it was less exciting. I called pretty much every twist that took place after episode 1. I realized pretty early on that the teacher was dead the whole time, and I called the dog dying at the end a few episodes early. But it was still a fun ride. I can really dig it conceptually.The themes in this show were interesting, too. Delusion girl is probably the most interesting character to study. When the mall girl is brought in she immediately questions why on earth they coddle her and think it's fine that she lives so deeply in her delusions. Club president girl is quick to point out that it was the delusional girl that decided to go to the mall in the first place, and she was the one to jump in and save mall girl. It was like, is she unstable, or is she maybe on to something? Her actions seemed to contradict her mental state at times, too. Almost like there was a deeper part of her psychosis that was leading her to make decisions that were actually helping them with survival.She does eventually realize that the visions were unhealthy, though. Toward the end mall girl sees a ghost dog out the corner of her eye, and delusion girl seems to notice and shakes her head saying it's better to not live where you pretend everything is fine. It's okay to be sad sometimes, and it's appropriate to mourn the loss of a loved one. Pretty neat stuff leaves a lot to think about. There was a teaser post-credits scene that might hint at another season but it's been over 6 years and no word on that. I'd love to watch more, but I think it's unlikely to get another season at this point.

While not many things were changed, quite a lot was left out and the order of events was completely thrown out the window. I can understand why they changed it, as they were trying to fit 5 volumes into 12 episodes, but the main issue I have is the amount of time it takes for the characters to actually do something significant.

Absolutely perfect. Beautiful mind-fuckery wrapped in an adorable, pink, candy jpop ribbon.I give this show a 9 because it’s my personal favorite show ever, but aside from the plot I can see why the average person wouldn’t find it as a standout.If you love Madoka Magica and “it’s me and ONLY my best friends against the world” watch this show....Also read the manga <3 Also read the manga <3', 'Don\'t judge a book by it\'s cover.

The art (especially the developing opening sequence) and the ominous, mood-setting sound were captivating and made for some nice scenes in the anime. However, I think the plot and content of the anime were lacking significantly enough for it to be overall not a very good anime.Personally, Yuki made the anime so much worse. Although her development plays a critical role in the plot of the anime, there were too many times when she was actively a nuisance to the other members of the club, threatening their lives unnecessarily by...being too oblivious of her surroundings. Maybe it was out of a genuine fanship for the other characters, but I really despised her for being such a large detriment to the group and for being generally annoying.I also think the pacing of the anime was far too slow. As is true for a lot of anime, the plot of the anime can be condensed pretty well into half the number of episodes. Although there were moments of genuine intrigue that captivated me, there was too much dead time in between, enough so that I could watch while doing other things without missing the plot at all.Overall, I think this could be a decent anime for people who like kawaii girls and don't mind the mix of stereotypical high school girl fun and zombie apocalypse, but definitely not worth the watch if your sense of survival is stronger than your suspension of disbelief and if you desire a fast-paced, moving plot. being too oblivious of her surroundings.

We don\'t see a lot of monsters, they\'re like a Deus ex-machina; what we do see a lot is four girls getting through their last year of high school (as absurd and terrible as it is): Yuki\'s smile was a bright light for the viewers too, apparently.At first, it was just natural to draw parallels between Gakkou and Madoka Magica pertaining how they both open with a premise which...gets brutally destroyed after; but I didn\'t like Gakkou revealing everything at the end of the very first episode, seeing as in Madoka they try harder to lure people in [PUELLA MAGI SPOILER AHEAD] (so much so that if you were to start watching it without any previous knowledge about the anime, you\'d be extremely shocked to see Mami being suddenly beheaded and devoured). I just thought it was too soon and that maybe building up to that moment would\'ve been a better, more engaging choice; boy was I pleasantly surprised.Barring those not bad but a tiny bit predictable twists (some of which weren\'t elaborated on that much, like the one about the Biological Weapon), the story was more  focused on bonds, growth and being forced to come of age in such a desperate situation. The journey is worth it.P.S.: Taroumaru being both a puppy and one of the most layered characters was fantastic; that\'s why his death burned a hole in my stomach, more than Megu-nee\'s (even though I truly adore her). gets brutally destroyed after; but I didn\'t like Gakkou revealing everything at the end of the very first episode, seeing as in Madoka they try harder to lure people in [PUELLA MAGI SPOILER AHEAD] (so much so that if you were to start watching it without any previous knowledge about the anime, you\'d be extremely shocked to see Mami being suddenly beheaded and devoured).

That's it. If you don't want to be spoiled any further I would suggest not to read anything else about this series. Don't look at the synopsis, ignore the rest of this review, and ignore everyone else's reviews. You can't get into Gakkougurashi! and talk about it without ruining the aspect that makes it fun to watch without any idea of what you're getting yourself into.The story is serviceable for what it is, and while it's not mindblowing, I found it entertaining and things...I had questioned and found too convenient were at the very least touched on and given a reason for existing. Enough for me to suspend my disbelief. The story isn't exactly chronologically told, but you're kept thoroughly grounded with a sense of time as the series goes on.The art is very moe coming from Lerche, enough so that you'd be forgiven for thinking at first this could have been the work of Doga Kobo, if not for the choice of colors and backgrounds. The OP gradually changes throughout the series and it's fun to see the visual aspect slowly develop with the story. There's a contrast of art styles that was interesting to look at. I don't particularly remember the animation impressing me at any point, but it does it's job and it's never bad enough to take you out of the show.I really liked the VAs for Gakkougurashi! This is the first time I had actually thought I should start following a seiyū for their work. As someone that has previously only paid attention to studios that I enjoyed, this may help me decide if something is worth watching in the future. The music range is quite broad and each song suits the emotion the series is trying to capture at the time.The characters are the weakest part of the series, and it rides too heavily on the protagonist for the other characters' developments, backstories, and personalities to be interesting. Their developments almost serve as filler in between the main protagonists developments.I enjoyed Gakkougurashi!, but felt it lacked something or perhaps was a little too idyllic at points or felt the plot rushed a lot. While the idea is interesting and it would be fun to dive another level deeper into the plot, I don't think it would be able to hold my attention for another cour.

The premise is that there’s been a zombie apocalypse, and a group of survivors, inexplicably a group of high school girls, are doing their best to survive, and also trying to protect the sanity of protagonist Yuki, who has failed to acknowledge that there has in fact been a zombie apocalypse and is convinced she’s living a kawaii sugoi anime high school life, largely due to the rest of the cast not wanting to take any measures to try and break these delusions. And all things considered, the opening episode’s...a strong one, but the problem is that from then on it falls into uninspired mediocrity, it comes across as though the first episode was properly orchestrated and thought out, yet the rest of it was improvised.My viewer’s guide is that you stop watching after episode 1, because nothing following that is worth your time. Once the big reveal that the setting is actually a sinister zombie apocalypse is over, there’s really nothing captivating that follows, a bit of regular acquiring supplies and the regular surviving the apocalypse shit, a bit of everyone doing their best to try and stop Yuki from going mental, and her mental state in general gets touched on, but none of it’s that compelling, perhaps if they moved it so it was a twist ending, they could’ve made it more effective, but ultimately that’s not what we got, the show is a bait and switch, and nothing more, and is unfortunately a mediocre show that certainly didn’t appeal to me, and I am having difficulty seeing who exactly it could appeal to, it doesn’t even have the cryptic symbolism of “psychological” shows, nor the crude edge factor of other “moe but not really” shows, in a word, it’s a disappointment. a strong one, but the problem is that from then on it falls into uninspired mediocrity, it comes across as though the first episode was properly orchestrated and thought out, yet the rest of it was improvised.My viewer’s guide is that you stop watching after episode 1, because nothing following that is worth your time.

"Kimi to, Nami ni Noretara",https://myanimelist.net/anime/38594/Kimi_to_Nami_ni_Noretara,"['I picked up this film for no other reason than the fact that it was directed by Masaaki Yuasa. This is a very different type of story than he would typically adapt. It\'s a story about love, coming of age and learning to move on from loss. Colorful, vibrant and fairly easygoing, it does away with most of Yuasa\'s hallmarks of frantic and wild fever dreams.Nothing wrong with that, however I don\'t think the movie is very successful at giving its lead much of anything to do besides being an absolutely hopeless blubbering mess who comes off as a dysfunctional klutz who needs her hand...held by her knight in shining armor.The film starts off showing Hinako - the female lead - as an elusive, glowing trophy. Two friends, Minato and Wasabi, admire her surfing in the distance. They don\'t know her name, and accept that her existence in their lives could be as fleeting. Yet fate has her cross paths with both of them, and in fact Minato ends up saving her from a fire, and the two of them start dating.It\'s then that you learn that Hinako is basically only good at surfing and doesn\'t have her life together in any way. She can\'t take care of herself, her house is a mess, she can\'t cook, she doesn\'t have a job - in fact, it\'s never quite made clear what exactly she\'s doing with her life. Minato, on the other hand, does everything for her and is basically the perfect cookie-cutter boyfriend. She becomes quite reliant on him. The only thing he can\'t do is surf, which Hinako teaches him.After a series of tragic events, Hinako spends the rest of the film acting like a lunatic when she learns she can sing a song to make an apparition appear in water whenever she needs its advice - which is basically all the time. The problem is, no one else can see this except her. So naturally, everyone around her finds her behavior strange. I can\'t tell if these portions of the film are supposed to be funny, or sad, or perhaps even both. It\'s a bizarre mix of emotions and it lacks any kind of magic or chemistry. The romantic chemistry only exists because of dependency issues, and Minato is such a flat and uninteresting character that it\'s hard to be anywhere near as infatuated with him much as Hinako is.The supporting cast is .. there. The only voice of reason is the stone cold Youko, Minato\'s sister. Minato\'s friend Wasabi doesn\'t do much of note besides live in the shadow of his buddy. And there\'s really not much more to it.As the title suggests, the film is supposed to be about Hinako learning how to ""ride the wave"" of her life. But constantly throughout the film she howls and begs for others help. It\'s only at the very tail end of the story that Hinako learns to grow, and only because of Minato\'s help. She never once accomplishes anything on her own accord.It\'s an unsatisfying story because of this abrupt end to Hinako\'s arc. The ending is bittersweet, as one might imagine, but it lacks any emotional punch. Hinako is hard to care about because she doesn\'t grow or change much, and when she does it feels unearned. Minato is hard to care about because he\'s basically an ideal and not much of a character. I, personally, only really enjoyed Youko\'s brief time on screen, a minor character by all means.Should you watch ""Ride Your Wave""? I\'m not sure who I would answer ""yes"" to. If you like the works of Masaaki Yuasa, you probably are looking in the wrong place. If you like romantic stories, the relationships aren\'t fleshed out enough here to give a satisfying romance. Everything that ""Ride Your Wave"" represents falls flat. Perhaps it could offer some catharsis for those going through loss, but I think there are many other stories out there that do it better. If you are looking for anime in that vein, I might recommend something like ""The Wind Rises"", ""Shinsekai Yori"" or ""Katanagatari"" instead. held by her knight in shining armor.The film starts off showing Hinako - the female lead - as an elusive, glowing trophy.

This review will contain spoilers (kind of) as well as my own personal experience, so please bear with me. This is my first review.When I first saw the trailer for this film, I thought it would be another romance anime, but it was more than that to me. I'll start with the six points and why I scored them as such. I hope you enjoy this review. And even if our opinions differ, I'm glad I was still able to share my experience with you all.Story...(7): The story was nothing overly spectacular, but was very relatable in terms of someone starting their own path in life and working their way towards their future with each bump in the road along the way. Even so, I enjoyed the journey and really felt it on a personal level. Which I will discuss at the end of this review.Art (9): The art style and animation in this film was absolutely gorgeous. The colors were bright and used effectively and I really enjoyed the pleasant look of the whole film. The movement of the waves were honestly what stood out to me most.Sound (8): The soundtrack in this movie was very well done. The composition was put together in a way that I thought worked well. I'm no expert on sound design or music scores, but I enjoyed how everything flowed with the movie like a wave. It matched the tone and I had no problems with it.Character (7): I enjoyed the characters. Nothing to write home about, but I was invested in them nonetheless. Nothing really more to say here. No complaints.Enjoyment (10): As I stated in the beginning of this review albeit being short and to the point, I felt this movie on a personal level. I enjoyed watching it and I hope to see more from this studio.I wrote this review because in April of 2019, my father who was eldery passed away and left this earth. He had been struggling for a long time but chose not to tell me because he knew I would worry. Even though he passed peacefully, it's been tough grieving someone who had been there my whole life.I lost my job, my sense of purpose, my interests in a lot of things and have felt conflicted on where to go and what to do. I was sobbing by the end of this movie because even when people leave us they're always there in spirit. I felt my own father was trying to reach out to me while I watched this film trying to tell me that he wanted me to be happy and to get back on my feet.Thank you for reading this if you did and I do recommend you watch this film.

It\'s about how people need to keep moving forward and learn to stand on their own even through the hardships. There\'s a lot of symbolism in the movie between riding a wave and the life of a person. The story also touches on motivation, as Hinako struggles...with finding the strength to move on after the death of her boyfriend.Art - 8People will probably recognize the art style from the recent devilman series as its made by the same studio. The style, as with all their works, is simple but unique. But I particularly like this style because it gives something that can\'t be imitated by 3D CGI or live acting. It\'s a bit hard to explain but the style exaggerates certain things like when eating or doing actions, certain body parts may be way out of proportion than they should, and this exaggeration is something which you can only produce because your medium is 2D. Being a smaller studio, they obviously can\'t produce gorgeous backdrops or super intense action scenes but they\'ve certainly proved that there\'s more to animation than just that, and you can convey so much even with simple animation.Sound - 9If you haven\'t heard of Oshima Michiru before it\'s about time you have. This woman is a living legend of a composer. The main reason I watched this movie actually was because I saw her name in the trailer. She produces a lot of background music for japanese anime or dramas. Usually they\'re orchestral, most of the time they have this nostalgic kind of vibe like the ET theme. In this movie however, most of the music is lighthearted and uplifting and it really helps in setting the mood and conveying the expressions of the characters. It\'s nothing extravagant but still really good.Character - 7There aren\'t many characters as this is a movie, so there isn\'t much time for introduction or development. But there are 4 main characters, each with different hair colors so the audience can tell them apart easily haha. No one really stands out as a really cool/unique character but the main focus of the movie is the story so as far as interaction between characters go, the dialogue was really good and nothing really felt that awkward or out of place to hear.Enjoyment - 8Really enjoyable. Probably something I would have enjoyed watching with my girlfriend if I had one :( This movie is about love, but it\'s also about coping loss and motivation so I think it appeals to a lot of whoever\'s watching this.Overall - 8The story is surprisingly good. Love stories usually struggle in any genre because it\'s so hard to relate to something I believe the majority of the population struggles in (especially anime otaku haha) but what makes this good is it also tackles other things besides love and it manages to do all this and make the story simple and easy to understand for the audience to follow. I like simple, simple is best.

I came in, with no pre-exisiting notions, i hadn't even seen the trailer so i had no pre-conception of the film.SPOILERS AHEAD!!Story (3):Firstly I thought the Film was Mediocre at best. The story was very linear and simple. Girl falls in love boy, boy dies trope. Although this is okay and can be interesting, the story didn't make it interesting and instead dragged out a semi-pointless story of Hinako dating water Minato.Art (6):The art was really...good at times and really bad at other times. When it came to scenery and back ground, the art was fantastic. Especially the water. However, when it came to characters the art was just bad, I myself am an Artist/Animator and this was something an independent could do on their own.Sound (7):Now the sound in this movie was relatively good, especially the music and sound effects. However a big problem with the title song is that it played almost throughout the whole movie  (whether it was sang by the characters or played in the background) which made the audience sick of the song by the end of the music. So although it was a good song, it's overplayed too much.Character (4):I think where the movie really failed was in establishing any emotional connection between the audience and the characters. We basically got a short montage of Minato and Hinako and then when story kicks in it expects you to already be connected to Hinako, who we have seen no character development for and only seen her ride a wave and get saved by Minato. We are then expected to engage with Hinako and her post-minato's death mentality. At first I thought that they were gonna deal with psychosis and denial, because it seemed like the water Minato was not real and in her imagination (which i thought could've explored some interesting territory) but ultimately it turned out that it was real and gave emotional weight to her character.Enjoyment (3):i'll be honest here, i did not enjoy this movie. It set up the premise really quickly and was straight to the point and i was not able to connect to the movie on a personal level despite any similar experiences i have had.Overall (5):Overall the movie is mediocre at best. There's nothing groundbreaking and the story is very bland and linear. So if you're expecting to be wow'ed then this movie is not for you. I'd say watch this movie if you're looking for an anime flick to pass the time with. good at times and really bad at other times. When it came to scenery and back ground, the art was fantastic.

My main issues with the movie are the rushed pacing and constant repeating of the films main message, moving on from sadness/grief and relying on yourself in life. The movie isn't a complete dud as it has great visuals and cute moments between the main characters but I can't say that's its more than average. Worth a watch but not highly recommended! I think Josee, the Tiger and the Fish has very similar vibes to this movie but executes the romance aspect better so give that a try if you like this one. "", ""You can make something groundbreaking by doing nothing groundbreaking and everything else really damn good.Just a quick heads up for anyone who may want to watch this movie: DON'T WATCH THE TRAILER. The trailer for some damn reason spoils the entire movie and makes it not near as intriguing to watch. I'm glad I didn't watch the trailer until after the movie.I am just blown away about how surprisingly spectacular this movie was. Looking at the score and the reviews, I thought this would either be a disappointing, boring ass movie like Shikioriori or a real solid, heartwarming movie like Summer Wars; and it was...none of the above.I deeply ADORE this movie and Science SARU has become one of my all-time favorite studios.Yes in fact, the reviews do speak the truth; the movie does nothing groundbreaking, but DAMN IS IT AMAZING. The writing is maybe slightly above average, the plot has been done a million times before, the execution was exquisite, the character design is simple, but beautiful, the characters themselves are memorable, the animation is so clean it puts Mr. Clean himself to shame, and I still can't get the soundtrack out of my head.Does this movie deserve the score it has? In my opinion, hell no.Ride Your Wave is one of those movies that does nothing different, but absolutely everything extremely well.Do not sleep on this emotional, heartwarming mastapiece of a film. You may not love it as much as I do, but I can assure that you are in for a tasty-ass treat.Watch this sh*t now. none of the above.I deeply ADORE this movie and Science SARU has become one of my all-time favorite studios.Yes in fact, the reviews do speak the truth; the movie does nothing groundbreaking, but DAMN IS IT AMAZING.

Within the first twenty minutes, they establish a romance between the main characters, Hinako and Minato. It\'s cliche, predictable, and I found myself cringing. I can\'t understand how we, as the viewers, are supposed to feel emotionally invested, or even care about the characters when the movie speeds through their relationship, just to get it out of the way.The viewer must sit through a terrible song, sung...by Hinako and Minato, as they go on dates to establish that, \'look, these two are in love\'. After that\'s over, tragedy strikes. I felt nothing but annoyance at this point, but I continued to watch.Hinako soon realizes that she can summon her beloved by singing the song from the relationship montage. I close my eyes and take a breath. I know where this is going. Sure enough, that terrible song is sung, repeatedly, over the entire course of the movie.Does anyone remember that meme of Mr. Incredible where he\'s on the ground, clearly in pain, with the caption ""I can\'t...not again. I\'m not...strong enough"" -- because this is how I felt every time Hinako sang that @#%! song. The singing was like nails on chalkboard. It made me grit my teeth. I felt my blood pressure rise with each broken note.Music aside, Hinako is obnoxious and unlikable. She sulks, pouts, and makes everything all about her, despite the fact that others are suffering too. She acts erratically and obsessively. She comes across as unintelligent and klutzy, without any redeeming qualities. She\'s nothing without her man. I haven\'t disliked a character so much in a long time.In contrast, Minato is the \'cool guy\'. He\'s laidback, intelligent (I guess), seems to have his life together, and is completely enamored with Hinako, which is frustrating to watch. I failed to see where the attraction stemmed from, but they touch on that later, and...well. I\'ve seen better plot twists on the Neopets RP boards.But I digress. Hinako just can\'t seem to move on, so she brings Minato with her wherever she goes, except he\'s carried around in a water bottle and in a blowup porpoise, because he can only exist in water. Oh, and she\'s the only one that can see him, so her friends think she\'s crazy. Rightfully so.Minato\'s character offers nothing. He throws up the shaka (surfs up) sign in every scene, offering little tidbits of encouragement while Hinako goes off the deep end. She acts giddy and seems to think that their relationship can persevere despite the fact that her man is literally in a water bottle.All the while, the ""goal"" of the movie is for Hinako to \'ride her own wave\', aka move on without Minato.And...that\'s the movie. What you expect to happens, happens. It\'s predictable, it\'s boring, it\'s cringeworthy and frustrating. I enjoyed Lu Over the Wall, so I thought I\'d like this one, but it\'s a hard pass.

But even his weakest work makes for a great watch that\'s enjoyable and has at least some interesting things about it.Before watching this film it\'s best that you know what you\'re in for so that you\'d be in the right mindset. This is a relatable and sweet (if cheesy and a very fairy tale-esque) portrayal  of young love which then turns in to a story of overcoming loss, letting go of...the past and finding new passions in life. The surfing and catching waves motif in the film is akin to catching new opportunities in life instead of hiding underwater and letting opportunities pass over you.Not a bad concept and this is tied together nicely with every aspect of the film. I especially like the hints we get about the main character early in the film about her clinging to her childhood by having her move in to her childhood town, using her childhood surfboard, eating her childhood food, listening to a song from her childhood... etc\' etc\'it\'s a little heavy handed, but it makes for good foreshadowing to what she\'s about to cling to later in the film.The male lead observed baby sea turtles struggling to enter the sea which hints at what he\'s going to cling to as well.The chemistry between the two leads is pretty solid, if a bit cheesy and the film is able to set up a fairly cute love story in its first act, using montages, seeing them have fun together and hearing them have nice casual conversations too.The supporting characters don\'t have too much of a character arc of their own, but they\'re also given enough personality, screen time, serve enough of a purpose in the story to justify their existence and they do just that - support.You have a another firefighter who\'s not very good at his job, but is trying his best to improve and is also used as a red herring to make the audience think he\'s gonna be another love interest for the main character. There\'s also the real love interest\'s little sister who\'s the voice of reason and does play more of a role later in the film.The thing you really need to know going in to this film is that it relies heavily on happenstance and fairy tale logic:[SPOILERS AHEAD]The inciting incident of the film is that the main character is saved by a fireman from a fire who (later turns out) just so happens to be the same guy she saved from drowning when they were kids.. Who later becomes her boyfriend, who later drowns in the sea, dies and becomes a firefighting ghost with water powers who saves the day in the climax (yeah it can\'t be her imagination at that point)..  It\'s also worth mentioning that the climax is set up pretty conveniently too, with one of the supporting characters who just so happened to overhear the same punks who set off fireworks illegally and caused the fire in the beginning of the film, planning their next fireworks playtime in an abandoned building where there happens to be a dried up tree that catches fire easily..[End of SPOILERS]Maybe making this feel like a fairy tale was intentional, I have no way to know that. I\'m just pointing this out because this does hamper some of the character\'s control over the story in retrospect. It feels like the scenarios are driving the characters half the time and not the other way around. This isn\'t too bad though since in a lot of the film the characters do act in a way that\'s significant and that\'s tied to their personalities, it\'s just that the transition between acts or the actual plot points that feel kinda forced and establishing that ghosts exist in the middle of the film isn\'t the best decision.Visually, the film is quite beautiful in terms of imagery and background art that seems to have great depth of field  and has very fluid character motions, impressive character acting, as well an emphasis on food and coffee animation that is also very elaborate. Coming from Yuasa Masaaki this is probably his most mainstream looking film, in the sense that the characters look a lot more ""animeish"" and further away from Masaaki\'s usual abstract style. Which is fitting since the film in general is more of a crowd-pleaser (not that there\'s anything wrong with that) and further away from his more abstract and weirder works.Soundwise it has breezy pop music, great sound design and excellent voice acting all around, especially from the main character who is the only one to sound like an actual anime character, while the rest sound like they have more realistic speech patterns (not the first time this has been done).Overall, I\'d say it\'s Yuasa\'s weakest work, but still a terrific film that\'s emotionally powerful, fun, has nice atmosphere and hits all the right notes.Yeah, it\'s pretty sappy, but I guess I\'m a sap.. the past and finding new passions in life.

This movie really had some promise, the premise is alright and what it more or less wanted to do could be a good story, but it fails on so many crucial parts.  To be fair I\'ll start with what I liked.First I actually quite liked the music, and by that I mean musically they were not bad songs.  I also did enjoy the two main characters singing together as it added some nice wholesomeness to the montage.  Secondly I did like the...art, backgrounds and still objects were very beautiful and things were vibrant when it needed to be and muted where they weren\'t.  I also enjoyed the couple of action/fire sequences as they were fairly well done and quite engaging. And finally the core story is good, dealing with a person having to handle the loss of a loved one and the toll it can take on them.Those were the few pros that bumped it up to a 3, but here are the things that it really does poorly.  First minor problem is the animation and character design, Im all for unique art styles and character design but these designs often make the characters look down right stupid and often took away from deep moments in the movie as they made silly and exaggerated looking faces, also their animations were often distracting and really took away from the tone being set at times.Second is the characters, these might be minor spoilers but I will try to remain vague.  Our two main characters are pretty underwhelming but not inherently bad.  Hinako can be a little stupid at times but overall she was probably the best, Minato was simply bland and so overly romantic at times I almost felt like Hinako was being set up or lured into a trap, see the sudden heart card and lock in the tower.  Wasabi was a very nothing character as well, providing very little to the plot except for some very forced feeling conflict with him trying to date his dead friends GF. Finally Youko was by far the worst character, she was a rotten human being and the only explanation for this was she had a sharp tongue as she spews insults and practically mock a girl whose BF just died.  Her ""redemption arc"" also consisted of nothing more than ""she has a crush now so she cant be bad.""  Id also like to bring up the fact that Youko and Wasabi did practically nothing to help Hinako who was, as far as they knew, having a mental breakdown.Next is pacing.  Im a fairly decent reader of subtitles and yet the characters talked so fast throughout the entire film, I found my self constantly pausing and rewinding to read what was said.  And yet despite this it seemed like very little was actually being said, towards the end I could gloss over about 60% of the dialog and still understand what was happening.  It seemed like the film was constantly racing to get to its two big climaxes, the ending and the other one.Sound design was also a big problem, while the music used was quite good musically, the way the sound designers used it a lot of the time ruined it.  I often found myself getting interested in some very dramatic and sad scenes only to quickly get snapped out of it by the borderline happy music being played.  They also did a couple cuts from loud music to sudden silenced, this worked once to create tension but the others times just made me thing my audio cut out.Finally the story, as I said before the premise isn\'t bad, however the lightning fast pacing and pointless and/or unlikeable characters caused me to not care about the issues occurring through almost the whole film.  The set up to Minato and Hinako\'s relationship was done in about 5 minutes of montage and then the audience is supposed to feel a connection.  For me this connection was never made and any investment I might have had in these characters was quickly swept away by their unlikeable personalities and terrible character design.Overall I was incredibly disappointed, the art and synopsis looked very interesting and what clips I had seen before hand tuned out to be by far the best the movie had to offer.  Its obvious that the background artists and the musicians were not included in some meetings as they are the only reason this film gets a 3 over a 1. art, backgrounds and still objects were very beautiful and things were vibrant when it needed to be and muted where they weren\'t.

The main character, Hinako, is attempting to figure out what direction to go in for her career and life (hence ""riding her wave""), and she enjoys surfing. She falls in love, something tragic happens, she becomes lost, something dramatic happens, and she is made to realize which direction she feels compelled to go in. It falls a bit flat, as it is not anything incredibly detailed. Unlike the core of the story, the path through the story...is not nearly as relatable. Hinako relies heavily on the other characters to find herself, which makes her seem dangerously dependent. What she accomplishes is diminished by the fact that she does very little of it for herself.Art (9):While the story falls a bit flat, the art is beautiful and the colors work well with the various settings. The movement of different things-- such as the waves that Hinako surfs on-- shows true strength in animation. The only thing that I think bothered me was how thin the characters\' legs are. In some scenes, the characters appear to be walking on little sticks, even if they are not super distant. It is definitely a trait that stands out.Sound (8):Having a specific song as a recurring theme throughout the movie does lend to the story a bit, but the song started to wear on me by the end of the movie. The main song is a cute song, and the lyrics definitely fit the story, but I got a bit tired of hearing Hinako and Minato singing it.Character (5):The characters are where the movie truly falls flat. The main character, Hinako, is very dependent on others. She learns very little on her own, and therefore, her character development seems largely unearned. The other characters feel like someone you meet once and never see again, despite their presence throughout the movie. They are not very dynamic. Certain aspects of certain characters-- including their desires-- are cut terribly short or jarringly switch directions. In fact, Minato is probably the most interesting character in the movie, which is a shame. His story gives him the most depth and purpose of all of the characters, and he shapes all of the other characters in some way. I would say he is the true main character.Enjoyment (7):While the movie was not the most spectacular thing I have ever seen, I did enjoy it. It was simple and cute, and relatable, and there were parts that brought tears to my eyes or made me feel very warm and fuzzy. I would be willing to show it to someone else, but I would not rewatch it on my own. There are other stories out there that do everything this movie was intended to do, but with a bit more strength.

It is definitely a trait that stands out.Sound (8):Having a specific song as a recurring theme throughout the movie does lend to the story a bit, but the song started to wear on me by the end of the movie. The main song is a cute song, and the lyrics definitely fit the story, but I got a bit tired of hearing Hinako and Minato singing it.Character (5):The characters are where the movie truly falls flat. The main character, Hinako, is very dependent on others. She learns very little on her own, and therefore, her character development seems largely unearned. The other characters feel like someone you meet once and never see again, despite their presence throughout the movie. They are not very dynamic. Certain aspects of certain characters-- including their desires-- are cut terribly short or jarringly switch directions. In fact, Minato is probably the most interesting character in the movie, which is a shame. His story gives him the most depth and purpose of all of the characters, and he shapes all of the other characters in some way. I would say he is the true main character.Enjoyment (7):While the movie was not the most spectacular thing I have ever seen, I did enjoy it. It was simple and cute, and relatable, and there were parts that brought tears to my eyes or made me feel very warm and fuzzy. I would be willing to show it to someone else, but I would not rewatch it on my own. There are other stories out there that do everything this movie was intended to do, but with a bit more strength. Overall, though, this movie was not bad.', ""I will review this going straight forward to the PTSD of the main character, a thing that I did not see in other reviews, I don't know why.This review doesn't have spoilers.the main character has post-traumatic schizophrenia, but although this is a remarkable adult plot, the movie doesn't completely understand the mental illness of hers as so and ground the situation into a child-like fantasy-power experience.Didn't expect much before watching it, but the movie itself shows its potential and then just disappoints a bit.I didn't see a single review talking about the PTSD which is in many real-life cases the cause of this type...of psychosis Hinako has. I don't wanna think I overthought the movie, it seems so explicit to me that makes me nervous nobody saying it.So I think a movie more focused on this would be awesome, but despite having all the resources to do so, the movie takes a more 'animely' path.. what a waste.Because anime can't have deep themes like mental illness, can it?Finishing the movie has some nice but very predictable and forced plot twists.Good visual art, good sound, surf scenes well animated, a catchy song, can make you cry (...) definitely the type of movie you'd see with your family or girlfriend to spend time together of psychosis Hinako has.

Their love story had developed fully at 20 minutes in. The back story was revealed almost in the end, so before, it was hard to relate. Also the type of all 4 characters was again, the ""happy, harmless, hard working"" type so it becomes impossible to relate. Like, this is a systemic stereotype, give us a break. Lastly, it seemed that everyone else other than the 4 youths, was either too promiscuous or too old to be considered a character. ', ""The message of the film is great and the two secondary characters were pretty well executed. They both had their own life and issues related towards the male lead and showcasing that added a lot towards the detail on his death. Despite there being one scene that leaned towards the friend becoming the main female's second lover, it didn't bear any fruits. Michiru Oshima is great as always. It's a shame that half of the soundtrack is just the vocal track.However that is the only praise for it's story writing that I can give. The pacing is a mess. It poorly built up the...romance and that greatly impacts the entire second half of the movie. A decent chunk of the scenes only exist just to showcase how good at animation the studio is, which is unnecessary wasted time in a film where every second counts.The second half is the meat of the story, however there it seems to have conflicting messages. It seemed like they couldn't decide whether the delusions were a positive thing or unhealthy. For a movie that's whole message is about moving on, the climax wholeheartedly acts as if her delusions worked. It's a smack in the face of the message and frankly ruins what should've been a decent film. How does justifying her deluded reality give any closure? And how exactly does him having a non-subtle effect on the world add to the clear message? The is easily one of Masaaki Yasua's weakest works. I enjoyed it, however I can't say that it's a good film with the major blunder that is the climax.I recommend seeing his previous works if you liked this one.

This movie is the latest anime feature from director Masaaki Yuasa (Lu Over The Wall, Night Is Short), who I find very hit or miss, but I\'m happy to say I thought this was a hit! In fact I loved this movie so much I almost gave it a 9/10, but a few things held it back to a strong 8/10. When I first saw the trailer I rolled my eyes a bit because...it comes off as a cheesy romance movie, but honestly the romance was VERY well done. Probably one of the best anime romances, ever. The main couple just have such natural chemistry and are so likable, they feel like a real couple and you just want to see things work out for them. I LOVED the design for lead girl, Hinako! She is just so cute and upbeat and strong and a total surfer babe! I\'m not kidding when I say I\'d literally watch a movie with any plot that has her in it, I just find her so entertaining to watch. Like that opening scene when she gets a surprise call from mom and she\'s trying to make lunch while trying to keep every box in her house from falling on her? I was in stitches! I wanna point out Hinako\'s tan, how she\'s much darker skinned than the male lead. For me this is a big deal since I almost always see the opposite in anime, where a tan male lead is accompanied by a much lighter skinned female lead (I could give so many examples but look at Natsu vs. Lucy in Fairy Tail or Ash vs. Misty in Pokemon). Anyway, Hinako\'s tan skin to me shows how atypical, how against the grain she is. Furthering my point is the fact that her boyfriend admires her surfing skills so much that he says SHE\'s HIS hero, when in a normal romance anime I feel like the female lead would be going goo goo eyed over the male lead\'s athletic ability, y\'know? Minato\'s a pretty loveable lead as well, a dude who became a firefighter solely because he loves helping people. You can see why Hinako falls in love with him so fast. Side note: I couldn\'t help but notice that Minato\'s got the same design as Ryo from Devilman Crybaby (only with dark hair), so I kept thinking to myself that this was an alternate reality where Ryo wasn\'t an asshole and got a girlfriend lol. I also have to mention that Minato\'s best friend Wasabi and Minato\'s sassy little sister Youko have a side romance that\'s actually VERY well done and cute as well. Even minor characters shine in this film! The animation is really solid, the designs are a bit lanky and noodley, but less so than normal Yuasa outings. The animation almost looks like a normal anime movie!OK, so if I loved it so much why did I only give Ride Your Wave an 8? Well, this is where it\'s hard to avoid spoilers, but I\'ll say the film doesn\'t stay light hearted for very long: it\'s actually a movie about coping with tragedy, which might throw some people off guard. It\'s a very sad film that can be hard to watch at times, so please don\'t watch this if you\'re already in a sad mood. Where I subtract some points is the supernatural twist related to the tragedy, which I found a bit silly and kind of hurt the film. Though it did lead to some great comedy, like when Hinako accidentally summons the water spirit in a toilet. Another big minus for me was that the film plays its theme song ""Brand New Story"" WAYYY too fucking much! It\'s a catchy song but I heard it so many times I just wanted to puncture my ear drums! Don\'t believe me? It\'s the theme of the movie, so they play it as part of the OST, AND it happens to be the fave song of the leads so they are CONSTANTLY singing it or humming it or listening to it on the radio, AND it\'s actually plot related because Hinako can only summon the water spirit by...you guessed it, singing that DAMN song! There\'s also a tiny twist at the end where you find out Hinako and Minato were like destined to meet, blah blah, it\'s really unnecessary and forced and stupid. My biggest complaint is that Youko and Hinako\'s actions at the climax are very dumb, like they kind of deserved to drown. Why would you follow these dangerous characters without contacting the police? And then Youko says they have to wait for the gang to light the fireworks, but then she says they have to take a perfect picture of the gang in the act, but THEN she says she needs a good video of it before they call the cops!? Ugh, just call the damn cops and get outta there, dummy!

Although I will say that the fire fighter scenes were pretty intense regardless if they were only training or had to attend buildings that were on fire due to fireworks.I understood this films backdrop involving the feeling of losing someone through drowning and honestly the ending was a near hard hitter for me. However I would have liked if the couples experience together was more in depth because as I said yet again, it was rather rushed. It didn't give much in...depth either with the other guy who had a crush in her or if he was going for someone else. Since I'm not gonna say spoilers to telling you who's who, it's best to watch the film.Animation wise, it was pretty alright.

It deals with the motif of water, being the main driving force of flowing through time, hardships and coming to terms with life. It is also a connector between our main characters, which were made to be as dull and one dimensional as possible.Hinako is the only salvageable character in the film and that is solely because she is the main focus of the theme of letting go and growing up. Despite this, I perceived her character more as a sort of stepping stone to present the theme...of the movie rather than actually portraying an interesting person.Minato was an absolutely eye-sore. It\'s like they tried to jam the perfect human male role model inside a seemingless, pointless and uninteresting creature that comes off as fast and agressive to the viewer as he does to Hinako, but due to plot-reasons, he actually gets his way and performs the most plain and dull dialogue ever in a romantic movie.Seeing as this is an adaption of an already plain storyline, I have no hard feelings toward Masaaki Yuasa, as his production work and art quality were over the top, and the animation was an absolutely treat to watch. This may be the only redeeming quality of a hard to swallow piece of media.This feels like a rushed romantic melodramatic film that was produced in order to either compete or gain advantage of the sudden rise of interest in these types of films thanks to already amazing productions such as ""Your Name"" and ""Weathering with You"", both which deal with what ""Ride your Wave"" was trying to convey is a cleaner way.It\'s worth a watch, but if you decide to indulge in this snooze-fest, I\'d recommend plugging off your brain from listening to the dialogue and enjoy the mesmerizing visuals that Yuasa has given us. of the movie rather than actually portraying an interesting person.Minato was an absolutely eye-sore.

Lowest would be Characters then Sound. Heres what I think:Art: 9| While the art really brings out the emotions, it kind of looks weird at certain times, kind of alien. It is so much better than some lip flapping picture though!Story: 8| The plot of the story brings you in and the beginning sets up the romance story to be something great, but the amount of timeskips or quick speed ups to try to fit a romance story that should be more fleshed out into a...1hr time frame, kind of kills the big tragedy that\'s suppose to set up for the revival at the end.Sound: 5| The theme song is super chipper, really sets the fun in the waves and how nice it is in that summer surfing season. Its just when its sung the 11th billion time that is gets old. Not to mention the very mediocre soundtrack that accompanies a scene. Wouldn\'t mind just listening to background or sfx over the music.Characters: 7| While the main (Misako) has a lot of bright, cheery eyed, star struck, klutz you learn to love and cry and cheer with.  The other characters aren\'t so fleshed out and are more like story placeholders rather than actual beings.Overal & Enjoyment: 8| I enjoyed it! The art is captivating, funny, sad, and the story is well thought out. Misako is a character I would love to have as a friend. I wish I could talk with someone I love by singing a song and calling them up from the water. It has some bad sides, but that\'s what happens when a big romance tragedy and revival arc all have to fit in a 1 hr time slot. I would love to be able to read this as a manga or even watch it as an episodic anime show.Spoilers Ahead!The story the art and even the characters are so nicely drawn, with so much emotions. You wish that you could be there in those heartbreaking moments, or wish you can slap those fire making gangstas\' faces.The art style really brings out those emotions. Instead of static faces with a lip flap, you can see their whole face contort or scrunch up or even get super red. It makes them more animated and relatable than some 2D mouth moving picture. The story is a wave of emotions itself. From the beginning where it sets up some guy admiring his ""hero"" and this girl who wants to be out there, do things, show the world she is more. Then the two meeting up realizing they have so much more in common and a past too. Their love story blossoms until it is all taken away from him saving someone\'s life. In the end though, the girl realizes her dreams, finds her place in the big world, and realizes she can take on any wave.But what this story lacks, is the time it needs to flesh out a romance. The beginning is sweet. Its romantic. It drags me in because I see the romance blossom in real time, but then I\'m suppose to believe in tiny glimpses of the romantic adventure these two have in short tiny story points? Yes it\'s cute they are singing the theme with tiny laughs and so much emotion, but I can\'t relate or really see everything blossom.Its like trying to figure out what the ocean is except you live in the middle of a continent and all you have is a snow globe that\'s has a small replica of ""Panama Beach"".So when the big dramatic climax comes in, I\'m not invested enough in the relationship to realize how big the drop, the tragedy, will become. I\'m sad that such a lovable character was taken away from me, but how can I feel heartbreak when I haven\'t even felt love? I\'m sad that Misako is so broken down, I\'m sad that her passion to surf died with her boyfriend. I\'m sad that such a bright sun like her is so broken. Yet her boyfriend who is the tragedy, I\'m not so sad about and their now broken relationship.Okay, so time is one downside. In romance you have to take it slow sometimes to really make the drop so much more painful. Another downside to this story is...the side characters.So we have Wasabi and Kyoko, and also Misako\'s two friends. In the beginning we see a bit of all of them. All their different personalities but they seem more like static characters or placeholders then actual beings. Misako\'s friends are just that ""her friends"". I don\'t see the quirky or the hip or the sloth or anything. Just two placeholders friends for two scenes.Kyuoko seems just like another placeholder too, except with a larger role. She is the little sister Hinako and pretty protective too. She has this running gag with ""Love is bad"" but she isn\'t really funny or something cute. She\'s just kind of pops up sometimes. The we go back to Misako sulking, or a timeskip, or her talking to water Hinako.Wasabi, I had high hopes for. Like maybe by the end he would be so much more. Maybe be a senior firefighter or help Misako with the flower shop. Instead we are pushed this weird, ""So like, I know you were my former bff\'s gf but like...I\'ve always liked you soooo, wanna like me?"" At this point I\'m disappointed. The story does skip over this mistep, ""by not bringing him back till the end (and one scene with Kyoto) [yes I spelled it wrong]."" Eventually he becomes a ""good firefighter"" and eventually gets a girl that actually likes him.The sound is pretty mediocre too. The waves don\'t really sound good, but I\'ll leave that out, cause I can see the recording issues. The soundtrack is pretty bland, and my the time you hear the theme song the 11th billion time it kind of gets pretty boring too. I\'m not a sound expert but I could have just watched the movie with just regular sfx and I would have still been fine. 1hr time frame, kind of kills the big tragedy that\'s suppose to set up for the revival at the end.Sound: 5| The theme song is super chipper, really sets the fun in the waves and how nice it is in that summer surfing season.

I went in thinking it was a nice bittersweet story between our main characters; Hinako and Minato. I was not excepting to not only cry not once, not twice, but three times during this movie!Story: 8/10We start off with our female protagonist; Hinako Mukaimizu who moves next to the sea in order to surf again, as she did during her childhood. While still unpacking in her new apartment, a firework mishap sets her apartment building ablaze. while trying to escape the blaze she is saved by our next main character; Minato...Hinageshi. Hinako tries to teach Minato to catch the waves, teaching him how to surf.Minato decides to practice surfing to surprise Hinako, while having a break, he begins texting her. He gets interrupted however once he hears a cry for help. Minato swims out and manages to save the persons life, but with the cost of his own life.As Hinoko struggles with the loss of her loved one, she would hum the song they both sang together. In doing so, Minato begins to appear as a spirit in any body of water.I hear a lot of people disliked the ending of this movie but I quite liked it, just the fact when Hinako was training to be a lifeguard, She still panicked as it reminded her of Minato. She got inspired by Minato to help others who were in danger.Art: 10/10The art style is very unique in this movie, at first i didn\'t like how they did thier necks at the start of the movie but eventually it grew on me. Water animations were excellent. The viewing experience was really enjoyable as the movie progressed. The animation style especially demonstrated the emotional scenes really well.Sound: 10/10Music was great! The main song in the movie was extremely catchy. The fact that Hinako and Minato were singing during the middle of the film while spending time together was such a nice touch, gave more meaning to the song. The voice acting was great also, fitting their character roles very well. Excellent work to Rina Kawaei for Hinako\'s emotional scenes.Character: 8/10I thought that I would end up writing a lot about Youko by the end, but I really liked her character during the end of the movie as she warms up a bit towards Hinako. However I did have an issue when Wasabi \'confessed\' to Hinako as it felt so unnecessary and was pushed under the rug during the movie.Seeing how our main characters bloom during their time together was very wholesome and enjoyable to watch. The fact Minato had conflicts with himself about not being able to help or touch Hinako really made it more realistic, I\'m glad that he just doesn\'t accept that fact that ""Hey, This is fine."" cause lets admit, most people wouldn\'t just accept that fate with their significant other.Enjoyment: 9/10Other then the fact I was bawling my eyes out during this film, I did really enjoy it. It was a really emotional film. Normally with cliche emotional series I rarely cry, but this is one of them that made me did. I would definitely watch this film again!Overall: 10/10I can say this is an underrated movie in my opinion. I recommend this to any anime fan who likes romantic-drama films. I can see why someone would dislike this movie as it can be cliche for this genre but other then that, its quite an enjoyable film. Highly recommended from my part. Hinageshi.

Highly recommended from my part.', 'Romance movies are a dime a dozen. They\'re practically everywhere, so any attempt at making any form of romance media will inevitably seem cliche, because at this point, there\'s literally no original storytelling ground for them anymore. I myself have never been much for romance stuff, mostly because many of them are either annoyingly cliche, formulaic, melodramatic, or indulge in tropes that are so aggravating, you just want to punch a wall. I especially hate it when the main leads come across an obstacle, NEVER talk to each other about it in favor of dragging out the drama longer than it needs to, thereby ignoring...healthier solutions, or when a love triangle gets shoved in and the writers feel the need to make everyone as mean-spirited and antagonistic about it as possible. So when I heard that famous animator/director Masaaki Yuasa, famous for works such as Mind Game, Kaiba, Devilman Crybaby, and his most recent TV series Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken, was making a romance romp called Ride Your Wave, I thought I\'d check it out. It looked nice enough, and he can be good at character development and storytelling when he actually puts effort into it, so when it aired in theaters in my area, I decided to see it, thinking it\'d be a cute and serviceable, but still formulaic, unmemorable movie.Boy, was I wrong. I went into this with absolutely no expectations, and not only did the movie blow my ass away, it officially became the gold standard for which I hold all romance media as a whole! Where has this movie been all my life?!So what\'s the story? A young surfer named Hinako just moved into a new town, happy to be able to surf in the nearby beach. But when her apartment catches fire thanks to irresponsible kids setting off fireworks, a young firefighter, Minato, manages to get her out of the building. The two gradually become closer to the point where they start dating. For a while, things are great for Hinako...until Minato gets into a surfing accident and dies unexpectedly. Hinako and Minato\'s friends and family try to cope with his death, but Hinako is the most hurt by his passing. Then, one day, she starts seeing Minato\'s face in bodies of water whenever she sings a song they heard on the radio. Hinako is shocked by this development, and decides to make the most of this discovery by spending as much time with spirit Minako as possible, never wanting to be apart from him. But the two realize that this kind of lifestyle can\'t go on forever.In terms of premises, this isn\'t exactly new material. Coping with the death of a love interest is the kind of story that\'s been done over and over again since the beginning of movies, and Ride Your Wave is no different. Since you can\'t really break new storytelling ground with that kind of premise anyway, it all really depends on the execution, and honestly, Yuasa and his team at Science Saru really brought their A game for this one, and I\'m still wonderstruck by just how well everything came together and how great the whole thing turned out. The animation, for one, is absolutely sumptuous. Yuasa is well known for his dynamic, fluid animation and his use of bold colors to really make everything pop and feel lively, and it really shows here, especially when it comes to animating the water, and considering the series has a very heavy water theme, it really works. From tiny droplets hanging off leaves to roaring waves crashing into the ocean, with good use of camera angles that show Hinako surfing as if she\'s part of the ocean. It\'s pretty much on par with Ponyo in terms of how great the water animation is, and everything else is great, too.The soundtrack I have mixed feelings about. I mean, the background music itself is good, though nothing too memorable, but the main theme, ""Brand New Story"" by Generations from Exile Tribe (Yes, that\'s the band\'s actual name) is not only a fun song, but is a vital part of the story. It becomes Hinako\'s way of summoning Minato after his death, and it\'s sung professionally and by amateurs all throughout the movie, being both its opening, the insert song, and the ending. The song itself is good, but...I\'m not gonna lie, the movie REALLY milks it, having it be literally the only song in the movie, and having it sung over and over and over, especially by people who can\'t sing for the life of them, really starts to get grating and make it lose its emotional impact. I think it\'d be better if the song was just the insert song, and have different ones be the opening and ending, rather than having the same song for all three. I\'m docking points on this one, because the movie could have benefitted from not milking the song for all it\'s worth, even if the song itself is both good and a really important part of the story overall. But I\'m probably just nitpicking, as the positives far outweigh any negatives I can find.One of those positives being the characters. It\'s hard to develop a cast of characters in a movie in a believable way, even more so when it\'s a romance. In the hands of less talented people, something like Ride Your Wave could have easily been a complete disaster. Some creators force characters to be in a relationship just for the sake of it, even when they have no reason to be together, or try to make a really unhealthy, even abusive relationship seem romantic or even the ideal relationship (Looking at you, Twilight saga). Most of the time, especially in scenarios involving love triangles, characters are either too stubborn to talk about their relationship issues or are needlessly mean to each other all for the sake of forcing drama. Boy am I happy to tell you that Ride Your Wave has absolutely NONE of these things. All of the characters here are intelligent, relatable, three-dimensional, and they all get their fair share of development and have great chemistry with each other. For one, when they have issues and problems, THEY ACTUALLY TALK TO EACH OTHER AND TRY TO SOLVE THINGS!!! You have NO idea how much I wanted this in any romance movie I ever watched! When Hinako asks Minato about why he went out to sea and wound up dying, Minato gives her a solid answer. When Minato\'s friend Wasabi (Who names their kid Wasabi?) develops a crush on Hinako and tells her about it, she outright rejects him in no uncertain terms, but is still nice about it. Youko, Minato\'s younger sister, is blunt and doesn\'t sugarcoat anything she says, but has no hard feelings towards Hinako in regards to her brother\'s death, as she knows full well it wasn\'t her fault and tells her such. Both Minato and Wasabi see that Hinako\'s lifestyle is hurting her because she still wants to be with Minato as a watery spirit, and explain to her in detail how she needs to come to terms with things and heal so she can move on in life. There\'s no dumb love triangle, no stupid romantic hijinks, nor is there really any antagonist. Do you have ANY idea how much I wanted to see a romance movie that avoids all of these terrible cliches? How rare this even is? Because Yuasa completely eschews the typical formulas and tropes involved in romance media, cuts out the bullshit, and plays the whole thing completely straight, showing a perfectly healthy, loving relationship between two people and their friends, he manages to make the audience, me mostly, care about the two leads. Wasabi and Youko both have their own arcs as well, where they have their own different ways of coping with Minato\'s death and finding peace with it and themselves.The film has a typical three-act structure, but the first part focuses on Hinako\'s relationship with Minato, the second her struggles with accepting his death and the lifestyle she lives by summoning him in water bottles or water filled inflatable fish, and the third centers on her healing: How she\'s learning more about Minato and herself as people, and making the effort to try and move on, even if her attempts at doing so don\'t succeed at first. There\'s also the running theme of what it means to save someone, whether it be actually rescuing someone from the edge of death, or how simply saying the right thing at the right time can help someone just as much as the physical act. More than that, it\'s even possible to save someone without even being really aware of having done so. Seriously, I want to just gush about this movie all day long, it\'s that good! As far as where it places on my top favorite movies of all time, I wouldn\'t say it reached the top, as let\'s face it, nothing can beat Dog of Flanders for me. But seriously, the past few years have been great for anime movies. There\'s no denying that. But Ride Your Wave did place pretty high in my overall favorites list. Maquia was great but does have some storytelling issues caused by questionable writing decisions, Mirai had a concept that sounded good on paper but doesn\'t make sense when having a four year old as a main character, Liz and the Blue Bird was held back by its setting and lack of conflict, Okko\'s Inn had an annoying soundtrack and may seem too kiddy for certain viewers, and Your Name had too many convoluted plots and overused many dumb jokes to the point that they overstayed their welcome.So, yeah, Ride Your Wave is awesome. It\'s simple but very effective, making optimal use of its run time to develop its reasonably small cast of characters, the romance was sweet and genuine, if a little twee at times, and while the premise is nothing new to romance movies, all of the positives outweigh the negatives in my personal opinion. If you\'re looking for something genuinely sweet and touching that\'s actually free of so many of the problems that consistently plague the romance genre, Ride Your Wave is a good way to get your feet wet. healthier solutions, or when a love triangle gets shoved in and the writers feel the need to make everyone as mean-spirited and antagonistic about it as possible.

Wasabi and Youko both have their own arcs as well, where they have their own different ways of coping with Minato\'s death and finding peace with it and themselves.The film has a typical three-act structure, but the first part focuses on Hinako\'s relationship with Minato, the second her struggles with accepting his death and the lifestyle she lives by summoning him in water bottles or water filled inflatable fish, and the third centers on her healing: How she\'s learning more about Minato and herself as people, and making the effort to try and move on, even if her attempts at doing so don\'t succeed at first. There\'s also the running theme of what it means to save someone, whether it be actually rescuing someone from the edge of death, or how simply saying the right thing at the right time can help someone just as much as the physical act. More than that, it\'s even possible to save someone without even being really aware of having done so. Seriously, I want to just gush about this movie all day long, it\'s that good! As far as where it places on my top favorite movies of all time, I wouldn\'t say it reached the top, as let\'s face it, nothing can beat Dog of Flanders for me. But seriously, the past few years have been great for anime movies. There\'s no denying that. But Ride Your Wave did place pretty high in my overall favorites list. Maquia was great but does have some storytelling issues caused by questionable writing decisions, Mirai had a concept that sounded good on paper but doesn\'t make sense when having a four year old as a main character, Liz and the Blue Bird was held back by its setting and lack of conflict, Okko\'s Inn had an annoying soundtrack and may seem too kiddy for certain viewers, and Your Name had too many convoluted plots and overused many dumb jokes to the point that they overstayed their welcome.So, yeah, Ride Your Wave is awesome. It\'s simple but very effective, making optimal use of its run time to develop its reasonably small cast of characters, the romance was sweet and genuine, if a little twee at times, and while the premise is nothing new to romance movies, all of the positives outweigh the negatives in my personal opinion. If you\'re looking for something genuinely sweet and touching that\'s actually free of so many of the problems that consistently plague the romance genre, Ride Your Wave is a good way to get your feet wet.', 'Vi Kimi to,Nami ni Noretara con mi novio Yago porque desde hace días me estaba diciendo que la veamos juntos y que era mejor que Kimi no na wa, y no me quedan dudas de que la supera por mucho tanto en animación, trama como así también, en la banda musical. Decir que lloré es poco, se podría decir que es una película muy realista, jamás me había sentido tan identificada con una personaje principal como lo fue Hinako.Por otro lado, mi novio se sintió muy identificado con el amigo de Minato, un personaje que tuvo muy buen desarrollo desde mi punto de vista,...ya que en vez de ayudar en la explosión siendo bombero, decidió contener y abrazar a Hinako en un momento de locura, eso es algo que haría y ha hecho mi novio por mí sobre todo cuando le lloraba a mi ex.Después de ver esta película, dado que él y yo mantenemos una relación a distancia, comencé a ver a mi novio Yago en el agua, por lo cual hablar con él en el inodoro se hizo una rutina habitual y nos ha unido más que antes, esto me ha ayudado a superar las dificultades que se producen en relaciones de este tipo y por eso recomiendo que vean esta película y la pongan en práctica con sus parejas. ya que en vez de ayudar en la explosión siendo bombero, decidió contener y abrazar a Hinako en un momento de locura, eso es algo que haría y ha hecho mi novio por mí sobre todo cuando le lloraba a mi ex.Después de ver esta película, dado que él y yo mantenemos una relación a distancia, comencé a ver a mi novio Yago en el agua, por lo cual hablar con él en el inodoro se hizo una rutina habitual y nos ha unido más que antes, esto me ha ayudado a superar las dificultades que se producen en relaciones de este tipo y por eso recomiendo que vean esta película y la pongan en práctica con sus parejas.', 'I would say this anime movie is enjoyable, it did make me drop some tears, but i dont think its really sad like the way people made it seem. I like the art, the characters are also unique.  Hinako is really strong along the way, but minato is... i think he is just usual, nothing really special. i like the ending where minato saved all his family and friends, and the ending i quite hurtfull, but thats the most favorite scene i liked from this movie. anywat this movie is good for me to sit and enjoy some snacks to watch with. ', 'I was disappointed with this movie. I\'m seriously sick to death of these SOL anime drama films with a magic/sci-fi element that use gooey, flashy animation to make you feel like you\'re watching something well written. i feel like they\'re being mass produced since Your Name came out, which I thought was alright, but nothing worth heralding it as on par with something put out by Ghibli. Masaaki Yuasa is hit or miss for me, but this one felt especially soulless.writing is usually never his strong suit imo. the characters in this film weren\'t fleshed out beyond each of them getting one or two defining...character tropes and that\'s about it. character development is not shown, instead his idea of character development is someone says ""Falling in love is for idiots!"" for most of the movie and then in the last 5 minutes says ""NOT falling in love is for idiots!"". masaaki yuasa needs to stop seeing his characters as devices to move his plot forward to the next flashy animated sequence. the themes are not carefully conveyed so much as they are beaten into your skull and then in case that wasn\'t enough they just explain it to you. and usually he has interesting animation to back up his films at least, but this film wasn\'t even all that visually memorable. sometimes the characters\' movements are animated in awkward ways, the character designs are as forgettable as it gets, and the palette is just brightly colored with nothing all that stand out about it. you\'d think that the animation would look better at the very least considering that this had a film budget.i\'ve seen 9 of Masaaki Yuasa\'s works at this point and this is the worst one i\'ve watched by far. character tropes and that\'s about it. character development is not shown, instead his idea of character development is someone says ""Falling in love is for idiots!"" for most of the movie and then in the last 5 minutes says ""NOT falling in love is for idiots!"". masaaki yuasa needs to stop seeing his characters as devices to move his plot forward to the next flashy animated sequence. the themes are not carefully conveyed so much as they are beaten into your skull and then in case that wasn\'t enough they just explain it to you. and usually he has interesting animation to back up his films at least, but this film wasn\'t even all that visually memorable. sometimes the characters\' movements are animated in awkward ways, the character designs are as forgettable as it gets, and the palette is just brightly colored with nothing all that stand out about it. you\'d think that the animation would look better at the very least considering that this had a film budget.i\'ve seen 9 of Masaaki Yuasa\'s works at this point and this is the worst one i\'ve watched by far.', '*Spoilers, just in case*This is quite possibly one of the cutest and funniest animated films I\'ve seen from Masaaki Yuasa. Unfortunately, it didn\'t ""punch"" as well as others.If you watch the theatrical trailer before seeing the film you will be in for a surprise. Yes, the trailer spoils the crux of the film, but the trailer touches nothing about our main characters and how amazingly developed they are. If the story wasn\'t as comical as it was, I think I would have cried a lot more, but I also think this to be a fault of the animation style.Don\'t get me wrong, this film is...absolutely gorgeous. The art style complemented the bubbliness of the characters extremely well, heavy emphasis on how well the ocean waves are rendered in the art style. The cute style allowed for stunning facial reactions and body movements by all characters that further pushes the comedy of the story but, as aforementioned, takes from the impact of the emotions.Tying in a song that the two main characters perceived as \'their song\' through their unfortunately short relationship is an amazing choice. It pushes the story that much further and gives an additional emphasis on the theme of \'coping\' that surrounds the party after one of the characters\' passing about 30 minutes in. Then to show that the main female character is relying too much on the song and its link to her late boyfriend further drives home this sense of desperation. It wasn\'t until the very last scene where the song comes back again that I felt the story really hit the emotions it intended to an hour earlier.I highly recommend this film for those who are looking for themes of coping after the end of a relationship; to those who think tears should be spared until the end of a film; most importantly, to those who need a good laugh in their own relationships. absolutely gorgeous.

I didn’t find the film consistently great, and it dragged at several points (for me), but it has it’s moments, of which I thoroughly enjoyed. Also, Props to Rina Kawaei for an incredible performance! Her voice acting was really endearing. I had a hard time telling how much time had passed at several points, and some things felt really off (like characters reaction to certain things). I dunno…. It’s not amazing, but it’s certainly not bad...either. either.', 'A little background: Kimi to, Nami ni Noretara (or Ride Your Wave, which I\'ll be referring to it as for the rest of this review) is the 2nd anime movie I\'ve seen in theaters and the 1st one that hasn\'t been a side story for an airing anime. I tried to go into it with only the knowledge that Wikipedia and IMBD gave me, but I attended the movie with a friend of mine who went in totally blind. Based on both of our reactions throughout the film, I\'d suggest going in not knowing the ""twist"" (because if you\'re good at spotting red flags you...can tell what\'s going to happen at about the ~20-minute mark) that happens 30 minutes in or dragging along someone who doesn\'t know so you can watch their reaction.Story: 6The story isn\'t particularly revolutionary, but it\'s good enough to hook you and leave you wanting more. The 1st 30 minutes set up a sweet love story, and then the twist happens and promptly decides to use the beginning of the movie as a baseball bat to beat your heart into submission. The ending can probably be predicted easily, and I kind of wish they went with a less supernatural approach, but I also acknowledge that the climactic ending scene was awesome and couldn\'t have happened without the supernatural elements so I\'m content.Art: 9The animation is absolutely gorgeous, and all of the colors are pleasing. Going into the film, I knew that even if the story was subpar that the art would be beautiful, and it did not disappoint. I\'d honestly say it\'s worth seeing for the art and animation alone.Sound: 8You WILL get the opening song to this movie stuck in your head by the end of it. The OST for Ride Your Wave is good, and there weren\'t any bad pieces of music. The voice acting was also excellent, and I felt that the cover of the opening song that the two main characters did was so adorable.Character: 7I must admit, I never got super attached to any of the characters besides Hinako, but I didn\'t end up hating anyone. The characters are all competently written and the actions they take make sense. Hinako ended up being my favorite simply because I felt that I\'d do the same things she did if I were thrust into a similar situation.Enjoyment: 10Explaining why I enjoyed this movie so much would have to into the personal and slightly sappy territory, but part of it is the theater experience. Movies are a lot better if you have tons of people with you laughing with or at the movie, regardless of the actual quality.

However, if you\'re more of an action movie person and can\'t stand mushy gushy films, then Ride Your Wave probably isn\'t for you.

What happens next, whether it’s the actual relationship or the fact that there is a life after high school is very often overlooked. Fortunately for us, Yuasa saw this opportunity to create a genuinely engaging summer romance.The story starts when some knackers start using fireworks like a group of idiots, which accidentally sets fire to our heroine, Hinako’s, house. The fireman that saves her, Minato, recognises her as that one cool surfer chick, she offers to teach him how to surf and the two...fall in love, through a genuinely adorable musical sequence. I don’t want to spoil what happens, but the way that the song is used here really helps to sell the fact that this couple is genuinely in love, which is difficult to do when the characters themselves aren’t speaking to each other.If the whole film was just this one romance, I would have loved it, and said that it was probably the best anime romance of the decade. Instead, a genuinely shocking plot twist completely changes the movie. I would strongly advise that you go into this movie blind, and just trust me when I say that around half an hour in, the emotional weight of the movie heightens to a new extreme. It can be a little bit clumsy at times with the melodrama but considering the reason for said melodrama, I’d say the film get’s a pass.The only real criticism I have is that the knackers were really generic, and while I get that fleshing them out would have definitely dragged the pacing a bit, come on, there was nothing else he could do? Also, one of the biggest emotional revelations for Hinako wasn’t really foreshadowed as opposed to spoiled by the opening scene of the movie. It’s like they didn’t want it to come out of nowhere but couldn’t think of a better way of divulging the information than the method they chose, which while vague, is specific enough that I got why the event was important even if I didn’t know what exactly the event was.These are more nitpicks than anything else though, and if you’re looking for what I would consider to be up there with Ping Pong in terms of Yuasa’s best work, then I urge you to watch this film.9/10This Review is actually the script to this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuiQyCshoogCheck that out and subscribe to the channel if you want to see more reviews like it. fall in love, through a genuinely adorable musical sequence.

However, that doesn\'t mean I like his stuff no matter what it is; it means I have high expectations of his work. I skipped a class to drive an hour to see this film.

The main theme is sung so many times throughout the film, but I just couldn\'t get tired of it; great stuff.The characters were good; they seemed legit, which is...nice in anime.The story wasn\'t amazing, but it didn\'t have to be. The message is far more important. If you like Mamoru Hosoda films, it is exactly something he would write.Things I didn\'t like; the animation was NOT up to par with other Yuasa works, at all. Sometimes there\'d be something very beautiful, but everything else seemed underwhelming when considering the other projects to come from this studio and director. It was fine, but definitely the weakest he\'s worked with.Overall, I thought it was good. It\'s not as fun as ""Lu"", or huge as ""Devilman"", but it\'s a good watch.

The film quickly introduces and resolves conflicts at a rapid pace, never lingering long enough to explore how or why any of these conflicts might be meaningful. Which in itself may not be such a large problem, but it is because the conflicts themselves irrationally justified within the narrative, that the film fails to convey it's themes in a graceful manner.That being said, while science Saru are not fantastic animators, they are fantastic digital artists. This film is absolutely captivates the eye....There is an abundance of visual creativity in the film, and while the second  to last scene of the film has terrible narrative justification, it certainly has a visually justification. The character designs, color scheme, and general visual 'design' are something anyone will be able to appreciate.This movie might be worth watching just for the visuals; or perhaps it's something you can watch with your significant other (as that is certainly this movies target demographic).

We know they can’t see him, but if they can still see the water’s movement, that opens up another can of worms:- If they can see the water moving, why couldn’t Minato show the others his water manipulation powers?

There are few characters, but there are many elements. However, it is well organized as a story. However, I also understood that this is divided into evaluations. At the beginning, the sweetness continues.""- Overcome lost emotionsAs you can see in the trailer, the characters will feel lost. After a long, long sweet time. I also experienced a sense of loss and it continues to this day. It will not disappear even if it weakens. I think the important person will stay close to me in the future,...and I hope that.While I was feeling lost, I felt like a loved one was lying next to me. Therefore, I can understand the feelings of the characters very much. In the case of a story that overcomes such a feeling of loss, hardness is often drawn. However, the pleasure that ignores anguish in a sense (which can be said to be crazy) is drawn, and I can understand it very much. I understand that she wants to seek temporary pleasure, even if the loss is true. The madness of not accepting that reality will divide the movie\'s evaluation. After that, the long and sweet time also divides the evaluation of the movie. It was a very shining time for them. But I think it was the time needed for this movie.- Insert song problem in Japanese animated filmsIn my review, I have repeatedly addressed this issue in Japanese animated films. Why do Japanese animated films make heavy use of insert songs? However, there was a reason for this movie. Also, the insert song like a sweet and fun karaoke like a live-action movie is new. I felt uncomfortable, but as a highlight of the sweet scene, I think it was a match.However, the insert song was sung by a member of the popular Japanese singer group LDH and appeared in the anime. There is also a review that it is an animation for LDH.I am happy that the melody has been changed to a nostalgic melody that matches this movie. (When I saw the actual live-action PV, the impression was completely different.)Anime and popular singer group. In a nutshell, it\'s a synergistic effect. To put it badly, do anime have to rely on tie-ups for box office revenue?- Re-screening (re-screening upon request)In Japan, there is a site called ""drepass"" that gathers calls for re-screening. This time, I happened to see the announcement of the re-screening on that site, and I was able to see it (Apr, 2022). They don\'t seem to be able to respond to all the voices, but I\'m grateful to have come across a great movie.- Final impressionFirst of all, I forgot to mention it, but it is a unique illustration.

For me, who is experiencing feelings of loss, I think it was a movie that I would want to watch again in order to see myself objectively in the future.Oh, and she moves home several times, but I want to live in such a large house.

Saw lots of pictures captured from the movie here and there and immediately added it to my watchlist. And it really did meet my expectations. Came out just like how I wanted it to.

Once again reminded me of childhood, don't exactly know why though!As I said, the art-style was immaculate for me, wish there was more animes with this kind of art! Also the sounds, the music, perfectly fit the movie! The story was so nice and enjoyable, once you get into it with criticism-free, you really do get to enjoy things by then, in general. After all, animations, especially like this are supposed to be enjoyed. The main girl at first got me annoyed with the clumsiness, but that only happened about two times, it wasn't repetitive and by the end I realized that's just how she is and anyone would get nervous, if we were in her shoes. so i realised you cant really blame someone for doing something as human as showing your emotions and letting it out once in a while.It was really enjoyable for me, nothing less expected from Masaaki Yuasa!

The romance was cute and I enjoyed watching the relationship.As for the story, something major happened midway that required the main character to move on. There’s a big element of fantasy, but not one that I haven’t seen before. The plot...was pretty typical of a drama dealing with death and moving on, so there wasn’t too many surprises. Also, the emotion wasn’t as high as I wanted, probably because of the typical storyline and the light tone.The characters were pretty okay and not unexpected.

"", ""I will try to review this with no more spoilers than what is in the trailer.Ride Your Wave is a very good movie about grieving. The first act is a cute, mushy, super wholesome Girl Meets Boy section. The actors (Japanese) have amazing chemistry and it was really fun to see. The movie takes a sad turn, and then a rather whimsical one shortly in. Don't be turned off if the trailer looked too silly; the whimsey is easily just the main character trying to cope. This movie hit the heart strings hard, but was still light enough to be fun to watch. I haven't...heard anyone mention this film, so it might be an underrated hidden gem.

It brings you up just to tear you back down, not with another tragic event, but with...something that otherwise would've been lovely. Watching Hinako go through the film and learn how to cope and let go and take care of herself helps you understand the emotional person that she is. That paired with the ending is a big bitter sweet jab to the heart.

The characters are ""problematic"" (no, not that kind of problematic) in varying ways: Hinako is such a klutz, it makes me cringe seeing her drop things non-stop, and that singing, ohhhh God; Minato is the perfect boyfriend who is practically good at everything (except surfing which he had Hinako teach him) but is otherwise such a bland colourless character; Youko just irritates me; Wasabi I guess is kinda okay because he is more...interesting than Minato, though he and his love interest has no chemistry as far as I can see.

I don\'t hate it but I certainly am not raving for you to watch it either.', 'Ride Your Wave is a 2019 Japanese animated film directed by Masaaki Yuasa (The Night is Short, Walk on Girl, Tatami Galaxy and Devilman Crybaby). It follows a story of a female surfer named Hinako who is still unsure on what to take up in college and has a hobby of surfing. In a fire incident, she is rescued by a firefighter named Minato. The two eventually developed romantic feelings for each other and discover the different sides of their personality. With an unexpected turn of events that occur, Hinako’s life changes.I loved Masaaki Yuasa’s previous works mentioned because of how artistic and original his...animation is and by doing so, I gave his film a watch. During the first half of the film, I felt a little bit worried because the story seems a bit predictable at first and would kind of be a romantic comedy film. However, in the second half of the film, because of that one event, it made me hook to the film even more. Throughout its running time, I felt somewhat good as to how the story unfolds with Hinako and how she deals with the situation she is facing as of the moment. The story itself still managed to keep itself solid from the beginning to the end.The characters in the film were also good. I loved how the film fleshed out its two main leads, Hinako and Minato, a bit more so that I could get to know more about them. They are both definitely carrying this film fully throughout its runtime which makes me interested in them more. The message of the film is what made think of the movie a lot because of how it leans into the theme of “finding your wave”. It symbolizes how a person must learn how to discover his or her own path in life despite the tragedy that one must accept in order to overcome all of it. The way how they depict the mutual love between life and death is something that will remind me how people will always be watched by their loved ones in search for meaning of life.Its song “Brand New Story” is definitely the song that may catch the attention of the audience more. It is very catchy and gives a boost to the film. Both versions of the song in the film: Hinako and Minato, and the original band were great to listen to. The animation is great and the studio Science Saru managed to do a job well done with its beautiful effects of the background such as the ocean, fire and sky. Yuasa’s direction, although it wasn’t as amazing as its previous works as mentioned in the first paragraph, was still great all in all.Ride Your Wave may not be much of a memorable film but it still deserves attention to the anime community. The film will make you think a lot about your relationships with your friends and family that defines how happy or successful your life will be. Masaaki Yuasa’s film has done a great job in telling a story that the audience may not expect at first look.  The animation and art style are as what you can expect from Yuasa’s great previous works.

Im probably too emotional  for watching soo much depressing anime tho . I sympathize with...the girl  but not with the sister ( she was way too bitchy) the movie just kept stabbing me with the reminder that losing  people sucks and life goes on. the girl  but not with the sister ( she was way too bitchy) the movie just kept stabbing me with the reminder that losing  people sucks and life goes on.', 'At its core, this is a story about processing grief and learning to move forward through life at your own pace. It\'s a humble tale that serves some melancholic summer vibes and doesn\'t try to preach to the viewers. But for all that this movie does well, some parts probably didn\'t need to drag on as long as they did. It\'s such a little detail in the editing, but it can really make so much difference in the pacing.For example:~ When Wasabi was struggling on the rope, he didn\'t have to fall and fail to get back up while his coworkers cheered him on more...than twice for the point to come across, especially since it felt like the same clip on loop.~ The ""Brand New Story"" karaoke montage was very cute, but it could have been cut down a little for brevity.~ We really did not need to watch Hinako twiddling her toes for so long to understand that she was stressed and struggling to process her feelings of guilt.Perhaps it\'s just me, but the just-a-bit-too-long repetition and stalling made my brain anxious.The characters are at least easy to watch.Minato comes across as perhaps too supportive and perfect until we are actually given the chance to learn more about him.Wasabi is the rookie firefighter who struggles to feel like he\'ll ever be good enough at his job to make a difference in his community.Youko is the standoffish younger sister who is left to unpack not only the weight of her own grief but also Hinako\'s because it\'s what her brother would have wanted.Hinako maybe isn\'t the most likeable protagonist for a lot of the story, but it is easy to understand and relate to her. She starts out like a lot of us do - feeling lost and overwhelmed in the world, unsure of how to move forward or where she\'s even going - until one day her entire world turns upside down and, through the grieving process, she learns that she is more capable of independence than she had given herself credit for... even though that\'s still a hard truth to accept.The use of the ghost as a symbol for grief is an interesting one. The more desperately she clings to the memory of Minato and the way things used to be while he was by her side, the more her behavior begins to concern the people around her. Let me tell you, it is such a treat to watch the background characters react to Hinako publicly display some truly unhinged behavior. At one point, she summons her tiny ghost boyfriend in a toilet so aggressively warp pipe green he\'s one ill-timed flush away from being isekai\'d into a Mario game, utterly terrifying the coworker unfortunate enough to witness her public breakdown through the open crack she left in the doorway. Overall, I appreciate that the movie lets her sit with her grief all the way through to the end rather than forcing her out of the process and into a new relationship before she\'s ready.And if you take nothing else away from this movie, I just want it to be known that there is something so funny about Hinako riding Youko like a surfboard in an extremely perilous situation while lighthearted, upbeat music plays in the background. than twice for the point to come across, especially since it felt like the same clip on loop.~ The ""Brand New Story"" karaoke montage was very cute, but it could have been cut down a little for brevity.~ We really did not need to watch Hinako twiddling her toes for so long to understand that she was stressed and struggling to process her feelings of guilt.Perhaps it\'s just me, but the just-a-bit-too-long repetition and stalling made my brain anxious.The characters are at least easy to watch.Minato comes across as perhaps too supportive and perfect until we are actually given the chance to learn more about him.Wasabi is the rookie firefighter who struggles to feel like he\'ll ever be good enough at his job to make a difference in his community.Youko is the standoffish younger sister who is left to unpack not only the weight of her own grief but also Hinako\'s because it\'s what her brother would have wanted.Hinako maybe isn\'t the most likeable protagonist for a lot of the story, but it is easy to understand and relate to her.

Feeling you can’t start over without that person. Then, this dramatic romance anime is a must watch for you. This is not about the positive aspect of a love story but the painful side of moving on and trying to ride on your own wave.The plot started on how our two MC’s met each other by accident. It was a fast track love story you might end up dropping this movie so early if you’re looking for a long paced romantic shit but this movie is not about being falling in love. It’s about moving on. The film did...a great job showing us how Hinako dealt with the lost of his boyfriend, Minato. I actually called her freaking “crazy” because of what happened to her. Yeah, talking to water or taking out her water balloon dolphin outside is not crazy enough for you then you might need a professional help but later on she needs to deal with it and continue with her life and that’s also what her late boyfriend wants for her.  What I like the most about the film is not the characters but the situation that our MC need to handle, the topic of moving on. It’s really relatable to all of us. That what kept me watching this film till the end and how the ending executed the main theme of the film was really amazing! Surfing from a tall building and saving someone else’s life.The Sound and animation was ok too. Although, it’s annoying hearing the main song again and again throughout the movie but it’s an important aspect of the show.Overall I really enjoyed watching the movie really got me hooked with its topic.

Principalmente consiste en presentar uno de los opuestos: Minato/Hinako, y mostrar como influye el uno el otro. Hinako representa el descontrol, la euforia, caos etc que engancha el desorden de su casa, su convivencia con el fuego, perderse por la ciudad o derramar bebidas. Minato es lo contrario, representa el orden y serenidad podemos apreciarlo en como hace sus ejercicios de bombero, hace...café o como haces comentarios más reflexivos.Cuando Hinako y Minato interactúan ambos salen reforzados.

A falta de un mejor ejemplo diré que el la película empieza con ella intentando comer, hablar, por teléfono y sostener una cajas, en cuanto más interacciona con Minato menos la vemos en está tesitura.La película presenta varias ideas interesantes pero se estropea en cuanto deciden explicar por diálogo contenido que ya entendiamos por el subtexto. Por poner un ejemplo de varios: en el primer incendio Wasabi va a rescatar a Hinako pero ve llegar desde una grua a su compañero Minato, con está escena ya queda claro que Wasabi se siente inferior a Minato, muy bien personaje bien definido.

Let\'s get right into the review (first impressions from a single watch).*** SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS ***Story; Hinako Mukaimizu moves back to her home town for two thing; surfing and the ocean. Little did she know a firefighter in training would hit on her and end up falling in love. They quickly become an item, enjoy each-others company and experience love like nothing before. Then one night, her official boyfriend Minato Hinagenshi, decides to ride the waves...early in the morning by himself. He safety gets back onto shore, but notices a pedestrian has gone missing in the water. He goes back in without hesitation, saving the life of the person in the water, and never coming back for a breath himself. With Hinako being alone we get to see how she deals with the lost of her first love, if she\'s ever able to go back into the water again and if she\'s able to find new love just as quickly as she\'s lost it... The plot isn\'t what I was expecting at all to be honest. When I saw the trailers, I was expecting some magical water boy to fall in love with the main girl. Not true love, death and then depression(and how to deal with it). Although it wasn\'t the story I was expecting, it wasn\'t all bad. I felt a lot of information was missing (or maybe I wasn\'t paying close enough attention) like the flower shop, his friend being waaaaay to interested in Hinako and then moving on like it\'s nothing and the sister being extremely rude then becoming her best friend like it was nothing? Time to move on. Art; The animation was beautiful. The water, flashbacks and emotional-changing scenes. Sound; The OST was cute. By the end of it I was tired of the song that they sang together. Especially because she would only sing the one part over and over again to call him. Characters; I like the attempt to jump right into the characters getting to know each-other, but they weren\'t interesting enough for me to get emotional. It was cutesy, I was blushing and getting excited. But it all moved so fast. My heart/emotions couldn\'t keep up with what I was happening in the movie.Overall, not the movie I was expecting but it was interesting. Now that I know what the plot is, I can come back to it in the future when I\'m in the right mood for it. If I had to describe this movie it would be ""love, lose and growth""... I suggest you watch this movie when you\'re in the right mindset, and not expecting a straight-forward romance between the unidentified and a human. early in the morning by himself.

For one they did a good job on portraying the music with the feelings of the characters. I feel like they did a great job in the beginning with the romance but honestly[SPOILER ALERT] I could see it coming a mile a way that Minato was going to die. I didn't know how he would die but I just knew that he would. They made they made the romance feel so rushed and it was just blah. They did do a good job towards the end though with how Minatos card was announced and...how he had written it a year ago. I just feel like this movie had so much potential but it was wasted because of how much they rushed the movie. how he had written it a year ago. I just feel like this movie had so much potential but it was wasted because of how much they rushed the movie."", ""Anime doesn't always have to be action packed in order to have an impact, but sometimes a story as simple as a love story can be conveyed incredibly well even in the world of animation. Especially when we have a love story that is abruptly ended by tragedy. However tragedy is used as a catalyst for personal growth and development despite a character's unwillingness to let go to what makes us the most comfortable. This is the basic premise of Ride Your Wave.The plot of Ride Your Wave centers around the story of Hinako Mukaimizu who lives a fairly care free life and absolutely...loves the ocean and surfing. Very early in the anime Hinako's apartment complex is engulfed in fire due to some degenerates setting off illegal fireworks and it is through this horrible ordeal that she gets to meet a young firefighter Minato Hinageshi. His willingness to save others and his caring personality makes Hinako immediately fall for him and they start a romantic relationship together. Minato is completely enamored by Hinako and is willing to learn how to surf since she is into it so much even though he is not very good at it at the very start. The relationship in this film feels completely very organic and I think it's because of the slow natural progression of this relationship is why it's so easy to relate to these characters and your cheering for them to succeed and grow throughout all the time that they get to spend together. They share meals, discover their favorite song and do a wide array of activities in order to strengthen the bond they have with each other.Unfortunately their happiness is short lived when Minato gets into an accident in the ocean trying to rescue someone and is unfortunately killed much to the shock of Hinako and our very organic yet stereotypical love story turns into a story of self discovery, dealing with loss, and finding purpose afterwards. It is during this part where a very normal story love and loss delves into the world of fantasy and it's unfortunately at this point where the movie loses a little bit of its power. Once Minato's death happens she loses all desire to continue her love of surfing and as she is trying her hardest to deal with the loss of her boyfriend she starts to see him in the water every time she starts to sing their favorite song. He reassures her that he'll always be there for her to help her through the tough times until she is strong enough to stand on her own two feet but unfortunately she is the only person that can see him, and it gets to the point where she counts on him as a drug to help her find happiness again even though it's not really helping her move on. Minato is constantly reminded of his mortality and the fact that even though he can see and speak to Hinako he can't physically touch her and the longer he is in her life the more he realizes that she will not be able to successfully move on. She even stopped him from ascending into heaven.I understand why the film went in this direction. In the world of animation you have the luxury of implementing fantasy aspects in order to provide some incredibly strong imagery in the film, but I often feel like the film could of been much better if it was grounded in pure realism. I think the film could of had a stronger impact if we watched a character go through the multiple stages of grief without having to cater to the fantasy trope of Hinako hanging out with the ghost of her dead boyfriend. It's not to say that watching a person trying to maintain a relationship with a ghost is bad, there are some incredibly beautiful animated scenes and heartfelt moments but in the back of your mind your thinking to yourself that this cannot work and you start to lose interest on how this anime is going to conclude. It does delve back into the realm of realism when Hinako manages to figure out through the help of Minato's sister that Hinako and and Misato had interacted before when she actually rescued him from drowning when they were kids. Therefore through this knowledge she manages to unlock his phone and sees a message that finally gives her motivation to find purpose in her life again. She decides to live by Misato's example and gets involved in becoming a lifeguard in order to save and help people much like her boyfriend did when he was a firefighter.Despite the far fetched nature of the film and a very absurd yet visually appealing concluding set piece, it does cover some very important concepts on how to deal with grief. The characters are built with a level of care that you don't see in a lot of love stories in the realm of anime. The supporting cast is actually incredibly small which is a pleasant sight to see because it gives enough time for proper character development not only for the main leads but for the supporting characters as well. Misato's sister and Misato's best friend have their purpose in the film in helping the movie flow and their presence never feels shoehorned in. The music is fitting for the mood that it wants to exemplify. There are scenes of happiness and scenes of sadness and the music is incredibly fitting for each scene. The animation of the film is a little offputting first, but you get use to it fairly quickly and there is a lot of care put into how the water is animated since it is a central theme throughout the entire story.This film will ultimately tug at the heartstrings especially during the final concluding scene that reinforces the fact that even when we're ready to move on with our lives the feeling of loss will always be there and even through grief it's always important to understand the importance someone had in your life despite the fact that they're gone now. Hinako manages to regain purpose in her life by the end, but she'll never forget the impact Misato had in her life. Even though he is gone from her life in both flesh and spirit now that she has found purpose and meaning in her life again there is a fitting tribute to their love that he manages to leave one last gift for her despite the fact that he has been dead for a year.A powerful film that loses a little bit of its potency by catering to a fantasy aspect that feels incredibly cheap and shallow but still a great heartfelt watch that ultimately shows the power of love and loss and how integral it is to a person's development in life and the many curve balls it can throw at us.8/10 loves the ocean and surfing.

This is not a romance movie, but rather how someone processes grief so don't watch it expecting a loving romance.From the creator of Devilman Crybaby, this film is a completely different vibe from Devilman Crybaby. The film is full of color and the tone reflects the colors used during each scene. I loved the fluidity of the animation with how the characters interact or how they move along the water. Every bit of the film felt like it was perfectly chosen for the right...moment, from the colors they used to the music that we hear. The film aesthetics are impeccable and the story tugs at your heartstrings with every passing scene. The characters are fleshed out and we can see how much of an impact each one has on each other very quickly. Each character shows how different the process of grief is for everyone and takes that into account with how the story flows.I would say for those who like Your Name, Spirited Away, this would be a good watch if you're looking for a movie to watch.*** Spoilers from this point onward ***Like I stated earlier, this is not a romance movie, but rather a film about the grieving process. We watch how Hinako processes the death of Minato, her boyfriend with fantastical elements added for the ride. Adding in those fantasy elements is a gray area for me. There were some moments where I liked those elements, but there were moments in the story where it felt a little odd. Even with that, the film made it work without me questioning it too much. Another little thing I have with the film is the odd pacing of their relationship in the beginning, but it wasn't bad, just could've been done better.Other than those little things, I felt the movie is a good watch for someone looking for a break from romance films. Watching Hinako try to live her own life past Minato's death was fairly realistic in my opinion. Hinako manages to crave her own path, but the scars from losing someone are still there so she will hurt from time to time, but overall she has moved on. Also, I really like the decision of not making Hinako end up with Wasabi was a really nice move, as moving on from a dead partner to date their junior just sounds bad.

The clear selling point would be the art style that is so vibrant and full of the energy that every part of the animators put into it. The story and the character development throughout the film were quite lacking, however, as we see a lot of scenes that were unnecessary for the plot to continue. What really caught me was the emotions that were so clear-cut that the VAs were able to express through singing or screaming out into the open air. Overall the film was a piece of eye candy that will...leave you wanting if you came for an actual story, but as an experience will make you feel alive with magic and whimsy. leave you wanting if you came for an actual story, but as an experience will make you feel alive with magic and whimsy.', '*WARNING: I DO ALLUDE TO A FEW SPOILERS!!!*I wanted to love it (especially after watching the pretty appealing trailer that came out early last year along with the preliminary hype), I really do, but I have to go with the generous 5.5. I say generous because despite the multitude of disappointment, I still had the patience to get some enjoyment out of it. I held off on watching this too because I thought it was going to rip my heart out, given the premise provided to us from the get-go. However, I was sorely disappointed by the lack of anything really.The plot, simple enough,...has nothing to offer and just leaves you hanging in the end, which claims to be relatable after having to deal with the loss of a loved one. Sure, I get that. The execution, however, was just not it. Likewise, connecting with the main female protagonist proved to be difficult, when there were just bits and pieces of a character. A lot of mystery surrounds her as an individual. As I see it, her characterization is simply defined by her fleeting romance with a boy, who pretty much thrives off of a savior complex. While the savior complex is not entirely problematic in the general sense, it does come off as problematic in how Hinako ""copes"" throughout the whole entire film. Even in the end, closure would have coincided well right after the resolution of the whole building arc, but unfortunately, an unsatisfying finish was what we got instead.As for our main male protagonist, he gives off the whole ""Superman"" presence, which is giving too much credit for an ideal and has no inkling of the relatable character we always tend to look out for. Naturally, we are made to like him because he\'s the definition of PERFECT. The reality is, there is no one like that. We, instead, as imperfect individuals, strive to be as such. That\'s why we care more for a character with relatable flaws and unbelievably great character development, instead of the cookie-cutter hero dished out to us from the very beginning. The film literally gives him ONE weakness trying to pass off as a character flaw, which I find seriously ridiculous. The harsh reality is that his hero persona is all he has going for him. Other than that, he\'s pretty much a shell of a person. Even the memorial, shown briefly, only serves to strengthen that hero persona, which is kind of messed up when you think about it. In short, there\'s no depth to him as an individual and unfortunately only serves as a crutch to his leading lady.Aside from all that and much more (which will just turn more into a rant than a review), the visuals were pretty stunning and did well to show contrast in lighting and color to immerse the viewer in the tone or mood they were trying to achieve for a particular moment or scene. The music did its job as well, but nothing too notable aside from the song they play repeatedly for the purposes it does serve.Overall, I gave this a generous 5.5 (rounding up to a 6) due to the art and some enjoyment I got from the film itself. has nothing to offer and just leaves you hanging in the end, which claims to be relatable after having to deal with the loss of a loved one.

However, I must say that Ride Your Wave does not give as much of a visual impact as his other films. That being said, if I were simply to rate this film without factoring in the people behind the work, the animation, although not as beautiful as Shinkai-sensei's work, still manages to capture my interest on an artistic level. However,...the animation, in my opinion, was not as thought provoking as usual.When it comes to the plot of the movie, I would say that the romantic tale from this film does not add much more to the table than previous romance drama film. The only selling point of this movie was the fact that the male lead, while deceased, somehow manage to live on as a spirit within water. However, instead of taking a much more philosophical route like Yuasa-sensei did with his other work, Devilman Crybaby, Ride Your Wave simply glosses over the mystery for the romance. Which is not a mistake, per se, however it does make the movie more average, since the selling point was the supernatural aspect of the film.The only thing I can praise is that the movie manages to capture the emotions of the female lead quite well, showing her sadness in a way that made it quite realistic and human, evoking sympathy from the audience. However, once we get invested to the main characters, we somehow enter the climax where the female lead literally rode the wave on top of a tower, defying gravity, in order to safe a friend. Although the action sequence should be praised, I can't help but think tthat it doesn't mesh well with the rest of the plot, like they don't know whether to focus upon the romance aspect of the film pr the action.Finally, the release of this film was closely preceded by another film made by a much less famous director called Children of the Sea. Although both films have a much different plotline, the similarities on the background of both films --the sea, made me subconsciously compare the two films. Although I gave the rating of this review objectively without letting this comparison influence me, I couldn't help but think of how Children of the Sea had better animation, plot and a well grounded theme compared to Ride Your Wave.Therefore, I would recommend for people to watch this film without thinking of it as a Yuasa film nor should people watch this film with other similar themed films. Otherwise, there might be some disappointment coming for you. the animation, in my opinion, was not as thought provoking as usual.When it comes to the plot of the movie, I would say that the romantic tale from this film does not add much more to the table than previous romance drama film.

Compared to Masaaki\'s previous works, this one\'s easy to follow and it has more appeal to general audience. It is easy to recommend this movie to anyone which is contrary to his other shows like ""Night is Short, Walk on Girl"" and ""The Tatami Galaxy"". The length of the film is perfect and there\'s a decent amount of characters introduced. In that case, you won\'t get any trouble with overwhelming information. The soundtrack is good and it plays a major...role in the story. Animation is stunning, and the gradual change of colors to depict the vibe of the scene is so smooth. In short, it\'s a PERFECT high quality production.The story is easy to acknowledge without any complications, and I didn\'t expect that coming from Masaaki Yuasa. The direction is simply beautiful, like who would\'ve thought someone could come up with a scene where the MC is riding the wave from the top of the building all the way down to the bottom. The sequences were extraordinary depictions of how crazy the life is, and that\'s actually a trademark of Yuasa\'s works. The theme is also simple yet relatable to everyone. Things like losing something valuable and moving forward were showcased in this film. Basically, anyone could relate to Hinako as a main character since it could be experience by ourselves as well. I like how they successfully presented the theme and made a comparison through waves. The fire which was seen in different scenes is also significant as a symbol of conflict. The message of the movie is already on its very surface, that\'s why there\'s really nothing to dive deeper into. Like I said, this film is for everyone and you\'ll definitely get to enjoy its simplicity. Ja Matane! role in the story.

Ja Matane!', ""So this film was directed by Masaaki Yuasa, who also directed 'Night Is Short, Walk On Girl', and this film definitely has his stamp on it. It's animated nicely but not in a traditional way; there's a lot of overly fluid motions which is appropriate because this story has water as its main theme.At first glance, this film has everything. The two main characters fall in love, and one of them (the man) sadly passes away due to drowning. However, when the other main character (the woman) sings when she's near a body of water, her partner appears in the water! I was prepped for...a mystery, some intrigue and an emotional rollercoaster.And I got an emotional rollercoaster but not in the way I thought. Initially, I expected the drowning event to be really sad and emotional, but...for me it wasn't. It was over so quick! And then, minutes after that scene we see her singing and the guy appears in her glass of water, which she then spills and the image of the guy floats away with the water. It made me laugh, but in a way where I thought 'is this meant to be funny? He just drowned!'It just got weirder after that. Imagine the Black Mirror episode 'Be Right Back'. That's the episode where a woman's husband dies but she can use an app to talk to him, and eventually there's a clone of him, and it's all a bit creepy. Now imagine that but she could only communicate with him via singing near water. That's this film.I won't even go into the 'rules' of how the body of water works, or even if there needs to be a body of water at all (spoiler: apparently there doesn't!), but it left me with a weird feeling, like something was missing. And that's in a film where a lady walks around with a giant blow-up water-filled beluga whale, with the 'ghost' of her husband inside it. a mystery, some intrigue and an emotional rollercoaster.And I got an emotional rollercoaster but not in the way I thought.

It is directed by Masaaki Yuasa, who is one of the most celebrated anime directors ever, with classics such as Tatami Galaxy and Ping Pong, as well as underground gems like Kemonozume, Kaiba, and Night is Short, Walk on Girl. He brings this dreamlike quality to anime while also boasting some solidly explored themes. However, I found Ride Your Wave to be disappointing.Before I continue further, I would recommend watching Ride Your Wave as I’ll be diving (hehe get it?) into spoiler territory. If you go in completely blind like I did, there’s...an unexpected turn at the end of the first act that is pretty important to my criticisms.Ride Your Wave is about a girl named Hinako who moves to a new town for college. She gets rescued by a firefighter named Minato, and love brews between them. Unfortunately, Minato drowns in the ocean when surfing alone, which fills Hinako with grief. However, Hinako discovers that she can make him appear in water by singing “their song,” which turns their romance into an unconventional one. It turns from a generic romance into a film about loss and perseverance.The technical side of the film is pretty bizarre. It has good shot composition and some aesthetically pleasing shots. There’s a montage early in the film with the characters being a couple, and alongside it is them singing “their song.” When they sing, they often are off-key and laugh at each other. It makes their relationship feel more intimate, and would work wonders if both of them weren’t cardboard cutouts. The ost is repetitive, not only because she has to sing the same song every time to summon him, but because the same track plays when he is summoned. The editing is also off-putting, because whenever the film shows something that happened in the past, there’s this weird red and purple layering to the frame for this nostalgic effect. Maybe he didn’t want to use a sepia color correction because that’s pretty standard, but other anime have used incredibly creative methods to communicate this (Only Yesterday).The characters in Ride Your Wave are bad, as Hinako is just a surfer girl who sucks at everything except surfing. Minato is a “Mary Stu,” who is good at everything except surfing, making him very dull. Minato’s sister, Yoko, is awful. She speaks her mind and isn’t afraid of confrontation, but showed no sadness about her brother passing away until 15 minutes left in the film. She tells Hinako to “get over it” like that isn’t her own flesh and blood. Wasabi was Minato’s firefighter friend who was just as insufferable. He waits until his best friend dies in order to corner his girlfriend at her work and confess his love for her. Hinako mentions two friends of hers, but they have to have two minutes of screen time. The film could have benefited from a longer run time to flesh out these characters, but it already feels longer than it is.The themes in Ride Your Wave are pretty messy. There’s this weird prevalence of saving somebody’s life and how that leads to love. Hinako saved Minato’s life when they were little and he fell in love with her. Minato saved Hinako’s life from the fire and fell in love with him. Wasabi saves Yoko’s life by standing up to her parents and falls in love with him. Saving someone’s life is a very kind thing to do, but that doesn’t mean that love will blossom. Falling in love with someone means you are compatible, and sharing your lives with one another to support each other. I truly believe they made this theme so the characters have an excuse to like each other because they have no personalities. The themes it does explore well are very easy to read into. Water is ever present in the film, and symbolizes the unexpectancy of life, and how the currents and waves can take you places. The theme of perseverance was well developed, with Minato secretly working his ass off to be able to help people and be the best he can be. He also mentions a time where he watched turtle hatchlings scurrying to the sea with conviction after being born.The first act of the movie is pretty boring. You’re just watching these two nothing characters fall in love in a generic romance anime fashion. The second act isn’t much better, because this is supposed to focus on the grieving element, but Minato is in the film again within 10 minutes. They show their struggles of their new unconventional relationship in a “comedic” way, but Minato being “alive” again brings up a huge problem. One of the worst aspects of “13 Reasons Why” is that Hannah committed suicide but she’s still present throughout the whole series. This falsely portraits death into being this idea that “you don’t really die, you live on,” but death is death. After you die there is no living to see how your friends and family cope. If many consider that a problem for that show, why don’t people consider it a problem in this film? The third act is also pretty bad, with Hinako trying her best to move on. Yoko and her make a stupid decision to follow a group that is going to launch fireworks from a building, which would definitely cause a fire. Instead of calling the police, they decide to get proof of them doing it instead, which leads them to be in a burning building. The last few minutes were very infuriating. Hinako sings “the song” to try to see Hinako again, but he doesn’t show up. She gets a very upset look on her face when this happens. Then, a cheesy Christmas message from Minato announces from the skyscraper she's next to to say he loves her and will always be with her, which makes her break down crying. So did she move on? Did she get past the grieving stage? The signs point to no, which renders this film pointless.Overall, the Ride Your Wave was a disappointing experience. The characters suck, the ost got old very quickly, and the themes were underwhelming. It's goals were misguided, trying to balance being a heartfelt romance and a film about grieving. Originally, I was going to give this film a 5/10 but writing down my thoughts further ran my disappointing feelings into the ground. I didn’t like a single act of this film. This felt like a Makoto Shinkai film. It wasn’t as sappy, but just as messy. an unexpected turn at the end of the first act that is pretty important to my criticisms.Ride Your Wave is about a girl named Hinako who moves to a new town for college.

If I were to be brutally honest, I initially did not want nor wish to watch this movie as after taking a look at the trailer, I figured that this was not worth of the hype is was getting, that it looked rather plain and boring.Seeing what the trailer had presented to me, I just assumed that this movie would just be of some generic love story where a couple goes to the beach, dude dies from being hit by a wave or something...and the girlfriend, being too depressed after his death, gets hallucinations of him and that's about it. I figured that this movie's story would be far too simple and basic, especially coming from a person as creative and highly acclaimed as Masaaki Yuasa.BUTTTTTTTTTTTTTthank goodness, I was proven to be wrong. It was not long before I decided to give 'ride your wave' a go. I was just bored and thought that it will be of no harm to just give it a chance.To summarize, the story plot is pretty generic actually, it's basically how I predicted and expected it to be as mentioned previously but it's just that ' umph' that made the movie so compelling and enjoyable.Yes, the story is rather generic but Masaaki Yuasa has done a wonderful job in executing everything and turning it into an anime adaption. The way he presents his characters and how they face problems throughout the whole movie is a job well done.Personally, I am not much of an emotional person. I tend to lean more on the practical side but lemme just say.... there was never a single moment where I would expect myself to get all emotional and teary for a movie with such a simple and predictable plot but I had proven myself wrong... yet again. I ended the movie trying to stop myself from tearing up.I was not emotional after watching Anohana and Maiquia: when the promise flower blooms but somehow I was for 'ride your wave'. It really was a massive shock for me, I must say.All in all, if you're like me and are hesitating to give this one a go, I'd highly recommend you to stop your pondering and just get to it ;) and the girlfriend, being too depressed after his death, gets hallucinations of him and that's about it.

I ended the movie trying to stop myself from tearing up.I was not emotional after watching Anohana and Maiquia: when the promise flower blooms but somehow I was for 'ride your wave'. It really was a massive shock for me, I must say.All in all, if you're like me and are hesitating to give this one a go, I'd highly recommend you to stop your pondering and just get to it ;)""]"

I've never seen something so perfect come out of Nasu's work since Carnival Phantasm.Story: The story follows Gudako and friends, and her gacha filled journey through FGO. Following a 4koma format, there's absolutely no flow, but nobody seems to care. Later on, it follows Gudao and his gay adventures with Astolfo. Honestly, nothing could be better.Art: Look at the screenshots. You can see it's just the shitpost that is Learning with Manga, but animated.Sound: Gudako sounds like a demon, but everything else is just a nice performance from the VAs.

The Altera wriggle dance is also animated! THIS IS GOOD CIVILISATION!ok real info time:Story:It's just an compilations of shorts from Learning with Manga in animated form. So don't expect deep character or story.  One minute and you already are to the next short. There is little to no continuity between the shortsArt:The art is...the same you can find in the manga.

Celebrating a brand new year, type-moon was ready to unleash hell for us Fate fans, and they truly did.Story: The story partakes the adventure of Gudako and her hellish adventures with her servants, now the story truly deserves a 10/10, having every ingredient you need for an amazing story, fan service, comedy, amazing fight scenes and most importantly the power of bonds, they teach us an amazing lesson of what a strong bond can do. Take for example the bond between Gudako and Mashu, in this special, they truly show us...what an amazing bond between servant and master can bring, it brings tears to my eyes.Art: Now the art of this show reminds me of a higher budget PopTeamEpic, I do very much like this art for what it is, I\'ve always been a fan of the Fate GO manga so it was very pleasant on my eyes to see it animated. I really love the quirkiness of the animation, like when Gudako tried ""Molesting"" Mashu while she was using the VR set, the way her head would move, snuggling onto Mashui, was an amazing example of what good animation can do. Truly a 10/10 animation.Sound: I love hearing my favorite servants talk a bring my down to a eargasm, and now with the addition of Gudako\'s voice, it really makes this special, very special to my heart. I always expected Gudako to have the demonic voice that we needed and this VA truly brought us what type of person Gudako is. A demon. 10/10Character: Now the characters are the most important things about Fate in general, it\'s very nice to see Mashu, Jeanne, Tamamo, etc, in this special, they\'re all waifus (including Gudako) and without their quirky personalities this just wouldn\'t be as amazing, so thank you Type-Moon, for bringing these characters to this special. 10/10Enjoyment: My new years truly wasn\'t the best one\'s I\'ve had, but watching this 14:39 minute long special really brought a smile to my face. I can feel every pain in my body melt away with every second I watched of this show, the last time I felt so blessed was when I was punching my hand to the beat of Precure, and the fact I didn\'t even have to injure myself to feel all the negatives be blown away, I truly love this. 10/10Overall: This is a great way to conclude 2018, and I truly recommend any fan of Fate to grab your cups of milk and watch this. what an amazing bond between servant and master can bring, it brings tears to my eyes.Art: Now the art of this show reminds me of a higher budget PopTeamEpic, I do very much like this art for what it is, I\'ve always been a fan of the Fate GO manga so it was very pleasant on my eyes to see it animated.

Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1915/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_StrikerS,"[""Well here I have arrived at the final season of Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha.  It’s been a nice ride.  The final season brings back most of my beloved characters, provides a decent story and action and lets me enjoy grown up versions of Nanoha and Fate.  While I did find myself glued to my television watching this there was quite a bit about this series I found extremely disappointing.  I will get into that further later, but as a sequel to the Nanoha franchise IMO this series fails.  It just doesn’t feel like the originals, it also has a very...overbearing military theme to it that just feels out of place for a Nanoha show.  Taken though on its own merits this is a well crafted drama with good action and is fun to watch.When you compare the story in StrikerS to the first two series then this show comes up short.  When I started this series I thought wow they will do something amazing with 26 episodes compared to just 13!  Well yes and no.  They were able to construct a much larger and grander story than previously.  Tons of new villains though without the shocking plot twists.  It does however bring you through the entire spectrum of emotions, I cried at times, I laughed at others, and I was frustrated and angry too.This reason I knock the rating down for this show is well this show is called Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha.  It’s not called Magic Girls and sometimes Nanoha.  There is shockingly little Nanoha in this show, sure she appears a lot has a few lines then vanishes from the screen for 10 minutes to make another couple minute appearance.  In addition, characters I find to be important to Nanoha's world completely vanish from her life or are given basically cameo roles.  What happened to her friends from her hometown?  What happened to her family?  Why does Yuuno who it is implied that perhaps a romantic relationship may develop there almost complete absent from her life?  And talking Fate.. wtf is Arf?  She was a very important figure in Fates life.. oh wait there she is in episode 18 or so?  uh why is Arf now a loli?  Hello! Story?! Can you please explain why the grown up and buxom fox spirit Arf now looks like she’s 8 years old?  Oh you’re not going to explain that huh?This anime is crushed under its own weight of a further explosion of new characters, most of whom are stupid and useless dead weight.  The villains are mostly maddenly annoying and overpowered.  Further frustrations include a silly restriction on Nanoha, Fate, Hayete, and her knights’ powers.  The thing is, that this didn’t need to be a 26 episode story, it could have been told in 13 episodes just as easily and probably had a lot more effect and suspense.  This isn’t because of filler really, almost every episode advances the main plot in some way but episodes feel like they are being stretched out for no reason than so they take up an entire episode.  Nowhere is this more obvious than in the final battle which takes up about 7 episodes to complete.  The action loses its bite and the drama is lessened because of the constant shifting around to all of the characters battles.  This is what I mean about there being just too many characters for the shows own good.Character wise though I still give this a good rating, despite my disappointment with the lack of beloved characters and too little screen time for Fate and Nanoha.  The new Strikers are interesting characters though, particularly Tia and Suburu as they get the most development.  As I said before I really loathed the villains and found pretty much none of them to be sympathetic in the least.  I spent most of my time watching them hoping the episode would come soon that they were horribly and painfully killed by one of the strikers.  The crushing weight of characters as I mentioned doesn’t help this show, and many I felt were just a waste of time and would have preferred their screen time go to Yuuno, Arf or one of the others missing from the series.Voice acting is good not great though, the mains are all well cast but probably contributing to my disdain of the villain characters was that many of them had voice that grated on my nerves, in particular the evil doctor.  The music is pretty good too, the first OP/EN themes are great but the 2nd songs for each are noticeably weaker.Overall as a Nanoha fan I come away feeling a bit disappointed in this series, but still if you’re a fan this is still a show you’re going to want to watch.  It was really nice to see Nanoha and Fate grown up and being adults and having adult problems and relationships.  But in doing so something of the charm of that 9 yr old mage is lost.  Taken by itself though this is a nice magical action drama with military themes.  In that role it does a very good job.  I think most people will like this series as I did but still feel let down at the same time. overbearing military theme to it that just feels out of place for a Nanoha show.

So it should come as no surprise when I say it's got transformation sequences, mascot animals, and a whole slue of magical girls (one of which is even a pink healing type).But what should come as a surprise is when I tell you this is a series with awesome, mind-blowing action.  The action sequences are great, and never choppy.  StrikerS's got the type of action that rouses excitement and gets your adrenaline pumping, not what you'd expect to get...in mahou shoujo.And perhaps a little background history is in order.  The Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha franchise was originally created and geared toward seinen audiences who like their flat-chested loli girls.  You can see the franchise succeeded admirably, given the immense popularity Nanoha and Fate (our two original magical girls) enjoy.  I've also noticed that really hardcore fans of this franchise tend to prefer the original Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha and Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's a lot more than StrikerS; I see this as evidence of StrikerS falling into the opposite end of the mahou shoujo spectrum, setting it apart from its two predecessors.  (Besides which, since StrikerS is set ten years after A's, Nanoha and Fate are no longer, ah, flat-chested loli girls.)StrikerS has a solid and grounded plot.  It's well-paced, mixing everyday life with the very hectic nature of our magical girls' (and one &quot;magical boy&quot;) job duties quite well.  You get to see them on their down time, in actual combat, and what's surpising is, you even get to see them training.  You get to see them get bruised, exhausted, have arguments with their team members, and even screw up majorly.  With that said, I can't say the plot's extremely original or anything; it's good, but not superb. The characterisation is very good, especially since we can see various characters' vulnerabilities and misgivings.  Their motivations are clear as well (maybe not at first, but definitely by the end of the series you know why people do what they do).Now, for sound.  Check the seiyuu list-- you've got a lot of big names there, so you know at the very least the quality meets a certain standard.  There are some emotionally-charged scenes, and they're executed very, very well by the seiyuu.  The OPs are terribly uplifting and catchy, especially the first one.  The EDs are very good, particularly on the basis that they offer suitable music to listen to after an episode, whether it was happy or gut-wrenchingly sad.  There's nothing as bad as watching a sad episode and then suddenly having sugary happy music assaulting your ears before you've even had enough time being sad.I've mostly had good things to say about StrikerS, so needless to say, I enjoyed it very much.  I think StrikerS transcends the mahou shoujo genre and is just plainly enough, a series done well.  I would recommend this to anyone who just wants to watch a good series and isn't too particular about genres.  For people who are allergic to girly mahou shoujo, I would still ask you to keep an open mind and just try out the first episode (which, incidentally, has awesome action and isn't the least bit girly).  If you like the first episode, I can almost guarantee you'll like the rest of the series.  Those who are looking for romance in StrikerS might be disappointed though, since the only romance I really saw (if any) was subtextual f/f (which is worth watching for, in my opinion, if you're into yuri).  So I wouldn't suggest this title to hardcore shoujo romance or harem series viewers.I think StrikerS is different enough from its predecessors to watch on its own (it is, after all, set ten years after A's), but to truly understand the relationship between Nanoha, Fate, Hayate, and the rest of the older generation, you really have to watch the original series and A's.  The first two series are very traditionally mahou shoujo though (but with great animation and vague hints of fanservice, due to its seinen-geared history) so please proceed with caution if you are allergic. in mahou shoujo.And perhaps a little background history is in order.

Nanoha, Fate and other characters they've met now work full time for the TSAB.  We meet two new characters in the first episode: meet Subaru and Teana. They are mages who have Nanoha as trainer and they're trying to rank up as a mage. It doesn't take long and two new characters appear: Erio and Caro. Nanoha, Fate and Hayate must train these four mages to work together and to save the world from new enemies.The story is not longer that original if you ask me, but still, Nanoha StrikerS has things that makes...it different than other mahou shoujo. ''What makes it more different than?''. It are the military and the political part of the story which makes the difference, but which also makes it sometimes harder to understand what it is about. Further is there the low amount of love that's in StrikerS. Love is in most of the mahou shoujo a must and yes, I missed it here.

First, let's do a quick recap. In the original series our heroine, Takamachi Nanoha, gained powers and used them to help her ferret friend, Yuuno, find artefacts called Jewel Seeds. Her rival in this endeavour was a young lady named Testarossa Fate. The two experienced their first feelings of romantic love and Nanoha was eventually able to help Fate escape her abusive mother. In the end, they weren't able to stay together as Fate had to face trial over her part in her mother's scheme. The second...series saw the pair reunited under less than ideal circumstances. Yagami Hayate, no relation to Light, found a magic book that unleashed four guardian spirits who were stealing magic power from mages to fill the book in a desperate bid to save their beloved Hayate's life. The two were able to find the truth of the book, save Hayate, redeem her knights and, in the process, Nanoha and Fate fell even harder for one another. But maybe I'm over-stating it. It's not like they've adopted a child together or something. Let's look at Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS and see what comes next for the pair and their friends.Story:A decade after the events of A's, Hayate forms an experimental unit, Section Six, supposedly to deal with relics. She's joined by Nanoha and Fate as well as a group of four promising recruits, Subaru, Teana, Erio and Caro. Nanoha begins training the troops with the help of Vita, but their time is limited and the unit is quickly dragged into a mess involving a high level criminal named Jail Scaglietti and his maniacal machines. After a slight altercation they find a young abandoned girl named Vivio, whom Nanoha and Fate adopt. Canon relationship status achieved. The main narrative deals with the threat posed by Scaglietti and his minions.I don't really have anything negative to say about the story. It's strongly paced, using slower character moments and faster-paced, dynamic action moments really effectively. It also has some great moments of heart-warming, particularly when it comes to Vivio. The series is also really good at keeping sources of tension and producing high stakes with credible threats to our heroines and it's good at using that to keep the audience invested. The build up for the various plot points is quite effective, being vague enough to keep you guessing but also concrete enough that you can trace where the hints were once something’s been revealed.Characters:The characters in this are really compelling and complex. With the time skip, Nanoha, Fate, Hayate and the others have change from the last series, but it's done in a way that's believable and you can see how the girls they were became the women they are. Similarly, you can fully understand how their relationships developed into what they are. The new major characters all get their own story arc, which informs and develops their characters. Vivio is adorable, and this is coming from someone who doesn't normally find children remotely cute. The character interactions are really good too. The villains are well crafted characters as well, albeit less sympathetic than the ones the franchise has previously provided. Particularly Scaglietti who basically comes across as a crazy person. Although, I will give them credit, he's not unrealistically or exaggeratedly crazy. He's the sort of nutter who has verisimilitude.Art:The art has a lot of good qualities to it. The character designs are really well done and there's a lot of attention to detail for the backgrounds. The action sequences flow really nicely and have a high level of intensity, in spite of the occasional slower, larger special attack. The big flaw with the art is the same one we've had with this franchise, the transformation sequence. Unlike most magical girl series where the characters' genuine shapes are obscured by whatever sparkly effect they're using, the Nanoha franchise lovingly details the bosoms so that you can pretty vividly tell what they look like. At least in this one most of the girls are grown women so it isn't quite as gross on that level, but they also make sure that the undergarments are really detailed for both Nanoha and Fate so that we can see what they're taking off of one another later. Seven Arcs, we don't need to know what kind of panties they wear. Even the sort of people who draw pornographic doujin have seen enough women's underwear that they can pick a design for their work. Okay, maybe they haven't, but I would still argue that those aren't the types who should be catered to.Sound:The vocal cast in this is stellar. Mizuki Nana, Tamura Yukari, Ueda Kana, Yuzuki Ryouka, Shimizu Kaori, Ichijo Kazuya and Sanada Asami reprise their roles. They all give strong performances. In addition to them, Nakahara Mai, Inoue Marina, Saito Chiwa Takahashi Mikako and Mizuhashi Kaori all deliver their own strong performances. Narita Ken makes a good villain too. Really, the entire cast from primary to secondary characters is superb. The music is fantastic as well.Ho-yay:This has a lot of les-yay, even for the Nanoha franchise. In addition to Nanoha and Fate sharing a bed, going on vacations together and adopting a daughter, as wives are wont to do, you have some really strong les-yay between Subaru and Teana. There's a little bit between Vita and Hayate as well, although not as much as there was in A's since they're less of a focus in this one.Final Thoughts:Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS, is a really strong series. While there are some things it could have done better, and it's transformation sequences are just awful, it presents a compelling story, strong characters, a stupendous cast, excellent music and great artwork aside from the transformations. My final rating on this one is going to be a solid 9/10. Next week I'll look at Wooser no Sono Higurashi. series saw the pair reunited under less than ideal circumstances.

Next week I'll look at Wooser no Sono Higurashi."", 'First up, I\'ll be honest, the primary reason I went into this show is because I heard it had some ""mecha"" relations, which is true, it does revolve heavily around cyborgs, and the secondary reason was because I heard that Subaru was a pretty awesome character.But that being said, I\'m not an idiot, I realise that being a ""Magical Girl"" show, this probably had about as much chance as being /m/ as Dragon Ball Z, so I was willing to give it a shot to see if it was good for its own sake. And cudos to the first two seasons, they were...pretty good. Nothing mind-blowing, but something that even I, despite it being well outside my realm of usual viewing, could watch (and heck, there were even mechs in the first series for a little bit).But then I got up to this one, the one I actually wanted to watch, and man, it is poor.Basically, there are no problems with the animation or sound or anything like that, the problem is with the writing. I\'ll break it down into three categories, 1- the premise of the show, 2- the new characters and 3- the old characters.I\'ll start with #1, the premise of the show. First up, the title is abhorrently misleading, despite being called a ""magical girl"" show, it really isn\'t. There may be a bit lost in translation here, so I should elaborate, the ""girl"" in ""magical girl"" means ""young/small/little"" girl, so a more appropriate name would be ""magical teenager"" or ""magical practically-an-adult"" nanoha. The reason this is somewhat important is because of the themes that are connotated by the genre. Magical girl is all about being cute, gaining new powers and, most overridingly, must revolve around friendship. So much so that it is usually sickening to someone like me, who\'s not a fan of the genre.But S1 did this pretty well, sure it was a tad cliche, but Fate and Nanoha\'s story was one that was watchable, and indeed, it was nothing bad. A\'s (the second season) was about Hayate, and even though I thought the ""poor crippled orphan"" plot was a little bit too over-the-top, it was understandable, as there was a good reason that she was a ""poor crippled orphan"" (explained in the show so I shan\'t elaborate). Nanoha making friends with them and helping them out was a perfectly good plotline.But in this regard, what did StrikerS have to offer? None of the antagonists were in any kind of situation where they needed help/friends, bar Lu and Agatio, but both were already getting help/gotten help of their own free will in the series. This means the ""friendship"" was forced down their throat. I mean Fate having friendship forced down her throat was understandable, considering her circumstances in season 1, but as a gerneral rule, forcing friendship onto someone is just nonsense.And that\'s pretty much the problem with this series\' premise, it aborts from the themes established in the first two seasons and goes down a completely different track. This might not have been a bad thing, but, as per below, there were some deep writing flaws that turned it into one.#2 is the most obvious, the new characters. As I already said, there was a good reason Hayate was a crippled orphan in season 2, and Fate in season 1 was the main subject matter, so again, there was a reason to have her in that situation. But what about this one? All the characters (basically) are orphans, with some deep emotional scarring. Why? Well, put simply, it is so that the writers have something to talk about in the numerous incessant personal reflections that go on. I\'m all for a bit of backstory, when it is relevant. Entire episodes of nonstop backstory from characters like the helicopter pilot, who, as my description implies, is a completely and utterly minor character, is downright annoying. The only reason I can think that they have so many backstories is because the *actual* story is inadequate. I mean honestly, aside from training, the squad in this series partake in, like, all of three fights (with the last fight being a really long one, admittedly), and the plot is resolved in these three fights. This proves to me that the plot is very, very shallow. Now I wasn\'t expecting something deep, but good lord, was there really a need to fill the episodes with so much cliche overblown emo crap in the meantime?This is the second serious complaint. The new characters were, essentially, only there because the plot wasn\'t interesting enough and the directors had 26 episodes to fill. I can easily see them simply removing half the cast and putting this into a 13 episode anime and it working just as well. The only thing having all these new characters did was to slow down the series to an absolute crawl. The pacing was terrible.But now onto writing issue #3. The old characters. First up, Hayate didn\'t really do much in A\'s, so I can understand why they made her the ""main"" character and altered her, etc, that\'s all well and good, its the rest of the cast I have an issue with. Firstly are the ""power limiters"" they all suddenly got. These were only in there because the plot, which I already explained was stretched thin and needed boosting with new characters, was *so* weak that simply using the recurring characters would end it instantly, so they had to *construct* a reason to use the new cast. What better plot device than weakening the old cast, right? But in the end, what was the point of this? It would have been just as easy to have Nanoha  and co. go one way and the others go another. Heck, that is *EXACTLY* what they do anyway. So why bother stripping away the power of the old cast? It was a pointless plot device that served no purpose other than to construct fake drama and pad the series out just a little longer.Second up is the ""overworking"" sub-thread that applies to Nanoha. I shan\'t explain due to spoilers, but basically, there is this whole sub-thread about using too much magic power/effort, etc. Why is this even in there if you already have power limiters? The writers ALREADY padded the plot out with fake weakness to slow it down, but then they put in a fake danger *ontop* of that fake weakness. The writers should\'ve taken this as a sign of way too much filler and not a strong enough plot. Alas, they did not, and I wasted my time with this rubbish story.Third is the inexplicable removal of the minor characters. Fate\'s familiar is the most notable. Aside from a few brief shots in the background of the later episodes, and maybe one or two throwaway lines, its made like she never existed in the first place. Nanoha\'s family and friends are tossed out (understandable, but still evidence of how much this show detracts from the original genre) and Yunno is delegated to an utterly menial role. All this I could forgive if any of the new characters, antagonist or protagonist, (like Hayate or her Knights in A\'s) were likeable and/or relevant to the plot. Alas, they were not. Aside from Subaru\'s family, everyone else had nothing to do with the plot, and all the antagonists were, essentially, *troops*, not *characters*.And finally is the Jewel Seeds. Remember them? Yeah, for being supposedly rare and powerful, for them to be suddenly found in stock grunts was just inexcusable. (Sorry if you think this is a spoiler, but if you watch the show, you\'ll realise that it isn\'t actually that relevant at all, which in of itself is part of the problems I\'m writing about)Basically, this show reads like a fanfic. The new characters are all Mary Sue\'s, despite having no relevance to the plot, and heck, some, like Caro, barley even have any lines (honestly, the whole lightning team, and Lu, could be removed and the story wouldn\'t even blink), some of the plot devices are retconns, which, depending on whether you think about it or not, usually don\'t even make sense and finally, the recurring characters were so utterly un-thought-out that they had to make up fake plot devices and introduce new problems just so the writers could fit the titular characters into StrikerS\' new story.And how on earth could they not see the problems with that?If you\'re watching this as a stand-alone series, it\'s probably pretty good. As a franchise, this is a bad piece of writing that pretty much has nothing going for it. Worth a watch if you\'re a Nanoha fan, because fans can overlook poor writing and still be happy, but overall, Fate/Stay Night or something along those lines is a much better show, since the writers in those shows didn\'t insist on forcing their characters into a really weak plot and then stretching it out over 26 episodes, when 13 probably would\'ve been too many. pretty good.

This time they have to face some bigger enemy than before. I won't say too much who they are going to fight but it will be revealed later on after some episodes in the story...I have to say that the pace of the story is kept thanks to the higher number of NOW 26 episodes pretty slower at the beginning...but around the half it is getting to the real plot and also increasing the speed. Before it was more like an introduction to the newer characters and how they train...or progress.Don't get me wrong ;) everything is build up pretty nice for the final battles and they are also well executed...even though a little bit predictable.To the characters...the old ones are all the same and I have to say that I personally like it. Don't expect any big characteristic developments or change of minds.But the new characters bring some fresh air with it. Nothing new or spectacular for animes will happen just some typical sad background is included for them. But someone bringing up some interesting flair is included too. For example I'm talking about Teana who is new now and who uses some pistol like Device. Other are Caro who can summon dragons, Erio who fights with a spear like Device and Subaru using a rollerblades Device. - a side note, a Device is a magic tool for fighting and defending..I enjoyed it quite a lot and it is staying truthful to the previous seasons. That is also a plus for me. Of course the battles improved and show some more action too, another thing that is nice.For the music, I didn't pay too much attention to it but it was suiting and pleasant enough for the setting. 2 op's and ed's.So then finally if you like Nanoha and co. then you can watch the 3rd season without any problems because it sticks to the friendship, magic and fighting themes. It is really enjoyable and looking also nicely drawn, don't miss it out if your especially a fan. or progress.Don't get me wrong ;) everything is build up pretty nice for the final battles and they are also well executed...even though a little bit predictable.To the characters...the old ones are all the same and I have to say that I personally like it.

Soppy little transformation sequences, annoying mascot animals, ridiculously cute lolis...But make no mistake. Maybe people have the wrong impression from the title (which may account for the surprisingly low ratings), but  StrikerS is, in fact, squarely in the Shonen denomination, and is a rambunctiously good Shonen to boot.PlotLets have a quick summary. StrikerS is set 10 years after the previous iteration of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, in which the titular character has outgrown her loliness and become a full time Instructor, training the new generation of horribly underaged TSAB...recruits. The cast is further expanded with the introduction of new recruits. As industry standard, a threat to world security soon arises, and Nanoha, together with her old friends from the previous season, as well as her new recruits, is responsible for stopping them, shonen-protagonist style.When I say shonen-protagonist style, I mean, of course, &quot;extremely violently and with great prejudice. The plot is par for the course, with a convincingly evil big bad, lots of cool henchmen, and lots, and lots of violence. It also manages to get some decent military intrigue going, and the last few episodes are a roller-coaster ride of emotions, where the action is fast-paced and gripping. It's a great step up from the previous seasons, and indeed, the complexity of the plot surpasses industry standard shonen, or even seinen fare.Necessary recaps for viewers who have not seen the previous show are done extremely tastefully, telling just enough, but not totally spilling the beans, such that new viewers can jump right into the show, yet are still tempted to watch previous seasons. The continuation of previous plot elements to their conclusion in StrikerS is also done well, if a bit thuggishly at certain points.Sadly, the show is hamstrung by its shonen trappings. I cannot talk any further to prevent spoilers, but suffice to say, the marvelous plot was, in the end, let down by the fact that the target audience for this show was, in fact, teenagers. Bit of a shame. It wasn't a deeply profound plot, but it was entertaining.AestheticsThe art is vey much the same as with the previous seasons, with one major difference: budget. No frame-dropping or awkward movements for us this time, no sirree! While not spectacular, the animation is nonetheless extremely high-quality, and the explosions are beautifully done.Sound, sadly, appears to have taken a dip from previous seasons, even if still serviceable. The voice acting continues to be above-average, but sound effects have suffered slightly. The whimsical bassoon melodies from Season One and Two have disappeared, to be replaced by genericized faux-brass tunes. The character leitmotifs, however, remain as beautiful tunes.Setting and CharactersTo my surprise (and later, pleasure), the director of StrikerS has taken the ambitious step of rewriting the setting, dragging emphasis away from staples of the previous seasons (Familiars and Devices being the most obvious), instead putting the emphasis on political maneuvering and a certain degree of philosophy. The emphasis on human relations from the previous seasons remains strongly in force, and indeed, we continue to see well-rounded and strong characters, both familiar and new, grow and develop as the show progresses. It is extremely well done, and kudos should rightly go to the director for this.However... again due to the shonen trappings of the show, the cast has gotten into a.. ballooning tendency due to their shonen protagonist invulnerability status. This leads to appearance issues, where a huge cast pool competes for limited airtime. While this is understandable, it is also regrettable, especially when characters whose deaths would have been perfectly placed to advance the plot stay alive.OverviewThe director has chosen to shunt the show to the mainstream, a smart and noble move. However, I do wish he'd have enough confidence to put down his artistic vision without fear of repercussion, although the realist in me tells me this will never happen. While I don't deny I enjoyed this show, it has the potential to be more, so, so much more. It's good, but calling it excellent would be a blatant lie.8/10, very deservedly so. recruits. The cast is further expanded with the introduction of new recruits. As industry standard, a threat to world security soon arises, and Nanoha, together with her old friends from the previous season, as well as her new recruits, is responsible for stopping them, shonen-protagonist style.When I say shonen-protagonist style, I mean, of course, &quot;extremely violently and with great prejudice. The plot is par for the course, with a convincingly evil big bad, lots of cool henchmen, and lots, and lots of violence. It also manages to get some decent military intrigue going, and the last few episodes are a roller-coaster ride of emotions, where the action is fast-paced and gripping. It's a great step up from the previous seasons, and indeed, the complexity of the plot surpasses industry standard shonen, or even seinen fare.Necessary recaps for viewers who have not seen the previous show are done extremely tastefully, telling just enough, but not totally spilling the beans, such that new viewers can jump right into the show, yet are still tempted to watch previous seasons. The continuation of previous plot elements to their conclusion in StrikerS is also done well, if a bit thuggishly at certain points.Sadly, the show is hamstrung by its shonen trappings. I cannot talk any further to prevent spoilers, but suffice to say, the marvelous plot was, in the end, let down by the fact that the target audience for this show was, in fact, teenagers. Bit of a shame. It wasn't a deeply profound plot, but it was entertaining.AestheticsThe art is vey much the same as with the previous seasons, with one major difference: budget. No frame-dropping or awkward movements for us this time, no sirree! While not spectacular, the animation is nonetheless extremely high-quality, and the explosions are beautifully done.Sound, sadly, appears to have taken a dip from previous seasons, even if still serviceable. The voice acting continues to be above-average, but sound effects have suffered slightly. The whimsical bassoon melodies from Season One and Two have disappeared, to be replaced by genericized faux-brass tunes. The character leitmotifs, however, remain as beautiful tunes.Setting and CharactersTo my surprise (and later, pleasure), the director of StrikerS has taken the ambitious step of rewriting the setting, dragging emphasis away from staples of the previous seasons (Familiars and Devices being the most obvious), instead putting the emphasis on political maneuvering and a certain degree of philosophy. The emphasis on human relations from the previous seasons remains strongly in force, and indeed, we continue to see well-rounded and strong characters, both familiar and new, grow and develop as the show progresses. It is extremely well done, and kudos should rightly go to the director for this.However... again due to the shonen trappings of the show, the cast has gotten into a.. ballooning tendency due to their shonen protagonist invulnerability status. This leads to appearance issues, where a huge cast pool competes for limited airtime. While this is understandable, it is also regrettable, especially when characters whose deaths would have been perfectly placed to advance the plot stay alive.OverviewThe director has chosen to shunt the show to the mainstream, a smart and noble move.

Well that and the fact that our favorite magical girls were no longer loli's. But the series picks up with some interesting (and plentiful) villains and some new characters that are also very cool. The multiple plot lines near the end is done very well and even those new characters you may or may not have liked in the begining become interesting and exciting as we get to our big StrikerS finale. "", "":::INTROFast-forwarding ten years after A's, our little heroines are all grown up.PrimeSonic once again, here with the final part in my review of the Nanoha trilogy: Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS.Does the final chapter in the Nanoha trilogy live up to the hype? Well let's take a look.:::STORYSay goodbye to Japan, and Earth for that matter, as the entire story takes place on Mid-childa, home to the Time and Space Administration Bureau's main branch.All the supporting characters from the previous seasons that had nothing to do with magic or the Bureau are pretty much gone.Four years after the conclusion of A's, the girls have risen...through the ranks, reaching the goals they set for themselves long ago.At present, Hayate is leading a newly created section and, with the help of her friends, she's realizing her dream of being able fight for the people caught up in the Lost Logia cases.In a general perspective, the story has two main focuses.One would be the new recruits and their training with Nanoha while the other deals with quite possibly the first central antagonist the trilogy has ever seen.:::NEW CHARACTERSStrikerS gives us lots and lots of new characters as well as properly introduce a few that made only minor appearances so far.To add to that, in this season it seems like almost everyone and their mother has a back story to tell.So to keep things short, I'll just mention the more important characters in this review.:Subaru NakajimaFour years earlier, Nanoha rescued Subaru from an intense fire.Ever since, Subaru has been determined to become strong like Nanoha so one day she can be the one to save a life in danger.When she's not in combat, she can be the most childish of the recruits, and that's saying a lot considering she's probably the oldest.There's also a bit of a secret to Subaru, but I won't spoil it here.:Teana LanstarOf the four recruits Teana is by far the one that takes things the most seriously.Initially she feels out of place, feeling like the only normal person surrounded by a bunch of elites and aces.It's actually because of Teana that we end up finding out more about what happened to Nanoha in the years since she joined the Bureau.She's reluctantly been friends with Subaru since they both enlisted with the Bureau and has had to put up with her ever since.:Caro Ru LusheEven though she's the youngest of the four, Caro's support magic and dragon summoning are a big help for the team.Her back story and inner conflict get resolved before anyone else's as it doesn't take her long to master her dragon summoning to protect her friends.:Erio MondialThe only lead male protagonist we'll be seeing, and it so happens that Erio is really just two months older than Caro.He's very protective of Caro on the battlefield and has all makings of a modern knight. He has his own story which links him to Fate in a way, but I won't spoil it here.:VivioAbout half-way into the series we meet Vivio. Very early we discover she's another child created through Project F, an artificial mage born in the same way as Fate.This girl is made of concentrated cuteness, I swear.She's the subject of much heartbreak, and it should be said, she's also the subject of blatant controversial fanservice.You see, Vivio has two mommies. Uhm...wat?:::ABOUT THE ANIMEStrikerS was the long awaited sequel that generated a lot of hype and even more expectations. Because of this, it got very mixed reactions when it first aired. It made plenty of changes to that way it presented the story while still trying to feel the way a Nanoha series should.Some fans loved it, others only liked it, and others gave up on the series by the 4th episode and said they hated it.One thing that becomes clear right off the bat is that Nanoha and rest of the main heroes from the previous seasons are now sharing the spotlight with a lot of new characters.That's not to say we don't spend time with them, but for the first half of the series they are clearly acting more like supporting characters than protagonists.One of the issues that brought up so many mixed reviews was how StikerS has more dialogue and side-stories than it does action scenes.In the first half of the series, much more time is spent on the recruits and their training than actual missions or the returning heroes.That being said, the plot is also far more complex and mature than before, taking everything from the previous seasons and placing it on an even larger scale.There's plenty of time spent on character development for the four recruits, most of it given to Subaru and Teana, and probably even more than Nanoha and Fate had throughout both previous seasons.I have to admit: I wasn't crazy about there being four new protagonists all at once, and it certainly wasn't a packaged deal like is was with the knights were in the last season; but after a while they did grow on me.Looking at the lighter side of StrikerS, there's still a few funny and embarrassing moments to be had.As far as the fanservice goes, it mostly comes from the transformation sequences. Don't expect much more than that.Speaking of transformation sequences,the ones in StrikerS are much like they were in A's.They don't come often, but when they do, you will know it.It's kinda funny how the older girls all get elaborate and lengthy transformation sequences while Erio's and Caro's are done in half the time.Not to mention that Erio goes instantly from his uniform to his barrier jacket without having to strip down first. Yeah, you can draw your own conclusions from that.As far as action scenes go, they're relatively few and far between this time.Still, they make the final battle in A's seem small in comparison.Overall, the combat sequences are much more intense than they were before.Expect to see e good deal of blood in later episodes.:::CONCLUSIONStrikerS was certainly going to make or break the Nanoha series.It gets off to a slow start, but after watching it in full, I can definitely say it was worth enduring the long dialogue scenes.It's hard to put into words, but in a way, after watching StrikerS, A's just seems small, much in the same way A's made the first season seem small.Even with all the changes in style, once you get into it, StrikerS doesn't make you feel like you're watching a completely different series.Most of the themes are are taken directly from the previous seasons and even ten years later, Nanoha, Fate, and everyone else have remained largely unchanged.I'm giving StikerS an above average 8 out of 10.Personally I liked it, but some people might get bored with it before it gets to the good stuff.I can't say it was excellent all around, but the ending was just amazing and certainly more intense than the ending for A's was.Again I stress, to really appreciate the characters in StrikerS, having watched the first two seasons is a must.To wrap things up: if you're a Nanoha fan, then you owe it to yourself to give StrikerS a try. through the ranks, reaching the goals they set for themselves long ago.At present, Hayate is leading a newly created section and, with the help of her friends, she's realizing her dream of being able fight for the people caught up in the Lost Logia cases.In a general perspective, the story has two main focuses.One would be the new recruits and their training with Nanoha while the other deals with quite possibly the first central antagonist the trilogy has ever seen.:::NEW CHARACTERSStrikerS gives us lots and lots of new characters as well as properly introduce a few that made only minor appearances so far.To add to that, in this season it seems like almost everyone and their mother has a back story to tell.So to keep things short, I'll just mention the more important characters in this review.:Subaru NakajimaFour years earlier, Nanoha rescued Subaru from an intense fire.Ever since, Subaru has been determined to become strong like Nanoha so one day she can be the one to save a life in danger.When she's not in combat, she can be the most childish of the recruits, and that's saying a lot considering she's probably the oldest.There's also a bit of a secret to Subaru, but I won't spoil it here.:Teana LanstarOf the four recruits Teana is by far the one that takes things the most seriously.Initially she feels out of place, feeling like the only normal person surrounded by a bunch of elites and aces.It's actually because of Teana that we end up finding out more about what happened to Nanoha in the years since she joined the Bureau.She's reluctantly been friends with Subaru since they both enlisted with the Bureau and has had to put up with her ever since.:Caro Ru LusheEven though she's the youngest of the four, Caro's support magic and dragon summoning are a big help for the team.Her back story and inner conflict get resolved before anyone else's as it doesn't take her long to master her dragon summoning to protect her friends.:Erio MondialThe only lead male protagonist we'll be seeing, and it so happens that Erio is really just two months older than Caro.He's very protective of Caro on the battlefield and has all makings of a modern knight.

It started of pretty badly and the awful pacing during the first seven episodes didn’t help much. But starting from episode 8 of the anime I was completely hooked.  Fate’s story was such a sad one and it made the anime even more endearing.  And here I am reviewing the final part of Nanoha and company’s journey. Boy has it been a fun one!Story – 8/10One thing that always manages to amaze me with the Nanoha series is the world the characters live in. It...has always managed to draw me in because of the unusual combination of science and magic. Our characters live in a world which is technological far superior to ours however they still make use of magic as their primary military might – aside from the TSA fleet. Another aspect of the series I always find fascinating is how a Magical Girl anime aimed primarily at a younger audience, manages to tackle some pretty depressing topics, such as morality and loss. The story this season continues to build from previous seasons with Nanoha and company at the centre of it all. It isn’t a perfect plot, however it gets the job done. For the plot of a Nanoha anime to be well done – at least in my opinion – it should further enhance the characters of the anime as they are without a doubt the strongest part of the anime.  It manages to accomplish this adequately as we can see how Nanoha, Fate, Hayete, Chrono ect; have matured of the course of the previous seasons.Art – 7/10For a rather dated series, StrikerS art style manages to keep up to today’s standards. Nothing exactly stands out, however nothing is done too lazily either. The character designs of the protagonists are all different and vividly colored. The various gadgets however were simply disposable tools with not enough variation however I am just full of shit. It is still a blast to watch Nanoha and co. destroy herds of gadgets with little to no effort.  The “boss fights” were well made however I feel the duration of these fights were a little too short.Sound – 8/10I thoroughly enjoyed StrikerS soundtrack. The vocals for both openings and endings were beautifully sung and I could probably listen to it for hours on repeat, because that is just how weird I am. Unfortunately I can’t say the same of the OST. Even though it accomplished its goal of building atmosphere and personality within the series, many of the tracks – with the exception of a few – were completely forgettable.  Voice acting on the other hand is fantastic for a large portion of characters, most notably Fate’s seiyuu. Just like in previous season’s her seiyuu gave Fate even more personality than she already has. Round of applause everyone.Character -9/10Sadly because of the gigantic cast of characters a lot of characters weren’t as fleshed out as in previous seasons, which is a real shame because I really enjoyed seeing the grown versions of characters from the first two seasons. Here to take their place however are bunch of children which joins the main trio in section 6. Weirdly enough I happened to really enjoy the introduction of Subaru, Tiana, Caro and Erio. Enough time was given to really flesh out these new characters and their motivations,  which is always a plus as many continuing series simply introduce a new character and then immediately expect you to care for them. The best part was seeing grown-up Nanoha and Fate. To see them act like warm and caring mothers to their kouhai and later on sweet little Vivio, was absolutely heart-warming.  We can definitely see that they have matured and how their past has helped make them the people they are today. Plus seeing grown up Nanoha and Fate express their concern for each other’s well-being , was sweet beyond words.Enjoyment – 9/10If you haven’t noticed already, I am not only a massive NanoFate fan but also a massive fan of the Nanoha universe as a whole. This vibrant world filled with characters you can not only relate to, but also cry for, will always have a special place in this rotten heart of mind. I adored seeing Nanoha and co. as adults. Even though this season wasn’t as well written as previous ones more Nanoha is never bad … unless you go and make fan service focussed spin-off by A1 pictures.Overall – 8/10Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS is an anime aimed at fans of the Nanoha universe. I wouldn’t recommend watching StrikerS if you aren’t familiar with the Nanoha universe as the bad pacing up until the climax episodes would drive the majority of people away from this otherwise great series. If you are a fan of the Nanoha universe please give StrikerS a go.

We see our beloved cast all grown up as working adults and how the events of the first 2 season shaped them growing up. The new cast members were also great additions, especially Subaru and Tiana. All the characters get some great development. The shows has themes of motherhood, family, the importance of discipline and accountability as well as the burdens of leadership and command. The stand out as always are the well executed relationships between the characters. Like in the previous seasons the OST is outstanding. We also...get some updated animation and art style. The direction is good as well with some well thought out action choreography.The biggest weakness of the show is the antagonists, with the main one being just a generic mad scientist.Overall this season was a great watch with a lot of powerful emotional moments, as well as being a lot more mature than the previous ones. It was fun seeing where and what newer shows borrowed from and got some of their influences and inspirations. My favourite season of the show so far, and I highly recommend everyone gives the series a try.P.S.

The first two seasons each spanned 13 episodes by Studio Seven Arcs and director Keizou Kusakawa. Seven Arcs prior to this third season at this point was very young with basically only this series and an ecchi show called Sekirei under their belt. StrikerS broke from the usual 13 episode format and created this show to be 26 episodes. The first two shows in the series were actually pretty good and the later movie adaptations were even better, so high hopes stood on this third iteration of...the tv show.Our setting is set ten years after the events of the second season, and runs through the basics of the world and characters establishing quick that the first two seasons are not needed to jump right into this show. The show focuses and brings back the cast from the previous show with Nanoha, Fate, and Hayate now working full time at the Time-Space Administration Bureau. Each character is around 19 and has taken on roles fitting to their brand new character such as Nanoha is now a super powerful combat instructor. She is deemed with being the captain of a specialized task force ready to deal with issues regarding ancient dangerous artifacts called ‘logia.’ New characters are introduced to be part of the task force.Now, the show suffers from a slew of negatives. Presentation is done by having exposition included into the fighting and going over strategy accordingly, but the pure amount of talking and standing around does not help constantly repeating exposition. Second, the plot is a mess and suffers from extremely slow pacing away from the main plot consistently. 75% of the show is about life lessons, side missions, and repeated sequences over the new team of characters without much actual backstory and zero character development. StrikerS has an issue with Nanoha and Fate basically becoming mom’s to the new cast and it gets old very quick. Also, there are too many characters in the show now for overload causing the new characters to basically be a side task to the main plot. Third, there are limiters on the main characters preventing them from using their true power. They need permission, so when the enemy comes it causes convenient issues for the sake of expanding the story. There is even way too much to get into with more characters and interaction constantly happening just to expend ‘moe’ for the sake of cuteness. Animation and production are all over the place ranging from inconsistent character designs within the same episodes to fight scenes being choppy and images being slid across generic backgrounds. Music is sub-standard and has the equivalent of old generic video game sounds from the early 90s.Everything in StrikerS has the definition of budget issues and probably would have been miles better as another 13 episode show. Character overload and half the show being introductions is unforgivable. Action and battles which made the previous shows so good are put aside here for more moe/feel good moments.

This anime was a severe disappointment.', ""Mahou Shoujo Nanoha first and the A's have been great. The character development, magic upgrades in the dire pinch, and finally working together after the rival fighting have been very attractive. However, StrikerS lacked all of them.Nanoha is supposed to be a typical elementary school girl with two friends back home on Earth. There's no Earth; there's no family (which she had bother and sister), and a house she lived in. She's already a fully grown adult at 18 years old, living at Magic central station Honbu (Home Station). Nanoha is no longer the main character who we get to feel, listen, and be,...it's about building the perfect team called the StrikerS against the great scientist. Thus the focus of the story has been on Nanoha building the team, along with stories on all of the other characters instead of Nanoha. The authors should have called it Mahou Shoujo StrikerS. This anime was supposed to be Nanoha's stories and her contributions to the world, not the Team. I have to say, StrikerS has been a huge disappointment.Next, Nanoha had magic upgrades when raging heart was defeated. In StrikerS, Nanoha already had the powers; all they did was restrict her magic as she (and few others) were far too strong. This already made them out to be a supernatural monster who have enough powers to destroy anyone without training and fighting and challenge. Where's the growth without challenging other more difficult situation? You can't suddenly attain over limits as it has been in the first two series. It's absolutely inconsistent and story lost its quality completely.Finally, Nanoha had the power to turn the enemy as her own friend and fight with her to the end for the same cause. StrikerS made it clear that their goal was to destroy the plan of the unstable machines that's running amok and stifle his/her plan. She did not have enemies, she befriended nor did she have to help players, nor talk to them. Her goals were clear and straightforward. Build a strong, supportive, and trusting team, so that they do not have to rely on the very slow reaction of kanrikan.The artwork is great along with sound. But story was just barely decent and characters were mediocre at best. StrikerS is the beginning of a decline of my support for any future Nanoha series if they continue on this road. it's about building the perfect team called the StrikerS against the great scientist. Thus the focus of the story has been on Nanoha building the team, along with stories on all of the other characters instead of Nanoha. The authors should have called it Mahou Shoujo StrikerS. This anime was supposed to be Nanoha's stories and her contributions to the world, not the Team. I have to say, StrikerS has been a huge disappointment.Next, Nanoha had magic upgrades when raging heart was defeated. In StrikerS, Nanoha already had the powers; all they did was restrict her magic as she (and few others) were far too strong. This already made them out to be a supernatural monster who have enough powers to destroy anyone without training and fighting and challenge. Where's the growth without challenging other more difficult situation? You can't suddenly attain over limits as it has been in the first two series. It's absolutely inconsistent and story lost its quality completely.Finally, Nanoha had the power to turn the enemy as her own friend and fight with her to the end for the same cause.

The original series was something of a conventional Magical Girl vs. Dark Magical Girl show, like the Pretty Cure franchise, with the difference being that the battles between Nanoha and her opposite number, Fate, played out a lot like a superhero fight.The later series played up this concept, with the second series, Nanoha As setting up a battle of superhero teams (or superhero and super-anti-hero teams), with Nanoha, Fate, Arf, taking on a team of opponents with more-or-less similar abilities....The series also played down the school adventure side of the traditional magical girl story, with Nanoha’s school friends, who were very much a prominent part of the narrative for the first series, being pushed to the side very early.Nanoha StrikerS dumps the “civilian life” side of the equation entirely, with series protagonists Nanoha Takamachi & Fate Testarossa working as, basically, state-sponsored superheroes, and spending all of the series well away from Earth. Previous series had introduced the Time Space Administration Bureau (or TSAB), the bureaucracy behind it, and that the government that it answers to is based on a world called Mid-Childa. StrikerS spends almost the entirety of it’s runtime there.The premise of the series is that it’s set a little over 10 years after the events of Nanoha As, which would put Nanoha and Fate in their early-to-mid 20s. Nanoha and Fate have become part of a special unit as part of the TSAB, lead by Hayate, the befriended antagonist of As. The objective of the unit is to hunt down Lost Logia, lost pieces of magitech which can be incredibly dangerous in the wrong hands. As part of this unit, Nanoha, Fate, and the Wolkenritter (Hayate’s now-less-dark Magical Girl superteam from As), are also training another team of, for lack of a better term, Magical Superheroes.From a narrative position this setup puts the audience in an amazing position to see how the protagonists who we’ve followed through the last two series have matured, and it’s certainly successful at that. In particular, Fate and Nanoha have become the de-facto parental figures for two kids who are now part of their unit, Erio and Caro. While they were not actually adopted by Fate, they were adopted by Fate’s stepmother – Lindy, with Fate helping to raise them in a maternal/older sister role.This leads to Fate & Nanoha. The writing of the first two series loosely implied that the two were homosexual. StrikerS, on the other hand, strongly implies that the two are in relationship with as strong a subtext as you can get without actively crossing over into text – like, stronger than the handhold in Legend of Korra.The new protagonists, Erio, Caro, Subaru, and Teana, are generally well written, and have really strong chemistry. Erio and Caro, and Subaru and Teana have some romantic chemistry, which is read stronger for me with Subaru and Teana.The overall story of the series serves to bring back together some plot threads going back to the original series. Hayate’s team, Riot Force 6, ends up coming into conflict with a mad magical scientist named Jail Scaglietti, who has been engaging in genetic engineering to create artificial mages and cyborgs for combat. The research he’s working on is similar to that that was done by Fate’s birth mother, Precia, in her attempts to raise her deceased daughter, Alicia from the dead – work that lead to the creation of Fate. The level of conflict here is nice and personal, and gives the conflict a strong direct tie to our protagonists that makes up for the lack of any real civilian life our heroes have.That said, the animation doesn’t quite back up the story. This is a 2007 anime from studio Seven Arcs, who animated the earlier Nanoha series, along with the Triangle Heart OVA, and somehow, I can’t quite say why, but the animation here doesn’t feel quite right. The Digicel animation feels a little overly flat and stilted, particularly towards the end of the series. Now, it’s been awhile since I watched the first two shows, and maybe they’re just as bad, but with this series it feels like it stands out more, especially towards the end of the show.There are also some weird decisions with the animation that seem to make little sense. The show cuts around some early stages of some very emotionally significant fights later in the series, showing the aftermath of the action instead of the action. Now, when we hit the climaxes of those fights, we see the full conclusion, but with this particular fight, the early stage was really important, and it was really disappointed with the fact that we didn’t get a chance to see it.There are some issues with the costume design. The designs for the TSAB staff, and Riot Squad 6 are fine. However, there is Jail Scaglietti’s team of combat cyborgs, The Numbers. They wear these skin-tight outfits that leave as little to the imagination as the animation budget will allow, without actually showing skin. It’s the kind of outfit that 90s comics were mocked for putting female characters in, with boob socks and precisely defined butt-cheeks. The plugsuits in Evangelion didn’t go nearly as far in their form-fitting nature.I enjoyed the show enough to finish it, but it was the characters who kept me coming back for the rest of the show, and in particular the fact that I’d come to appreciate these characters and their stories through the last two series. If it wasn’t for the writing and the characters, I probably would have dropped the show due to my issues with the animation.That said, with how the show wraps up, considering the fourth series, Nanoha Vivid (focusing on a character that Fate and Nanoha adopt in this series), has not yet gotten a US release, StrikerS does make for a decent conclusion to the Nanoha series.

StrikerS marks the point of no return for the Nanoha franchise. What began as a more thoughtful take on the dark mahou shoujo genre has morphed into a mindless action mecha romp with minor mahou shoujo elements in it. It marked the turning point for when Nanoha would finally begin its downfall and fall from grace. StrikerS was still entertaining for different reasons though, and I'll go through them with you in the following review.By far the biggest change is the season's shift in focus to more base primordial emotions. What I mean is, where the...previous seasons focused more on emotions such as reflection, redemption, sacrifice, guilt, regret and sense of belonging, StrikerS instead focuses on anger, revengeance and impulse. While previous seasons featured more sympathetic villains (well it only really worked in A's), Dr Jail here is irredeemably evil and hammy. Not that that's a bad thing, (again see Symphogear), but it does mean this season lacks the nuance of say, when the Tome of the Night Sky chooses to have herself executed by firing squad so the people she loves will no longer get hurt. The tonal shift is jarring to say the least. This extends also to the action sequences, now more bombastic and higher in density than before. Where beam spam is ever present and the slow methodical battles of the past are no more. One crucial thing from the previous seasons (A's especially), was that the meaning behind each battle was given just as much prominence as the actual fighting going on. Wolkenritter fighting the gang in A's was more meaningful than whatever given conflict in this.Not to mention the pacing. Dear God the pacing. The first half is a slog. No meaningful character or plot development, just training sequences and bad SoL sequences. When S1 had the first half be traditional magical girl shenanigans, it did so to prove a point. Namely to accentuate the bait and switch genre shift midway through. It also helps that the filler content in S1 was at least somewhat entertaining.But when it gets going it really does get going. The second half of StrikerS is very much enjoyable. It's fun, frantic and Subaru's determination to fist makes you wanna yell and scream along with her. The new mains are pretty good. Despite hating them initially, Subara and Teana do complement the original duo (trio) well and their interactions with the cast and the world are nice to see. What isn't nice to see are Caro and Erio which can be easily removed from the plot with minimal impact and who do nothing but to frustrate you as they steal precious screentime from Nanoha and Fate. While Fate doesn't get any development or even much screentime in this, I do appreciate how they developed Nanoha as a character. The timegap meant that Nanoha can have her character branch out in a way that avoids standard sequel trappings where characterization is recycled. Instead Nanoha is going through parenthood and her struggles and journey of being a mother is genuinely nice to see. It's one of the few moments where it's closest to the first two seasons in tone and focus.  Vivio is indeed a welcome addition although I wished it didn't take them half the season just to even bring her into the main plot.I enjoyed StrikerS (half of it anyways) for very much the same reasons as I enjoyed Symphogear. Where the latter refined and tuned everything StrikerS had to a mirror sheen, StrikerS I find feels like a prototype Symphogear, or a spiritual predecessor. With very much a lot of concepts that Symphogear would later outright nick from, from fisting to screaming to impulsive decisions to a hammy mad scientist with funny faces.And sadly ever since Nanoha's time in the spotlight has shifted to Symphogear. This town ain't big enough for two mecha mahou shoujo franchises. Not ever since Nanoha became a housewife supporting character. Reflection and Detonation attempted to salvage it, but by then the creative staff had forgot what truly made Nanoha, well, Nanoha, and instead both films fell flat on delivery and execution. But that's another story for another day.StrikerS is still a fantastic show (half of it at least) that's balls to the wall fun. Just don't expect to feel any emotions beyond hype and excitement for most of it.6/10 previous seasons focused more on emotions such as reflection, redemption, sacrifice, guilt, regret and sense of belonging, StrikerS instead focuses on anger, revengeance and impulse.

Despite this series breaking conventional norms and being a full thirteen episodes longer than the two series prior, the plot had a lot of problems, and perhaps, the world building got a little bit too out-of-hand... after all, there are now over THIRTY reoccurring characters to keep up with, not to mention over TWENTY antagonists that are thrown in the fray! This is like the weirdly named extensive cast in U.C. Gundam\'s continuity, except if many of them weren\'t as colorfully designed and had...drab personalities!※This isn\'t explicitly stated in the script, but there is official art of them in wedding dresses together. Not to mention that they\'re living together intimately and are raising a daughter. How much more subtext do you need?⚠️ This review of Mahō Shōjo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS will contain light spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersThe first half of the series had me hyped: all of the old characters are ten years older and taking a group of younger characters under their wing, AND they\'re raising an orphaned child as their own! After Fate Testarossa\'s acquired adoration for conventional, little girl things, i.e. stuffed animals and dresses, after the end of her first arc — I kind of expected her to be the more traditional, stay-at-home mother figure; but, NANOHA actually ends up taking that position, while Fate is more work oriented! I mean, I guess it isn\'t like Nanoha is any less feminine than Fate, she just has the most broken power level and skill set in the universe!This installment has an atmosphere that screams what if the ""Muv-Luv"" militia had magic powers, instead of mech suits! Some of the skills that were used as final attacks in the first two seasons, like Nanoha\'s Starlight Breaker, are now used more conventionally, like instead of charging up to fire a huge laser beam at a bad guy, Nanoha will just use it to blast through walls. She could be a magical girl firefighter, with that level of practicality! Despite Hayate having god-like abilities in ""A\'s"", she seems to be more designated to the role of an office worker in this season.I thought the plot point with Vivio being a clone of ""Sankt Kaiser"" and being used as a vessel to activate the Saint\'s Cradle was kind of lame; it seemed like forced drama to have Fate and Nanoha become attached to her, and then have her kidnapped and used as a damsel. The inheritance of all of that power also seemed translucent with its attempt to make the all-powerful Nanoha and Fate\'s daughter have a way to somehow adopt a portion of their magnanimous abilities, despite not actually being related to them! Maybe, I\'ve just consumed too many other fictional stories, but I kind of rolled my eyes at that point, because it appeared to be thinly veiled, sequel bait.More than anything this series felt like an extended universe bookend, that was saying ""here\'s references to the previous series with the characters that you liked all grown up, now we\'ll dump a bajillion more girls and effeminate boys for you to fawn over in the up-coming sequels""! It reminds me of all of the Marvel crossovers! I get that this franchise is acting as an enterprise, by branching out and showing off how cool the world is, but can we just get one really good story with a few new characters? Not a gaggle of generic background characters, that each have their own individual backstory in the canon, I mean, even the 東方Project girls were released in a series of individual game installments!Luna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Keizō Kusakawa (director), notable works:* Action Heroine Cheer Fruits* Ahiru no Sora* Aho Girl* Akuma no Riddle ✅* Asura Cryin\' (series)* Campione!: Matsurowanu Kamigami to Kamigoroshi no Maō* Dog Days (Season One) ✅* Fūka ✅* Genei wo Kakeru Taiyō ✅* Happy Sugar Life ✅* Inukami! ✅* Inukami!

SS ✅* Rō-Kyū-Bu! Tomoka no Ichigo Sundae ✅* Sekirei* Sekirei: Pure EngagementCommentary: Mr. Kusakawa is less celebrated than he should be; the man can direct some very visually striking animation scenes — if you haven\'t watched the ""Kantai Collection"" film, I would suggest giving it a try, it is a gorgeous, hour-long slice of animation! I would say that his lack of popularity with English audiences is partially due to his focus on leading very niche projects, that are more popular with the ""moe otaku"" crowd, rather than appealing to your everyday, run-of-the-mill, anime-watching normie. The original GAME for ""Kantai Collection"" has never even received an international release, and I doubt that it would garner much of a following if it did, since ""Azur Lane"" has already wormed its way into the hearts of EN players! Despite being a very talented director, he doesn\'t normally land projects with highly-skilled animators or writers; that\'s the whole reason why ""Akuma no Riddle"" sunk! And he is typically designated to lower budget studios, but when he is granted a large sum of expendable income, like with the repackaged ""Mahō Shōjo Lyrical Nanoha"" films, his finesse really shows! Keizō Kusakawa is an incredible director, I would suggest ""Mahō Shōjo Lyrical Nanoha,"" ""Rō-Kyū-Bu!"", or ""Kantai Collection"" as an entry point into his shows (""Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?"" is pretty dang enjoyable, too)! The fight scenes are polished in the film and the emotional scenes brought me to tears, so kudos to Mr. Kusakawa and his animation team for the amazing amount of strife that they put into the project!Good Seiyū Work = ✅Really Enjoyed the Seiyū\'s Performance = ✅ ✅One of Luna\'s Favorite Performances OF ALL TIME = ✅ ✅ ✅Yukari Tamura as Nanoha Takamachi, notable roles:* Michiru, Air* Mine, Akame ga Kill  ✅* Mayu Watanabe CG-3, AKB0048  ✅ ✅* Remon Yamano, Ano Natsu de Matteru (""Waiting in the Summer"")  ✅ ✅* Asuha Tōhara, Astarotte no Omocha!* Chihaya Ikaruga, Asu no Yo\'ichi!

Ms. Mizuki is able to alter her glass masks between the abused, little girl to the fiercely, cold magic user in a matter of seconds; despite Fate\'s fractured persona, the performance came off as organic and natural, and nothing seemed forced. I would say that this was Ms. Mizuki\'s ""career-defining"" role, and the adulation and recognition that the character receives is well-deserved!

Schnaufer, Strike Witches: The Movie ✅✅* Kareha Suzuka, TOKKÔCommentary: Ms. Ueda is known for having a very youthful, yet mature presence. This is the character of Hayate Yagami in a nutshell, she is very naïve and pure because of her age, but her terminal illness has given her an emotional complexity that makes her wise beyond her years. I would compare her role is ""Nanoha A\'s"" to her roles as Fumika (""Shigofumi"") — I will avoid going into spoilers here, though this explaining the character of Fumika is difficult without stepping into a minefield of them, but put simply, she is a Shinigami that lost her mortal life at a young age and has seen a lot of things... there, I simplified it to the best of my ability, now go watch ""Shigofumi""! I would also compare her performance as Hayate Yagami to Neon Nostrade (""Hunter x Hunter""), if you know how brutal the world of Hunter x Hunter, you would know that a cute girl would simply not just exist within that realm, and Saki Miyanaga (the titular character of ""Saki""), she comes off as boyish and unsophisticated, but she\'s actually a mahjong genius!

Ms. Mizuhashi has a talent of making the child version of Vivio impossibly adorable, while the adult version can kick some major butt! I would compare her voice as child Vivio to her roles as Michiru Matsushima (""Grisaia no Kajitsu"") and Akane Suzumiya (""Kimi ga Nozumu Eien""), because they\'re more youthful-sounding, whereas Vivio\'s older self can be comparable to roles like Mami Tomoe (""Mahō Shōjo Madoka★Magica"") and Miyako (""Hidamari Sketch""). Great job with the character!※He\'s in all the other iterations, too, but he\'s more of a pivotal character in the first arc.Chiwa Saito as Subaru Nakajima, notable roles:* Konoha Inōe, ""Bungaku Shōjo""* Yona, Akatsuki no Yona ✅ ✅* Aika S.

Ms. Saito\'s voice in ""StrikerS"" is very spirited and tomboyish, I would compare her performance in this series to Tatenashi Sarashiki (""IS: Infinite Stratos"") and Francesca Lucchini (""Strike Witches""), both are energetic girls with masculine energy, though Tatenashi tends to be more on the promiscuous side! Great voice actress, to my surprise, I actually preferred Subaru over the other new protagonist, Teana, despite the fact that the MAI NAKAHARA plays her character!Mai Nakahara as Teana Lanster, notable roles:* Rena Kunisaki, .hack/Legend of the Twilight Bracelet ✅* Chitose Nanbu, Amaenaide yo!!, localized as ""Ah My Buddha""* Hatsune Otonashi, Angel Beats! ✅✅✅* Akagi, Azur Lane ✅✅✅* Felli Loss, Chrome Shelled Regios* Nagisa Furukawa, Clannad ✅✅* Chisa Yukizome, Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibōgamine Gakuen ✅✅✅* Thanast Useim Ruki Miu Sia Nostal Ren Naguregyug (""Miu""), DearS ✅* Haruka Niekawa, Durarara!! ✅* Juvia Lockser, Fairy Tail ✅✅* Reika Rikudō, Fate/Apocrypha ✅✅* Rena Ryūgū, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, localized as ""When They Cry"" ✅✅✅* Watashi, Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita, localized as ""Humanity Has Declined"" ✅* Karin Hanazono, Kamichama Karin ✅* Nanami Yasuri, Katanagatari ✅* Mai Tokiha, Mai-HiME ✅* Yui Takamura, Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse ✅✅✅* Anna Aoi, Chōjūshin Gravion* Aono Morimiya, Sola ✅✅✅* Nagisa Aoi, Strawberry Panic ✅✅* Morgan, Tears to Tiara ✅* Reimu Hakurei, 東方 Niji Sōsaku Dōjin Anime: Musō Kakyō ✅✅✅* Morgan, Tears to Tiara ✅* Yashirō Shimogamo, Uchōten Kazoku, localized as ""The Eccentric Family"" ✅✅✅* Yuzuha, Utawarerumono ✅✅✅Commentary: The feminine sharp-shooter, as Ms. Nakahara is with all of her other great roles, she delivers with Teana Lanster! I would compare her role as the more pragmatic and thoughtful of the two girls in the buddy cop duo, to Reimu Hakurei (""東方Project""), Reimu is honest and pragmatic to the point of being seen as a jerk, and Yui Takamura (""Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse""), the First Lieutenant in Japan\'s Imperial Royal Guard that also descends from a distinguished, samurai family... meaning that she\'s a hard cookie to crack!

(""My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU"") ✅ ✅* Shigeru Kanmuri, Yakitate!! JapanCommentary: Ms. Inōe usually plays beautiful, young women but, in ""StrikerS"", she plays a little boy! The only other little boy role that I can recall seeing her in, is when she voices Armin Arlert in ""Shingeki no Kyōjin"", and I would say that the inflection that she uses with the two is quite similar, since they are effeminate and can be feisty, when they get angered. Incredible work!Conclusively, the main problem with ""StrikerS"" is that it was too ambitious and didn\'t have a linear direction. I usually don\'t mind stories like this terribly much, after all I\'m a fan of franchises like 東方Project and Kantai Collection, I like shows with a lot of characters, but each character has to have a memorable arc and a time to shine; you can\'t just garbage pile THAT many character onto us and expect us to care about ANY of them. Apart from the returning cast members, the only people that I actually did have an investment in is a) the original cast and b) Subaru and Teana — the other characters just gravitated around them, like trash orbiting around a planet! I give ""Mahō Shōjo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS"" a 4/10, I enjoyed parts of it, but it was too overzealous and tried to do too much, instead of sticking to a core component of a single narrative!Rating: ★★☆☆☆ drab personalities!※This isn\'t explicitly stated in the script, but there is official art of them in wedding dresses together. Not to mention that they\'re living together intimately and are raising a daughter. How much more subtext do you need?⚠️ This review of Mahō Shōjo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS will contain light spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersThe first half of the series had me hyped: all of the old characters are ten years older and taking a group of younger characters under their wing, AND they\'re raising an orphaned child as their own! After Fate Testarossa\'s acquired adoration for conventional, little girl things, i.e. stuffed animals and dresses, after the end of her first arc — I kind of expected her to be the more traditional, stay-at-home mother figure; but, NANOHA actually ends up taking that position, while Fate is more work oriented! I mean, I guess it isn\'t like Nanoha is any less feminine than Fate, she just has the most broken power level and skill set in the universe!This installment has an atmosphere that screams what if the ""Muv-Luv"" militia had magic powers, instead of mech suits! Some of the skills that were used as final attacks in the first two seasons, like Nanoha\'s Starlight Breaker, are now used more conventionally, like instead of charging up to fire a huge laser beam at a bad guy, Nanoha will just use it to blast through walls. She could be a magical girl firefighter, with that level of practicality! Despite Hayate having god-like abilities in ""A\'s"", she seems to be more designated to the role of an office worker in this season.I thought the plot point with Vivio being a clone of ""Sankt Kaiser"" and being used as a vessel to activate the Saint\'s Cradle was kind of lame; it seemed like forced drama to have Fate and Nanoha become attached to her, and then have her kidnapped and used as a damsel. The inheritance of all of that power also seemed translucent with its attempt to make the all-powerful Nanoha and Fate\'s daughter have a way to somehow adopt a portion of their magnanimous abilities, despite not actually being related to them! Maybe, I\'ve just consumed too many other fictional stories, but I kind of rolled my eyes at that point, because it appeared to be thinly veiled, sequel bait.More than anything this series felt like an extended universe bookend, that was saying ""here\'s references to the previous series with the characters that you liked all grown up, now we\'ll dump a bajillion more girls and effeminate boys for you to fawn over in the up-coming sequels""! It reminds me of all of the Marvel crossovers! I get that this franchise is acting as an enterprise, by branching out and showing off how cool the world is, but can we just get one really good story with a few new characters? Not a gaggle of generic background characters, that each have their own individual backstory in the canon, I mean, even the 東方Project girls were released in a series of individual game installments!Luna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Keizō Kusakawa (director), notable works:* Action Heroine Cheer Fruits* Ahiru no Sora* Aho Girl* Akuma no Riddle ✅* Asura Cryin\' (series)* Campione!: Matsurowanu Kamigami to Kamigoroshi no Maō* Dog Days (Season One) ✅* Fūka ✅* Genei wo Kakeru Taiyō ✅* Happy Sugar Life ✅* Inukami! ✅* Inukami!

SS ✅* Rō-Kyū-Bu! Tomoka no Ichigo Sundae ✅* Sekirei* Sekirei: Pure EngagementCommentary: Mr. Kusakawa is less celebrated than he should be; the man can direct some very visually striking animation scenes — if you haven\'t watched the ""Kantai Collection"" film, I would suggest giving it a try, it is a gorgeous, hour-long slice of animation! I would say that his lack of popularity with English audiences is partially due to his focus on leading very niche projects, that are more popular with the ""moe otaku"" crowd, rather than appealing to your everyday, run-of-the-mill, anime-watching normie. The original GAME for ""Kantai Collection"" has never even received an international release, and I doubt that it would garner much of a following if it did, since ""Azur Lane"" has already wormed its way into the hearts of EN players! Despite being a very talented director, he doesn\'t normally land projects with highly-skilled animators or writers; that\'s the whole reason why ""Akuma no Riddle"" sunk! And he is typically designated to lower budget studios, but when he is granted a large sum of expendable income, like with the repackaged ""Mahō Shōjo Lyrical Nanoha"" films, his finesse really shows! Keizō Kusakawa is an incredible director, I would suggest ""Mahō Shōjo Lyrical Nanoha,"" ""Rō-Kyū-Bu!"", or ""Kantai Collection"" as an entry point into his shows (""Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo?"" is pretty dang enjoyable, too)! The fight scenes are polished in the film and the emotional scenes brought me to tears, so kudos to Mr. Kusakawa and his animation team for the amazing amount of strife that they put into the project!Good Seiyū Work = ✅Really Enjoyed the Seiyū\'s Performance = ✅ ✅One of Luna\'s Favorite Performances OF ALL TIME = ✅ ✅ ✅Yukari Tamura as Nanoha Takamachi, notable roles:* Michiru, Air* Mine, Akame ga Kill  ✅* Mayu Watanabe CG-3, AKB0048  ✅ ✅* Remon Yamano, Ano Natsu de Matteru (""Waiting in the Summer"")  ✅ ✅* Asuha Tōhara, Astarotte no Omocha!* Chihaya Ikaruga, Asu no Yo\'ichi!

Their collection performances (in the first two series particularly), are just that monumental! I would compare Ms. Tamura\'s role in ""Lyrical Nanoha"" to her roles as Michiru Munakata (""Uta-Kata"") and Io Euclase (""Granblue Fantasy the Animation""), though Ms. Tamura is one of the most versatile voice actresses, when it comes to the variety of characters that she\'s voiced over the years!

Ms. Mizuki is able to alter her glass masks between the abused, little girl to the fiercely, cold magic user in a matter of seconds; despite Fate\'s fractured persona, the performance came off as organic and natural, and nothing seemed forced. I would say that this was Ms. Mizuki\'s ""career-defining"" role, and the adulation and recognition that the character receives is well-deserved!

Schnaufer, Strike Witches: The Movie ✅✅* Kareha Suzuka, TOKKÔCommentary: Ms. Ueda is known for having a very youthful, yet mature presence. This is the character of Hayate Yagami in a nutshell, she is very naïve and pure because of her age, but her terminal illness has given her an emotional complexity that makes her wise beyond her years. I would compare her role is ""Nanoha A\'s"" to her roles as Fumika (""Shigofumi"") — I will avoid going into spoilers here, though this explaining the character of Fumika is difficult without stepping into a minefield of them, but put simply, she is a Shinigami that lost her mortal life at a young age and has seen a lot of things... there, I simplified it to the best of my ability, now go watch ""Shigofumi""! I would also compare her performance as Hayate Yagami to Neon Nostrade (""Hunter x Hunter""), if you know how brutal the world of Hunter x Hunter, you would know that a cute girl would simply not just exist within that realm, and Saki Miyanaga (the titular character of ""Saki""), she comes off as boyish and unsophisticated, but she\'s actually a mahjong genius!

Ms. Mizuhashi has a talent of making the child version of Vivio impossibly adorable, while the adult version can kick some major butt! I would compare her voice as child Vivio to her roles as Michiru Matsushima (""Grisaia no Kajitsu"") and Akane Suzumiya (""Kimi ga Nozumu Eien""), because they\'re more youthful-sounding, whereas Vivio\'s older self can be comparable to roles like Mami Tomoe (""Mahō Shōjo Madoka★Magica"") and Miyako (""Hidamari Sketch""). Great job with the character!※He\'s in all the other iterations, too, but he\'s more of a pivotal character in the first arc.Chiwa Saito as Subaru Nakajima, notable roles:* Konoha Inōe, ""Bungaku Shōjo""* Yona, Akatsuki no Yona ✅ ✅* Aika S.

Ms. Saito\'s voice in ""StrikerS"" is very spirited and tomboyish, I would compare her performance in this series to Tatenashi Sarashiki (""IS: Infinite Stratos"") and Francesca Lucchini (""Strike Witches""), both are energetic girls with masculine energy, though Tatenashi tends to be more on the promiscuous side! Great voice actress, to my surprise, I actually preferred Subaru over the other new protagonist, Teana, despite the fact that the MAI NAKAHARA plays her character!Mai Nakahara as Teana Lanster, notable roles:* Rena Kunisaki, .hack/Legend of the Twilight Bracelet ✅* Chitose Nanbu, Amaenaide yo!!, localized as ""Ah My Buddha""* Hatsune Otonashi, Angel Beats! ✅✅✅* Akagi, Azur Lane ✅✅✅* Felli Loss, Chrome Shelled Regios* Nagisa Furukawa, Clannad ✅✅* Chisa Yukizome, Danganronpa 3: The End of Kibōgamine Gakuen ✅✅✅* Thanast Useim Ruki Miu Sia Nostal Ren Naguregyug (""Miu""), DearS ✅* Haruka Niekawa, Durarara!! ✅* Juvia Lockser, Fairy Tail ✅✅* Reika Rikudō, Fate/Apocrypha ✅✅* Rena Ryūgū, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, localized as ""When They Cry"" ✅✅✅* Watashi, Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita, localized as ""Humanity Has Declined"" ✅* Karin Hanazono, Kamichama Karin ✅* Nanami Yasuri, Katanagatari ✅* Mai Tokiha, Mai-HiME ✅* Yui Takamura, Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse ✅✅✅* Anna Aoi, Chōjūshin Gravion* Aono Morimiya, Sola ✅✅✅* Nagisa Aoi, Strawberry Panic ✅✅* Morgan, Tears to Tiara ✅* Reimu Hakurei, 東方 Niji Sōsaku Dōjin Anime: Musō Kakyō ✅✅✅* Morgan, Tears to Tiara ✅* Yashirō Shimogamo, Uchōten Kazoku, localized as ""The Eccentric Family"" ✅✅✅* Yuzuha, Utawarerumono ✅✅✅Commentary: The feminine sharp-shooter, as Ms. Nakahara is with all of her other great roles, she delivers with Teana Lanster!

(""My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU"") ✅ ✅* Shigeru Kanmuri, Yakitate!! JapanCommentary: Ms. Inōe usually plays beautiful, young women but, in ""StrikerS"", she plays a little boy! The only other little boy role that I can recall seeing her in, is when she voices Armin Arlert in ""Shingeki no Kyōjin"", and I would say that the inflection that she uses with the two is quite similar, since they are effeminate and can be feisty, when they get angered. Incredible work!Conclusively, the main problem with ""StrikerS"" is that it was too ambitious and didn\'t have a linear direction. I usually don\'t mind stories like this terribly much, after all I\'m a fan of franchises like 東方Project and Kantai Collection, I like shows with a lot of characters, but each character has to have a memorable arc and a time to shine; you can\'t just garbage pile THAT many character onto us and expect us to care about ANY of them. Apart from the returning cast members, the only people that I actually did have an investment in is a) the original cast and b) Subaru and Teana — the other characters just gravitated around them, like trash orbiting around a planet! I give ""Mahō Shōjo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS"" a 4/10, I enjoyed parts of it, but it was too overzealous and tried to do too much, instead of sticking to a core component of a single narrative!Rating: ★★☆☆☆', 'First things first. My ""reviews"" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.------✦StoryWhy? First season was okay, second I liked and now with 3rd season they somehow managed to take everything from Nanoha I liked and make it into such a boring piece of work. Probably biggest dislike regarding this season would be military detailed progression and terminology. Aside personal reasons why I dislike military, it was nevertheless boring. For be it was pure annoyance and boredom. It had few good points, as some new ""factions"" and characters who showed up had somewhat interesting background to them, but the...whole ""realism"" military detailed thingy just was absolute horrifying annoyance for me. I just wanted magical girls doing magical fights, not somewhat magical girls being army drilled.. Anyhow should comment, that I don\'t mind military in piece of fiction usually, as long it\'s in general presentation / surface-scratched / simple whatever. Basically guys in organization and battle. That\'s all I need, maybe little bit of detail for enjoyment factor, but I do despise such in-depth detailed progression and terminology that this Anime used.TLDR; ""Realism"" military presentation method was absolute turn-off for me. Aside that story was okay.✦Art&SoundNothing to say, simple and derpy at times. Main cast ""grown-up"" some of characters felt a bit stretched rather than re-drawn.Music&OST still good.✦CharacterMost were boring, old cast was as they were, only now they were a bit plainer and ruined with military\'esque style. Few characters I did enjoy, but in the end it cast was quite average.✦Enjoyment&OverallIf there wouldn\'t been this annoying ""realistic military & terminology"" then it would been absolutely different and enjoyable Anime. Magical girls drifted away here and wasn\'t really an enjoyable season. Might have finished it instead of dropping, but yeah thing I disliked the most, annoyed me a bit too much. Haven\'t been fond of more detailed realistic military Anime for ages, but since of certain events, now I dislike it personally even more. Point being, aside annoyance element, it was still quite mediocre Anime. whole ""realism"" military detailed thingy just was absolute horrifying annoyance for me.

I feel like some characters acted abit out of character I do understand this takes place 10yrs after I believe but I think strikers had more potential to be better, also I'm not saying its bad its just coming from season 1 and 2 and what I'm used to and how season 2 was I kinda feel it was abit more intense the way the story was done and more enjoyable, strikers is okay for me and well I still love the series very very much but I feel like strikers was mediocre or perhaps above mediocre well it was alrightThere are many other things that bother me about Strikers but I dont wanna elaborate too much but season 3 overall the writting of the story was not that goodcouldve been better since many of the characters have alot of potential honeslty  I kinda wish they would remaster as in remake strikers really but that would ruin the contiuity since then you have season 4 lyracal nanoha Vivid, or at least fixed the writting keep the story but fix like how the characters were somethings like how they mentioned hayate being removed form TSAB and the character development honeslty as well as the battles thinking about it that I think itd be abit more enjoyable and keeping the concept of season 3 but yeeeee like in battle I feel like that character had more potential I guess especially since she was abit in a duo with subaru and their always together we see in the first episode they work together I also feel like Tian had Daggers after in the end she could use them in a really cool way also since she has 2 guns, I just dont feel like there was much character development and all I feel like more couldve been done with the battle scenes since they have so much potential that kinda bothered me I felt like it couldve been better.As well as the story it self there are things that I didn't fully understand like how Hayate would get  removed from the TSAB because of the book of darkness incident, which  I find somewhat stupid since in season 2 the guardians from the book of darkness were taken to court and it went well everything was justified in the end so she was clear and she was a child, so I found that when they added that to season 3 it bothered me really which made me not like the show as much, as well as there is also the issue about  them talking about pushing their magical abilities  that could potentially hurt them because of the cartridge load system which I'm glad they explained why it was dangerous, but when they showed parts of season 2 showing nanoha fighting, saying how much nanoha pushed herself i suppose that yes she did and she was a child but she was doing her best to fight also back season 2 they didnt rlly care they new nanoha was very strong and it never really was an issue, but the way they showed it towards Tiana Lanster because she was putting herself down I kinda feel like it was wrong and wasnt the way they should have tackled the issue of Tiana putting herself down because she just as good I dont have the right words to explain but what  I'm getting at is that I feel like lyrical nanoha strikers could've been better in terms of character development and how something happened and I feel like the characters couldve been better portrayed as well as the battles.

It's a cheap and easy way to do lots of character development and not have to the leg work of actually showing it. Avengers Endgame did it and it made the most money of any movie ever so it must make for good storytelling, right?Honestly, though, I think this is the best entry in the series so far. There was a lot of boring stuff to slog through still but the ending had a strong emotional core thanks to the introduction of one character: Vivio. I think without the addition of a cute, young anime girl you immediately want...to protect there wouldn't have been nearly as much investment in the villains boring generic evil plan.I think there's no measure of how effective a villain is greater than how good it makes you feel to see them get brutally murdered. When the smug glasses girl gets blasted through the whole ship by Nanoha's biggest energy attack and she's actually freaking out and has that look of dread on her face I almost actually did a guts pose air fist bump of happiness. She was the worst.Nanoha and Fate being lesbian moms together is an interesting direction to take the show. Sorry ferret boy, you had your chance. I didn't really like how many characters the show tries to introduce and make you care about, ensemble casts are hard to make work well when you have limited time to spend with them. You have to introduce them sparingly a few at a time or the audience won't have time to really care about who they are because you're throwing like 20 new characters at them all at once. There were just a lot of people to keep track of and my attention span is so short I kept having to go back and watch sections of episodes multiple times because I missed some line of exposition or something.Anyway overall it was good enough for an 8/10 magical girls. to protect there wouldn't have been nearly as much investment in the villains boring generic evil plan.I think there's no measure of how effective a villain is greater than how good it makes you feel to see them get brutally murdered.

You have to introduce them sparingly a few at a time or the audience won't have time to really care about who they are because you're throwing like 20 new characters at them all at once. There were just a lot of people to keep track of and my attention span is so short I kept having to go back and watch sections of episodes multiple times because I missed some line of exposition or something.Anyway overall it was good enough for an 8/10 magical girls."", 'Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS is one of few series (or at least, seasons) that can put me at a complete loss for words. Before I start, I\'d like to clarify to anyone unclear that while the previous two seasons were magical girl seasons, the third (and potentially onward) deviate from this so severely that it\'s almost a complete tonal change, which may detract from the experience, depending on your enjoyment or reason to be invested in this. However, there are severe changes to the formula and many other factors as well.The first major change is that Nanoha (as well as Fate and Hayate) are no longer...the main characters of the series, as they were in previous versions. Despite the series still being named after them, the focus is shifted onto four new characters: best friends/lovers Subaru and Teana, and child summoner Caro Ru and Erio. All of these characters are very much hit-or-miss: in my opinion, you will either hate or love these new characters depending on whether you view these as good or bad. Unfortunately, in my opinion, Subaru and Tea are two of the most unappealing main characters in the series. This isn\'t even to say they\'re bad characters, I just don\'t feel that they\'re worthy of main character status. Subaru seems to be a rather generic main character, as she embraces the ""clumsy yet heroic"" archetype many other protagonists use, while not retaining any of the charm. While she does have an appealing backstory, she falls short from being ideal. Tea is a similar story, though Tea\'s character devolves from a sniper into more of a simple straight man to keep Subaru in check.The first major issue with the series is its change of pace and setting. The series subtly changes setting to Mid-Childa from Earth with not a very clear explanation and adopts a military theme with a new plot. This wouldn\'t be too bad, although the plot with the enemies is heavily confusing and frankly crowded. There are approximately a minimum of 10 new characters all wanting screentime, and none of them get enough focus to be made worthwhile. As an example, the main villain, Jail Scaglietti, has twelve underlings, in addition to the aforementioned four new main characters, Nanoha, Fate, Hayate, and a whole slew of new characters. Surprisingly enough, old characters more often than not don\'t return; even main characters formerly (such as Lindy, Chrono, and even Yuuno) all have their screentime slashed significantly, barely appearing beyond an episode or two. Even then, all of them take very minor roles in the grand scheme.The plot is also heavily confusing. One of the main issues is that for the majority of the series, episodes are separated into a ""filler"" episode (where everyone trains) and an ""action"" episode, where the actual fighting occurs. This breaks up the plot and makes following important events even more difficult. The series is also frankly caught up in a heavy political context and tries to make ongoing commentary and usage of its political and military setting. Politics, however, can be somewhat controversial to feature in a show, and this one doesn\'t really use it all that well, even.This is a very mixed review, as the series does have some positive themes and elements despite all this. However, several factors let it down: the plot is overly cryptic and doesn\'t explain what it should explain in a timely manner, and several characters are missing significant development (or any at all in some cases, beyond a one-note trait; examples include Carim, whose only role in the plot is to have clairvoyance to foreshadow a later event). Regrettably, even if you enjoyed the previous seasons, I can\'t recommend this one; the flaws are too overwhelming for it to be an enjoyable casual watch. 3/10. the main characters of the series, as they were in previous versions.

Well, I have to say, it's a season that certainly packs a punch. If I were to rate it, I would give it a solid 8 out of 10. The series takes us on a new adventure with Nanoha and her friends as they join the Time-Space Administration Bureau and face new challenges. The character development is top-notch, and we get to see our beloved characters grow and evolve even further. The action sequences are intense and visually stunning, keeping you on the edge of your seat. However, there were moments where the pacing felt a bit slow, and...some plot points could have been explored more deeply. Nonetheless, Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS is a worthy continuation of the series that fans will enjoy, with its mix of thrilling battles, heartfelt moments, and strong themes of friendship and determination.The main protagonist is Nanoha Takamachi who becomes involved in a battle against evil forces after discovering she possesses powerful magic abilities. She teams up with other girls who also possess these powers and together they fight against those who wish to cause destruction and chaos throughout the world. I like it! It's very well written, and the characters are real. Because it feels genuine and relatable. The characters are flawed yet endearing, and their struggles are ones many viewers can relate to. Plus, the storyline itself is engaging and keeps you hooked from start to finish.Oh, Nanoha, Fate, and Hayate! They are such amazing characters in Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS. Nanoha continues to be the determined and compassionate magical girl we know and love, always fighting for what's right. Fate, on the other hand, undergoes tremendous growth as she navigates her complex past and finds her place in the world. And Hayate, well, she's a force to be reckoned with as the commander of the Wolkenritter and a strong leader. Their individual storylines and interactions bring depth and emotion to the series. I found myself rooting for them every step of the way, feeling their triumphs and struggles as if they were my own friends. It's truly a testament to the excellent character development in Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS. Yes, some of them definitely change over time. But I don't necessarily see this as a negative thing since everyone grows and changes as they go through different experiences. For example, Nanoha goes from being shy and timid to becoming more assertive and brave. This shows just how far she comes along during the course of the series.Wow, I am impressed by how everything turned out in the end. It was quite satisfying seeing our heroines finally achieve victory over their enemies once and for all. While there may be sadness due to certain losses, there is also joy knowing that justice has prevailed. All in all, it was a fantastic ending to a wonderful series. some plot points could have been explored more deeply.
