Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6064/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni_Kai_Specials,"[""Well it doesnt look like there's any reviews here so ill just make one then.Watch these After you finish watching Kai. These specials are mostly 20-40 seconds long so you cant really expect much. They are mainly short clips of either a scene in the anime or just something totally random, and they all have some kinda joke to them. I couldn't get all of them since there were no subs but that's pretty much the main idea. Not exactly worth seeing even if you're a Higurashi fan but if you really want to then sure. "", ""Unless you have watched Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai, you shouldn't watch these.Story: It's basically just abunch of mini stories that are only afew seconds each.Art: I love the style of the art, so I gave it a 10.Sound: It was okay. The voice actors are the same, which is good. But the ending theme was just a sound effect.Characters: The same as the Higurashi characters, so pretty cool....Enjoyment and overall: I guess it was okay. Watch it if your bored, it takes alittle less then 24 minutes to watch *I think*.THANKS FOR READING! :D Enjoyment and overall: I guess it was okay. Watch it if your bored, it takes alittle less then 24 minutes to watch *I think*.THANKS FOR READING! :D"", 'This is only 20-50 seconds of parodied scenes in Higurashi.. Some from first season, some from second season..A bit spoiler for you..Story : Some are fanservice,some are just short scene with different conversation in the real series,some are something like behind-the-scene scene,some are scene-that-not-exist-in-TV scene,and some are scene that maybe hard to understand, even you already watch all episodes of Higurashi.....It\'s funny if you already watch Higurashi, but maybe NOT funny if you hadn\'t watch the series before..Art : Not too bad, but not too good either..Sound : Nothing special.. Really..Character : Some scene will expose the ""hidden"" feeling of some character..

It's basically Higurashi's outtakes and silly ideas on full display.It consists of 24 episodes lasting from 20 seconds to 1 minute per episode.It's not that long, and it will take roughly 12 to 20 minutes to watch it all.The best part is that it's surprisingly pretty funny sometimes, especially if you understand Japanese humour well.Additionally, you can tell the animators had fun creating this, and...I enjoyed watching it; you probably will too.One last thing before we end this review. Make sure you've seen Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai before watching this, or the jokes won't make any sense.7.5/10 for the funnies I enjoyed watching it; you probably will too.One last thing before we end this review.

Overall, not much to say. These short specials range from 20 to 40 seconds long and don't really offer anything in terms of value except for the jokes, gags and punchlines. Think of these as bloopers if you will. Unless you're a big Higurashi fan (like me) and want to get the most of what you can get out of this franchise or you're a completionist, I really don't see any reason as to why you'd want to or feel the need to watch these shorts. They're hardly memorable and some jokes didn't really land...for me personally. But hey, it's more Higurashi, and you're not losing too much of your time by watching this anyway. Don't expect too much out of this. The quality of the visuals and audio is the same as the main series with the same characters. It's alright. 6/10. I can't really rate this objectively so this entire review is mostly subjective. for me personally. But hey, it's more Higurashi, and you're not losing too much of your time by watching this anyway.

They're okay enough, though if they're mean't to be funny, they really didn't make me laugh (except maybe the Banana one with Akasaka and Irie, but that sort of just a chuckle for me.There's not really much to say about these, they're just real short little clips of the show. Animation looks fine, sound is fine, there really isn't any music for these, and there's only small little stories for each of these.If you're a hardcore enough fan of Higurashi, then I guess you can find a little more value in...these (it doesn't really help that I found out about these a bit after I watched Kai, so maybe I didn't get some of the jokes that I could've gotten if I DID watch it right after, but whatever, it wasn't THAT long ago anyways.)These are just...eh, Higurashi 'Funny Moments' and nothing more. these (it doesn't really help that I found out about these a bit after I watched Kai, so maybe I didn't get some of the jokes that I could've gotten if I DID watch it right after, but whatever, it wasn't THAT long ago anyways.)These are just...eh, Higurashi 'Funny Moments' and nothing more.""]"
Galaxy Angel Z,https://myanimelist.net/anime/652/Galaxy_Angel_Z,"['I was surprised no one had ever written a review on this series and that it is not more popular than it is.  Galaxy Angel Z is the sequel to the original and contains the same likable cast detailing their insane adventures.  This show is pure comedy, totally random, and quite silly. Yep I loved it.Story? We don’t need no stinking story!  There is none, I mean no plot at all besides the basic premise which is their role in the Angel Brigade in search of Lost Technology.  This is such an important part of the story that most episodes rarely...even mention it.  It doesn’t matter a bit.  The episodes are just insane and random, so much so that they feel fresh and original.  The episodes are pretty much totally independent of each other too and you could basically watch them in an order you wished.  So if you’re looking for story this isn’t your show.  Its comedy and it does that very well.The Angels are great characters.  There isn’t any character development but the show does a great job of defining their personalities and using it for the comedic elements.  Another thing in this shows favor is the limited number of characters.  Basically the entire cast is the Angels, Volcott, and Normad.  This is a good thing because the episodes are short (12 min) and it lets us get to know the characters through the humor.  The angels are not particularly unique but they are just so well done that you got to love them.  Milfeulle is the ditsy klutz, Forte the butch gun toter, Ranpha the sporty beauty, Mint the loli cosplayer, and Vanilla, well the perfect vanilla bland emotionless robotic type. The cast fits together perfectly and there is just a good chemistry.  Forte and Ranpha are probably my favorites and they are really the most over the top characters in the show.For an older show I find that the art really is strong.  The colors are very bright, cheery and vibrant and I think reflect the tone of the show nicely.  The music really stands out too as both the OP and EN songs are so silly and cute that they match perfectly.  Voice acting is strong as well and I felt all the voices fit their characters perfectly.Overall this is a very good show.  I don’t have too many negative things to say about it but I don’t give it a top score either.  It’s so insane that sometimes you get lost and don’t know what’s going on.  Perhaps some of it is a culture difference.  Though anyone who likes wacky comedy should watch this show.  It probably won’t appeal to everyone, but this is a nice sweet innocent show that relies on genuine humor without using echii to make it funny. even mention it.  It doesn’t matter a bit.

Fantastic episodes that are broken down into 10-13 minute shorts. We're given a lot of great comedy again, making Season 2 an absolute must watch, but Galaxy Angel Z takes a turn and introduces some very real tense moments. The episode with Forte and the Silent Soldier was down right not a comedy; introducing dark, scary, tense and entirely different emotions from what we normally get in a Galaxy Angel episode. The stark difference works really well too, as the episodes that go in the opposite direction from the standard Galaxy Angel...setup seem to act like backstory and of a more serious intent.The story is once again, for the most part, non-existent, though it makes Galaxy Angel focus on the harder things like character interaction and actually being funny, something that Galaxy Angel does really well.Sound and music design is very 90's, with a lot of sounds that seem to come from many different shows. It doesn't hurt Galaxy Angel, but it's not exactly the best either. Ambient sounds are good though, as are the sounds of guns and other things. Opening and ED are really nice to listen to once again.The girls are still really cute and with Galaxy Angel Z, we see more depth and information about them than ever before. Mint and Milfuelle continue to be super adorable and mega cute, my favorites!! ~ setup seem to act like backstory and of a more serious intent.The story is once again, for the most part, non-existent, though it makes Galaxy Angel focus on the harder things like character interaction and actually being funny, something that Galaxy Angel does really well.Sound and music design is very 90's, with a lot of sounds that seem to come from many different shows.

Mint and Milfuelle continue to be super adorable and mega cute, my favorites!! ~"", ""I've talked about Broccoli Entertainment's Galaxy Angel series before. A long, long time ago. Seriously, it was a very early review and it was a great series. Like Broccoli's other franchise I've reviewed, Di Gi Charat the anime was handled by Madhouse. Does this one live up to its predecessor? Let's look and see.Story:Like the first series, this one has no real story. Each episode puts the Angel unit in a different bizarre situation, a lot of which use the lost technology to drive the shenanigans and some of which just rely on putting the characters into a situation and letting them be delightfully quirky.The...big issue with the series, like the first instalment, is that it has an inexplicably serious episode. Yeah, there's an episode about Forte having a traumatic experience on the battlefield and her old enemy returns and she has to face her fears and go against it and the episode has, in total, one joke and it's not a particularly funny one because it's taking itself far too seriously. This is an anime that parodies game shows and sentai series, has an episode with the characters switching bodies and does a bunch of other crazy shit. A largely serious episode doesn't fit. The gags in the Volcott reunion episode are kind of weak too. They're pretty much built around seeing him bossed around by crones. But at least s has some.Those halves aside, the comedy in this is is spectacular. It's built on high energy, zany absurdity that's excellently executed, with only those aforementioned exceptions that only make up... 12% of the series.Characters:This isn't a complex group of characters. They're built on their quirks and on having very strong comedic interactions. Which, to be fair, is a perfectly acceptable route to go down in a comedy. And the characters are designed in such a way that you can put any of them in a scene together and get something funny out of it. You don't need any specific permutations. It's hard to even say whether some work better than others. So, the comedic chemistry is pretty spot on.Art:I'll give Madhouse credit on the artwork front again. They have some excellent backgrounds, strong object designs and really good visual gags. The extended chase scene with Vanilla being a good example of that. If there's anything worth being critical about, it's that the comedic art style shifts might be considered excessive for some people. But they also suit the comedy type, so I can't say I had any real issue with them.Sound:Tamura Yukari, Yamaguchi Mayumi, Sawashiro Miyuki, Kanai Mika & Shintani Ryuouko get to show off their acting chops a bit more in this series. Yes, they were good in the last one too and all my praise about the surprising levels of nuance still holds true. But the body changing episode has the group of them swap mannerisms and basically imitate the speaking styles of the other characters, which they do fabulously. We can thanks Itou Masumi for the soundtrack. She also worked on music for Phantom & Shigofumi. And I'll give her full credit, she is excellent at composing music that suits the atmosphere of a series. I quite like the theme tunes as well.Ho-yay:Again, there's a bit. There are points where Ranpha seems to lose her general boy crazy mentality and be more into the other members of the Angel unit. But there's not a lot of that.Final Thoughts:Galaxy Angel 2 is a bit of an improvement over the first series. It certainly suffers from some of the same problems, but its high points are better. If you like that variety of off the wall crazy comedy, I'd highly recommend it. If you like your comedy to be more subdued, dry, raunchy or referential it's probably not for you. For myself, I really loved it. I had a god time watching it and was very entertained. As such, I give it a 9/10. Next week I'll look at Melty Lancer. big issue with the series, like the first instalment, is that it has an inexplicably serious episode.

However... the show has improved, and contains some very well written non-comedic episodes. Music has also improved and is less annoying. Characters are mostly the same.Overall (if you haven\'t watched the first season for some reason). This is mostly a ""silly fun"" kind of anime that talks about some sort of all-girl special force that is supposed to be doing... something? Finding lost technology? Fighitng crime? Protecting justice? I\'m not entirely sure. But instead they usually end up in some sort...of messy or silly situation instead.Detailed breakdown below:Story: 6/10The story has improved compared to the first season. While first season mostly had a story that didn\'t really standa out in any aspect, this season features several episodes with a serious or mysterious atmosphere, which are surprisingly well written. There aren\'t a lot of those episodes - 3 or 4 of them total, but they\'re memorable. The rest follows the same pattern, like the first episode - girls dealing with some situation they\'ve gotten into. There are more references to toher anime as well.The story is episodic, and doesn\'t really have an overarching storyline. I think the episodes could\'ve been watched in any order without any negative consequences.Art: 5/10:Same art as the first season. It looks relatively low budget, and does not really have a lot of details going on. It is not as bad as, say... Narutaru was, but they\'re definitely trying to reduce animation budget when they can, even though they don\'t really ever go overboard with cost cutting tricks.Sound: 5/10:Doesn\'t really stand out, but the annoying electronic tune from the first season is, thankfully, gone. Music is okay. The music that accompanies ""serious"" episodes is actually good, but it is rarely utilized.Characters: 5/10:They\'re okay. Basically, everybody has a role/stereotype or archetype they adhere to and they try to stick with it. On an occasion the anime shows other side of the character, but there isn\'t much character development going on. In the end, it is a gag anime, so this is understandable.Enjoyment: 6/10:I liked it more than the first season. The serious episodes were surprisingly good, especially the one called ""Silent Enemy"".Overall: 6/10:This is no masterpiece, but I\'d recommend to check it out when you have the time. The show is fairly clean too, meaning no gore and fanservice in it. So, mostly silly fun kind of thing, with occasional sprinkle of seriousness. of messy or silly situation instead.Detailed breakdown below:Story: 6/10The story has improved compared to the first season.

I totally understand if some people are turned off by the lack of any plot or how cliche some of the characters are, but I think that only adds to the charm of GA!Starting from this point on, GA\'s episodes are separated into two different segments each half that last about 11 mins aprox., so the comedy is still very quick and makes use of the limited time they have. Z begins to experiment with absurdist comedy, which will later be GA\'s modus operandi. This is what I like to...call the ""Experimental period"" since there\'s still a hint of the more light hearted comedy in S1. The only reason this season isn\'t a 10/10 for me personally is because not every episode hits a home run (Specifically the episode: Deep Fried Egg-rolls of Love), but have trust that you will have a fun time.The CVs are all also amazing! The best way is to watch the original Japanese version since all five main CVs are outstanding, but the Eng dub isn\'t horrid by any means and is a valid way to experience GA. The ENG cast have all gotten warmed up to their characters (Forte\'s ENG actress really is the only one who hasn\'t fully connected to her character yet) and perform really well together.The animation is good. The art style definitely had a major shift from S1 to Z because of a swap from hand drawn cels to digital cels, but it still screams early 2000s/90s retro which is always a pleasure to see.Despite having it\'s own separate category on this site, there\'s one special episode that isn\'t normally grouped with the rest of the season but can probably be seen as a special(?). That episode is Gunsmoke and Tobacco Cassoulet. If you are a big fan of Forte, and enjoyed Downtown Soulfood ODEN (S1E14), and Steel Jambalaya (S2E6 second half), then I can guarantee that this episode will become a favorite. It balances Ranpha and Milfeulle\'s antics between a rather heavy story about Forte reconnecting with an old acquaintance who\'s planning on getting revenge against the man who killed his family. Forte is really the only character that ever gets ""development"" in the form of a story that has a connection to her past (which is quite the colorful one if you piece all four ""canon"" backstories in the series), so it\'s safe to say that Forte fans get to eat often.Definitely keep going! Galaxy Angel really just gets better as it goes, especially if you\'re a fan of Forte. call the ""Experimental period"" since there\'s still a hint of the more light hearted comedy in S1.

Gear Fighter Dendoh,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2484/Gear_Fighter_Dendoh,"[""In lieu of no reviews... this might be seen as yet another mecha anime, but it could be sweet... the way there's a motherly figure, the friendship, and the reversal of an 'evil' entity, while the position reverses for a brotherly figure... it is not quite as deeply philosophical as Evangelion, but it has a certain panache and an allure that can be both colourful and dark. It explores human relationships, yet is intimate with technology and lifeless (?) machines.Overall, it may be slightly repetitious and a classical shounen mecha, its music not outstanding, but passable, yet it can be charming and at times moving....There is some character development, but also 'technicians' with not much of a backstory...Ultimately, it does have a potentially interesting storyline. There is some character development, but also 'technicians' with not much of a backstory...Ultimately, it does have a potentially interesting storyline."", ""Though it is seemingly another repetitive kids' mecha anime, GEAR Fighter Dendoh is pleasantly surprising, as it manages to introduce several interesting ideas in a shortened run.The anime follows two boys who must pilot the mech Dendoh under the auspices of the organization GEAR to protect the world from an evil alien empire. It's the same general plot of most kids' super robot animes, but it stands out for several reasons. First, our two protagonists do not always get along, but they must work things out so they can pilot Dendoh together and save the world. This dynamic is very similar to that between Cure...Black and Cure White in the first Precure series, which I found very enjoyable. It allows for plenty of character exploration and growth, which complemented the series nicely. The protagonists' parents and other side characters are also shown in their mundane, happy, often comedic lives, which gave the series a wholesome, heartwarming element. The mechanical designs are also cool. Dendoh's chest looks like a car grille, which makes the mech reminiscent of a robot-mode Transformer. Dendoh's legs are made of wheels, which not only makes it look even more similar to a Transformer but also allows for lots of cool moves. Additionally, digital animals are used as weapons in battle. The power-up/attack sequences for these digital animals are reused, but these sequences are appealing to watch nonetheless. The digital animals are also used to lightly explore the nature of intelligence, relationships, and reality -- fans of Digimon Tamers may enjoy this aspect of the series. The weekly battles in each episode are also given variety and stakes in that Dendoh often does not have the upper hand in the battles and that Dendoh's power gets depleted easily, so the heroes must figure out unique, ingenious ways to defeat the villains and ensure that Dendoh has enough power to complete the missions.Visually, many elements of the series, such as GEAR's control room and mech hangers, are obviously inspired by Evangelion in their detail and general aesthetic. Combined with the fact that there's a four-letter organization fighting aliens, certain visual cues, and the fact that the mech runs on limited power, many may be quick to dismiss this as an Evangelion clone, but the similarities between this show and Evangelion end there. Gear Fighter Dendoh is happy and full of hope -- the series is set in an idealized, optimistic future, and much of the show is about the power of friendship and cooperation.The anime was made in the early 2000s, right when the anime industry was shifting from cel to digital animation, so this series uses a combination of cel animation and 3D CGI, making this one of the few animes made in the new millennium that primarily use cel animation. The cel animation simultaneous amplifies the warm, wholesome elements of the show and allows the show to be darker visually when the plot gets more serious.Gear Fighter Dendoh has remained severely overlooked, making this show into something of a hidden gem. I find this surprising for several reasons other than its distinctive plot, cool designs, and wholesome, endearing characters. The plot is based on a cancelled entry in the Brave series, The Saint of Braves Baan Gaan (which was also used in the Brave Saga video game), and a cancelled sequel to GaoGaiGar. The fictional idol group in Gear Fighter Dendoh, C-DRiVE (whose songs are legitimately good enough to listen to outside the context of this anime), would inspire the characters of My-HiME. Finally, the director of this series would go on to direct Gundam SEED.Overall, I highly recommend Gear Fighter Dendoh. It has good characters, visually appealing designs, and it uses its episodes well, keeping the monster-of-the-week formula engaging throughout. Fans of mecha anime should definitely check this show out. Black and Cure White in the first Precure series, which I found very enjoyable. It allows for plenty of character exploration and growth, which complemented the series nicely. The protagonists' parents and other side characters are also shown in their mundane, happy, often comedic lives, which gave the series a wholesome, heartwarming element. The mechanical designs are also cool. Dendoh's chest looks like a car grille, which makes the mech reminiscent of a robot-mode Transformer. Dendoh's legs are made of wheels, which not only makes it look even more similar to a Transformer but also allows for lots of cool moves. Additionally, digital animals are used as weapons in battle. The power-up/attack sequences for these digital animals are reused, but these sequences are appealing to watch nonetheless. The digital animals are also used to lightly explore the nature of intelligence, relationships, and reality -- fans of Digimon Tamers may enjoy this aspect of the series. The weekly battles in each episode are also given variety and stakes in that Dendoh often does not have the upper hand in the battles and that Dendoh's power gets depleted easily, so the heroes must figure out unique, ingenious ways to defeat the villains and ensure that Dendoh has enough power to complete the missions.Visually, many elements of the series, such as GEAR's control room and mech hangers, are obviously inspired by Evangelion in their detail and general aesthetic. Combined with the fact that there's a four-letter organization fighting aliens, certain visual cues, and the fact that the mech runs on limited power, many may be quick to dismiss this as an Evangelion clone, but the similarities between this show and Evangelion end there. Gear Fighter Dendoh is happy and full of hope -- the series is set in an idealized, optimistic future, and much of the show is about the power of friendship and cooperation.The anime was made in the early 2000s, right when the anime industry was shifting from cel to digital animation, so this series uses a combination of cel animation and 3D CGI, making this one of the few animes made in the new millennium that primarily use cel animation. The cel animation simultaneous amplifies the warm, wholesome elements of the show and allows the show to be darker visually when the plot gets more serious.Gear Fighter Dendoh has remained severely overlooked, making this show into something of a hidden gem.

Gingitsune,https://myanimelist.net/anime/18411/Gingitsune,"['Stories with spirits and humans from literature are always a fascinating tale. The concept of blending between the lines of fiction and reality can be an intellectual story to tell. Often times, fantasy literature brings elements of suspense, horror, and power struggles into stories involving clashes between spirits and humans. However, stories can sometimes be just simple and straightforward. Take Gingitsune for example. It’s a series that defines itself as a fantasy slice of life that is simplistic but yet charming, sensible, and alluring.Gingitsune is an anime series based off of the manga of the same name written by Sayori Ochiai. The setting takes place...in the modern ages but fuses it with traditional Japanese themes to transform it into a product of elegance. In such an age is a young child named Makoto Saeki, the only child and daughter of a widowed shrine priest in an Inari Shinto Shrine. She may seem ordinary but Makoto possesses a very special gift – the ability to see heralds. As a well-known phrase goes, “with great power comes great responsibility”, Sekai now plays the role of a girl that can change people’s lives. She’s not alone either because Gintaro, an anthropomorphic fox whom Sekai can only see, becomes her partner and guardian of the shrines.As what it is, Gingitsune isn’t a horror story or vengeance with anguish spirits out to get back at humans. Rather, it’s a simple slice of life fantasy story that conveys the life of Makoto Saeki. More importantly is also the significance of character relationships. This is especially true earlier on as we get to witness how Makoto interacts with others, in particular Gintaro. The duo often works together because of Makoto’s circumstances of being unable to accurately tell fortunes. This is a problem as most Sekai priestesses are proficient in the art of fortune telling. Luckily, Gintaro serves as her helping hand as the duo are able to serve their roles with Makoto bringing many hopes and promises. As promising as the series goes, the story seems to be a bit slow at first. Most episodes focuses on specific events that can be simple as solving a problem to more complex issues dealing with human relationships. This is where Makoto comes in as her ways of thinking is beneficial with human knowledge. On the other hand, Gintaro comes into play whenever there is a supernatural problem that becomes more than what Makoto can handle on her own.Because the series isn’t focused exclusively on an ongoing story or arcs, there can be some issues with pacing. It sometimes may feel slow further evidenced by its serene atmosphere. The way it presents the series is simple but yet offers a concept that can be captivating. Most of this is captured by character interactions. Makoto and Gintaro is an odd duo to get to know just by simple observation. Gintaro often finds Makoto as a nuisance and is indifferent about human affairs. However, there are various times when he truly cares for Makoto’s well-being and offers her useful advice. Makoto can be a bit argumentative with Gintaro’s actions or ways of thinking. Yet because a human and spirit relationship can be complex, the duo can work out problems collectively to protect and help the helpless.As the series goes on, there are also other characters’ relationships and backgrounds revealed. This includes another prominent successor of the shrine, Satoru Kamio. The young man can be considered a prodigy especially in the arts of kendo. But unlike Makoto, he didn’t grow up in a very well treated environment. In fact, his childhood had people mistreat him and causes the young man to be isolated as who he is today. His closest friend and fox herald is an 80-year old being named Haru. Unlike Makoto and Gintaro, the relationship between Satoru and Haru can be quite one sided at first. Haru often cares for the well-being of Satoru, so much that it borders on obsession. (Typically involves members of the opposite sex) Unfortunately, Satoru seems to rarely respond in a way that can be deemed as appreciation which because of his stoic personality. It is not until later though where their relationship is more emphasized and viewers will get to see how much they develop. Relationships are also further explored in a realistic manner especially involving parents. We get to see how children respects their elders and holding responsibility of their future. They represent the future generations as comparisons are made throughout the series of how the new generation are similar to their ancestors.A fantasy modern slice of life is not complete with its heralds. Throughout the show, other characters of supernatural nature shows up including dog-like heralds, turtles, or playful monkeys. There is a sense of comedy representing some of these characters that contrasts the usual vengeful spirits greatly. In essence, they also represents human characteristics such as Haru’s jealousy, the turtles’ humbleness, or the monkeys’ playfulness that of a child. It’s fun to see it from a more human perspective and how they compare as if they were one of us.Comedy wise, the series is lighthearted and avoids crude or shock value. There’s virtually no fan service as it avoids the typical beach/onsen episode. Instead, it relies on natural humor with some sarcasm and gags such as Gintaro’s love of oranges. Also surprisingly enough, there is minimal romance that is often played out as a causal sense. Otherwise, most relationships are based on events from the past such as Makoto’s introduction to the series is when she was a young child. She witnessed the first sight of Gintaro that changed her life forever. With clever usage of flashbacks, it’s also easy to feel what the experiences the characters have gone through. It can create mixed responses but surprisingly can be pragmatic. Furthermore, some of these stories sends a message with a tag of morality labeled. Unfortunately for action junkies, there isn’t much intensity or rivalries going on throughout the series. It takes on the more slice of life approach rather than the typical ‘save the world’ trope. As a simple fantasy life story, this is what it should be.Artwork wise, Gingitsune is easy to see visually. Human characters are designed to look human while heralds are colored with fantasy tones. The shrines are designed as being simple, realistic, and natural. There’s a sense of mystical atmosphere that the shrines also brings out that can make viewers wonder what goes on behind its history. It’s not a magic story but creates that atmosphere of innocence such as Makoto and Haru. The studio Diomedea is involved with the project that has a history involved with supernatural stories such as Nanatsuiro Drops, Squid Girl, and Sola. Here, they do their job with consistency to bring this fictional story to life.Soundtrack is moderate with only some outstanding features. The OST generally remains the same with its serene tones. The OP song, ""tiny lamp"" by fhána works well but lacks any catchy moments that captures the essence of the series. There’s also hardly any notable characteristics regarding its ED song. But if we were to discuss voice acting, then Gintaoru’s VA should definitely be one to mention. Shinichiro Miki plays the role of Gintaoru with his talent that represents why he is a prominent voice actor in the seiyu industry. The way his character speaks out often comes with a sophisticated tone that combines elements of sarcasm, pride, and maturity.I’ll admit, this show is not the type of anime for everyone. If you’re looking forward to a complex action fantasy with plot twists and struggles, then GIngitsune is the wrong show for you. Instead, this show fits more of a fantasy slice of life with dynamic character building based on relationships, past lives, and construction of friendships. Although it lacks a complex love polygon, the parental love that the characters presents is very realistic. The elements of fantasy and realism fused creates a line that blurs together creating a charming story. As relaxing the series can be, there are times when it feels slow paced or simply put…boring. But if we look carefully, it’s easy to tell that Gingitsune is nothing about saving the world or exorcising evil spirits. Not every fantasy story has to be about defeating evil. Gingitsune is about ordinary people doing extraordinary things. in the modern ages but fuses it with traditional Japanese themes to transform it into a product of elegance.

But if we look carefully, it’s easy to tell that Gingitsune is nothing about saving the world or exorcising evil spirits. Not every fantasy story has to be about defeating evil. Gingitsune is about ordinary people doing extraordinary things.', ""This is why I like animes, after getting thoroughly disappointed by watching something with excellent animation and music fall way beyond mediocrity due to lack of originality, unnecessary fan-service and a crappy sense of humor; getting angry at yet another butchering of a video game adaption into a utterly stinking pile misdirection and lack of effort; and laughing at a purely unrealistic and shameless attempt at seinen through yet again short skirt wearing superhuman schoolgirls, I get to experience a show like Gingitsune. This anime is not trying to achieve any new grounds and actually does not attempt at anything other than simplistic beauty, tries...to teach us some values with so refined subtlety and courageously realistic presentation of the relationships that we observe and gain just by leading our everyday life.Among other things Gingitsune is the story of the daughter of a priest, Makoto Saeki who lives in a Inari shrine with his father, from early childhood she has the power of the sight as she can see gods' heralds, which in her shrines case is the lazy and obnoxious fox spirit Gintaro. Early on the story mainly focuses on how with the help of somewhat reluctant Gintaro, Makoto helps the people around her. Through her unique relation and ability she gain new friends and even meets other heralds. At a first glance and after the first few episodes it might seem a bit too simplistic slice of life with such a slow pace and an all together happy-feelings kind of a show. But soon it delves into much serious ground with the introduction of the character Satoru who like Saeki has the power of the sight, but very unlike Makoto had a troubled childhood and due to circumstances had to live his shrine forever. He comes to live with the little family in Makoto's shrine and we get a little look at his tragic past with the early lose of both of his parents and how his troubled childhood made him a total introvert and socially awkward individual who's only attempt at happiness is through Kendo and the relatively young fox spirit Haru.As the story progresses through quite a slow pace we get to learn some nice life lessons as well as get to experience quite a varied array of different emotions sometimes even through the eyes of many of the side characters which was quite unique, these nice change of viewpoints felt very natural. There were even a few of episodes where the focus is completely withdrawn from some of the main characters to let viewers fully appreciate the emotions and turmoils of other characters. The writers viewpoint on romance and modernized relationships along side traditional influences were quite refreshing, as he tries to portray relationships in a more realistic way. The involvement of the characters with each other through their daily life, the slow progression of their attitudes and views on others were really done with vivid imagination. This is how real world works mostly (not like the fast to fall in love and fast to get together world of the animes and mangas). There are all kinds of romances; the subtle yet slow development of feelings, the unrequited emotions of someone falling for a guy/girl with a big age difference; even the amazing feeling of love at first site; everything was done quite naturally and with a lot of skills.Another important aspect for me was the clear line of demarcation that was put between the world of heralds and humans. Heralds with their long years of life are so much more different in their views of the ways of the worlds, the beautiful imagining of their emergence into the supernatural world through flashbacks were quite nicely done to.Overall the so simple, minimalistic yet beautifully imagined story, even without no real on going plot-line or even distinct beginning or end was one of the best aspects of the show. It gets 9 out of 10 from me.As expected characters are the real highlights and driving force of this elegant tale. Makoto is a naive yet energetic girl, who gets into lots of fights with Gintaro yet somehow always makes up with him as he is kind of family member to her; although she tries to use the power of the herald sometimes for her benefit yet at the end of the day learns the real importance of using the power for others. Through her growing up in this beautiful shrine with her loving father and Gintaro she slowly understands various aspects of being special. As she gains friendship of other people in her school and her interaction with the people visiting the shrine she tries to always do what is best for the people around her at the end of the day in her own particular way. Ginataro on the other hand may act very arrogant and annoyed at Makoto but deep down really adores the girl. By living for thousands of years he had learned many things about the fragility of human life and the freedom of simple belief. Her lectures to Makoto and others not only gives us funny moments but sometimes even gives quite a few good life lessons.Satoru is perfect example of someone brought up with the cruelty of this modern world. Through losing his parents in early childhood and then his grandfather after that, he learned the sadness of reality very young. By the neglect and prosecution of his aunt's family he has grown into an introvert, a socially awkward young man who thinks he has to do everything by himself. Through his journey to the new shrine and school we as viewers get to experience the joy of being accepted and even loved, the joy of getting new friends and over all the joy of learning to live for your own-self again. Haru is a real cute character who seems kind of one dimensional at first with her short-temperament, being too proud and obsessive affection for Satoru. But through her beautifully told back-story we get to learn her tragic entry into the world of heralds as well as the special and unique bond that she shares with Satoru. There was some really emotional and memorable scenes in her past indeed.The other characters were also very deeply detailed in respect to such a short series. Makoto's two friends, the carefree and adventurous Yumi and the gentle and intelligent Funabashi; the other heralds and even some people in the lives of the side characters (like Yumi's boyfriend, Funabashi's fathers assistance/driver, Satoru's kendo team members etc) gets their story told in somewhat short yet delicately careful details.The characters are quite well imagined and does the show justice, so gets 9 out of 10.The animation gives us nicely detailed scenery in and around Saekis' small shrine and also other beautiful landscapes are thrown to give the atmosphere that much of a push towards a mixture realism and supernatural. The subtle color and stylistic changes that was introduced when we were getting flashbacks along with the beautiful music was really something that added to the total experience.The realism even persisted with the character designs as the writer avoided including unnaturally good looking and well endowed designs and used simple yet appropriate imagining. This was a really welcomed change after the plethora of too good looking or too cool looking characters that are now-a-days overflowing the anime scene in general. I, myself really enjoyed the animation although it felt a bit aged to be honest while comparing it with some of the works we are seeing these days. While it does not actually hold anything back from the experience it was indeed something that should have been looked upon. the art/animation gets 8 out of 10.The soundtrack/music isn't anything special in spite of use of nice in-show music specially in the flashback scenes. The total in-show music as a whole does something in adding to the overall enjoyment as giving new dimensions to the experience but some of the tunes were a bit over used to be honest. On the other hand while being quite appropriate the OP and ED didn't really do anything for me as I mostly skipped them after a few listens.The real achievement in this regard for Gingitsune is the excellent voice acting. The voice actors really did put in their best efforts and really gave the emotions that much more vigor and realism through their works. Special mention should be given to the voice actors of Gintaro and Satoru as their efforts really caught attention and made it that much more easy for us viewers to relate with them and appreciate their dilemmas. The music/soundtrack gets a score of 8.5 out of 10 from me.Despite all of its strong point this show is not something for everyone. This is a show for people who enjoys the simplicity of life, the joy of living each day and the greatness of having people around you who care about you. For me the slow pace of the story with its unique blend of realism with supernatural; the portrayal of various aspects of relationships, friendship and love and the overall simplistic nature of the messages given like the life lessons that we get to learn everyday just by being alive was a very enjoyable experience.I will recommend this to any lovers of slice of life and seinen out there. Believe me, although it may not seem so now, you will really enjoy this if you just give this a try.Overall Score -8.5 out of 10. to teach us some values with so refined subtlety and courageously realistic presentation of the relationships that we observe and gain just by leading our everyday life.Among other things Gingitsune is the story of the daughter of a priest, Makoto Saeki who lives in a Inari shrine with his father, from early childhood she has the power of the sight as she can see gods' heralds, which in her shrines case is the lazy and obnoxious fox spirit Gintaro.

From its general beauty to its inner world of provocatively enriching emotions, this show always has something to mesmerize you with.Story: Keep in mind that this is a Slice of Life show, so the thing is that this is a story much more than it is an underlying plot. This is far from a bad thing; in all honesty, I find this show to be a very refreshing take on the Fantasy genre. For example, the rule that makes only one bloodline member possess ""the...Sight"" was extraordinarily different and well played in that it manages to maintain this show\'s reality close to our own. Think about it, and I\'ll use Naruto for a reference here: any family with a bloodline ability is practically a super ninja (which is more than half the main cast), so that begs the question: ""What is normal supposed to be?"" Gingitsune never had to beg that question. What I also enjoyed about the story was how the shrines themselves feel like characters in their own right, though more on that in the character section.Another thing in this show\'s favor is the characters\' back-stories were very heartfelt and real. Sure, Makoto may have always had the Sight as far as she can remember, but if I was to ask her ""Was it worth losing your mother?"", what do you think her response would be? See what I mean? There may be a pacing block or two and the beginning may be a bit rough, but this was a very easy show to marathon and empathize with. 9/10Art: Simply AMAZING! Many people immediately take for granted the gorgeous blue sky, brightly starry nights, the detail in the trees, the variable mix of color; but this show packs an extra punch in this department, something that\'s often not accounted for: The visual variety in scenic architecture. Modernity and tradition CAN work together to create a harmonious masterpiece that becomes a truly living, breathing world. This creates a kind of immersion that is an unforgettable experience for viewers to explore and to craft a journey that feels like a heavenly ascension.The characters\' expressions were kept in realistic proportions which is good because after years of watching anime, I felt tired of seeing over-exaggerated feelings all the time and this again reinforces the down to earth aspect the show has. The humans\' designs were smoothly done, while the heralds\' appearances were appropriately extravagant, mystical, and enchanting which is a constant, yet pleasing reminder that this IS a Fantasy. The animation itself was plain and simple, yet fluid for the most part, but the show obviously had no need to go all out here. The CG was thankfully minimalistic and never really interfered with the gorgeous scenery since it was reserved mostly for cars. 8/10Sound: The voice acting was immaculately done. Each voice suited its respective character well in body, personality, and emotion. Nothing much to say there, but what really makes this category stand out is the music! This is one of the liveliest Slice of Life soundtracks I have ever listened to. This is what allows the show to feel like the adventure that it is and absorbs us into its world. The instrumentation is primarily a traditional Japanese orchestra with catchy and revitalizing modern compositions that respect the olden times and culture in a very pleasing way that rivals Disney\'s classical scores sometimes. This is where I believe the show\'s heart is, and I want that heart to beat through my speakers for a long time to come. 9/10Characters: I absolutely adore the variety and cohesion of these characters! From the main pair Makoto and Gintaro, to her friends, to the other heralds themselves; they all have various quirks that make them enjoyable to some extent save for one for the most part, Satoru. He\'s not a bad character by any means, but it does take a while for him to be fleshed out instead of being a walking statue with hurt feelings. These characters learn and grow together in a way that\'s very similar to the way we do in real life, especially the relationship between Hiwako and Yumi. There are other characters that people may have a problem with for example...Haru.Now, Haru might be another stereotypical tsundere character; however, she is not a tsundere not just for the sake of having a tsundere in the cast, which is rare these days. She is given actual depth into why she acts the way she does, her tsun and dere sides get equal shares of the spotlight, both sides are given a reason to exist, and both are played realistically given her age (she acts 10 because that\'s about how old she would be in human years). Do not automatically assume a tsundere to be a bad character; she just needs to be written more carefully than most, which this show thankfully took into account.I mentioned before that the shrines were their own characters, and I\'ll explain why here: they offer life to the setting just as much as the living beings do. Writing the shrines out would have completely killed the show\'s amazingly unusual atmosphere. They are the symbolism behind the settings inner workings. They are the heralds\' perfect compliment in design, grace, and personality. They are the very soul and essence of the show.  9/10 for characters.Enjoyment: This is THE Slice of Life show any fan of the genre should marathon!  10/10Overall: 9/10. The merit and variety this show has is astounding! This is a true adventure into art, life, and ourselves and what we can see, imagine, and inspire in others.

I've seen a lot of people hype about this anime when it was clearly nothing special. Maybe it's just me, but I tend to dislike the whole slice-of-life type of anime. Gingitsune isn't that bad, but clearly nothing special. If you're looking for an anime that's completely calm and if you like the slice-of-life genre then it's worth checking out I suppose.Story: 4/10Call me strict, but there was nearly...zero plot in this anime. From episde 1, up to the final episode, I was still trying to figure out what the plot for this anime was supposed to be. I get it, it's just your typical cultural, slice-of-life anime, but of course you can't keep watching an anime series if there is no interest in the plot and in my opinion, the plot is what matters most. The story didn't start getting interesting until Satoru and Haru joined in, but it started losing it's interest around the last episodes again.Art: 6/10The animation was not too bad, but again nothing special, I've seen better. What I liked about it is that the colors were always appealing to the eye and the animation was nice and simple, but nothing that impressive. There weren't any great effects either, but I find that the best part about the artwork in this anime were the backgrounds. Very well done and good job to the concept artists.Sound: 6/10Again, the soundtrack was nothing special. I like how they kept the music simple, since it fits in this anime, but then again it didn't have any themes that impressed me and it's not a soundtrack that I'll go back and listen to it. The opening was decent, the ending song was pretty nice though.Character: 5/10Another major problem about this anime was absolutely no character development. And when I say absolutely no character development, I mean it. It seemed like they were going to develop Satoru a bit, but they just kinda dumped him after some time. The only character that seemed to have some slight development was Haru. I wanted to learn more about Gintaro though and actually see Makoto, since she's the main character, progress a bit, but it just seemed that she kept getting worse with each episode.Enjoyment: 5/10The fact that I was half-watching each episode, especially the ones that Satoru and Haru were not in, probably shows that I didn't really enjoy this anime. There wasn't really something to enjoy after a certain point and the fact that the characters were either unninteresting or that the anime itself wouldn't develop them was a huge turn off for me. There were many things they never finished explaining and of course, they did have time to do that, if only they didn't waste time on matters that the viewers wouldn't care about. Then again, that's what most slice-of-life anime do.Overall 5.2/10Don't get me wrong, I might be strict with my ratings, but I only rate anime in this way because there are others who deserve a much better rating. Gingitsune wasn't one of those, for me at least. Don't go assuming that I'm rating it so low because I hate slice-of-life anime, I've watched some others too and they were more interesting than this one, but I've also seen worse too. Again it's probably one of my least favorite genres so if you want, you don't have to listen to my opinion, although I tried keeping it as unbiased as possible. For me, this anime could have been more interesting than the average slice-of-life since it also had the fantasy type to it. zero plot in this anime.

Looking at the premise I almost skipped over this series entirely, mainly due to my personal bias against slice-of-life and how I usually see them as snore-fests where nothing really happens. In the end I gave the first episode a chance and my expectations were quickly surpassed.What exactly caught me off guard? It would be the fact that the script and characters brought genuine life to the story, both subtle and meaningful. I’ve grown used to slice-of-life having little to no story,...and themes that ultimately are delivered in such a limp-wristed way that you can’t care about it. Already in the first episode, Gingitsune accomplishes to remind me of how drama can teach us things about real questions we face in everyday-life. At its best points, the series focuses on problems ranging from isolation and bullying, to more philosophical matters such as what gives apologies their meaning.The animation fulfills its purpose and always manages to stay at an above average to great level, showing that plenty of love went into the making of the series. The design and direction manages to be colorful yet never abundantly so to the point where it sticks out, giving it a more neutral tone that feels more grounded in reality, disregarding the presence of fox-spirits and other deities of course.The use of the soundtrack helps in creating a tranquil environment for the series, with its use of flutes and string-instruments at the forefront, emphasizing the feeling of being at a mysterious shrine that contains more than meets the eye. It is also a perfect fit for the bits of Japanese culture and Shinto religion that is shown. The one thing that could have been improved sound-wise would be some of the voice-acting, as certain voices didn’t fit the characters’ ages, and in the case of the spirits there are some who get very loud and annoying at times.As for the down-sides of the series, there are a few annoyances and at least one greater flaw. The biggest con among the pros of Gingitsune is that it‘s short and incomplete. Normally when a series’ main flaw is that it leaves you wanting more, that is a compliment. At the time this review is written however, there seemingly is no available manga to continue the story with, leaving the viewer with some loose threads hanging at the end of episode twelve.Ultimately, Gingitsune captures its audience with a lovable cast and skillful writing that makes you care for the simple things in life. With a relaxed yet mature tone that doesn’t talk down to its audience, Gingitsune includes a lot of heart into its characters and script, ultimately ending up a short but sweet experience. and themes that ultimately are delivered in such a limp-wristed way that you can’t care about it.

With Gintaro's power to see glimpses of the future and find lost things,  Makoto tries to help anyone from their little community who comes to the shrine. Around the middle of the series, a boy named Satoru comes to live at Makoto's shrine. He can also see the...messengers and has one attached to him as well, Haru. She is also a fox spirit, but a younger one than Gintaro so she is much smaller compared to him and has a childish personality.The pace story is really slow. It's an episodic anime with no central story. It's just about every day lives, and the relationship between Makoto and her friends, with a little bit of supernatural. If you are looking an anime before bed, that's not hard to understand  and relaxing, this is the right choice for you.There's nothing much to say about the art; is't pretty decent, somewhat similar to Kotoura-san plus the big white anthropomorphic fox. There are no fantastic nature background images, no detailed outlines nor anything spectacular. I think that flashy art was not needed in this kind of anime anyway, you just watch it to relax, not to see something complicated and out of the ordinary.There's nothing memorable about the sound, OP and ED songs are also pretty quiet and in accordance to the overall mood of the series. The seiyuus did a good job, nothing out of the ordinary. I personally find Haru's voice a little annoying but that's just a personal opinion. High pitched voices are just too much for me.The characters are pretty likable and all of them have their own unique personalities. There are lot of hints for a potential romantic relations between a lot of characters, but there was just not enough time to develop anything. It's like the series is just a prologue to something more awesome and engaging. Many dialogs and moments are funny, too, especially between Haru and Gintaro. Satoru's background story brings some drama into the picture too, so I think this series has a lot to offer.Gingitsune is not a story for the masses, it doesn't have flashy fight scenes, witty dialog or any kind of mystery. All the cards are on the table from the start (except the explanation of how Gintaro got to be the herald of that shrine,which is not essential to anything ), there are no surprises. Still, I found this series really likable and was looking forward to every new episode. I just wanted my 20 minutes of relaxation every week, because that's what this series was for me. Also, Satoru's background story really got me hooked on it and I generally liked him the most. His socially awkward moments were the best, always getting me to giggle and smile.I would recommend this to fans of Natsume Yuujinchou, because the series has somewhat the same feeling. And also for all fans of Japan in general, because you can also find out about their culture through this, mainly the purification ceremony and some interesting customs. messengers and has one attached to him as well, Haru.

Young Makoto has received a special gift that allows her to use her vision to see spirits, known as heralds. This gift is passed down from generation to generation; in the previous generation, it was her mother who possessed this ability.The Inari Shrine, in turn, is home to the fox herald named Gintaro ""Gin,"" a large, white, and very lazy...fox who happens to be a big fan of eating tangerines! He is there to answer prayers and fulfill the requests of the local Shinto community. Gintaro can also foresee the future and locate lost things, offering assistance on the path of solving problems.In the initial episodes, we are immersed in the phases of Makoto\'s friendship establishment, first with Yumi Ikegami and later with Hiwako Funabashi. These young girls are involved in a school conflict, which, although initially tense, conclude with reconciliation and the solidification of their friendship. Additionally, two significant characters in the story are introduced: Satoru Kamio and his herald, Haru.Satoru moves to the Inari Shrine, where Makoto lives, and starts attending her school. His herald, Haru, follows him and arrives at Makoto\'s residence where Satoru is. In this part, the anime shows us the past life of Satoru and Haru, revealing the loss of Satoru\'s parents and later his only loyal friend, his grandfather. In Haru\'s past life, we discover her strong connection to Satoru, where she is incessantly worried about him and refuses to abandon him.In the second half of the anime, we witness the consolidation of the connection between Makoto and Gintaro. Despite Gintaro\'s rudeness, he has feelings, and thinking that Makoto will die before him, all that remains for him is to instruct and learn from his mediator. In the world, heralds live for a long time and will witness the birth and death of their mediators throughout the ages, powerless against this continuous cycle.As we reach the epilogue of the narrative, we realize that many things said during it or some lingering doubts remain unanswered. It feels like a second season is missing to tell the rest of the story. I highlight, for example, the relationship between Gintaro and his ex-partner Kinjiro. The narrative hints at it, but a clear and objective explanation is not provided. Kinjiro\'s whereabouts remain unknown. Based on this, is Kinjiro in another shrine? If so, which one? Does he still miss his ex-partner? I think things like these could be easily explained in a second season, which is lacking for this anime.Gingitsune, at its core, is a contemplative and slow-paced anime that also introduces us to a good understanding of how shrines and temples operate, with their ceremonies and customs. Despite my preference for slice-of-life anime without more mysterious plots, this one was enjoyable to follow, although some episodes were perceived as tedious.RATING: 7.2/10---------------------------- PORTUGUÊS (BRASIL)A narrativa começa nos mostrando Makoto Saeki e Tatsuo Saeki (o seu pai), onde eles vivem em um Santuário Inari. A jovem Makoto recebeu um dom especial que pode usar a sua visão para poder ver os espíritos, chamados de arautos. Esse dom é passado de geração em geração, a partir dos que possuíram essa capacidade, no caso anterior, era a sua mãe que tinha esse dom.O Santuário Inari, por sua vez, possui o arauto da raposa chamado de Gintaro ""Gin"", uma raposa grande, branca e muito preguiçosa, que deve ser fã número um em comer tangerinas! Ele está lá para atender as súplicas e suprir as necessidades do povo xintoísta local. Gintaro também é capaz de antever o futuro e de localizar coisas perdidas, onde poderá auxiliar ao caminho do problema.Nos primeiros episódios, somos imersos nas fases do estabelecimento da amizade de Makoto, inicialmente com Yumi Ikegami e posteriormente com Hiwako Funabashi. Essas jovens protagonizam um conflito escolar, o qual, embora inicialmente tensionado, acaba em reconciliação e solidificação de uma amizade de ambas.Ademais, é nos apresentado a dois personagens bem relevantes na história, o Satoru Kamio e seu arauto Haru.Satoru acaba se mudando para o Santuário Inari, onde Makoto mora, além disso, começa a estudar na escola onde ela estuda. O seu arauto, Haru, fica seguindo ele e chega na residência de Makoto, onde Satoru está. Nessa parte, o anime nos mostra a vida passada de Satoru e Haru, revelando a perda dos pais de Satoru, e após, o seu único leal amigo também morre, no caso, seu avó. E na vida passada de Haru, descobrimos a sua muito forte conexão com Satoru, onde ela sempre fica incessantemente preocupada com Satoru, e não quer o abandonar.Na segunda metade do anime, testemunhamos a consolidação do vínculo entre Makoto e Gintaro, onde apesar de Gintaro ser rude, ele tem sentimentos, e pensando que Makoto irá morrer antes dele, apenas o resta instruir e aprender com sua mediadora. Pois no mundo, os arautos vivem por muito tempo, e irão testemunhar o nascimento e a morte de seus mediadores ao longo das eras, impotentes perante esse ciclo contínuo.Quando chegamos ao epílogo da narrativa, percebemos que muitas coisas que foram ditas durante ela, ou algumas dúvidas que tinhamos não foram respondidas, é como se faltasse uma segunda temporada para contar os outros acontecimentos. Destaco, por exemplo, o relacionamento entre Gintaro e seu ex-parceiro Kinjiro. A narrativa nos insinua isso, mas não é mostrado uma explicação clara e objetiva. O paradeiro de Kinjiro permanece envolto. Com base nisso, será que Kinjiro está em outro santuário? Se sim, qual? Será que ele ainda sente saudades de seu ex-parceiro? Acho que coisas como essa, poderiam ser facilmente explicada em uma segunda temporada, que falta para esse anime.Gingitsune, em sua essência, configura-se como um anime contemplativo e de velocidade lenta, onde ao longo do anime, percebemos que ele também nos introduz um bom conhecimento de como funcionam os santuários e templos, com suas cerimônias e costumes. Apesar de minha preferência aos animes slice of life destituídos de enredos mais enigmáticos, porém, esse foi bem legal de acompanhar, embora alguns episódios tenham sido percebidos como tediosos.NOTA: 7.2/10 fox who happens to be a big fan of eating tangerines!

In this part, the anime shows us the past life of Satoru and Haru, revealing the loss of Satoru\'s parents and later his only loyal friend, his grandfather. In Haru\'s past life, we discover her strong connection to Satoru, where she is incessantly worried about him and refuses to abandon him.In the second half of the anime, we witness the consolidation of the connection between Makoto and Gintaro. Despite Gintaro\'s rudeness, he has feelings, and thinking that Makoto will die before him, all that remains for him is to instruct and learn from his mediator. In the world, heralds live for a long time and will witness the birth and death of their mediators throughout the ages, powerless against this continuous cycle.As we reach the epilogue of the narrative, we realize that many things said during it or some lingering doubts remain unanswered. It feels like a second season is missing to tell the rest of the story. I highlight, for example, the relationship between Gintaro and his ex-partner Kinjiro. The narrative hints at it, but a clear and objective explanation is not provided. Kinjiro\'s whereabouts remain unknown. Based on this, is Kinjiro in another shrine? If so, which one? Does he still miss his ex-partner? I think things like these could be easily explained in a second season, which is lacking for this anime.Gingitsune, at its core, is a contemplative and slow-paced anime that also introduces us to a good understanding of how shrines and temples operate, with their ceremonies and customs. Despite my preference for slice-of-life anime without more mysterious plots, this one was enjoyable to follow, although some episodes were perceived as tedious.RATING: 7.2/10---------------------------- PORTUGUÊS (BRASIL)A narrativa começa nos mostrando Makoto Saeki e Tatsuo Saeki (o seu pai), onde eles vivem em um Santuário Inari. A jovem Makoto recebeu um dom especial que pode usar a sua visão para poder ver os espíritos, chamados de arautos. Esse dom é passado de geração em geração, a partir dos que possuíram essa capacidade, no caso anterior, era a sua mãe que tinha esse dom.O Santuário Inari, por sua vez, possui o arauto da raposa chamado de Gintaro ""Gin"", uma raposa grande, branca e muito preguiçosa, que deve ser fã número um em comer tangerinas! Ele está lá para atender as súplicas e suprir as necessidades do povo xintoísta local. Gintaro também é capaz de antever o futuro e de localizar coisas perdidas, onde poderá auxiliar ao caminho do problema.Nos primeiros episódios, somos imersos nas fases do estabelecimento da amizade de Makoto, inicialmente com Yumi Ikegami e posteriormente com Hiwako Funabashi. Essas jovens protagonizam um conflito escolar, o qual, embora inicialmente tensionado, acaba em reconciliação e solidificação de uma amizade de ambas.Ademais, é nos apresentado a dois personagens bem relevantes na história, o Satoru Kamio e seu arauto Haru.Satoru acaba se mudando para o Santuário Inari, onde Makoto mora, além disso, começa a estudar na escola onde ela estuda. O seu arauto, Haru, fica seguindo ele e chega na residência de Makoto, onde Satoru está. Nessa parte, o anime nos mostra a vida passada de Satoru e Haru, revelando a perda dos pais de Satoru, e após, o seu único leal amigo também morre, no caso, seu avó. E na vida passada de Haru, descobrimos a sua muito forte conexão com Satoru, onde ela sempre fica incessantemente preocupada com Satoru, e não quer o abandonar.Na segunda metade do anime, testemunhamos a consolidação do vínculo entre Makoto e Gintaro, onde apesar de Gintaro ser rude, ele tem sentimentos, e pensando que Makoto irá morrer antes dele, apenas o resta instruir e aprender com sua mediadora. Pois no mundo, os arautos vivem por muito tempo, e irão testemunhar o nascimento e a morte de seus mediadores ao longo das eras, impotentes perante esse ciclo contínuo.Quando chegamos ao epílogo da narrativa, percebemos que muitas coisas que foram ditas durante ela, ou algumas dúvidas que tinhamos não foram respondidas, é como se faltasse uma segunda temporada para contar os outros acontecimentos. Destaco, por exemplo, o relacionamento entre Gintaro e seu ex-parceiro Kinjiro. A narrativa nos insinua isso, mas não é mostrado uma explicação clara e objetiva. O paradeiro de Kinjiro permanece envolto. Com base nisso, será que Kinjiro está em outro santuário? Se sim, qual? Será que ele ainda sente saudades de seu ex-parceiro? Acho que coisas como essa, poderiam ser facilmente explicada em uma segunda temporada, que falta para esse anime.Gingitsune, em sua essência, configura-se como um anime contemplativo e de velocidade lenta, onde ao longo do anime, percebemos que ele também nos introduz um bom conhecimento de como funcionam os santuários e templos, com suas cerimônias e costumes. Apesar de minha preferência aos animes slice of life destituídos de enredos mais enigmáticos, porém, esse foi bem legal de acompanhar, embora alguns episódios tenham sido percebidos como tediosos.NOTA: 7.2/10', ""I enjoy slice of life anime and elements of the supernatural, and Gingitsune delivered on both aspects.  My favorite part of this show, and why I gave it a 10, is the relationships.  The bonds between the characters were meaningful and authentic.  There were scenes that made me cry they were so heart warming.  It did a great job of showing what truly matters in life.  I also enjoyed learning about shrine ceremonies.  The artwork, especially the scene with the rainbow, was beautiful.  The series made me feel warm, happy, and uplifted.  Very relaxing show.

This show is heartwarming, simple and wholesome. Story revolves around Inari shrine, Makoto Saeki, the teenage girl, as the protagonist, doing her daily life mostly with Gintarou, herald, fox-like creature. Yes, she can see spirits since she was kid. The one that makes this show differs from other slice of life is they treated the minor characters so well. Even if it's not deep. Also don't forget the character development. As the story goes, the new herald appears and one human character as a main supporting character or should I say closest comrade. This show...has slow pacing so you need extra patient to see the character development and further events. But a bit portion of comedy kinda works to maintaining the audience due to the pacing. Not to mention the visual is great as well. The studio is doing good job on this too. Just calm, calm and calm what I got while watching this show. There is romance too in this show but it's subtle, tho. The OP and ED are also good especially the OP sung by famous Japanese musician.

The montage of the scenery is beautiful, really makes me want to go out and appreciate the world. The characters each have some development that makes them endearing. I actually found haru-chan to be quite bratty in the beginning but she began to grow on me, and i'm sure if the anime were longer, we would be able to see her growth. The relationship between gin and makoto is very special and it was heartwarming to see it.I wish there were a second season that went into depth about kinjirou...and other heralds, satoru and his family, and just to see where everyone ended up in a few years. But overall, the ending was pretty satisfactory. It kinda gave me the same vibes as the anime hanasaku iroha, which I also enjoyed quite a bit. and other heralds, satoru and his family, and just to see where everyone ended up in a few years.

The first chapter is kinda ""you don\'t know these characters, but we are going to put emotional scenes, but you are not going to bat an eyelash with them"" type (because, duh, you haven\'t developed any emotional connection with anyone). The second and the third chapter...are building the base for the rest of the chapters (in terms of characters), so they are quite slow too.

She lives in the shrine with his dad who is s̶o̶ ̶h̶o̶t̶  so diligently working as another shrine maiden. This might look like an application of unpaid child...labor, but from the very start, you can see how happy she is working as a child laborer in this shrine, because of the fox youkai. The moment you see them in the scene, it's undeniable that extreme sexual tension emerges between them, it might seem weird at first but light-yet-not-important spoiler alert: the youkai is at least 500 years old so it ok.Makoto asks Gingitsune to help her friend by seeing the future of her and her boyfriend who are currently on a beef and on the verge of breaking up. This is the power that a youkai has as the god's messenger and as well the premise of this anime. Because Gingitsune likes Makoto, he then accepts the request and does as she says. But Makoto is a dumbfuck who doesn't listen so she only tells half the thing that the furry says to her friends, by the way only Makoto can see this youkai so she has to tell her friends what Gingitsune sees. This causes her friends and her boyfriend to be on the verge of breaking up even more. So Makoto says that she hates the youkai for not telling her everything and then leaves.That's all the synopsis of this anime I will give to you, I'm sure you all are curious about what happens to them now, and I promise you, there will be so much emotional weight that you will feel throughout this anime, as its resolves the feelings Gingitsune has towards Makoto, and as well the many triangles loves that will be shown later.I think this anime is doing a great job as a romantic anime, and for that, I must give this anime a 10/10 recommended, thank you for reading. labor, but from the very start, you can see how happy she is working as a child laborer in this shrine, because of the fox youkai.

Airing on a packed day like Saturday led it to get overshadowed by other titles, but this was one of the funniest and most enjoyable rides of the year.Japanese comedy isn’t for everyone. A lot of times it simply doesn’t hit, but on rare occasions, like 4-uso it’s genuinely hilarious. The whole story revolves around 4 girls at a school who have massive secrets they’re hiding from each other. While on the surface they’re having normal middle school girl interactions, on the inside they’re having these hilarious monologues and working out how to keep their...true identities from one another. The show is really easy to digest, knows what it is, is confident in that identity and does a great job of presenting Japanese comedy in a digestible manner for western audiences. I found the show to be a nice de-stresser after a long week and absolutely loved the girls’ chemistry and antics. Seeing them gradually building up the confidence to be honest with each other was really nice.The plot is pretty non-existent in the show, it’s a flavour of the week type of anime with some generally consistent themes, but no deep story or anything. But, the gags and skits are more than enough to keep you satisfied.I think this is a perfect show for people who typically don’t think anime is funny, but still want to give comedy a try. It’s got a bit of magic to it that’s really hard to describe and needs to be watched to be believed.

Art, direction, sounds, voice acting and music are all on good levels. As I see it, this anime fullfills its intended mission quite well - character profiles combine quite well for comic and absurd situations, relatively many of which I found genuinely funny.While freely diving into absurdity is the main idea, it has an inner logic in it, interconnections do make ""senseless sense"", so to speak, making it interesting to watch and allowing the getaway from the constraints of common sense to be a comfortable experience.The core of...the plot reminded me of Spy x Family a bit, but it is much crazier and carefree, which works as a some sort of a relief from constant exposure paranoia of Spy x Family.The main drawback are somewhat not aesthetically pleasing scenes here and there, which sometimes contrast way too hard and could be too much for appreciators of cute stuff like me, however this is probably to be expected from the work of this genre. the plot reminded me of Spy x Family a bit, but it is much crazier and carefree, which works as a some sort of a relief from constant exposure paranoia of Spy x Family.The main drawback are somewhat not aesthetically pleasing scenes here and there, which sometimes contrast way too hard and could be too much for appreciators of cute stuff like me, however this is probably to be expected from the work of this genre.', ""This is a show to watch while eating, that's the best way I can describe it.Each episode is filled with clever jokes and these 4 funny and compelling characters.

I like the fact that 'I' as a viewer can see them lying and make assumptions on how they'll try to hide the facts about them either by playing it or trying to be weird to the extent that the others just turn the other way.It somewhat reminded me of Daily Lives of High School Boys, it pretty much the same vibe, funny and cute but most certainly enjoyable moments. The goofiness also is top notch like how Rika erases...their memories or turn all of them to the opposite sex.Especially the boy was the most absurd one between them, because how do you hide the fact for so long and nobody notices?

Although this one is a lot less grounded in reality.The premise is simple, with the show often having each character fulfill their roles through out each episode's runtime. They can get pretty repetitive, especially with the Narrator over-explaining the jokes at times. I didn't mind this much, since I do like the Narrator butting in at times, but they do age the joke...and add to the repetition. A petty complaint I have is that the series doesn't go far enough in exploiting its characters for their full potential, like, the Rikka=Alien Colonel joke is pretty funny but it's never really taken anywhere beyond the same set of jokes. Same with everyone else really. I think the most was the show actually turning Tsuyoshi into a girl or replacing him with the real Tsubasa, but otherwise it's all fairly one note.While not bland or boring, 4-nin Uso presents itself as an entertaining show but one that's never laugh-out-loud or especially memorable.

That small show that no one remembers about? And how the premise of the show was how it had a time traveler, a psychic, and an alien? Of course, the biggest surprise was that Haruhi herself.That being said, this show contains extremely similar themes. A ninja, a psychic, an alien, and instead of Haruhi, we have a crossdressing guy. However, the shows can't be said to be really similar to each other. In fact, despite having virtually the same plot, the style, the comedy, and the pacing of the shows are completely different.That's what I love about comedy. There's just...a limitless amount of scenarios that you can do even with similar characters and setting. So I also find it hard to review this show. After all, in a show about slice of life and comedy, it's all about the comedic timing, the execution, the delivery, the pacing, and most importantly, if  you like it is if you find it humorous.And what can I say, it was interesting. Not all episodes were a home run, and there certainly where dry parts to the show that weren't particularly great. It has a lot of room for improvement, but it certainly has its charm. Sure, the animation isn't anything spectacular, but the facial expression and body movements during moments when it really mattered is nice. There's definitely a lack of backgrounds, too many still frames, or just a low budget in general, but the show made it work when it needed to.The characters are good. While they might have been ruined if the episode scenarios or skits were boring and predictable, they pair well with them instead. Even with the best characters, if the comedic delivery and scenarios are bad, then nothing can save it. Fortunately, while these scenes and episodes aren't anything out of the box, they certainly weren't predictable and were executed cleanly for the most part. Chiyo's a scatterbrained ninja that lightens up the mood, while liking all things cute. She quit her life as a ninja, and now fights for her life in order to keep her current high school lifestyle and her friends. Tsubasa's a cool, crossdressing guy. He always is trying to keep up his image as a female student, but also considers his  group of friends to be precious. He's also a wildcard since he's the only person Sekine can't mindread. Sekine's a psychic that functions mainly as a Tsukomi for she's the only person that knows everything, and tries to keep the group together. It's fun watching her act flustered, cursed with the knowledge that only she knows. Rikka's the boke that introduces chaos into the anime with her alien nature. Whether it's her lack of understanding of culture or terms, or her supernatural powers to create fun episodes, Rikka definitely brings life to the story.Yet, while the characters and scenes are fine, there's the problem with the lack of side characters. There's a lot of to explore here. Rikka's fellow alien compatriots, Chiyo's little brother, Tsubasa's sister, and Sekine's organization. While some of these characters appear to spice up some of the episodes, a vast majority of the episodes focus on our four main characters. That's fine and all, but introducing some more mainstay side characters enable for more variety and ability to create even more vibrant chapters and scenes.The first few episodes of the show were definitely the best quality, with good gags, but as the episodes drag on, the quality worsens, and you definitely also see that the author runs out of super good gags as there's a lack of character diversity. It's like the anime took the best chapters in the manga and put them all in the first few episodes. There's no side character students at the school, and you never even see the characters go to class, really.While the later episodes aren't as good as the first few, I truly appreciate the anime keeping up with the theme. There's no super big melodramatic finale or anything. There's definitely more heart to heart scenes, and that's actually good. It helps characterize our main cast, and makes us feel more connected to them when there's comedic jabs or scenes. I'm glad that there wasn't some dramatic reveal where the anime creates a serious finale that nobody really wanted. Things are just status quo, which is four high school students that might be hiding some secrets, but are also great friends. I appreciate that. a limitless amount of scenarios that you can do even with similar characters and setting. So I also find it hard to review this show. After all, in a show about slice of life and comedy, it's all about the comedic timing, the execution, the delivery, the pacing, and most importantly, if  you like it is if you find it humorous.And what can I say, it was interesting.

This was a very silly and funny comedy show, but also went completely under the radar for some reason.As befit a gag comedy show, it was very episodic and plotless, and yet it managed to regularly make me laugh out loud. The characters all had very strong and well-defined personalities that played off well from each other :- Rikka the alien played the role of the cheerful and...clueless little girl to hide the fact that she had no idea what life on Earth was actually about. Her impulsive nature and superpowers created a lot of trouble for the other three.- Chiyo the Ninja had a rather sweet nature and wanted to be a normal girl, but kept having to fight her brother sent by her ninja clan after her for going AWOL, and obviously did not have a single brain cell in her thick skull.- In face of those two idiots, you had two ""straight men"" : Sekine the psychic was the only ones who actually knew the other secrets because she could read their minds and was here to comment and react to their antics. She was the smartest one, with a down to earth, pragmatic (and rather selfish) personality always trying to protect the rest of the world from Rikka and Chiyo.- The last member of the quartet was Tsuyoshi/Tsubasa, an easygoing but rather dumb boy forced to crossdress by her evil twin sister to replace her in school, who was regularly the butt of the jokes and always seemed to wonder what he was doing here.Thanks to those characters, that show ends up often being very funny. The setup and characters were weird enough that it could regularly throw the characters into new crazy situations without getting repetitive. clueless little girl to hide the fact that she had no idea what life on Earth was actually about.

I would recommend for the jokes but idk...I found this show and the thumbnail looked interesting show highly detailed and dark 4 panels but i was wrong the quality was below average but more than acceptable. I think the charts were really interesting and did what to...know more besides the loli since aliens... know more besides the loli since aliens...', 'Yare Yare. Do you love Saiki K?  The similarities between the two shows is profound but with a very different cast of characters. This show will be hit or miss for you, but if this is your kind of humor every episode will have you laughing out loud. The writers always ""lean in to the bit"" pushing it too far which is a must for this type of humor. I wish both this and Saiki K would just keep running as the story really never ends. They just reboot when it gets too far along, and these shows always deliver a smile when needed.Easy,...funny, a perfect no commitment laugh. Heck even the deadpan narrator kills it.  The opening song is fun too. You\'ll know after one watch if this is for you. If it is, there aren\'t enough episodes. If not your thing you can confidently pass as it isn\'t changing. Hope you enjoy as much as I did. Haven\'t laughed at an anime that much in some time and that enjoyment earns my top score. funny, a perfect no commitment laugh.

Four friends who spend every day together also have to secretly navigate around bizarre scenarios brought on by the fact that Chiyo...is a former ninja, Rikka is an alien, Sekine is a psychic and Tsubasa is an unwilling crossdresser, whilst maintaining the facade of being completely normal people. Of course, being a psychic Sekine already knows Chiyo and Rikka’s secret, but not Tsubasa’s because her psychic powers are so rubbish that she can’t read the minds of men, and Sekine is kinda dumb so she doesn’t put two and two together. Tsubasa on the other hand is only attending an all-girls school because his identical twin sister blackmailed him into keeping her attendant score up whilst she slacked off and the result of hanging around with girls coupled with his androgynous appearance leaves him with a case of gender dysphoria.Between the four of them and their crazy circumstances, they’re all well-balanced as a comedy quartet. We are mainly put into the point of view of Sekine as she is the telepath and the only one who knows the other's secrets (except Tsubasa’s). However, unlike Anya from Spy x Family, she’s not a 6-year-old child who obliviously and disarmingly uses her power to break through the defences of her Lloyd and Yor. She’s usually performing damage control on behalf of Chiyo and especially Rikka after she decides to use an alien device to change everyone's gender or to make Chiyo’s IQ anything higher than 5.Although the jokes are on point where this anime is let down in its art and animation. The school that the girls and one guy inhabit feels surprisingly empty as there's not another student in sight unless it’s for a gag. This is also the same for many of the other locations too. The art overall is kind of bland looking thanks to the bad line art. I feel like some of the jokes may have landed better with better animation to back them up, but luckily the hilariously over-the-top ost and voice acting make up for it.As far as absurdist comedies go The Little Lies We Tell is very enjoyable. If it didn’t air in the same season as Spy x Family I feel like it would’ve got a bit more attention, but if you’ve finished Spy x Family and are looking for something similar then I think you should give The Little Lies We Tell a shot.7/10 Good. is a former ninja, Rikka is an alien, Sekine is a psychic and Tsubasa is an unwilling crossdresser, whilst maintaining the facade of being completely normal people.

They showed skill in interpreting different types of contexts and situations. For example, in a typical anime, a character pretending to be of the opposite sex could be treated superficially, without us caring much about that plot. However, the author gave proper attention to this character, highlighting their discomfort in various situations. This also applies to the other characters, making them unique and distinct from each other.Humor is subjective, so I won't dwell on it too much. In my opinion, it is well executed, working...with sarcastic situations resulting from each character hiding their secrets, leading to comedic misunderstandings. This, to me, was very enjoyable.The ending was predictable and could have been more emotionally intense, with each character sharing their secrets and experiencing intense moments. In conclusion, I believe the characters were excellently written, each one being quite different from the others, and the plot was well constructed. with sarcastic situations resulting from each character hiding their secrets, leading to comedic misunderstandings.

Everyone has a tale that they don\'t want to tell to hide it away from the world for 1001 reasons. Be it being a human or an extraterrestrial, a boy or a girl being in the suit of the opposite sex, straight or transgender, this is what makes the world revolve in its oddball-shaped mess of a planet that we call Earth. But in this season, there\'s a show like it: mangaka Madoka Kashihara\'s 4-nin wa Sorezore Uso wo Tsuku a.k.a The Little Lies We All Tell, that showcases the bizarreness between hiding what\'s true to the heart as opposed to exposing whatever...is appropriate in reality. And with just 2 volumes in circulation, one would expect that shows like this needed more time to get noticed, but apparently by the grace of the anime gods, this feels like a breakneck speed of fast adaptations being cash cows, but I guess that there\'s a silver lining of interest, especially in a very diverse and stacked season such as this.The series title, also literally translated to ""Four People Lie in Their Own Way"", it\'s exactly what the show is going for with its absurd comedic gimmick of ordinary people, but unordinary in their own way of fashion: the loli alien Rikka, the glorified former ninja Chiyo, the scrupulous psychic Sekine, and the tomboy-ish real male Tsubasa/Tsuyoshi. All 3 girls and a boy roam together in their school being the best of friends, but also at the same time, maintaining their posture that they are just as ordinary as they come, forebearing their ""true"" origins, almost akin to playing Among Us where all of them are sus in their own way. Be it preposterous or full of shenanigans, these 4 characters try to subvert one another into revealing who they really are, while navigating and trying to negate any suspicions along the way to protect themselves and the friendship between the 4 of them. And as weird as it sounds like, it can be funny, or constantly feeling like a hit-or-miss affair.Each of the 4 characters complement one another by the way of their own personalities, and as eccentric as it is, it\'s hilarious to see them be hard-wired towards the perception of others, sometimes overthinking to the point of situations like ""the total destruction of the world"". No doubt that this is a psychological battle of wits and valour to try and see who can get the most suspicions right, but knowing when to take a step back relinquishes the know-it-all minds of the people, preserving the friendship as such. Alas, as much as I would want to like the antics here being in the vein of the superpower-like school setting that\'s pretty much filled with gag humor, the comedy felt dry sometimes and didn\'t quite punch the way that it should. Nevertheless, I can understand that ""comedy is subjective"", and this to you, may be good or bad depending on your watching experience with the show.Studio Flad is a rather miniscule studio with 4-nin being the 3rd show in its line-up (Winter 2018\'s Dame x Prince Anime Caravan with Studio Pierrot\'s production assistance, and last Fall\'s Shin no Nakama with WolfsBane for production cooperation), so it\'s obvious enough that they had to have some form of external help, and it came in the fashion with Studio Pierrot and WAO WORLD for production assistance. And for the most part, though bombastic as it comes, it is serviceable and looks decent to the eye for the unkempt weirdness that is its style for flattery. Same goes with the OST, it\'s really fine though, but nothing to write home about.There\'s a reason why the anime community have developed this thinking of ""turning off your brain for enjoyment"", especially for shows derived from source materials that are unlike the usual fashion of expectation. And while 4-nin is a show where either you find the comedy good or bland, it\'s really up to personal preference, and this is something that you must gauge whether if this is the type of comedy that you\'re looking for.

Battle Spirits: Brave,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9346/Battle_Spirits__Brave,"[""First off, I'm going to start by saying this: This show can be watched as a stand alone, but I would not recommend it. It would be better to watch the prequel (Dan) first.After the dissapointing execution of an interesting plot in Toppa (first battle spirits series, absolutely skipable), came Dan. To me, in started becoming interesting half way through. I had hopes for it's sequel series Brave, and I was dissapointed.I found the first half of Dan to be a typical episodic card based isekai, and the second half to be much more plot focused, and my enjoyement went up. In Brave...however, the series starts off strong, and keeps it's momentum for most of the watch through. I was dissapointed because I expected it to also grab me after a twist, but I was already grabbed.TL;DR: Dan was good because it had a slow start, but Brave is good throught, and thus has no surprise 'wow, that's awesome' moments.The story is interesting. It revolves around character relationship a lot, and even though I dislike Youth (one of the most prominent side characters), he develops well. Also, if you're expecting more from Kajistu and Yuki, they exist, but aren't very plot relevant.The series isn't very linear, and the plot is all over the place. However, it reflects well on how they deal with everything happening around the world, and I like it. I'd give an 8 for story, and a 9 for characters.Art: 7. I don't have much to say. I'd also give the sound a 7.Enjoyment: 9/10. I would also feel confortable giving it an 8, since, like the previous 2 series, the card game isn't super interesting IMO.Total: 8/10.If you liked Dan, you should like Brave.Nota:Yes, Dan is more mature.There isn't more focus on the relationship between Mai and Dan than in the previous series. It's just accepted that they like each other, but Dan has another passion. Not much more than that.As I said, the story is all over the place, but if that doesn't matter to you, then that's one of the charms of this series.Indeed, the only characters from the previous series with an important role are Dan and Mai. however, the series starts off strong, and keeps it's momentum for most of the watch through.

Here Dan wins all the battleship tournaments and craves for powerful rivals and thrill of watching the spirits alive as it was possible in the other world. When he was in such agony, Mai comes from future and takes him to the future. Future world is ruled by mazoku (other world beings with monstrous appearance and powers). There is conflict between mazoku, the ruleers and mankind the slaves. MAI joined the world saving human organization where clarckey works as the captain of a ship, which he named as ""beautiful sophia"". Here dan\'s...battle with Barone, a mazoku leader of rome, changes both of them. He in the future world considered a legend of battle spirits game. As the story progresses, our hero has to collect 12 zodiac cards to stop the planet from being destroyed.Art: too good.Sound: good. Especially you can observe it while the battle spirits fight goes on.Characters: Barone character is the one which seems to change a lot. He thinks of the humans in another perspective . Most amazing characters- though were not shown quite frequently -are the queen of mazoku and the wife of a captain of mazoku -Duke (who work hard for both the species). Both of these ladies understood their environment and planned well their future. For instance, Queen perceives that here court officials are trying for a coup d\'etat, plans beforehand. She even understands others though the way they battle. She bowed to Dan when duke was defeated in a battle with Dan. She hold on to her promise with Dan. But her bow to Dan makes her to face severe consequences, she never quivered. Again duke\'s wife seems to understand the emotions of people around her. In the final episodes, she comforts mai well. She even accepts a human as a son so that her husband\'s ideal may be achieved.What i do not like in this series:1. To show Dan more mature and serious.2. To forcefully show romantic relationship or at least hints between Dan and Mai.3. Search for the 12 zodaic cards is not executed well. I mean to say is that for some episodes these were shown and for some Dan says we got 8 we need some more. No struggle at all shown for achiveving the cards from Suzuri\'s prospective.4. Clackey is left completely side character.Finally i disliked this series. So i gave very low ratine in my watch llist. battle with Barone, a mazoku leader of rome, changes both of them.

Most amazing characters- though were not shown quite frequently -are the queen of mazoku and the wife of a captain of mazoku -Duke (who work hard for both the species). Both of these ladies understood their environment and planned well their future. For instance, Queen perceives that here court officials are trying for a coup d\'etat, plans beforehand. She even understands others though the way they battle. She bowed to Dan when duke was defeated in a battle with Dan. She hold on to her promise with Dan. But her bow to Dan makes her to face severe consequences, she never quivered. Again duke\'s wife seems to understand the emotions of people around her. In the final episodes, she comforts mai well. She even accepts a human as a son so that her husband\'s ideal may be achieved.What i do not like in this series:1. To show Dan more mature and serious.2. To forcefully show romantic relationship or at least hints between Dan and Mai.3. Search for the 12 zodaic cards is not executed well. I mean to say is that for some episodes these were shown and for some Dan says we got 8 we need some more. No struggle at all shown for achiveving the cards from Suzuri\'s prospective.4. Clackey is left completely side character.Finally i disliked this series. So i gave very low ratine in my watch llist.']"

Aikatsu Friends!: Kagayaki no Jewel,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39078/Aikatsu_Friends__Kagayaki_no_Jewel,"[""Aikatsu: Brilliant Jewel is the definition of a disappointing sequel season.CHARACTER: 9Like always, this is where Aikatsu shines. Every character manages to be full of personality, albeit a little too trope filled sometimes, while still managing to be surprising.The originals duos return, and actually grow up, which I hadn't been expecting. Reflect Moon's growth arc made them much more likeable, and had them grow up in a realistic and relatable way, while showing Love Me Tear as relaxed equals instead of mentors made them seem much more likable. Pure Palette continued to evolve in unexpected ways, which I won't spoil! Honey Cat doesn't have nearly...enough screen time, but the group mixing episode was hysterical, and reminded me why I fell in love with the Friends units in the first place.This season introduces 3 characters- an older Friends pair, with flaming hot Hibiki who wants to reunite with her former friend Alicia, and lovable soloist Wakaba who auditioned to be trained by Karen. They aren't quite as unique as the others, and do at times feel a little like recycled characters from the first Aikatsu series, but they mesh in a believable way with the existing cast despite the age gap.STORY: 6And this is where this season fails. The story is driven by characters we care little about, in order to achieve a highly chiche goal via very deus ex machina methods. Wakaba's solo success feels like it undermine everything season 1 was meant to prove about friendship.While the series as a whole has always revolved around more slice-of-life storytelling - and it's in those episodes that the season excels - the attempt at a large arc is frankly painful to watch at times, being mostly talk and not a whole lot of productive action.ART: 6I love Aikatsu's dresses and cards. They far exceed any of the mediocre to downright atrocities seen on Pripara. While the CGI has improved a hundredfold since the first Aikatsu, it still needs work. For the most part the 2d animation is incredibly inconsistent, to the point that any spectacular parts are soon overshadowed by atrociously crooked faces with super wideset eyes. Then there's the fact that dozens of rare and premium cards that exist within the game were never used, in favor of repeating the same ones over and over again.SOUND: 8Aikatsu always nails the music, and this is no exception. The ED is fantastic even for an instrumental- an unusual choice for an idol show - and the insert songs are all catchy and unique. I particularly loved the addition of a gothic, cool-flavoured ballad by the new character Alicia, which have been absent from Idol shows lately.My only major qualms are the OP (I don't know why I don't like it, to be honest, I just DON'T,) and the fact they played the same songs more times than was necessary - to the point where each character only really got 1 new song this season, which was disappointing. But quality over quantity, I suppose. enough screen time, but the group mixing episode was hysterical, and reminded me why I fell in love with the Friends units in the first place.This season introduces 3 characters- an older Friends pair, with flaming hot Hibiki who wants to reunite with her former friend Alicia, and lovable soloist Wakaba who auditioned to be trained by Karen.

Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko.,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15225/Hentai_Ouji_to_Warawanai_Neko,"[""A strong cast of characters is sometimes all that is needed.Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko (referred to as HenNeko henceforth) is a romantic comedy that knows its own strengths. Rather than focusing solely on panties, cleavage and harem tropes (oh, there's still plenty of that), it delivers a genuinely refreshing experience that cleverly combines its moe appeal with a strong cast of characters.The story follows Yokodera Youto and his hidden perversions. Hidden, of course, as joining the track club solely to gape at girls is not considered socially acceptable behavior. He conceals these thoughts under a facade, acting in part as the average...highschooler so that his intentions are not misunderstood. But eventually, as just about any teenager would, he grows tired of behaving like somebody that he is not. He decides to visit a purportedly wish-granting statue to ask that he can simply be himself, and in doing so entangles himself with the fate of another: Tsukiko, who instead wishes to conceal her emotions.Immediately, you will probably find yourself thinking how silly this sounds. And you would not be wrong-- it is very much silly. The entire notion that a cat statue can somehow grant wishes (and just about any wish, really) is supremely contrived and difficult to accept. But HenNeko seldom takes this aspect seriously. There are still the occasional moments of melodrama here and there marring the overall experience, but provided you are not looking for anything more than some lighthearted fun, it is easy enough to tolerate the lacklustre storytelling. Perhaps not forgive, though.The biggest problem with the story is not necessarily that it is poorly written or abundant with plotholes, but that it relies solely on the cat statue to get anywhere. Characters don't resolve issues or develop on their own-- the statue does it for them. If it's time for some drama, hey, why not have a character wish for something inconvenient? And they do. Again and again. It becomes entirely predictable by the end. How is the audience supposed to empathize with a story that feels so artificial, so reliant upon a single plot device? It is almost too bad that a wish-granting statue doesn't exist in the real world; it could have been used to wish away the show's own issues.Thankfully the characters are enough to amend the otherwise juvenile storytelling. Aside from the lustful Yokodera, HenNeko consists primarily of three female characters: Tsukiko, the ojou-sama Azuki Azusa (she's referred to by her full name for some reason), and Tsukushi, Tsukiko's violent older sister. Chances are that if you have any potential interest in the series, moe is one of the first things that you are looking for. And HenNeko provides plenty in that regard. Hell, it is the embodiment of moe. Tsukiko may just be one of the cutest characters in anime history, though Azuki Azusa is certainly no slouch either. The only issue is that Tsukiko's seiyuu overblows the dandere trope. She sounds less monotone and more like an android.In standard harem fare, they all come to love Yokodera in some way or another. It is justified in the case of Tsukiko and Azuki Azusa, but Tsukishi's infatuation is shoehorned in from nowhere. It also baffles the mind why she somehow believes that Yokodera and his mythical younger brother (which is just a bluff of his) are separate people, despite looking, sounding and behaving identically. Somehow she is collectively the most dense and mature character of the show.Speaking of Yokodera, he is actually one of the series' strongest points. For the harem genre where the protagonist is almost invariably some blockhead with the supernatural ability to inadvertently undress girls in mid-air, a comment like that may as well be considered nonsense. But Yokodera defies the genre's mold. He is honest, knows how to communicate with people, does not run away screaming at the sight of panties, and most importantly, has a brain. He is able to instill value to his interaction with the girls and as a result (Tsukishi excluded) their feelings for him seem authentic rather than forced. HenNeko could just as easily have been another insipid harem title if Yokodera behaved like every other harem lead, but thankfully it is a show that understands the importance of a quality protagonist. I just wonder why other harem titles haven't learned the same.In terms of art, HenNeko is pleasing to the eye and uses thick lines to give the show its own visual charm. Character designs are considerably appealing and while the art fidelity may not be enough to impress, it still does the job just fine.The sound also leaves little to be desired. The seiyuu are spectacular all around with veterans like Yukari Tamura and newer names like Kaori Ishihara providing their own personality to the female characters. Yuki Kaji lends his talents to the role of Yokodera and does a stellar job overall (though initially causes some concern for previously voicing a number of aggravating protagonists). And while the background music is restrained and rarely noticeable, the opening and ending sequences are infectiously catchy and adorable. It would be insanity to skip them.Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko does not tread any new ground, but what it fails to provide in creativity it makes up for with a solid cast of characters. If you are expecting a decent story, deep themes or anything beyond some nice lighthearted fun, you will be sorely disappointed.As for fun, though?

There are few better ways to spend an afternoon."", 'You know one of those days when you\'re feeling down and is hunting for something, anything to calm your moody day? Well, that hunt might not be easy but if Henneko is something on your hit list, then you might of hit a bulls-eye. That\'s because this is an anime that will brighten the mood of your moody day. In more ways than one, Henneko caters to the fantasies of a young teenager. It focuses more on Youto Yokodera, a young boy who is going through the journey of adolescence. What he seems to be more interested than sports or academics though is of the...opposite sex. Thus begin the story, a tale of The ""Hentai"" Prince and the Stony Cat.Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. (also known as The ""Hentai"" Prince and the Stony Cat) is an anime series based off the light novel and manga of the same name. No contrary to its title, this is NOT a hentai. Rather, it\'s about a young boy named Youto Yokodera who got nicknamed with the infamous title of the “Hentai Prince” after making a certain wish onto a particuarly gifted Stony Cat. Sounds strange right? Well, that\'s just the tip of the iceberg.Coming into this series, I already knew what may be expected. It doesn\'t take long for any viewer to realize this is a typical romantic comedy. The twist here is that it involves some magic at works in the form of the Stony Cat. So begins this strange tale, the story of the Hentai Prince. Note that not everything starts out like this though. In fact, while it\'s obvious that Youto is seen a pervert to viewers, the series doesn\'t directly depict these traits until after he makes his wish to the Stony Cat. It\'s the result of a wish he made and there\'s a saying that always stays true: be careful what you wish for.Unfortunately for Youto , he isn\'t very careful and now has to deal with the consequences.For Youto, the boy is naturally a pervert. He likes to read \'ecchi\' magazines of perverted nature. He joined the track team so that he can actually see the girls in their swimsuits (the pool is close to the tracks). And of course, he often references to shows that he watches to heighten his interests. Despite his faults though,Youto  at the same time is also shown to be a kind boy who often comes to the aid of others especially his female friends. He also seems to be somewhat clever with a crafty mind as he is able to manipulate a certain track leader into believing some obvious false ideas. Needless to say, Youto is the type of boy that\'s hard to be friends with unless you know his true visage.Among the people Youto meets in the series includes the adorable Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi. Being presented as both the mascot as well as the main female character, she is the younger sister of the Steel King and someone that accidentally also falls in the case of \'be careful what you wish for\' category. Unlike Yuto, the wish she called for made her emotionless. Now, she is like a cat but without the excitement. At the same time, it seems that she and Youto has a sort of deal to get back what they\'ve lost. It\'s a relationship of awkwardness and benefits all the same time.Throughout the series, Youto also establishes connections with other characters in particular with a school beauty named Azusa. As an animal lover, she is admired as a school idol, a wealthy lady, and someone who is to be respected by everyone. Despite her outer self, Azusa seems to be quite insecure with herself and often mistrusts people because of her past. Her first encounter with Youto seems to be some sort of fate because for the first time, we see her insecurities manifest thanks to Youto and his new personality granted by the Stony Cat. So much for being a goddess...The series follows more of a story arc telling format rather than a straight out story. However, the most common features of each episode involves Youto and what he does with his new situation. Of the many new changes in his life, one is his more closeness to three of the main female characters in the series. Youto gets closer with Azusa, Tsukushi (the “Steel King”), and Tsukiko as each episode progresses. Despite being labeled as the \'hentai prince\', Youto is also surprisingly reliable at key situations. His reliability as well as ability to help others earns him more affections from the girls. As a matter fact, they seems to see the better side of him and even goes to lengths to return the favor at various points.There is also a whole cluster of moments and gags that calls out \'cute\' throughout every episode. The opening song itself is one with the expressions of our main characters. Its animal-like gestures, high pitched vocals, and moe artwork paints this series as a headline for cuteness. It doesn\'t stop there either with the cutey artwork. There\'s the way that Tsukiko moves and way she eats that are formulated from the extra gags. Among other moments, there\'s the tsundere-like behavior of Azusa where she flatly denies what\'s really on her mind. Speaking of which, Azusa herself also shows her love of animals. Whether you\'re an animal lover or not, the show goes to portray many analogies. A clear example is Tsukiko likeness of a cat while Azusa seems to be fond of dogs. Naturally, the two sides don\'t get along just like the two girls. And naturally, Youto is the center of the drama when it comes to the duo.Despite the series having many comedy moments, there is also some serious times when we see that characters are more troubled than what they seem to be. Azusa is one of those characters especially with her past and Youto does his best to help her out. Then, there\'s also the tensions between the two sisters that balances between silliness and moody at various circumstances. It\'s hard to take them serious but at the same time, it\'s clear that there\'s something deeper going on between them.Even though the series is cute, there\'s many overused themes of a typical romantic comedy in Henneko that might turn some viewers off. There\'s plenty of fan service like the traditional beach episode. In fact, because the school has a pool, it\'s natural that the girls will be in their swimsuits. Therefore, expect some of those gratuitous outfits to hit the screen some time here and there. Among other little gags in the series are the various misunderstandings. In one fact, among one of these misunderstandings turns into more of a serious admiration for the Steel King. Furthermore, the Steel King is portrayed as the sex symbol of the show with her well developed body (thanks to her status as president of the track team) and sexy moans during exercises. It turns the physical education class into a theme of fan service and one that is presented clearly with both the vocals and visuals. It doesn\'t stop there either as we also have the master/servant like relationship, the repetitive tsundere-like behavior of Azusa, and later on seemingly a harem being under construction by our hentai prince.For J.C. Staff production, this series makes usage of its more colorful atmosphere. The way artwork is enforced throughout the series brings out the fairy tale-like cuteness of most of the characters. It is not realistic but rather overly flows with cuteness and moe. Given the setting of the romantic comedy genre, it does fit the overall idea. I\'m not sure what the objective it\'s trying to achieve but if cuteness was one of them, it nailed it on the spot. At other times though, it tries way too hard and the characters\' designs are generic. The petite figure, the flat chest, and the well developed bodies for our three main female characters shapes the different sides of this anime. There\'s nothing unique to see here but it\'s kawaii.The soundtrack of the series clearly is lighthearted. It also seems that a lot of times, it puts more effort into each and every single tiny moment to bring out the cute factors. These can also turn into more lewd moments such as our Steel King and her erotic moans. It does match though with our small cast of main characters and the way they portray is also expressed in their voice actors/actresses. The softness of Tsukiko\'s voice is a more prominent example as we can clearly see that she lost most of her emotions. Finally, both the OP and ED songs of this series brings out cuteness and moe at its best. The way the OP song is overflowed with adorable moments and gif worthy material. The ED song fits with the same flow with the dancing moments of Tsukiko and her adorable outfits. It\'s needless to say that in terms of audio features, Henneko brings out \'cuteness\' at its best.Ultimately, the end game of this series is how you might decide to watch Henneko. If cuteness is something you\'re looking for to brighten up that moody day you just had, then this series is definitely something to hit the play button on. Otherwise, enjoyment can come in different shapes and sizes. For one thing though, the series itself is hard to take serious even with its more moody moments. The fan service and little fun gags can give different results depending on how you view them. Otherwise, Henneko is a series that is probably not a masterpiece for me. I might forget it in the future. However, those cuteness and adorable moments are hard to take my eyes off of. opposite sex.

Staff production, this series makes usage of its more colorful atmosphere. The way artwork is enforced throughout the series brings out the fairy tale-like cuteness of most of the characters. It is not realistic but rather overly flows with cuteness and moe. Given the setting of the romantic comedy genre, it does fit the overall idea. I\'m not sure what the objective it\'s trying to achieve but if cuteness was one of them, it nailed it on the spot. At other times though, it tries way too hard and the characters\' designs are generic. The petite figure, the flat chest, and the well developed bodies for our three main female characters shapes the different sides of this anime. There\'s nothing unique to see here but it\'s kawaii.The soundtrack of the series clearly is lighthearted. It also seems that a lot of times, it puts more effort into each and every single tiny moment to bring out the cute factors. These can also turn into more lewd moments such as our Steel King and her erotic moans. It does match though with our small cast of main characters and the way they portray is also expressed in their voice actors/actresses. The softness of Tsukiko\'s voice is a more prominent example as we can clearly see that she lost most of her emotions. Finally, both the OP and ED songs of this series brings out cuteness and moe at its best. The way the OP song is overflowed with adorable moments and gif worthy material. The ED song fits with the same flow with the dancing moments of Tsukiko and her adorable outfits. It\'s needless to say that in terms of audio features, Henneko brings out \'cuteness\' at its best.Ultimately, the end game of this series is how you might decide to watch Henneko. If cuteness is something you\'re looking for to brighten up that moody day you just had, then this series is definitely something to hit the play button on. Otherwise, enjoyment can come in different shapes and sizes. For one thing though, the series itself is hard to take serious even with its more moody moments. The fan service and little fun gags can give different results depending on how you view them. Otherwise, Henneko is a series that is probably not a masterpiece for me. I might forget it in the future. However, those cuteness and adorable moments are hard to take my eyes off of.', 'For an anime with such an evocative title, Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko is actually a fairly...acceptably clean slice-of-life comedy with some really, really bizarre plot twists and characters. A harem-type anime, HenNeko tries to break the archetype by just being extremely weird, but still keeping comedy and romance at a harem-type best. While it may be a bit overly ""fuwa fuwa"" in both art and character design, Hentai Ouji delivers a compelling and hilarious story of a misunderstood high-school boy and his series of mishaps with the girls around him, all controlled by a mysterious cat statue. Definitely a good anime.Story (8/10)Art (9/10)Sound (7/10)Character...(7/10)Enjoyment (8/10)The story is definitely Hentai Ouji\'s unique point. The Warawanai Neko acts as the wildcard of the anime, allowing the plot of the anime to justify extending infinitely in any direction. Basically, since the Warawanai Neko can grant any wish at a cost (think Tsubasa Chronicles), anything is game and the world can be destroyed at the whim of the characters. Of course, the foundation of the plot is still the whole ""high-school-boy-with-a-bunch-of-girls-in-love-with-him"", but that\'s what a harem-type anime is and, frankly, it never gets old. As long as there\'s enough variation and excitement to distinguish the story, which author Sou Sagara did admirably. Anime, manga, and light novel are all consistent with regards to storyline, which is fantastic. Only grievance? The plot gets pretty wild at times, so the story gets somewhat difficult to follow.Round, chubby, cute and fluffy. Four words to describe this anime\'s art style. Just look at the OP - the artists were clearly trying to give people heart attacks. Naturally, not everyone likes this kind of art style. I will agree, sometimes an anime too based in this kind of cuteness becomes hard to watch (I\'m sorry, K-On!). But the art is good - you can\'t deny that. It\'s really encouraging to see an anime where the artists were clearly given ample time to draw, design, and really give the characters life.The music fits with the art style, but it takes the puffiness to another level. Lots of bells, tinkles, and chimes. Half of the OST seems to be played on the xylophone. Creates a great mood, but the theme limits the songs to be just ""cute"" pieces instead of timeless tunes.The characters in Hentai Ouji are full of various controversies. They are...quite stereotypical. The perverted high schoolboy. The silent Nagato-type. The tsundere. The yandere. The little sister. Classic tried and true roles, yes, but almost no effort given to move the characters even a bit out of their roles. The perveted main character, especially, while not often used, is a difficult character role to pull of because of the divided mixed reactions it usually receives - either people love it or hate it. And its still a commonly-used mold. The only character that seems to be a bit unique is Ponta - it\'s been a while since a side-character\'s given up hedonism for world peace.BUT.They are so well developed, it\'s hard not to love them. Despite their actions being predictable, despite their words being overused, despite the fact that you could probably guess every next move in the entire anime, the characters are developed in such a way that you really appreciate them in all their cliche-ness. I particularly like the amount of work and detail they put into Asuna\'s character - she\'s beyond the normal tsundere and in a class of her own.Whether laughing at Yokodera\'s antics or empathizing with Tsukiko\'s issues, the anime is quite able to bring the story alive and deliver it in an enjoyable package. The anime moves at a rapid pace - 4 episodes managed to knock out the entire first volume of the series. This change of pace is well-needed, and its refreshing to see Yokodera completing routes so quickly. The ending was one of the best conclusions to a 12-episode anime I have ever seen, nicely wrapping up the plotline while offering a sweet and memorable scene. Any ending that can make characters seem even cooler than they already were is a great ending in my book.Overall (8/10)All in all, HenNeko is a great anime to watch - funny, charming, and crazy. Would recommend this to anyone in need of some new anime to track in 2013. (7/10)Enjoyment (8/10)The story is definitely Hentai Ouji\'s unique point.

Would recommend this to anyone in need of some new anime to track in 2013.', 'Usually, anything with the word ""hentai"" in it is instantly thrown out the window for most people, as its word association is for the most part, is towards porn, as hentai means ""pervert"" in the japanese language.  Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko, or the hentai prince and stony cat in english uses that word in such a way, that it almost means nothing, in this pretty damn good rom-com.Story (8.05/10): The story of Hentai Ouji (simplifying the title), bases itself around Youto Yokodera, an open pervert, as many can guess from the title.  Through a series of circumstances involving the best friend character...giving up his pervert ways, and Youto\'s own desire to be open about being perverted, as well as hearing about a wish granting cat statue thing, Youto meets a girl named Tsukiko, who attempts to also make a wish, only to find out that both of them are discontent with their new lives, and make a pact about getting back what is theirs.Above all, this story is as imaginative and original as they come.  Personally, I have never seen a story quite like this before, and because of that, it piqued my interest.  However, it should be noted that that story only pertains to about 3 or so episodes.The anime\'s plotline is split in about 3 or so arcs where it mainly focuses on 3 of the main characters.  (The last one arguably focuses on 2 at one time.)   Each of the arcs having their own separate focus as a whole.  It\'s to the point that since the anime stems so far from the original idea, that the story becomes a completely different thing altogether.  However, though this sounds like a terrible thing, the story actually fits together really well, and provides a very good viewing experience.  Personally, I liked how the anime went, because I was never really bored with it at all.Characters (8.45/10): These characters are actually pretty damn good.  First, the hentai prince, Youto Yokodera.  First of all, why is it always the perverted guy in anime, that always somehow gets the girls?  Youto is a very interesting character as his pervertedness throughout the whole series is almost non-existent.  Sure, he has porn mags, an obsession with having Tsukiko as his little sister, and above all, has perverted thoughts, but as a whole, he never seems to actually portray that too much.  Rather, he\'s actually a really kind and nice character.  However, he does at times act a bit denser then he should be. (as all male protagonists are)  His character does get fleshed out at the end of the series, and really provides a nice backstory for him, adding to why he\'s actually a pretty good character.By the way, backstory is a huge thing that this anime does really well.Tsukiko, as the main female lead, is one of the more...interesting kuuderes in anime.  Because of her wish, she became emotionless, showing absolutely no different tone in her voice, no emotions, no embarrassed facial expression, well, you get the point.  Unlike most female characters that refuse to admit they like someone, Tsukiko...cannot.  Because she literally has no emotions at all, the denseness that Youto has when talking to her makes a lot of sense, as you really can\'t tell what she\'s actually feeling at that moment in time.  While yes, she is a good character, seeing as how she acts as Youto\'s voice of reason, as well as being extremely cute, they never really solve her problem in the anime, basically turning her into this emotionless doll, as they forget her whole purpose for meeting Youto as they did, and essentially, making the original idea of the story, null.The other main characters like my personal favorite, Azusa and Tsukushi also have their part in the grand scheme of things, becoming the other 2 aforementioned main cast, and have very good fleshed out characteristics, that make their characters really good.Various other characters, act as pretty good supporting cast, adding in more to the story, as well as fleshing out the main 4 characters more, which they excel at doing.  Above all, the characters are definitely this anime\'s strong suit, and it really shows it clearly.Sound and Art (7.25/10 and 7.48/10): The sound for this anime is somewhat generic I would say.  It sounds really adorable, I will give it that, and the mood fillers for the anime do sound good and very appropriate for where they\'re placed.  The OP and ED I would say are good but not overly fantastic.  It\'s nice to listen to, and the lyrics are as cute and adorable as they would come, but I wouldn\'t say it would be something that you would remember for a long time.The art I would say is above average.  The art is very light colored and somewhat moe heavy, as the majority of the female cast are in fact, moe.  The characters themselves aren\'t too overcomplicated in terms of design, and are definitely crisp in their design as well.  It\'s very simplistic and very nice to look at.Personal Enjoyment (8.67/10): Hentai Ouji to Warawani neko is definitely your above-average rom-com/harem show.  (It gets a bit haremy towards the end.)  Personally, I was never bored with the series, and enjoyed watching every moment.  The comedy is pretty funny, I love the characters, and the story was plenty deep and interesting to keep me watching.  I did feel that the story felt a bit incomplete, and would\'ve liked to see more, but for the most part, I\'m happy with what I watched.  I did feel like it went a bit side-story like towards the middle; as well as losing a significant amount of its original idea as the story progressed, but it did finish itself quite nicely, and I will say that I was somewhat pleased on how the characters, and everything else turned out in the end.  I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys a rom-com/harem/ecchi (there\'s not that much) show; or anyone that enjoys a good drama.Overall Score: 7.89/10.Still hoping for a second season so we could fix Tsukiko.  It sorta pissed me off seeing that she was never fixed. giving up his pervert ways, and Youto\'s own desire to be open about being perverted, as well as hearing about a wish granting cat statue thing, Youto meets a girl named Tsukiko, who attempts to also make a wish, only to find out that both of them are discontent with their new lives, and make a pact about getting back what is theirs.Above all, this story is as imaginative and original as they come.

But I\'m pleasantly surprised with what I\'ve seen in the first 5 episodes.By far the best feature of the show is the comedy. The extreme bluntness of the main characters speeches have me laughing my ass off in the first couple of episodes.

There are also several very generic plot scenarios in the series, such as the old ""walking in while she\'s changing/washing bit"".The soundtrack isn\'t mindbogglingly good, but there are a few catchy tunes buried in there.In summary the show has started strong mainly due to its strong character relationships and hilarious comedy (at least to me anyway) the series looks set to become my \'guilty pleasure\' of this season, I\'m hoping it stays this good for the full series and doesn\'t try and become more serious and through away the comedy aspect. there own unique characteristics that really help differentiate this from just another school harem.

While re-watching Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko I  felt like the producers were adding too many elements to the story at once. One moment I\'m hearing about the stony cat, next moment they\'re talking about losing facades, expressions etc. It\'s like, I felt that it would\'ve  been better if they let the story plot and events unfold one at a time rather than all at once because it felt like a mess.(as much as I wanted to like them) hated the...characters.  Generic, archetypes, expressionless character with lame over used ""sad"" or depressing backstory,  more than annoying ""Rich-ish"" Tsundere, and lastly pure vanilla, plain perverted MC you see in every other harem, romance, comedy. It\'s like at first I though if I gave them more time then I would open up to them and find at least one of the main characters funny, or at the  very least cute however, to my dismay, I could not.I seriously considered dropping this show after episode 5 because that is the  episode where I lost all interest however as a upcoming reviewer along with personal reasons its\' sort of a ""No-No"" to drop a showunless they are longer than 30-40 episodes. It really bothered me, or dare I say ""annoyed"" me that I couldn\'t find any redeeming qualities about  hentai prince and the stony cat. Characters, music, comedy, etc, none of it could really make up for the atrocity that I had been watching.Speaking of characters again, character designs were pretty interesting. When I\'m looking at characters in anime I always try and point out what makes them different or unique. Sometimes it\'s the facial expressions, other times it\'s personalities, in Henneko\'s case it was the characters eyes. Boobs didn\'t stand out, panties didn\'t stand out, they eyes did. I found that most of the characters eyes sort of reflect their personalities. For example, Tsukiko or whatever her name was, her eyes are a dull blue which reflects and in my opinion complements her personality.... boring, expressionless personality.Ughh, now for my least favorite thing about Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko.... the intro or opening song.. It was perhaps the most cringe-worthy and annoying-est song I\'ve heard in a while. I mean, it\'s great that its\' one of those intros that pretty much give you an idea about what the show is about however the actually song is just ewww! Honestly I cannot think of a single person to recommend this show to. Like it tries to be cute, tries to be a bit erotic and it just does not work. From a comedic standpoint though, it does have it\'s moments of laughter, however for me it\'s simply not enough. It doesn\'t make up for the rest of the terrible crap it gave to me.

What matters is how the anime impacted on the viewers. How it leaves an impression for its viewers. And how it leaves the mind lingering in a positive way.I hope my review will pique your interest. I won\'t say any spoilers.Your common romcom, as so I thought. There is a love triangle involved, but it didn\'t seem like it focused much on the love. After a few episode, it seems like your common love triangle. But you know what? It\'s a very good romcom. I thought why stop halfway, so I...finished it. If you watch a few episodes in the series, you already know who the it is, and that\'s as common as it gets honestly. But the point was it surprised me so much. I didn\'t expect any of this to happen. The twist and turn of events made it really, really, really enjoyable.Summary(little more in-depth):Yoto Yokodera, your normal pervert. Who has a problem of not showing his real emotions.  Hearing the big change and rumor of the "" stony cat "" from his equally perverted best friend. He went to see if the rumors were true. On his way, he met Tsukiko Tsusukakushi. She wanted to be more of an adult and wanted the opposite of what Yokodera wanted. The wish can remove a personality trait from someone that doesn\'t want it. and gives that trait to someone who needs it. Thus Yokodera found the person who has his trait. Azusa Azuki, the most attractive girl that every boy confesses to.

I think it really shows that you have to understand each other as friends. What happens in the past stays in the past. You can\'t dwell in it forever, or change it. You just have to make it work in the present. finished it. If you watch a few episodes in the series, you already know who the it is, and that\'s as common as it gets honestly. But the point was it surprised me so much. I didn\'t expect any of this to happen. The twist and turn of events made it really, really, really enjoyable.Summary(little more in-depth):Yoto Yokodera, your normal pervert. Who has a problem of not showing his real emotions.  Hearing the big change and rumor of the "" stony cat "" from his equally perverted best friend. He went to see if the rumors were true. On his way, he met Tsukiko Tsusukakushi. She wanted to be more of an adult and wanted the opposite of what Yokodera wanted. The wish can remove a personality trait from someone that doesn\'t want it. and gives that trait to someone who needs it. Thus Yokodera found the person who has his trait.

The story is barely coherent and the plot twists are more like back flips induced by characters to maintain a harem, create an opportunity for hit and miss comedy and create an explosion, LITERALLY AN EXPLOSION, of moe.Since we now know why you are watching let's get to the good, the bad and the moe.Story 4/10There is no story, or not at least one meant for any decent inspiration or contemplation.  It exists only so that there...are ways for moe to be exploited like a gold mine from the girls.  Which is why I won't mention the characters as you can guess that there also just for moe and harem antics, no development you haven't seen or even care to see.  Of all the LN adaptations in the Spring of 2013, none have as badly cobbled together a piece of plot as it (even the awful Oreimo S2). Clearly a bad, but not a con because who watches moe for story.Art 7/10The man behind the art of the series is a genius, well known in Japan for how f****** adorable he makes anime and manga girls.  Those sparkly eyes, beautiful slender bodies and triangular faces are the thing of legend.  The animation is the stock of JC's B team and not worthy of much mention other than thank god it's not like Aku no Hana.  It's average at best.Sound 10/10I could listen to both the ED and OP on loop for an age and still feel the buzz of moe, it's that irritatingly good.  Surely everyone (even guys) have sung Carly Rae Jepsen's 'Call me maybe' and just as that is stuck in our heads so is HenNeko's songs.  But that alone would not garner a 10/10.  What did though is the shocking moe, made for the role, brilliant voice acting of all our leading ladies.  My personal favourite is Ishihara Kaori's Azuki Azusa.  The other great thing is that Kaiji Yuki is not Kaiji Yuki from Guilty Crown and thus not an annoying youth who shouts garbage like a dump truck.  He talks more like a regular human and thus cannot annoy people off.Enjoyment 9/10I hate K-ON, I hate Oreimo, I hate effectively every single moe blob show of the last 4 years but I like HenNeko. I haven't converted or anything but the sound and art so damn moe that I am enticed like a drunk virgin to a beautiful prostitute.  I just can't help it.  I don't get annoyed the same way as though shows because I have accepted the purpose of the show is to ultimately wet my pants and buy some BDs (which I will).Overall 6/10If I love it so much how can I rate it just a 6?  Because I realize that as an anime its crap but its crap that somehow I love.  Plenty of other people who have not been seduced will know its crap and its better they do.  But as I have explained its crap that I don't mind smearing my face with. are ways for moe to be exploited like a gold mine from the girls.

Boy was I in for a surprise, it turned how to be very good and was unexpected of the entertainment value I receive. How awesome would it be to have a Cat God grant any wish of your desire, but does it come with a cost?Story-8The story centers aroud Youto Yokodera who is rather an ""average joe"" highschool student. Due to his perverted nature, his actions are always being misunderstood thus having a problem of expressing inner self. After hearing a story from a...childhood friend he goes to the Cat God statue where it is said it can grant any wish but as a twist of events, there is a give and take consequence which is the downside to it. His wish was to make it impossible for him to lie to help out with his personal problem of expressing himself for a belt of a hug pillow he offered in exchange, the twist to that was he lost his facade about his perverted nature. He later realizes that this has made him painfully honest to others which has caused trouble for others and embarrassment for himself so he then teams up with his childhood friend in Tsukiko who lost her emotions due to her experience of the Cat God Statue, and they are on a mission to reverse their wishes.I also  like how unique and entertaining this anime can get with some of the most hilarious comedy scenes that you will see i assure you the story is fun simple and enjoyableCharacters-8About the characters you have Youto Yokodera that has a  perverted nature but besides he is a nice and reliable person that sometimes tries to use his \'facade\' to trick the other girls you also got Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi she is the tsundere type and that makes her very likeable the other characters are love interests to the main character.Art-7In saying that, the animation was very fluid and maintained a good quality throughoutSound-7After you get past the opening you are all good the OST are pretty good didin\'t find one that piqued my interest thoughOverall-8I really love and enjoy the story characters even the art well about the sound like i said nothing that you can remember \'avarage\'\' but that opening oh god maybe its just me but i really find it annoying after the end i demand a second season childhood friend he goes to the Cat God statue where it is said it can grant any wish but as a twist of events, there is a give and take consequence which is the downside to it.

a boring story, putting ecchi art like any other anime. as with just looking at the title ""hentai"". however, still can not judge just by its cover. after watching it to completion, the story is incredible.At the beginning of the episode, the story begins with a silly and outspoken main character. then began to emerge an interesting path like the power of a cat statue, and how the personality can move on to others. and of course I did not expect it.then the story began to continue how the power of the...cat was indeed influential and really work. it is very interesting and of course that makes the audience feel something else in the anime ecchi genre. so of course for me that is a new thing.especially when the story continues at the climax. where the main character goes to the past to understand what really happened. it\'s really impressive how the author created many paths that made me and possibly other audiences amazed. the ending was also satisfying, making the audience happy because there is no odd and disappointing decisions. really this anime is unique and great.about music, I can not say much because it is an anime is different story. as is not expected from anime with this kind of genre. but also quite interesting where the background music can make the moment more tense or boring.about the characters, quite impressive because the author really creates a character without emotion. such as how they feel sad, happy, scared, embarrassed, yet still show a flat and innocent expression.and about other characters are also quite fun how they try to make this anime stay alive and not feel weird. such as interspersed with a lot of humor, sadness, and of course the ecchi itself.about art is pretty good. how the character designer can make a fixed figure put up a flat face while feeling different things. but basically, everything is very nice and amazing. good work, JCS.My recommendation, if you are looking for anime different from anime humor, ecchi, and romance usually, this anime is very worthy for you to watch.Overall, a good anime. cat was indeed influential and really work. it is very interesting and of course that makes the audience feel something else

I\'ve seen plenty of anime with a decent plot line but really weak characters, but this is the first time I\'ve ever seen a flip-flop like this. And perhaps you also agree, if you\'ve already watched this show.Enter the main characters: first up, Youto Yokodera. A pervert by nature, Youto is basically every high school boy: he will do anything in his power to see girls...... well you get the point. Next up, Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi (say that five times fast). Tsukiko is an emotionless, monotonous girl...who likes to eat food (who doesn\'t?). Third: Azusa Azuki, a strong-headed girl with a lot of willpower - it\'s either her way or no way. Finally, Tsukushi Tsutsukakushi (what is up with these names lol), Youto\'s track captain, and as you\'ll see later in the anime, an extremely important figure during Youto\'s younger childhood years.A simple, small cast of main characters with a lot of potential - which this anime fortunately delivers.Every main character undergoes significant development. If you watch closely, you\'ll learn why Youto can\'t remember anything from his childhood; why Tsukiko acts the way she does and why she was willing to sacrifice her emotions for another significant person in her life; why Azusa behaves the way she does and how it\'s basically Youto\'s fault; and, finally, how Tsukushi\'s life forever changed when she met Youto.If the character development is what allows this anime to take five steps forward, the plot is what makes it take five steps back.The plot is absolutely haywire. My main problem with this anime is the use of the ""Cat God."" Need a reason to push the plot forward? Cat God to the rescue! Want to create tension among the characters for some trivial reason? Cat God to the rescue! Want to successfully pull off a deus ex machina? Cat God to the rescue! Too many times does this show treat the Cat God as a gimmick, and for that, it fails on the plot.You\'ll also see how many of the side characters fall out the plot after one particular scene. To many people, this seems fine - after all, the story doesn\'t center around the side characters; but particularly take note of how they exit, ESPECIALLY Morii and Moriya.Aside from that, however, this show was very enjoyable. It was comedic, light-hearted, and funny. Characters were all drawn with thick lines; voice acting and sound were decent. All put aside, this is definitely a show worth watching if you\'re trying to kill off a lazy Sunday afternoon.tl;drStory: 2Art: 7Sound: 5Character: 9Enjoyment: 8Overall: 5Pros:- Impressive character development- Comedic, light-hearted- Art is on pointCons:- Too many plot inconsistencies- Too many plot holes- Side characters exited out of the show unexpectedly - and this was done in  a poor fashion. who likes to eat food (who doesn\'t?).

I only limit to to such score co\'z the story depends on the said proverb.Art- fair 6.There maybe some fanservice that them dogs would howl for by, it was nice that there isn\'t such intense nudity involved especially when it come to Tsukushi\'s tits.Sound- good 7.The score is for the op and ed, as for Youto\'s VA, I would have prefer if would have been done by  Soichiro Hoshi since his perverted tone from ""Sora No Othoshimono"" would have been perfect,instead of  Yuki Kaji whose voice is too immature for the said character.Character- very good 8.The score is for Tsukiko and Azusa since it was these two who contributed to this anime\'s touching drama, as for Youto, well he\'s not bad to be this anime\'s clown.Enjoyment- very good 8.I like that this anime can shift from comedy to drama, most especially the last 2 episodes of this anime, where it was a Tsukiko and Youto arc.Overall-  fair 6.Ok, so it was a funny and touching anime and the title fit well to this anime\'s theme, I gave it a 6 for the overall since it ended in a double standard at one hand we have Youto confessing and kissing Azusa and on the other hand we see him doing the same with Tsukiko, what pisses me off was how studio J.C Staff decided to end this anime that is like eating something nice only to spit it out, but that\'s just me.Adios, muchachos.

In many ways.First off it started like any normal anime these days: with a perverted male going on and on about swimsuits and what not. Then it turned into semi-magical anime where a cat statue grants wishes. Then it become a semi-love story with lot of harem. Then it went back to the cat statue that grants wishes, only this time everyone could use it. Then it became a mess of sorts and I got totally confused by the episode. And then it turned into a full-blown sad story through the cat statue where they go into the past to...uncover the mysteries of the present. And when they return, its back to the harem non-sense.In all honesty, it feels like Yami did a mind crush on me. This anime is more random than a random generator. But for all its non-sense, its not a bad anime. I liked it. But I have to say that the last 3-4 episodes were kind of pointless. Its like the author suddenly thought that this anime isn\'t serious enough, so let\'s fill it with serious content. Why? Wouldn\'t it have been easier for the girl to just say ""okay I\'m not your first""?I recommend it, but you will have to decide on its genre because its fuck all. uncover the mysteries of the present.

There\'s still a lot I want to tell you about!)The above quote is from the OP with is EXTREMELY moe-moe, but don\'t worry, this time, this anime ISN\'T just cute girls doing cute things: there\'s actually a plot. (*GASP*)NOTE: skip to the end of the review to for a ""quick summary"" of why you would or would not like this show.UPDATE: I just checked the rules and saw that you\'re not supposed to add pointless stuff in the review. I know that\'s obvious but added them anyway so... removing em...now. (JMURNIR\'s questions seem like what  prospective viewers might ask, so I\'m keeping them)also added minor stuff i apparently missed in the rules.STORY: 10/10> wait... an anime with hentai in a title actually having a plot? are you SERIOUS?!yep, just read on my just-made-up-right-now-imaginary-reader. or JMURNIR(hey, are you Nordic?)anyway, yes. the plot can be read in the anime\'s synopsis area, check it out.> JMURNIR: Okay, so it\'s about a pervert and an overly emotional girl who> wishes to change by praying to a Cat-god... how is this awesome?...it\'s awesome because their wish actually worked. and very effectively to the point it affected their social lives. and this is where most of the plot\'s conflicts arises: from the Cat-god.explaining that part further will just be too much spoilers. so let\'s drop the subject and move on.As said, the ""genie kitty"" is the show\'s major source of conflict, the character\'s decision greatly affect their relationships with each other. everyone grows a bit and change because of these experiences. in other words, there\'s plenty of character development.but aside from that, there\'s also the humor. the show uses it\'s Cookie-Cutter-Cutout-People (CCCP for short, nothing to do with the codec pack)  to set up jokes. pretty normal, except as said, some of these gags actually develop the plot. (surprise Bondage and Humiliation anyone?)ART:10/10the art style is cute, the environments are nice (hard to find badly made backgrounds these days, if you see one, message me.), I haven\'t seen off model moments as well. so yeah, no complaints on this department.Aside from that, is the art style memorable? to me, it is, The face designs are very recognizable, the uniform designs, not much. then again, why would you need that when you have a solid plot? no one complains that everyone wears suits in a well written mafia movie.There\'s also the nice special effects. which wasn\'t exactly what I was expecting in this anime. because why would a Slice of life need complex sfx? anyway, detailing what particular SFX was used would be a spoiler, so just see for yourself. (around EP 7, if i recall correctly)Sound: 10/10I haven\'t skipped the op or ed ever since I started watching. seriously, it\'s THAT catchy.the songs in the anime itself are pretty good too. mood setting music is great. everything fits well. however, it\'s pretty standard fair for this kind of anime. nothing memorable save for the op/ed. but why is it STILL 10/10 you ask? because it still made me wanna watch the anime with HQ speakers.Voice acting (briefly) detailed the character section.CHARACTER: 10/10> JMURNIR: Alright, now you\'re just overrating this anime!......This deserves a 10 for two things.1. The voice acting is top notch.Tsukiko\'s VA Yui Ogura did a great job portraying her. I\'m singling her out of the rest--who all did excellent jobs themselves, but it\'s just Tsukiko\'s character is unique for what she is because her delivery and lines do a great job of making the character seem more than meets the eye. (no, she unfortunately does not yell ""TRANSFORMERS ROLL OUT!"" at any point in the show, but explaining how she acts with the character will be a spoiler)2. The characters have Personas.No, not the firefox term for Themes nor Atlus\'s franchise. They\'re WAYY more than what they are supposed to be(for this kind of show, that is, otherwise, they\'ll pale in comparison to any decent mature anime)Watching them interact with each other we learn that they\'re more than CCCP, they have dreams(no matter how childish, they WERE kids when they made it after all),they have normal pasts that most people can relate with. even the ones that come out as petty are actually less petty than they seem once you get to know them.In case we aren\'t clear persona=facade, so for example, that nice girl you helped on the way home actually cursed and found you disgusting and showed that only when no one was looking.The characters have well thought out pasts and aspirations and hence come off as more than just yet another Moeblob, Tsundere, Ojou, Hentai, etc. in other words, they are not just mere Stock Characters/Stereotypes, they\'re actual characters.So yeah, save for THE stock characters (ganguros, main character\'s best friend) this anime is some sort of Lite Deconstruction for some anime stereotypes. with ""Be Careful What You Wish For""  as the main driving force of the plot.> JMURNIR: whoa, they sure seem deep. Now I wanna see this even more!I\'d like to repeat, even if you say they\'re deep. they\'re still deep only if you compare them to others in the genre. don\'t expect Evangelion level character depth here.> JMURNIR: fair enough. I won\'t expect that much then.anyway:ENJOYMENT: 10/10Personally, I watched for the moe and stayed for the character development. It has excellent humor and tasteful fanservice. There is no dull moment in this anime. even on slower segments you\'ll feel like you\'re right there with the characters, sitting like an unseen observer. It\'s rare for me to be this absorbed on anime. the last time I got this hooked was on Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.> JMURNIR:whoa, big words there, pal. I\'ll just have to see> for myself if it\'s as good as you say then!Yes, please do.and now...OVERALL: 10/10For people who like: moe, character development, cute characters, anime stereotypes.NOT for people who like: Madoka-level deconstruction(EDIT: as in it\'s not to Madoka\'s level, hence not worth watching exclusively for it), ecchi on young looking characters, serious shows. now. (JMURNIR\'s questions seem like what  prospective viewers might ask, so I\'m keeping them)also added minor stuff i apparently missed in the rules.STORY: 10/10> wait... an anime with hentai in a title actually having a plot? are you SERIOUS?!yep, just read on my just-made-up-right-now-imaginary-reader. or JMURNIR(hey, are you Nordic?)anyway, yes. the plot can be read in the anime\'s synopsis area, check it out.> JMURNIR: Okay, so it\'s about a pervert and an overly emotional girl who> wishes to change by praying to a Cat-god... how is this awesome?...it\'s awesome because their wish actually worked. and very effectively to the point it affected their social lives. and this is where most of the plot\'s conflicts arises: from the Cat-god.explaining that part further will just be too much spoilers. so let\'s drop the subject and move on.As said, the ""genie kitty"" is the show\'s major source of conflict, the character\'s decision greatly affect their relationships with each other. everyone grows a bit and change because of these experiences. in other words, there\'s plenty of character development.but aside from that, there\'s also the humor. the show uses it\'s Cookie-Cutter-Cutout-People (CCCP for short, nothing to do with the codec pack)  to set up jokes. pretty normal, except as said, some of these gags actually develop the plot. (surprise Bondage and Humiliation anyone?)ART:10/10the art style is cute, the environments are nice (hard to find badly made backgrounds these days, if you see one, message me.), I haven\'t seen off model moments as well. so yeah, no complaints on this department.Aside from that, is the art style memorable? to me, it is, The face designs are very recognizable, the uniform designs, not much. then again, why would you need that when you have a solid plot? no one complains that everyone wears suits in a well written mafia movie.There\'s also the nice special effects. which wasn\'t exactly what I was expecting in this anime. because why would a Slice of life need complex sfx? anyway, detailing what particular SFX was used would be a spoiler, so just see for yourself. (around EP 7, if i recall correctly)Sound: 10/10I haven\'t skipped the op or ed ever since I started watching. seriously, it\'s THAT catchy.the songs in the anime itself are pretty good too. mood setting music is great. everything fits well. however, it\'s pretty standard fair for this kind of anime. nothing memorable save for the op/ed. but why is it STILL 10/10 you ask? because it still made me wanna watch the anime with HQ speakers.Voice acting (briefly) detailed the character section.CHARACTER: 10/10> JMURNIR: Alright, now you\'re just overrating this anime!......This deserves a 10 for two things.1. The voice acting is top notch.Tsukiko\'s VA Yui Ogura did a great job portraying her. I\'m singling her out of the rest--who all did excellent jobs themselves, but it\'s just Tsukiko\'s character is unique for what she is because her delivery and lines do a great job of making the character seem more than meets the eye. (no, she unfortunately does not yell ""TRANSFORMERS ROLL OUT!"" at any point in the show, but explaining how she acts with the character will be a spoiler)2. The characters have Personas.No, not the firefox term for Themes nor Atlus\'s franchise. They\'re WAYY more than what they are supposed to be(for this kind of show, that is, otherwise, they\'ll pale in comparison to any decent mature anime)Watching them interact with each other we learn that they\'re more than CCCP, they have dreams(no matter how childish, they WERE kids when they made it after all),they have normal pasts that most people can relate with. even the ones that come out as petty are actually less petty than they seem once you get to know them.In case we aren\'t clear persona=facade, so for example, that nice girl you helped on the way home actually cursed and found you disgusting and showed that only when no one was looking.The characters have well thought out pasts and aspirations and hence come off as more than just yet another Moeblob, Tsundere, Ojou, Hentai, etc. in other words, they are not just mere Stock Characters/Stereotypes, they\'re actual characters.So yeah, save for THE stock characters (ganguros, main character\'s best friend) this anime is some sort of Lite Deconstruction for some anime stereotypes. with ""Be Careful What You Wish For""  as the main driving force of the plot.> JMURNIR: whoa, they sure seem deep. Now I wanna see this even more!I\'d like to repeat, even if you say they\'re deep. they\'re still deep only if you compare them to others in the genre. don\'t expect Evangelion level character depth here.> JMURNIR: fair enough. I won\'t expect that much then.anyway:ENJOYMENT: 10/10Personally, I watched for the moe and stayed for the character development. It has excellent humor and tasteful fanservice.

Don\'t be fooled, or get discouraged from watching this gem, simply because the word hentai is emblazoned in the frickin title. Just having finished watching this series, I would say this is actually my #1 favorite title of all time. There\'s just something about how frankly it captures the essences of our two main characters (who are static for most of the show)...StoryHave you seen Future Diary? Yeah, I\'m talking about that psychological thriller with future-predicting cell phones and that insane-crazy pink-haired yandere Future Diary. Welllll, now that I look back on Henneko the plot...scales at exactly that pace. First half of the show is your typical what-you\'d-expect from reading the series description. The plot sorta just moves at a snail\'s pace as the series has you get accustomed to the characters. Then in the second half, you go from ""oh hey the plot\'s actually going somewhere,"" to ""ok sure plot just slam my face on your way out the window"". But don\'t worry. The show builds itself up well, and ends with a satisfying (possibly unexpected, yet in the expected direction) conclusion. Oh, and I found it surprising how much material they were able to fit in just 12 episodes.SoundIntro, ending, and background music is nothing atypical of a harem/romcom, but there\'s just something about Tsukiko\'s nonchalant lightning-speed munching sound effects that I just can\'t seem to get enough of, which completely and utterly make up for it.CharacterIn the beginning the main characters may seem dry or like they\'ve been done already, and you\'ll find that some of the decisions that the characters make will seem over the top or out of place, but just trust me when I tell you the characters are like that for a reason which comes around later in the series.EnjoymentI started watching this show, expecting to play out like your typical harem/romcom, and I mean yeah, sure I wasn\'t disappointed. Yoto is a huge pervert, and Tsukiko is basically an emotionless moe. But unlike most other harem/romcoms that I\'ve seen,the employed plot devices throughout the show fascinated me. Following what cat god power was where, and which were in play at a given time was sort of hard to follow, but still pretty entertaining and opened up character development possibilities and plot points which would otherwise take much longer to get across.OverallI thought it was awesome.  9/10 scales at exactly that pace.

Yoto wishes to get rid of his habit of lying and his facade, and Tsukiko wishes her true feeling not show so easily anymore.The entire story of Henneko revolves around Yoto solving the troubles that the cat statue causes from the wishes that the main characters made to it (if you seen the up to ep 7, you will know...what I\'m talking about). So without further a do, let\'s get into the characters.Character Explanation:Yokodera Yoto: the Hentai Ouji of the story. 24/7, Yoto always thinks about perverted stuffs, but he shows exceptional obsession towards school swimsuits (this is why he is in the track team). His raison d\'être is hentai. However, people around misunderstands him, thinking that he is a honest, hard working man. After making his wish, Yoto is unleashed; his perverted thoughts does not end as a thought, but becomes words and actions, which ultimately makes him called the Hentai(Perverted) Ouji(Prince). Yoto later gets his facade back, but soon after that, gets rid of his feeling of shame. Yoto is a great fan of Oscar Wilde, making quite a reference of Wilde\'s works. Aside of Oscar Wilde, Yoto is quite a reader, and knowledgable of not only sexual/perverted areas, but also with common sense and academic. But during usual, Yoto tries his best to harass Tsukiko and Azuki Azusa, which ends up him being kicked to the face or be threatened of making him to live in prison for rest of his life. Yoto and Tsukiko and Tsutsukakushi family met in the past, however Yoto doesn\'t seem to remember it well (a bit cloudy).Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko: the Warawanai Neko of the story. Cuteness itself. Just, Cute. She is a underclassman of Yoto. Tsukiko wishes to be more adult-like, which lead for her to wish for her feeling not to show so easily anymore (this is Tsukiko\'s image of an adult). Tsukiko\'s personality is like that of a ""Cat"", as Yoto says. After losing her expressions (due to her wish), her habit of showing her embarrassment is her touching her side-tail. Tsukiko is quite a eater, or rather, a food champion; she loves eating, cooking foods, but for the most, loves watching people eating her food. Tsukiko often refers Yoto as ""Hentai-san"" and ""Senpai"" and frequently threatens Yoto by telling him that she will call the police and have him arrested. Tsukiko met with Yoto before she entered high school, which Yoto doesn\'t remember, and from then, she might have fallen for him(smirk).Azuki Azusa: If Tsukiko is the cat, then Azuki Azusa is the puppy. She is in the same grade as Yoto, and the girl that gained the facade that Yoto gave away to the stony cat statue. With her beauty, many boys in the school confess love to her, and due to the facade that she has, Azuki Azusa rejects them in a harsh stinging way which for male students feels as if it is a prize from the queen (people refers this act as Azuki Azusa\'s Prize Time). As said earlier, Azuki Azusa is the ""Puppy"" and Tsukiko is the cat; they often face off each other because of Yoto, but later becomes BFF because of Azuki Azusa\'s incident (ep 2~3). Azuki Azusa is quite a important character of the story, next to Tsukiko. Azuki Azusa refers Yoto as her ""pet"" but in real, she is more like the pet of her being obsessively all over Yoto all the time(smirk).Tsutsukakushi Tsukushi: the Steel Queen of the story and older sister of Tsukiko. Through out the story, Yoto refers Tsukushi as  Queen of Steel, or Steel Queen; the name came from Tsukushi\'s personality of being stubborn like steel and expressionless like a inanimate object. She is the president of the school track team and is very passionate towards it. Tsukushi is, even more than track, very passionate and all over Tsukiko; she wants to marry Tsukiko. Steel Queen is, however, very stupid or more like a child, lacking common knowledge of living in the world. Tsukushi believes that Yoto is a diligent passionate track runner like her, and give her utmost trust to him, even wanting him to success the president of track team. Because of her childish acts, she gets involved with most of the troubles regarding the Stony Cat Statue. Tsukushi is also referred as a ""Lion"" because of her noble and outgoing actions that she makes.Emanuela Pollarola(Emi): She is called the 100% girl, and the reason is that her smile is pure 100%, as Yoto ""believes"". Emi in past, met with Yoto while she was in Japan. However, she had to go back to Italia, and makes a promise with Yoto for that Yoto will write hand written letters to her even when she goes back. Emi has a beautiful voice and sings like an angel; she was in the church quoir while she was in Japan. When she came back to Japan, Yoto had no idea who she was, which ""pissed her off."" Yoto believes that Emi is a cute, innocent girl until he remembers her true nature, a devilish angel that is. She looks like a rabbit or a ""Bunny"". She often says ""Pumpkin"" when she is mad, pissed, or badmouthing Yoto.That was quite a explanation, or rather a spoiler (especially for Emi), but in summary, all the girls are all over Yokodera Yoto. So in short, this is story of Perverted Prince and a Stony Cat, Tsundere Puppy, Childish Lion, and Devilish tsundere Bunny.About seiyuu, absolute gorgeous lineup: Kaji Yuki for Yokodera Yoto, Ogura Yui for Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko, Ishihara Kaori for Azuki Azusa, Tamura Yukari for Tsutsukakushi Tsukushi, and Terakawa Ayumi for Emi. THANK YOU FOR HAVING OGURA YUI FOR TSUKIKO!!!!!!Tamura Yukari sang the opening theme ""Fantastic Future"", which is very upbeat and very addictive. Ogura Yui sang the ending theme ""Baby Sweet Berry Love"" which drew two different Tsukikos, one before she made her wish and one after becoming ""Stony"".

The first few episodes are fun, in a manner that one expects from the title, but there's far more to come. I was thoroughly impressed by the great depth and complexity the that the plot line was able to develop in just a short 12 episodes. The characters and story line all become well developed, especially considering the brevity of the series. I encourage anyone to watch this anime--it is fun, silly, light-hearted, surprising and touching. The only limiting factor I found to this anime was that...there are only 12 episodes, which isn't enough time to really flesh out the characters and plot in a really thorough manner, but this anime does do a great job with the time it has! I think anyone can enjoy an anime like this, and will also be surprised at the twists it throws at you. there are only 12 episodes, which isn't enough time to really flesh out the characters and plot in a really thorough manner, but this anime does do a great job with the time it has!

The cat statue is there throughout the story and it does play a vital role but the summary doesnt reveal how deep the characters are and how they form relationships. This may look like one of those animes...that takes the cliche character types and throws them into  a school and harem setting where it all is duct taped together and presented too quickly; its definitely not one of those. it may be at a school setting, but the scenes arent really at the school often at all, which makes it quite a bit better than the animes which mainly consist of just school meetings because there is a nice linear plot that changes the scenery often.although the title is about prince pervert its not really that ecchi a lot of the time. in fact the first few episodes have it the most and it really calms down after that. if ecchi is not your thing at all then maybe this isnt for you. however fanservice here is next to none at all, so if you can stand the ecchi situations without the fanservice then you should be able to enjoy it overall. the characters were great; each had a really different personality and they had a reason why they were different. what this anime does a lot better than most is when explaining the pasts of the characters its at a good pace without anything feeling rushed or out of place. that brings us to the comedy. the entirety of how the story can intertwine the comedy with the somewhat serious plot makes it shine. every episode made me laugh in one way or another because the comedy was not always innocent but it felt right with what was happening. even during the serious moments it shone wonderfully through both the characters and the actual scenarios.Sound:not much here for the sound because it didnt stand out too much nor did it ruin the mood. it was mostly limited to background music. although the occasional song sung by the girl was cute.Art:The art was great the characters were really fluid and drawn well. the body shapes were natural looking as were the facial expressions (with the exception of a certain someone)Enjoyment:I really enjoyed this anime i thought the whole thing was good from the pervert prince to the whole wishing to a cat statue actually coming true. i laughed a lot but i also got the feels on multiple occasions. the animators and story directors did a good job with leaving on a finished story at the end of the episode but also adding something new that makes you yearn to see the next one. i suppose that could also be called having a lot of cliffhangers but they werent the bad kind where it drags on. something odd that i liked about this anime is that it doesnt start anything the same. from meeting different characters to eating a meal there is always a different perspective and viewpoint as well as dialogue. some animes tend to slow down in the middle or lose their sense of story and get side tracked but hentai ouji does an excellent job and expands on its own plot with wonderful characters you cant help but enjoy to watch.if you are into a story that really surprises you in a good way and keeps on surprising you then you should give this a try. that takes the cliche character types and throws them into  a school and harem setting where it all is duct taped together and presented too quickly;

there didn\'t seem to be a solid plot development. The anime\'s plot did not live up to the seemingly large expectations that was foreshadowed by the first...episode the narrator (MC) says ""We went there underestimating it\'s power..."" Though the anime did have some fantasical links within the first episode, it seemed to be dominated by realism, which is why it was a huge \'shocker\' when it became almost completely fantasy;time travel, reality distortion etc (on the 7 - 10th episode) it seemed to completely change it\'s calm realistic setting into a completely nonsensical mutable world.At the time of writing (ep. 10), the plot seemed unmethodical; without aim. Other animes of similar nature, Hayate no Gotuku, through all it\'s hilarity, aims to connect to some kind of story. But this anime has no such connection, it merely races through the entire anime, and ironically, becomes somewhat of a harem of little girls, and attempts to make a connection with it\'s poorly written  story at the end of the anime. Though there seemed to be alot of foreshadowing to the anime\'s story, the story fails to tie all the knots together in a nice fashion. That being said, the anime had not finished at this point.As an aside from the 2 large paragraphs about the storyline, I\'m going to attempt to lump art, sound, character all into 1 paragraph. Starting off with character, the oversimplified nature of the character development seems to take a sporadic turn due to inherent \'superpowers\' that is embedded in the story, the character\'s personalities switch around so much that it is impossible to see what each character\'s true purpose is in within the anime, or to be more specific what each character truly are; in that we don\'t specifically know them well enough before they switch to a completely new persona. Sound, the only world to describe it is \'fluffy\' or rather \'cute\' the anime resolves heavily on the cuteness of their heroines in order to lure unsuspecting lolicons into watching the anime. But the sounds of the cicadas, water, background characters etc is something that is around the level that would be appropriate for anime of this generation; average. Lastly art, the art style is generic, and that\'s probably all that is needed to be said.But despite all it\'s flaws, I really enjoyed the anime, even though I heavily criticise the anime. My enjoyment was 10/10, it had me falling off my chair in laughter, and happily face palming at certain moments in the story due to it\'s utter (stupidly); stupid funny at times. So without doing any mathematical calculations, the score I give, overall, is 7. episode the narrator (MC) says ""We went there underestimating it\'s power...""

Starting off with character, the oversimplified nature of the character development seems to take a sporadic turn due to inherent \'superpowers\' that is embedded in the story, the character\'s personalities switch around so much that it is impossible to see what each character\'s true purpose is in within the anime, or to be more specific what each character truly are; in that we don\'t specifically know them well enough before they switch to a completely new persona. Sound, the only world to describe it is \'fluffy\' or rather \'cute\' the anime resolves heavily on the cuteness of their heroines in order to lure unsuspecting lolicons into watching the anime. But the sounds of the cicadas, water, background characters etc is something that is around the level that would be appropriate for anime of this generation; average. Lastly art, the art style is generic, and that\'s probably all that is needed to be said.But despite all it\'s flaws, I really enjoyed the anime, even though I heavily criticise the anime. My enjoyment was 10/10, it had me falling off my chair in laughter, and happily face palming at certain moments in the story due to it\'s utter (stupidly); stupid funny at times. So without doing any mathematical calculations, the score I give, overall, is 7.', 'Never expected to be this good!""The Hentai Prince and the stony cat!"" is really under-rated for the content it actually carries. I had expected a harem go-lucky anime, but this anime has a real plot, a real good plot. (along with plenty ecchi stuff).The Plot gets slightly darker as you dwell further into the episodes. The Story is nice. At first it starts off as a normal ecchi stuff, but gradually progresses to unveil the real plot.Art : GoodSound : Normal Effects were good. But the OP/ED weren\'t really very catchy. So it is just ok....Characters: The Neko God was real savage.Leaving a 10 rating since it is quite underrated. Otherwise I would have given a 8-9 rating.~Recoder Characters: The Neko God was real savage.Leaving a 10 rating since it is quite underrated. Otherwise I would have given a 8-9 rating.~Recoder', ""Hentai Ouji is JC Staffs moe flavor of the season.I know I know the industry is cluttered with cutesy school anime and moe girls doing moe things. But Hentai Ouji was nonetheless enjoyable.I’m actually kinda sad it is over since it reminded me a lot of one of my favorite anime, Denpa Onna.While Denpa Onna is a lot better in my opinion and also my favorite school/moe anime, Hentai Ouji still managed to be one of the more enjoyable shows of the season.Story__________________________________________________Despite being just a school anime, Hentai Ouji (HenNeko) actually had a story. Quite simple and more in the background but at least...it followed an overall theme and even had a conclusion.It’s about cat statues granting wishes and a bunch of characters wishing for the wrong things and dealing with the consequences.It wasn't really focused though. It just randomly had events going on that were somewhat connected.If you are cynical you could say the “plot” was an excuse for fanserice and moe.At least HenNeko had plenty of both to offer.So I guess I have to warn you, if you are allergic to harem, moe or fanservice you better stay as far away from this show as possible.If you on the other hand love cute things, blantaned sexualising of underaged girls and one guy going out with 4 girls at once this is probably what you are looking for.Over the course of the show though you will most likely be confused, as the cat statue wishes make the show pretty surreal and trippy at times.I actually thought this show is more suited for Studio Shaft (and also think they would have made it better but JC staff did an okay job) since it was not only full with fanservice but also had the quirky characters and messy story telling.On a bad note though, the drama the show offered can’t be taken too seriously in light of it’s rather light themes and sexual content.But again this is an otaku catering show not more.Characters__________________________________________________Since it is a harem you have one MC, his male friend who is barely represented in the show and a bunch of girls with different quirks and personalities.Yokodera is our perverted hero, he is thick headed as all harem protagonist and can’t read the most obvious intentions of the girls around him. But he is still entertaining and somewhat cute.I just loved how blunt they just made his perverted side. He straight out says and does things other harem protagonist are merely forced into. It’s kinda more fun to watch him do perverted stuff than your typical nice guy.But yeah his character is rather simple and the development doesn’t go anywhere too far out.Tsutsukakushi, Tsukiko (say that 10 times in a row!) is the other main character of the show, and probably the most important of the girls. She wishes right from the start to lose her emotions(actually more her emotional expression) and thus turns into a sorta Dandere character.She is damn cute and her voice is just melting you. Despite her supposed emotionless character she is witty with her comments and has some of the funniest moments of the show. She is also damn cute if I haven’t mentioned it.Have I meantioned that she is damn cute? No?Well she is... damn cute.Azuki is her main rival, though also cute she gets less screentime and less backdrop. Her character is also less consistent. Sometimes she likes MC sometimes she doesn’t. She is not a classical tsundere in this regard just very inconsistent.Tsukushi is Tsukikos older sister. She is leader of the track team and starts out hating the MC. Her role starts out as being the dominating arch type, abusing the MC but later becomes more likable. She is also used for the Oppai Fanservice, so if you are into that stuff she already won.She is also thick as two short planks as Yokodera makes her believe he is him and his none existent little brother at the same time, she falls in love with later on.though adds a lot of comedy to the show.The rest of the characters are rather insignificant but all cute too look at.Overall the show has great quirky characters but also has no depth or anything to offer. Just your typical moe archetypes, fun to look at and you wanna cuddle them, but nothing great and deep.Animation__________________________________________________As mentioned before, JC Staff animated HenNeko and we get our usual treatment. Nothing great, nothing bad.It was interesting from the surreal point of view but nothing Shaft couldn’t have made better and thus it was a sorta “letdown”.Backgrounds were typical school settings though sprinkled with some surreal elements whenever the wishes went rampant.The character designs, simple but effective. You will love them if you love moe things, you will hate them if you hate moe things.The special effects were actually pretty decent and helped the whole magical feel of the show.Overall it’s not impressive by any means but gives you a decent dose of cuteness and good feelings.Sound__________________________________________________Surprisingly well done was the soundtrack in HenNeko.The opening and endings as sweet as sugar. If you like cutesy popsongs you will like them. If you don’t... well you know the spiel.The background music was used effectively ranging from typical comedy songs to more dramatic piano pieces for the dramatic scenes.Overall the soundtrack wasn’t something I’d listen to outside of the anime but was quite good.Great were the voice actors as they not only enhanced the moe factor of the show but also were responsible for the sound effects themselves giving your extra sweet moments that you better see your doctor to check if you don’t have diabetes already.The super young Yui Ogura did the voice for Tsukiko and was my personal favorite even though Yukari Tamura did her older sister which was at least as good.If you’ve seen Katanagatari you’ll recognize Yukari, she has a great range and also a very sweet voice.Yuki Kaji lends Yokodera his voice, proving again his versatility from Eren Jäger to a Harem lead.The last great thing about the show were the sound effects.I normally don’t recognize them too much in shows but HenNeko had great ones that complimented the comedic scenes well and enhanced the enjoyment.Enjoyment__________________________________________________Speaking of enjoyment, Hentai Ouji was a blast for me.I know I should feel guilty for liking it as much, but I just did, sue me!I do say to anyone though that hates these kind of shows to just stay away, you are not missing out, this is a full-time pandering show with nothing to offer but good feelings.At least for me and some others this show was a good ride and soon will be replaced by the next cutesy show to come out.

I wouldn\'t expect something like that, since my ""hunt"" is based on random encounters, but this one was really worthy, not to mention that a single twist would be able to impress me so much on an comedy anime.{STORY - 8/10}Seeing pervert Yokodera right on the beginning may let you wonder if this one would be like any other ecchi anime. Way wrong! This one is absolutely different from anything I saw before!The plot focuses on a particular cat statue, able to give people...something they need, in exchange of something they don\'t. That\'s a pretty unusual power, but other variants from this same statue have other features. However, every one of them is based on this ""Neko God"" being.Our protagonist, Yokodera decided to be more honest with his own thoughts and, on his way to ask for this statue\'s help, he finds himself with Tsukiko, a very emotive girl. She came to the same hill in order to find a way on hiding her facial expressions, her feelings.\u2029\u2029Both had issues with the statue and that\'s where the first part of this beautiful story begins. Obviously that Yokodera regreted his decision, just like Tsukiko. The struggle now was to fix these two problems.However, powers from the Neko God shouldn\'t be underestimated, as it was responsible for an even deeper and exciting scheme, that is soon revealled, as the plot suffers a small twist later on.{ART - 9/10}I became amazed with the relatively simple design used on Henneko. Visuals are really smooth and beautiful to glaze at. Eyes\' style is totally basic, but also quite unique and really nice. I particularly loved how female characters have small blush signs on their cheeks all the time, even when they\'re not embarassed. It makes them so adorable...{SOUND - 10/10}A cute anime needs both OP and ED themes up to it and that\'s  what they did. Seeing such accurate sequences, combined with cheering and beautiful songs was something to be remembered. Can\'t say much about the backgrounding during the anime tough.{CHARACTERS - 6/10}Yokodera is a really odd pervert. He\'s not crazy for boobs like Issei. Still, he has no shame about his actions, just like Toori. Despite that, he hides a gentle and sweet personality under this disguise and can show affection very well.Directly into Tsukiko, the girl from which I was unable to turn my eyes away. After having her prayer granted, her face would never change again, as her voice tone. That\'s what makes her so lovable. You just want to hug her and hear her making cute noises while eating and breathing all the time!There are really few characters on this one, but that\'s not a problem to me. We also get to see two tsunderes, both Azusa and Tsukushi, both who fall in love for Yokodera. Others characters, like Ponta and Emi have a brief appearance on some episodes.{ENJOYMENT - 10/10}Watching gorgeous anime is an priority, but seeing really amazing plots and well made twists are essential for me to enjoy the anime. Great one, for sure!{OVERALL - 9/10}Having the chance to make a wish is something everyone would like. However, none of us is able to say what we really want and things could get messed up in the process. Why Yokodera can\'t remember about his past? Where Tsukiko and Tsukushi are related to his memories? The Neko God will give you anything, but it has its consequences.

Wishes. Wishing will always be a part of being human. You wish because you are human. But if you don\'t get what you wish, you end up disregarding others right? And then that\'s where desire comes in. There\'s a big difference between wishes and desires. Wishes are meant to be wishes, what I mean is. You pray in God\'s name, you throw coins on wishing wells . And you\'d know there\'s a chance that it won\'t come true right? Unlike desire. When you desire something, you don\'t pray...on something. You tell yourself you want that thing, that you\'d get it no matter what the cost is. So enough with the wishing and desire lecture! Let\'s start with this review!Story : 9As you can see, I rated the story really high. I\'ll be a little unfair here. I gave it a 9 since it\'s one of my favorite series. Well, I shall tell you why! So we have our lucky guy Yokodera who is a pervert in every way, he has the ability to sugarcoat things really good. Basically he\'s good at lying. He then met a girl who has the total opposite of his personality. The main girl Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko who doesn\'t know how to hide her facial expressions and is honest, they prayed on a stone cat who grants wishes. That Yokodera\'s facade to be gone, and for Tsukiko to hide her facial expressions easily. And that\'s when the chain of deeply good plot starts with.Art : 9Hentai ouji just came out this spring. So we should expect art that\'s really good, since art nowadays are mostly done by CG\'s. Well this is not a mecha or some action series. So you wouldn\'t need a lot of CG editing here. But I gotta tell you. In this day and age, this kind of art is really good. So expect some good art on this one.Characters : 8I can\'t actually say what the characters\' personalities are, since you\'ll end up cursing me, because it\'ll spoil the series really good. And you\'ll know them very well as the series progress.  The characters are not that original, considering a lot of rom/com anime with the same pervert protagonist came out. BUT! Hentai ouji characters are easily known. They have their own personalities that make them stand out, which gives them their own identity.Music : 8Not much to say on this one, they don\'t have much music. No songs were played by the characters during the show. But the opening theme and ending is quite cute. Oh wait, there were times that Tsukiko sings a couple or three nursery rhymes(?), not that it was worth mentioning, she\'s totally tone-deaf, but its kinda cute too.Enjoyment : 9I really enjoyed the show, I\'m not that hard to please when it comes to watching. If it piques my interest, ill gladly devote my time on it. And this one really piqued me. So I ended up missing my cram school watching the series overnight. Its really worth watching, with the mild echiness and the progress of the story is quite fast so there\'s never a dull moment for me.Overall : 9Of all the ecchi/harem romcom series I\'ve watched, hentai ouji surely is one of my favorites, why? Like I\'ve mentioned before, its not your everyday harem/ecchi romcom series. Because its not just about giving pantyshots, bouncing breasts, perverted positions, lewd scenes(well it still contains some of it.) It has a deep plot, easily recognizable characters and a little bit of drama. So that covers my review on this series! Enjoy the series if your going to watch it! on something.

Enjoy the series if your going to watch it!', ""Full article here!http://www.gamerselite.co.uk/the-hentai-prince-and-the-stony-cat/Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. is an anime that is often judged earlier for it's title, though it's more misunderstood. This anime does not have any hentai in it at all, and the fan service is more tame than others. But what really makes this anime stand out from others, is the writing and characters.Story (7) - The story isn't outstanding unfortunately. It does have it's sad and happy moments, but nothing strikes off as memorable. In a nutshell, it revolves around the main protagonists wishing towards the Cat God (hence the Stony Cat in the title), but wishes will always come at...a cost. Though I have always been wondering myself that if they would have worded the wish a bit differently, that there would really be any disadvantages.Art (8) - The art isn't the greatest either, but it just fits and doesn't really do anything wrong. I don't really have anything else to say here. It's definitely not a work of art, but it's just good.Sound (7) - The voice actors aren't necessarily bad, but I really disliked Youto's voice in the first episode. And while I absolutely adore Tsukiko, it is undeniable that she had the easiest voicing role in like... ever. Tsukiko has a monotone voice (which you understand when you watch the anime), which doesn't change throughout the entire anime. The rest of the voice actors are okay, but nothing spectecular. While the opening and ending themes are, of course, personal preferences, I really liked them!Character (9) - I'm mainly going to focus on the two main characters from this anime: Youto and Tsukiko. While the others are good too, these two are what the anime revolves around the most.Youto - I like him because he strays away from the typical Harem King theme. Instead of being the cat, he is often the mouse. While he is a pervert, his actions barely come to life and he often doesn't want to get involved with them either. That's why I like him more over the regular Harem Kings.Tsukiko - Everybody's favorite, and definitely mine too. Tsukiko is not only a very cute character, but also the main cause for the earlier mentioned happy and sad moments. The biggest reason I probably like her is that we are pretty similar, but in reverse. While she has emotions, I don't have many. While she can't express them, I have no trouble with it. And both of us talk in a pretty monotone voice.Enjoyment (9) - One of it's genres is Comedy, so there's bound to be some enjoyment here. And there is. This is mainly due to the writing, which is genius. Youto is a pervert after all, and they all react to it in a different way. And it does help that Tsukiko is the regular 'Black Hole Belly' stereotype of the anime. She can eat a lot, and those are often funny scenes to watch as she keeps talking in a monotone voice while eating so much.Overall (8) - Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. is an anime with a missunderstood name. The story isn't anything special, but the characters and writing more than make up for it. If you're interested in something fresh that strays away from most of the clichés other Harem anime have, give it a go! a cost.

One of the first reason (if not the most important) it's the evolution of facts; I don't want to do any spoilers, but the plot written on MAL cover only 3 episodes of the anime, and for me this was a lovely and unexpected surprise. Another thing is the number of genres this...anime has: Supernatural, slice of life, drama, romance, harem, ecchi (not so excessive), school, comedy elements, and maybe others, and they are, in my opinion, well combinated both in time and in enviroment. Characters are not really original and fresh, but they are characterized in a good way. This anime surprise me more and more, in particular in the last episode, that conclude in a bittersweet way the entire story. Opening and ending aren't a masterpiece, but they can listen more and more time without boring you. Art style is standard for me: simple but efficient. As I've already said in this review, I really loved it, and all anime lovers should give a chance to it, you'll not regret, I promise you. anime has: Supernatural, slice of life, drama, romance, harem, ecchi (not so excessive), school, comedy elements, and maybe others, and they are, in my opinion, well combinated both in time and in enviroment.

Btw,Love Tsukiko-chan :3 I love all the cute imoutos that there are and Tsukiko can be in my top 5 with that cute look of her.Art - Enough said 12/10. As expected from J.C.Sound - So-so but mostly at the good side. I found myself loving 'that one' instrumental that sometimes played in the back and the ED is cute and catchy.Enjoyment - I ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH!!!OVERALL - Very worth a watch for a romance anime. Got nothing on your list or just want to take a break with others anime or simply looking for another romance anime just like me? Go ahead pick this anime and it'll filled that empty void of yours. last episode is very good.Characters - I'm being biased but the characters' design are just perfect and their personality flows well with it.

It tries to be different but still feels cliched but it will mange to entertain you just fine.Art- As expected of J.C Staff(fun fact - My first romantic anime Golden Time was also by them.) the art is good and the character design...is nice.Characters - The Characters were the strength of HenNeko.you can watch it for Tsukiko alone.and after a long time I got a pervert harem MC.Sound - You know I mentioned I got melancholic from  some anime that does not happen  because of a particular  scene  or something, it happened every time because of a piece of ost. HenNeko had that one heart stringing OST  for me too,but the overall OST   was also great,it fitted  every scene perfectly. The MC who is a pervert is voiced by Kaji Yuki who has also voiced Hyoudou Issei(one of the biggest perv, I have seen in anime).so his voice was perfect.I would also like to give a applause for VA of Tsukiko(she was perfect as a expressionless girl)Enjoyment- I would have I enjoyed more If had not been struck by melancholy. but still it was good.Overall:I would rec HenNeko1)for Tsukiko ,the perfect expressionless girl.2) for watching a good harem.Thank you for wasting your time reading this. is nice.Characters - The Characters were the strength of HenNeko.you can watch it for Tsukiko alone.and after a long time I got a pervert harem MC.Sound - You know I mentioned I got melancholic from  some anime that does not happen  because of a particular  scene  or something, it happened every time because of a piece of ost.

With that said I don\'t care if you object to it. Constructive criticism is welcome.Now let\'s start from the beginning, literally, I loved the theme song so much that I would purposefully go back to the beginning just to hear it and start dancing in my seat. Yokedera is a high school boy who manages to maintain a misconception of him being a Good Samaritan. This becomes a problem for him because I keeps making him busier and busier when he only really wants to focus on you think,...women. Desperately wanting to get rid of this facade he has he hatches an idea to wish it away after his freind tells him about a cat statue that has the power to grant wishes because it is part of the embodiment of a deity. Upon reaching the cat statue he ""meets"" one of the main female protagonist tsukiko. Tsukiko is there for a similar reason, to lose something they don\'t need. The way this cat statue works is it takes something you do not wish to possess and gives it to someone else. Now that I\'ve given you a brief synopsis it\'s time to give you the actual review.First off I found it very hard to become attached to the characters. I didn\'t feel alot of emotional connections, I couldn\'t really relate to them either. I also didn\'t feel like they made any real revelations or significant progress. Small development though. Yet I found myself fascinated by the characters. They\'re all very dynamic from each other and it\'s worth it just to see how these characters interacting and play off of each other. How different they are from each other and the fact they keep these close relationships with each other is one of the best things about the show. For an ecchi anime it\'s incredibly light hearted, it\'s not another ""i must absolutely obsess over the main character and have his cock"" kind of anime. Going back to what I said about the characters being incredibly different from each other, the situations they are placed in is one of the best parts and redeeming qualities of the show. They\'re thrown into these sporadic and off the wall situations and its humorous to see how they\'ll behave and cooperate with each other. I adored the art style of the anime as well, all of the colors seemed to fade and shade perfectly. I also loved the voice acting, every voice seemed to match the character absolutely perfect in every way, to tone, pitch, appearance of the chacter to sound of the voice, to the personality of the voice itself.Possible spoilers ahead so be warned:Now for a little more gripes. There were some major holes in the story that could have been fixed with a simple wish. Magic is already a complicated thing to explain in a story but later down the rode we deal with memories and time travel. I felt like some of the perversion was overdone just a tad and could have been easily avoided if the main character could communicate properley. The story gets very confusing at times but most of it is explained in due time. The confusing parts are actually one of the main reasons you\'ll want to watch more of the show. women.

No matter what.”Memories and emotions are crucial in defining who we are as people, and if one were to lose one of those, they would certainly be in a pinch. Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko or ""The Pervert Prince and the Stone Cat"" is a tale of sacrifice, self-discovery and wishes. What seems on the outside as a mindless tale of erotic tomfoolery and comedy featuring a cast of many girls, turns out to be a story that holds lessons and morals that...we can all appreciate.The story in the first good portion of the series centers around three characters, being Youto, Tsukiko and Azuki Azusa. The plot is decent at this part as it follows the Stone Cat, a powerful deity who can take away something you have and give it to someone who needs it. At this point, Youto makes a mistake by giving away his ability to control his perverse thoughts, and must struggle to get them back from Azuki Azusa. But where the series really started to ring for me was the final 3 or so episodes, in which the story takes a turn to a much more serious tone, truly exploring the power of wishes that can be granted by a deity, and tackles the ideas of sacrifice and family. I would have wished that the series could have been more like the last episodes in the series, but there are positives and negatives to both. If you enjoy romcoms, then you will undoubtedly find enjoyment within the many lighter scenes and episodes of this series, as it seems everyone is trying to capture Youto. What adds to the atmosphere of this is the idea of an entity or deity in this case that can grant wishes, which adds a whole other dimension to the plot. I wasn\'t really sold in the first three episodes as it seemed like the series was going to drag on as a harem type plot in which nobody truly wins and it\'s just a battle of love interests, and thankfully I was mistaken as a I braced myself to continue the series. Don\'t be mistaken, there is plenty of comedy and times where the romance aspect does conflict between characters, there\'s just other things that help the anime to be more balanced and surprisingly emotional. In the end, it\'s a bit of a mixed bag. If you\'re looking for an anime that will only focus on the drama and discovering morals, then you might be disappointed. However if you\'re alright with the light-hearted ""perverted"" nature of this anime, and still enjoy your occasional drama (think Kore wa Zombie Desu Ka or Chuu2) then by all means, go for it.The art in this tale is beautiful, as the characters are very well drawn, and the scenery is also extremely well done as well. There shouldn\'t be many places where you can complain about the artwork in this anime, as even the animation in the OP and ED are surprisingly good. Watching the anime was a visual pleasure, to see all the characters fully interact and look great while doing it. For the sound, the OP and ED are enjoyable, although admittedly very feminine in nature. That shouldn\'t really stop you from enjoying the series too much as you can just skip them, so moving onto the soundtrack, it wasn\'t really anything notably good during the normal school/daily life themes but the piano tracks played during the emotional scenes are pretty solid. In all, the sound in this anime never really jumped out to me as ""spectacular"" but never left a bad taste in my mouth either.The characters are crucial, and although some of them are pretty good, some left something to be desired. Simply put, there are a TON of characters in this show. However, you should quickly know that the main elements of the plot revolve around pretty much 3-4 characters. Those being Youto, Azuki Azusa (more in the first half), Tsukiko and Tsukushi. That being said, I\'m disappointed that Emi wasn\'t more developed as there was an arc that heavily featured her. Additionally, it feels that Azuki Azusa is left in the dust in the last few episodes, as she almost completely disappears from your mind. Besides development, there\'s the obvious question, are they enjoyable to watch? The short answer is yes, the more complicated answer is going to follow. Youto is a very interesting individual and by interesting I mean he\'s pretty much a pervert, and you figure that out quite quickly. You might cringe a bit in the first few episodes, but please do not drop the show because of Youto\'s personality. He does tone down because of certain plot events, and he becomes a character that you heavily respect and adore by the end of the series. That being said, although it isn\'t officially labeled as a harem, most of the female characters are heavily attached to Youto by the end, and since there\'s no real other male characters, it\'s mostly fine. Some might grow to dislike certain characters, but overall, there were no characters that I flat out hated. No, you will not be throwing your computer out the window because you hate the MC so much (like a certain anime named School Days) but you may still find somethings to dislike. Basically, you should just stick with the anime, as the final arc, I feel really makes things worth it.Did I enjoy HenNeko? Absolutely. I love romcoms, and I came for a straight up romcom/harem in which hopefully one of the girls that I favored won, however I left with something much different. The emotional part of this anime is truly something else, and I won\'t spoil it because it\'s something that you should experience yourself. I\'ll put it this way, many people may spend their wishes on the Cat God for immediate benefit. For example, you may want a new car, or you don\'t want to have feelings for someone anymore. But what happens when there\'s a chance for you to give someone something that\'s very important to you, but they really need. Where does the joy of cherishing something dear to you meet sacrifice for your friends? How much are you willing to do? These are all things tackled within this anime (specifically the last part).Verdict: 8/10.

It\'s genuine and fun to its very core. Like Hentai Ouji, anime comedies that rely heavily on moe or cute girls as their driving force are overly contrived of tired old gags that aren\'t truly funny and come across as annoying than anything else. However, some shows are exceptions to this, and Hentai Ouji is one of these and is by far the best one to come out in the last year or two.From the beginning, the plot is...already quite over the top. You have a boy who can\'t help but be perverted because he loves girls so much, and he finds a cat statue that somehow grants wishes to people near it. Where did it come from? Why does it grant wishes? We don\'t know. Quite frankly, they don\'t bother explaining why it\'s here, but to the show\'s credit, they are at least aware of how silly the premise is, and the way the show is set up makes it completely obvious. It does go to a serious plot arc near the last episodes. Still, at best, the pacing isn\'t terrible and provides some decent development to the characters, especially with our three main leads, Tsukiko, Yokodera, and Tsukushi. One other thing that sets this back involves Yokodera and Tsukushi. He tricks her into thinking that he\'s a younger brother to himself, which somehow fools her easily without hesitation. Even with how silly everything in the anime is, this was easily eye-rolling material if someone were to buy into this.Now let\'s talk about the most significant strong point in the show: The characters. From time to time, we don\'t often get harem anime with protagonists, especially those that are perverted, that aren\'t spineless wimps or don\'t express their perverted fantasies openly like the true perverts they are. Luckily, recent harem shows in the past year or two have realized this and fixed this long-overdue mistake, and Hentai Ouji\'s protagonist Yokodera is one of the more vital aspects of the show. Voiced by Yuki Kaji, who is no stranger to perverted roles, Yokodera brings so much of the show\'s charm front and center from his honesty and the way he is written as a pervert who is likable within his primary trait. Most writers can\'t pull it off perfectly, but the writers for Hentai Ouji are an exception.So how do the girls fair in the character department? Are they all clichéd stereotypes? Yes. However, given in the context of the show\'s charm, these stereotypes are forgiven because of the sheer sincerity of the characters\' motivations. Tsukiko provides excellent humor in a deadpan tone throughout most of the show, which is a shame since the seiyuu Yui Ogura who plays her, is better when she\'s putting more emotion into her performance than when she is playing a dandere. Azuki Azusa may seem like your typical tsundere character. She quickly becomes more than just her alleged stereotype later on. Then we have Tsukiko\'s big sister Tsukushi who is the least interesting. Still, she does have some excellent needed humor involving her and her sister wanting to marry her, which is just as strange as it sounds but then again, this show is silly in and of itself, so it\'s a nice bonus.The animation is relatively standard anime fare with nothing unique or exciting, but the art design of the characters is something to behold. It is nicely done moe girls that don\'t seem as bloated with so many smooth or jagged lines around the characters that make it suitable for poorly trained eyes. The original character designer Kantoku is very talented in what he does, and it would be a shame not to let him have any more Anime deals soon.Voice acting is very well done to give all characters their own given charisma. Yui Ogura is fantastic in how she manages to pull off the dandere role and Tsukiko\'s original outgoing personality. Kaori Ishihara is easily the best one out of the rest simply because she pulls off the loud mouth tsundere without making Azusa Azuki grating or unpleasant from an audio perspective. I\'ve already mentioned Yuki Kaji before, and he\'s as eccentric and delightful as ever in yet another perverted triumph of a performance. The rest are exemplary in their way but nothing special to discuss.The opening and ending songs are very catchy and pleasant to listen. Nothing in terms of complex or experimental rhythm, but they\'re lovely J-Pop songs that are there to capture the essence of the show\'s pleasant comedic tone.It would be considered unprofessional for a reviewer to recommend a show purely based on fun and entertainment simply because people appreciate different types of comedy or entertainment. With the growing hate of moe shows in recent years, there\'s no doubt that many people won\'t bother checking this out after looking at the posters or screenshots. I appreciate shows like Hentai Ouji that rely on entertainment regarding my taste in entertainment. Still, at the same time, you come out of it with a sense of gratitude and pleasure rather than the feeling of regret or gain nothing from experience like most shows with moe traits. If you\'re open-minded enough to subject yourself to cute girls for 12 episodes, rest assured that you will most likely come out of this show feeling good and accomplished without feeling any form of regret watching it.A- already quite over the top.

The outrageous plot got me interested, the character development kept me watching. The art and sound are both good but this series really shines in its cuteness and humor. The pervert jokes never really get old. It\'s too bad that the transitions between the humor, bizarre story arc, and surprisingly heartfelt moments are often jarring. There was some missed potential here that almost earned it a 7 but overall it was highly enjoyable as a funny and heart-warming slice of very bizarre...life.Tsukiko\'s ""expressions"" were likely the cutest and simultaneously funniest parts for me, if I ever watch it again it will be because of her. life.Tsukiko\'s ""expressions"" were likely the cutest and simultaneously funniest parts for me, if I ever watch it again it will be because of her.', 'Despite the title of ""Hentai Prince"" the show is not an ecchi/fan service title and is really some strange supernaturalish romantic comedy. The show is about how the wishes granted by the Nekogami affect the characters and the world they live in.The Stony cat grants a wish in a rather particular way. For instance, the main character wants to be more open with who he is so he asks the cat to take away his facade. At the same time the cat will give what it took to someone who needs it. This along with the rather unlimited power the cat has is the basis...of the show and how just about all the situation evolve.While the story is rather fresh at first and honestly, pretty funny. It goes out of hand during mid to late episodes with some questionable archs until the last couple of episodes which are heart warming and explains just about everythingThis show has the benefit of having two of the most entertaining, and rather likeable leads of the season. Youto (the hentai prince), can\'t really talk to people, not because of being shy, but because he, after all, is a pervert and can\'t express himself correctly. So he wishes that the Nekogami take away his inhibition... which causes to be problematic. Tsukiko on the other hand has always relied on her emotions. I\'m sure you can see where this is going. They try to help each other to regain what the cat took from them.The show is somewhat a harem so other girls are present too. Among the most notable is Azusa, who starts out as a troubled and somewhat bullied character that looks like she might get some nice development, but unfortunately gets stuck in a rather poorly done later arch along with another character. Tsukushi (Tsukiko\'s older sister) is somewhat more important later on in the show, but never really gets the development she\'s due til the end.Overall a lot of the characters do get significant development, but not always in the way that might be the best. For having such strong main characters the side ones range from completely annoying to average.In the end The Hentai Prince and the Stony Cat is a show you should not pass over due to its name.

I am not saying this anime is bad or anything but just don't be expecting it to be around the best you have ever watched. This show is full of moe and some fan service; however, I guarantee you that there is more to it, like the characters for example. A strong cast can almost always make everything work out in the end, somehow.Characters: 8.2/10While the main cast wasn't a shining example of the...best character we've seen in anime, they were, for the most part, handled very decently. The main character, Youtou Yokodera was much more than your usual harem (did I mention this series is also a harem?) block-headed perverted main character. Although this guy is also pervert, he isn’t much more so than the average teenage guy surrounded by kawaii girls, apart from his sometimes wild fantasies and desire to openly be a pervert at the beginning of the series. As the episodes go on, he shows more and more behaviors typical of a nice guy, because he is actually a very selfless person. Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi, the main girl is also a decently developed kuudere character, however make no mistake kuudere lovers, she may appear cold because she lost her emotions due to her wishing it but deep down she is so innocent and cute you may start drooling... The other characters were okay too, some of them were even memorable (which is always a great plus because good side characters aren’t easily forgotten, most of the time) but I personally liked these two the most.Story: 6/10The story was plainly average. This is a slice of life romantic comedy and it was good in its genre, there were even some very decent emotional moments in the final two episodes. My main problem with the show's plot is, the shoddy attempts to add in a little flair of mystery. There were a few times it actually did the trick but to me, most of the time it felt forced and somewhat out of the blue. Maybe that's just me. I should also point out the stony cat that grants wishes was used A LOT as a plot device and often it did not serve any purpose whatsoever other than a chance to develop characters. That was about it for the “supernatural” part of this anime.Art style/ Presentation: 9/10The character designs were cute and adorable, standard for what you would expect from a moe show made in the last three years, especially from J.C. Staff (my favorite studio, actually)Music and Voice acting: 6/10The voices of the characters were good but not a single performance stood out. The same goes for the music. It did its job and nothing else. Average.Entertainment: 9/10It somehow managed to keep me interested enough to almost marathon it.The verdict:Watch this show whenever you're bored or in need of a moe shot, with a decent anime along with it. best character we've seen in anime, they were, for the most part, handled very decently.

When I first began watching anime, I obviously jumped on all of the big-name titles (SAO, AoT, OPM, etc.) and I unquestionably enjoyed them for the entertainment they provided.I will also admit that i was a hormone-fueled teen at the time, so obviously I indulged in all the ecchi I could find, hence the soft-spot of nostalgia I hold for cheap ecchi anime. During that time is when I first discovered HenNeko. How could I NOT be interested in an anime that had the word ""hentai"" in the title?So little 14 year-old me watched the entirety...of the show. Of course I liked the ecchi scenes and fanservice, but somehow part of me felt that what I had just watched was so much more than that. I had no idea anime could have this much heart and emotion, I thought all it was meant for was awesome action and big booba. I couldn\'t have been more wrong.HenNeko is a philosophy anime in an ecchi anime\'s trenchcoat. (I say this half-jokingly and half-seriously.)""Should I sacrifice my own happiness and fulfillment for the sake of other\'s happiness? Do I allow myself to be who I am in front of others in order to stay true to myself, or do I try to appeal to those around me by putting on a front?"" These are the central themes of the first season of HenNeko, and it executes them masterfully. The numerous characters and arcs all serve these central themes and attempt to find a nuanced answer.I will always love this show and everything about it, and I sincerely hope that everyone can find some enjoyment in this masterpiece of an anime. of the show.

The story of a ""HENTAI"" and his friends. A story that wil for sure make you laugh a lot, leave you confused, make you curious from time to time and of course will make you have an emotional shock!Yes, let\'s get started then!The protagonist of the anime series is a guy Youto Yokodera, who is a total pervert! And the storyline goes on with his encounters of several different girls. Yeah, the name seems like the anime is a total comedy but...it is not, well it is but it is not. Starting from the first episode the storyline will make you laugh out loud for real, then at some point it becomes a little more, uhm, interesting. Correct, it becomes interesting, makes you curious that you will wonder what will happen next. While doing it still makes you laugh, while moving on darker plots. Tragic events, a mysterious past almost no one remembers... And at the end a final you can call SUPER, a really good happy end, outstanding!Speaking of the story, we still shouldn\'t forget that we are talking about an anime series.

I find the artstyle of Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko outstanding, so good that I can\'t imagine it in a different way.Now we are down to the Sound! Well, let\'s begin with the OP and ED. Both the OP and ED of the series were good, but I can\'t tell they were a miracle that carved themselves in my mind. The voice acting however, was quite perfect, especially the voice acting of Yokodera and Tsukiko was really good. Though I still can\'t say many things were special about the voice acting of the series, thinking that there are many anime series that has good voice acting. Speaking of Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko, the voice acting was very good.I have written down everything in my mind about the story, art and the sound and now it is time to comment the characters! Not to give any spoilers, I am going to cut this part short, and write my ideas about them straight. The characters of the series were pretty funny, each with a potential of making you bound to itself. Each introduced character gets a good part in the storyline, and doesn\'t leave any questions in your mind, except Ponta, our protagonist\'s friend. Well, counting all these, I believe the character introductions, the way they take part in the storyline and their personalities were pretty good.Now, probably the best and the most important part: Enjoyment...Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko is an anime series that really has a well designed storyline, colorful characters and of course a good art supported by a good voice acting. The way it makes you bond of the characters and watch every episode without breathing, I can say it was quite enjoyable!Overally, Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko is a great anime series I believe everyone should watch.

So on, my review comes to an end here, I wish you a great time watching anime!', 'Well to start off the thing that caught my eye in this anime is the genres. I mean typical, comedy, romance, school. And when I thought it couldn\'t get worse, Harem. But then I saw there was no Ecchi and there was seinen plus supernatural. This got me thinking ""this is an unusual combination of genres, so I looked into it. I was there just for the sake of curiosity. But to my surprise this is how I found it:Story: 8One thing I found good about this is that there was an actual plot. The characters had something they were looking for. There is also...change in consistency of the story and because it changes it doesn\'t get repetitive. In my opinion great. And when I thought it would end like any harem anime it had a ""twist"" of the past which reveals all the truth about the little details that didn\'t make sense throughout the anime. And adding the supernatural aspect made this anime different (I know there are so many harems with supernatural, but if you watch this you\'ll understand).Art: 9Of course it\'s good, but even if the standard of 2013 art is high this type of art was still good and in some ways different. And the characters were drawn very well.Sound: 7I found the opening quite catchy and the ending sometimes made me listen to it till the end (which I normally don\'t). I think the VAs did a good job but not something to go in my trophy room.Characters: 8The only reason I put 8 was because of the consistency of the characters as they change ""like that"" with a ""wish"". But while it lasted, the main character was the opposite of all harem MCs as he actually would like do embarrassing stuff and kneel down in front of a girl. It\'s quite typical as there is tsubdere and deres. But even so there was also the drama aspect that also made it interesting to watch the characters.Enjoyment: 8To be honest I really enjoyed this anime because it was so different to other harems as there is a lot that doesn\'t happen normally in harems (like the MC actually picks a girl in the end). You won\'t find the story to be the best thing ever as it is half episodic. But it isn\'t the typical hot spring, beach, festival episodes.Overall: 8As you can see I have been quite positive in this review. So I will break it to you that it isn\'t perfect. Like the fact that they had used the supernatural aspect to make a great plot but then they change it back like it never happened instead of using it to an advantage. But it\'s good that they managed to make something out of it. It may seem very complicated to understand but I have been trying to be spoiler free. In my opinion I would check it out as it keeps you entertained and you can judge from there forth. change in consistency of the story and because it changes it doesn\'t get repetitive.

He is deeply in love with swimsuits and does squats near a window during his training time to look through them and see the girls in their swimsuits.He one day discovers that there is a stone cat statue at the top of the hill, and it fulfills his wish and takes away the things that you don\'t need and gives them to someone who needs them. He gets anxious at night and goes...there to find out for himself. He gives his body pillow as a gift to the stony cat and tells it to take away his facade. As we later discover, he stumbles upon a girl who made that cat with her sister\'s help. This girl prays to the cat to take away her emotions and facial expressions. However, the boy later recovers his facade, but the girl does not have her expressions back. As the story continues, we see that the boy does not remember anything about his past, and when going back in time, he understands that he made a deal with the stony cat when he was young, and it was that it would take away the boy\'s memory of the past. He would remember the person he talked to or met, but once they became memories, they would be taken away.This anime does have a rather sad ending, but overall, it is an anime that does not let the viewers get bored. It keeps unlocking new secrets as we keep watching the episodes.

The other hook is that the plot is also kinda interesting to what surmounts to one...of those typical ""trickster genie"" plotlines in the form of the cat god statues with various effects on the wisher.Since this is kinda a character focused narrative, LA will move onto characters. LA already talked about Youto Yokodera but LA will go into a bit more depth with him. He is one of the major forces driving the plot forward, if not he\'s one of the causes of many of the wishes gone wrong and he wants to protect everyone or befriend them in order to help with both his own problems as well as others. He is a slightly unusual main protagonist in the sense but still has one of the trappings of ""wants to protect everyone schtick to him, though once again his sincerity and dedication can easily make up for his pervertedness and especially his trappings that irked LA by the halfway point. Next are the harem members...Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi voiced by Yui Ogura, one of the main female protagonist in which she wished to express less emotions thus can\'t express ANY emotions, she is for the most part was a supporting character though her character development does arise from her issues of wanting to express herself but can\'t, that and her connection to Youto before the start of the anime also helps her to get away from her supporting character status and becomes important in certain plotlines. She was one of LA\'s favourite characters in the series because of her interesting dilemma and driving force of the anime. Next is Azusa Azuki voiced by Kaori Ishihara, the ojou of the series or so it would seem and adds to Youto\'s love triangle in a sense. Her character development arc was probably what sold LA in this series as it was more or less visceral on how it went. She later on has more importance later on but her introductory arc definitely added the impact to the anime really was going for and what it would become and like Tsukiko is an important character to the plot outright. Next is Tsukushi Tsutsukakushi, Tsukiko\'s older and much brasher sister voiced by Yukari Tamura and is the one that gave Youto the title of ""Hentai Ouji"", she is at best a comedic character what with her naivete and her brutishly powerful strength that makes for pretty slapstick comedy when with Youto, but because she\'s Tsukiko\'s older sister yes...she has a bit of importance to the plot as well but going any deeper would be spoiler territory and she also with her younger sister were LA\'s favourite characters in the anime, Azusa story-wise however had the better plotlines and impact to the anime (sans the finale arc which had more to do with Youto and Tsukiko which would make sense). Finally we have Emanuela Pollarola voiced by Aimi Terakawa, a mysterious young girl who knows Youto and her importance has some ties to Azusa but again spoilers.Why LA dived into the characters is that these characters do have some certain themes, the typical ""just be yourself"" is there and accounted for, but also ""be careful what you wish for"" added in and executed VERY well allowing these character to flourish in a sense and really make these characters with flaws such ""perverted and completely open minded about it, expressing too much, being different to being selfish and clingy"" really really likable and ""human"" and what allows the anime to be different from those typical romcom animes. LA also especially liked how Tsukiko, Azusa and Emanuela\'s animal theming coincided with the harem dynamic of the cat, dog and rabbit respectively.There is fanservice in this anime, there\'s no mistake in that but it\'s just not to the focus of the anime. The fanservice in the anime does mainly consist of the harem members going through many fanservicey outfits and certain ass shots but other than that it\'s pretty vanilla nonetheless.Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko.\'s plot elements has the typical stylings of a harem but it also has a bit of mystery mainly with it\'s wishmaking scenario\'s it has with it\'s characters. The mystery usually revolves around ""who is the wishmaker"" and ""how to make them revert it"" because of this insight it allows us to develop the wishmaker in question and drives the intrigue of the plot forward with Youto developing relationships or solving it.In terms of animation done by JC Staff, the character designs were polished and moe and LA really loved the designs, the backgrounds also had to give a bit of mention as the anime does go into some ""weird territory"" what with the wishmaking scenario and does emphasis the bizarre nature of the anime at times and all to the polished state similar to the character designs. JC Staff nonetheless did a really good job in the animation department in Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko.In terms of voice acting, the voice acting was actually pretty spot on for the entire cast. Though Yuki Kaji is typecasted as the lovable pervert in this anime (*cough* Highschool DxD *cough*), he is still a standout in this anime nonetheless and able to flex his harem drama vocals. Now LA had been annoyed by Yui Ogura to a certain extent a couple of times on LA\'s reviews but LA will be straight with you here, Yui Ogura is a GREAT voice actor (see her roles as Athena from Campione!, Yuzurina Houshou from Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru!, Hanbee Takenaka from Oda Nobuna no Yabou, Rinne Berlinetta from ViVid Strike! and Toki Onjouji from Saki Achiga-hen: Episode of Side-A..all coincidentally all have deadpan or loli tones in them in some sense) but Yui Ogura can sometimes be a caricature of her own roles and that easily spills into her vocals of the typical genki loli vocals, however her role as Tsukiko is one of her better roles to date for LA, sure her vocals are that of a deadpan loli but even then she has ""range"" to it utilizing both her loli and deadpan in the best mix possible and absolutely avoiding the annoying tone in her vocals at all for her role as Tsukiko and LA LOVED her performance because of it...she still wasn\'t LA\'s favourite voice actor in this anime though...that goes to Yukari Tamura AND Kaori Ishihara, Yukari Tamura because...it\'s Yukari Tamura voicing a brutish tsundere! and Kaori Ishihara for her voicing Azusa and her RANGE was more or less amazing in this anime. Even though this anime\'s voice cast has certain annoyingly squeaky voice actors, this voice cast managed to divert that COMPLETELY. LA just loved this voice cast...what else can LA say?.The finale arc as LA mentioned above looked at Youto and Tsukiko\'s rather mysteriously missing backstory of their first meeting which surprisingly Youto seemed to have forgotten, this finale arc brought some loose plot threads as well reverting the focus back to Tsukiko proper (as Emanuela, Tsukushi and Azusa took her limelight for a while with their development respectively) something LA was kinda wanting ever since Azusa\'s introductory arc and finally bringing Tsukiko out of the ""supporting comedic role"". This finale did get rather serious with some ""family issues"" as one of it\'s biggest crutch to the finale and executed well as the conflict was visceral (or took the turn for the dramatic...though Azuki\'s arc was like this too) in a sense, nonetheless LA liked the change in atmosphere while still balancing it\'s more comedic antics in check when it is needed. The only thing this finale had though if you paid attention to the plot is that the entire ""missing backstory of Youto"" is predictable in the sense that if you connected all the dots and took all the subtle hints...it became obvious what this finale arc was leading too, but still even if this ending was predictable, LA still liked this ending for developing not only Youto\'s missing backstory but Tsukiko and Tsukushi by an extent and giving a ""happy"" ending with a self-sacrificing result from Youto in the process but still a ""happy"" ending either way.LA really has to talk about flaws in this anime and it\'ll be more ironic that LA will in this review as LA already said that Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko.\'s themes of just being yourself even with your flaws but nonetheless the flaws needs to be addressed and LA did see some flaws in this anime as a whole. As much as Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. is a refreshing take on the ecchi romcom anime, it still has most of it\'s cliches accounted for from the typical harem setting and MANY of the misunderstandings drives the plot forward in a way (mainly from Tsukiko from comedic reasoning, Azuki from the plot), but as a defense to this LA will say that even though they use the typical harem romcom cliches, it\'s the underlining interesting plotlines with it\'s even more interesting characters that keeps it away from being stereotypical of it\'s genre even with it\'s cliches. The only other thing that might irk some people about Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. is Youto himself and his open-minded pervertedness and sometimes his white lying does kinda cross the line for the sake of comedy at times...some might see him as endearing...some might see him as another typically annoying Yuki Kaji genki pervert...take your pick...LA was in both camps for that.We all have flaws that we know or people point out that might make us a better person, but if ridding these flaws makes you a better person, it\'ll strip your individuality and being ""perfect"" is nothing but a flaw in itself and Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. projects this in it\'s characters and what makes Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. something refreshingly different in it\'s genre. LA will say this again, Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko.\'s characters and their flaws are the defining trait and strength of this anime and just it\'s sincerity and charm it has to it all coming from a white lying pervert and an emotionless girl as our main leads is anything to go by. of those typical ""trickster genie"" plotlines in the form of the cat god statues with various effects on the wisher.Since this is kinda a character focused narrative, LA will move onto characters.

First the summary is accurate for the first few episodes but then goes on a strange twist and focuses only on the male character making the girls feel like love sick puppies. While the harem effect seems obvious I was still hoping for more character development form the girls.Along with the plot of ""discovering what they lost"" the episodes don\'t all make sense unless you watch it all. (At least for me)The only thing I really liked about this was the slight resolution of why the main character was they way he was...and how the characters all seemed happy in the end. and how the characters all seemed happy in the end.', ""Ok let me get to the point if you hate and don't like loli character design, then its not for you. I being a man of culture am not particularly fond of it but don't have any inhibition towards it either.so, on a casual gaze it might seem like another typical harem anime where mc is loved by all the female cast without any credible reason whatsover, but this is not the case here. The anime is able to add depth to the character and make them much more credible and much more apealing.The mc in this case is not a useless runt...like most cases who is indecisive and simply basking in the pleasure of his harem. He is kind and vows  never to make a girl cry  but also is honest and never gives false assurances. Also he has a unique kind of history and chemistry with each of the girls and treats them very organically. There is never a moment of forced conversation.More over the supernatural aspect allows many cases to happen that won't happen in real life that really allows to add depth to the character. like most cases who is indecisive and simply basking in the pleasure of his harem.

It also has a hint of harem.)I liked Henneko because it had an interesting developing plot more so towards the second half of the series.I liked Henneko because it had an interesting cast of characters even though it was this genre of anime (comedy).I slightly disliked Henneko because the main character is/was incredibly dense most of the time. He becomes less dense further on, but it is a bit frustrating.θ STORY: The story is very good. The story is...centered on Tsukiko and previous memories that the main character does not remember. It\'s also centered around the ""stony cat"" you notice in the English title. The stony cats grants their wishes and it takes them in unexpected directions. The plot is semi-serious, so there isn\'t too much bullshit. It focuses a lot on Tsukiko\'s family, romance of the characters and Yokodera\'s memories. The anime doesn\'t have too much ecchi in it, but there are some body shots. It\'s not too dramatic, but more comedic(?).θ ART: The art is very good. The animation style is very clean and I rather like the cel shading. It\'s really high quality. The dancing on the ending theme is a bit awkward to me; not the dance, the way it flows is awkward.

The plot is flimsily handled and is not apparent until the middle of the show. This show is mostly focusing on “moe”, which does jumble everything with pointless episodes only for showing the cast of girls. But when there is an episode driven by the story it is handled a lot better, and more interesting, but still quite flimsy.Characters: 7/10Mostly the characters are stereotypical such as Tsukiko, the monotone shy love interest or...the short “tsundere” blond. The main character is very interesting though. Yokodera is a very perverted teen but has a very odd kindness to him. Unlike in most harems, he is interested in every available girl causing him to get into some major “pervy” situations. The characters although are quite well written and loveable.Art:10/10This is the show’s strongest aspect. The character designs are beyond adorable. The backgrounds are quite beautiful to look at. The 3-d models are also handled very well.Sound: 9/10The Voice acting is nothing short of fantastical.  Ogura Yui, the actor who plays Tsukiko, perfectly captures the monotone voice. The Music is actually enjoyable and is worth listening to.It ends quite quickly and has a very rushed, awful ending. But for what it’s worth the characters are a treat along with the Art.

Meow.Story [8/10]It seems like something is either wrong with you or the world is gonna end when a statue of a cat can actually grant your wishes and...that is exactly what happens to our fellow main characters. Although, things don\'t go as well as they should and now, they may have just gotten a turn for the worse and I love it. All the chaos that a wish-granting cat can ensue is pure genius, but also a little restricting considering that the main characters can\'t even pull their own weight and turn to their cat friend instead.

No complaints otherwise!Sound [7/10]Meow. The opening was quite catchy and the ending was decent but, nothing too memorable can be dug up from that.

It often tried to portray itself as dramatic and moving, but because of its poor pacing, repellent fanservice, and borderline ridiculous drama, it was extremely easy to see through this façade. These are just a few of Henneko’s many problems, which you will learn if you continue reading. I don’t enjoy writing negative reviews, but warning you against this show is practically public service.StoryThe premise of Henneko, two characters searching to reclaim that which they carelessly wished away, is uninspired. Be careful what you wish for scenarios are...a dime-a-dozen and I’m sure that there are many better executed examples out there. Instead of exploring in any real depth why Yokodera and Tsukiko wished to rid themselves of that which they considered burdensome and undergoing a thorough dissection of their characters and motivations, this show chose to be nothing more than mindless entertainment, which would be fine, if that entertainment didn’t come in the form of unfunny, un-titillating (come on, people, these kids may be legal, but they look about eight), and offensive fanservice. Henneko also flip-flopped as to whether the cat gods were benevolent or malevolent. It waited until the show was mostly over to set them up as the villains of the piece. Additionally, one of the characters becomes ill to the point of being at death’s door, because of mildew. These things were poorly timed, poorly thought-out attempts to create additional conflict, because Henneko’s central conflict was resolved just a few episodes in. It should come as no surprise then that that which was intended to keep me invested and tug at my heartstrings prompted nothing but bewilderment and frustration.CharactersI didn’t like a single character. What’s there to like about an immature, teenage pervert whose defining trait is his ability to put up a façade and lie to other people about his true intentions and an emotionless husk of a girl? And that’s just the two lead characters. The other female characters compensated for the lead’s lack of personality by being too loud and too over-the-top – caricatures of actual, real people. More upsetting was the female characters’ reactions to Yokodera’s advances (accidental or otherwise). On the whole, they appeared shocked, but otherwise flattered to find themselves in degrading, mortifying positions. What kind of poisonous message does that send out to anybody watching Henneko? That girls secretly enjoy being assaulted or will, at the very least, resign themselves to their fate should they be so misfortunate as to find themselves in that position? To imply that in today’s day and age is absolutely disgusting.Art and musicHenneko’s art was alright. It was an improvement on that of JC Staff shows gone by, anyway. Its background art and character designs were acceptable, if not excellent. Henneko’s music was equally passable. I didn’t especially like the opening or ending tracks, but that’s to do with my aversion towards extremely high-pitched female vocals, but some background pieces were rather nice and enhanced the mood of the scenes they were played during.Overall enjoymentThe only enjoyment I got out of Henneko was the undiluted relief upon finishing it and realising that my torment was over. Its story was uninspired, poorly paced, and lacking believable conflict, its characters were intolerable, and its fanservice, offensive. I would strongly advise you not to watch Henneko. Even if all you’re after is fanservice, you’d be scraping the bottom of the barrel to turn to this show. a dime-a-dozen and I’m sure that there are many better executed examples out there. Instead of exploring in any real depth why Yokodera and Tsukiko wished to rid themselves of that which they considered burdensome and undergoing a thorough dissection of their characters and motivations, this show chose to be nothing more than mindless entertainment, which would be fine, if that entertainment didn’t come in the form of unfunny, un-titillating (come on, people, these kids may be legal, but they look about eight), and offensive fanservice. Henneko also flip-flopped as to whether the cat gods were benevolent or malevolent. It waited until the show was mostly over to set them up as the villains of the piece. Additionally, one of the characters becomes ill to the point of being at death’s door, because of mildew. These things were poorly timed, poorly thought-out attempts to create additional conflict, because Henneko’s central conflict was resolved just a few episodes in. It should come as no surprise then that that which was intended to keep me invested and tug at my heartstrings prompted nothing but bewilderment and frustration.CharactersI didn’t like a single character. What’s there to like about an immature, teenage pervert whose defining trait is his ability to put up a façade and lie to other people about his true intentions and an emotionless husk of a girl? And that’s just the two lead characters. The other female characters compensated for the lead’s lack of personality by being too loud and too over-the-top – caricatures of actual, real people. More upsetting was the female characters’ reactions to Yokodera’s advances (accidental or otherwise). On the whole, they appeared shocked, but otherwise flattered to find themselves in degrading, mortifying positions. What kind of poisonous message does that send out to anybody watching Henneko? That girls secretly enjoy being assaulted or will, at the very least, resign themselves to their fate should they be so misfortunate as to find themselves in that position? To imply that in today’s day and age is absolutely disgusting.Art and musicHenneko’s art was alright. It was an improvement on that of JC Staff shows gone by, anyway. Its background art and character designs were acceptable, if not excellent. Henneko’s music was equally passable. I didn’t especially like the opening or ending tracks, but that’s to do with my aversion towards extremely high-pitched female vocals, but some background pieces were rather nice and enhanced the mood of the scenes they were played during.Overall enjoymentThe only enjoyment I got out of Henneko was the undiluted relief upon finishing it and realising that my torment was over. Its story was uninspired, poorly paced, and lacking believable conflict, its characters were intolerable, and its fanservice, offensive. I would strongly advise you not to watch Henneko. Even if all you’re after is fanservice, you’d be scraping the bottom of the barrel to turn to this show.', ""Harem-esque but with substance. The story keeps evolving and changing and you can see the characters change from 'your typical harem people' to 'Oh! Those are actual characters'. Yes, they progress and develop, even if the main first plots are lost in translation.I enjoyed it. I was somewhat satisfied with the ending and how the story developed. It wasn't a disappointment as almost every other harem I've watched, and I could enjoy both main characters as well as some secondary ones. The plots and subplots and chaos was nice and refreshing.It is not  piece of art, but you would not waste your time...if you watched it.After all this I've said, I have to add this: if I ever knew the hero, I would punch him. Just saying. if you watched it.After all this I've said, I have to add this: if I ever knew the hero, I would punch him. Just saying."", ""it was a very good anime. Complicated, confusing at points (whic is a good thing I think) and the ending and twists were AMAZING!!!however, I just can't shake the sour feeling if dissatisfaction. It fell short of my expectations. The clever use of small signals and timing was perfect to convey the feelings of a character who couldn't show emotions, and it often made her just as likeable as any female protagonist in a romantic comedy. However, in the end the lack of progression was just frustrating...The outcome (SPOILER) where they just continue on living out their daily lives, him with a lack of memories...and her with a lack of emotions, was interesting, and maybe a good universal message about living and making others happy, but it left me personally feeling frustrated, incomplete, sad, and lonely.

The story follows Youto who is for all intents and purposes a huge pervert with a heart full of gold (and most likely blood too). He ends up becoming the reason Tsukiko, the younger Tsutsukakushi...sister loses her ability to show emotion. Along with her older sister Tsukushi and an annoying blonde ditz Azusa, they all go through different trials and events due to the cat gods wishing powers.So first off; this is a harem. If you do not like harems then leave now you will not like this show. For you who are still here, there are many great things this show accomplishes. First while this is a fanservice heavyish anime, pretty much everything is tied to a gag. Youto gets into many different situations because like 99.9% of the boys his age, he is a perve. All of these scenes (and believe me there are tons) are so funny and yes I actually did “laugh out loud” during many moments of the show. The scenes with Tsukiko are especially funny since even when she is extremely embarrassed, her monotone, no expression acting makes it so much funnier. It is a really funny show take my word for it.What the show ended up lacking on is what shows in this genre usually end up doing; leaving out important information and having excessive plot holes. A large amount of information seems to be pulled out of nowhere or just not looked into enough. It just seemed a little off putting when a character would bring up something like it’s common knowledge in the show but you cannot remember when (or even if) it was brought up. Also there will be large amounts of time where a main character will just up and disappear without any notice for three or so episodes.Now pertaining to the actual plot of the show, you can kind of split this show up into three or so parts. Essentially we start with the whole Tsukiko emotionless thing but then later on you are introduced to Azusa who ends up wishing for stuff. So essentially as the show progresses you will see Youto have to deal with various issues with various individuals. Everything seems to flow quite nicely EXCEPT the last sort of story arc (I guess the last four or so episodes). Everything begins to rush to a certain point of the plot and I feel as if some more time was needed. I do have to say that the final episode was very enjoyable as we FINALLY got to see some back story for Youto. Overall the story is passable and enjoyable even if the show suffers from pacing issues towards the end.Animation: 7/10The animation in this show is really good thanks to the character models, lighting, AND THE EYES (I’m a weirdo). Each character is very detailed and has a constant quality throughout the entire season. Also the eyes are extremely well done. There are many scenes where characters will seem more believable just because of how they are looking towards each other (eyes are important man). The color palette was pretty good in my opinion; nothing looked bland and the backgrounds were pretty good.Sound: 7/10The main star focus of the sound in this anime are the voice actors. Even though Tsukiko was monotone for like 95% of the show, just the way her voice actor presented herself with the different mannerisms made her character’s performance much more believable. The rest of the cast also did a great job especially Youto. As for the soundtrack for the anime, all I can say is that it was pretty average. Other than the really catchy opening song, everything else was there but just not over the top awesome.Characters: 7/10Azusa sucks. She was by far the most annoying female character of this season (yes even more than Tohka from Date a Live). That being said, the rest of the cast did an amazing job providing us with some very interesting scenes.  The chemistry between Youto and Tsukiko is awesome to see unfold throughout the entire season as they do become closer and closer. Also due to some certain events later on in the show, Youto somehow gets on Tsukushi’s good side which makes things even more interesting later on with all three main females gunning for Youto. Most of the characters get pretty extensive character development so yeah overall this anime did a great job presenting us with interesting characters (fu#@ Azusa though…annoying b!%ch).Overall: 6.7/10This show was a real shocker for me. When I saw “hentai” in the title for the show, I automatically assumed it was going to be a stupid ecchi anime. What I found out after twelve episodes was that masked in this gag comedy anime, there are some really cute, interesting, and serious moments that I will remember for the years to come. I strongly encourage you take the time to sit through this show. You will be too busy laughing your ass off to point out the plot holes.Enjoyment: 7/10Thanks for reading my review!

If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!Sincerely,Awesome Drummer', ""The title says it all. Yokodera Youto is a pervert, or more precisely, someone labeled a pervert. His interests seem perfectly normal for a teenager, what makes him special is that he's quite open about them. This honesty will be one of the major gag sources and also the way to gain girls's trust. Just watch the opening. It represents the show quite well.One other thing apparent in the OP is an overflowing of cutesyness. This is going to be the main armament of the less equipped heroines. Fortunately it's treated by healthy appreciation on Youto's part, without melting away. Well, save for the customary...going back to childhood-part, the barely hidden steamy reactions to each other's younger forms are hilarous.Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko couples this charm with the acquired inability to express emotions, the hit representative of which is the disenchanted munching sound she makes when indulging in her favorite hobby -- sweets. She's going to be the girl always near the protagonist, perseverant but tempered.Not like Azuki Azusa, for sure. Thinking back, her character seems not as well thought up as that of the others, I might go as far as stating that it is the weakest point of this show. She starts with the rôle of the haughty spoiled girl admired by all, but quickly falls for Youto, and after that she only appears as a mock image of affection gone overboard. Maybe all this was only a plot device to draw out Youto's gentler side.Ah, Koutetsu-san! The elder sister of Tsukiko is certainly the stacked flagship of this series. She wears the objects of all the boob jokes in an unaffected way, which together with her utmost naïveté makes her an interesting character. Thankfully her extreme affection for Tsukiko is quickly subdued. That's done much better by her sidekick, with her boisterous perverted ranting.All in all, this is a comedy with a merry atmosphere and unexpected dramatic tones, where all the drooling over female characters is made explicit and jokingly self-referential. going back to childhood-part, the barely hidden steamy reactions to each other's younger forms are hilarous.Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko couples this charm with the acquired inability to express emotions, the hit representative of which is the disenchanted munching sound she makes when indulging in her favorite hobby -- sweets.

Majorly, what I found that liked the most was the colors. Everything was bright and had a distinct look to it. One of the things that was different than the generic were they eyes. Now I found that the eyes had a little less detail than average, but it really worked. For example, one of the main characters loses her ability to show emotion on her face, and this way of drawing eyes relative to her...face makes her look emotionless, not like she was inanimate, but more like she was just indifferent to everything. If this wasn’t the way they took that character and made her like that it wouldn’t have been believable, and I’m glad they did.Sound: This is where the show falls short for me. Not saying the music and sound was bad by any means but the story sucked me in that I lost track of where I was. Sometimes there were places where the sound makes the show really good, but others, it just sounds a bit cheesy. This being said I really loved the introduction animation. The song was catchy and the animation was fun to watch, albeit a bit repetitive. As for the closing, most times I was so eager to get to the next episode I would just skip over those endings, and while I know i shouldn’t do it, I felt like the endings--when I did watch them--didn’t really add much and weren’t worth watching.Story: This story was fresh and amazing. A story about a student named Youto who has a bit of an obsession with dirty magazines (even so, Fan-service is present, bu not abundant) but he has a façade that he puts up so no one can see the real him. When he is fed up with living a lie he hears about a stone cat idol on hill with a tree that grants wishes and gives what it takes to someone that needs it. So Youto goes and offers his façade and wishes it to be gone so he can be who he truly is. While there he runs into Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi, a first year looking to try to get rid of the way she has whatever she is thinking is shows up on her face. The Cat God responds by taking her emotions and removing his façade. Now, even if he wanted to lie about what he is thinking, he can’t hold back from saying what he is thinking. The story then revolves around the relationship between Tsukiko and Youto, and how even though he never seems to realize it, things never seem to work out the way they are anticipated.Personal Reflection: This show has been on my “to watch” list for the past two years. But I have a pretty strict rule about not watching shows from my list until I come to them, and this show makes me want to start breaking that rule. I say this because this show was so good and made me feel so many things inside, and it has been on my radar for so long, If I had chosen to watch this show earlier I could appreciate it more. It is a show that I will recommend and I will watch again. Some may be turned away from this show simply because the title has the word “hentai” in it, when that word is just Japanese for “pervert”. Also, while Youto may seem really hard to deal with at the beginning, he does get better and the show does at times become really heartfelt and it is hard not to like this show. Please, watch The “HENTAI” Prince and the Stony Cat. face makes her look emotionless, not like she was inanimate, but more like she was just indifferent to everything.

Please, watch The “HENTAI” Prince and the Stony Cat.', ""Henneko is a wacky show about a stone cat that grants wishes. We're not talking about a stingy genie in the lamp with just three wishes, with this cat you get unlimited wishes. And even better, make your wishes today and you can UNDO any of your previous wishes at will, no commitment necessary! Now at this point any sane person would rightfully be suspicious of this infomercial of a show; indeed there is a caveat in that the cat will grant the wish however he sees fit. If you're wishing it were cooler, don't be surprised to find a blizzard outside.While obviously not the...most realistic of shows, Henneko has its humor points. The show vaguely reminds me of the style of Inukami with lots of random ecchi moments and harem-based situations. That being said, I wouldn't expect any deep relationships or focused plot line from this show. It's a slice of life in the same way that ToLoveRu is, i.e. anything but ordinary days at school. If you're looking for a light, harem-based ecchi comedy with some semblance of a plot, feel free to give this a try.Animation:The animation is fair overall. The animation style is fittingly simplistic and colorful, as the overall mood is generally light. Don't expect lavish backgrounds or awe-inspiring light effects. The characters are all readily distinguishable and the stone cat is less stony than you might expect (it seems to be able to change its expression and grows/shrinks with the amount of wishes it is burdened with). The expressions can be a bit hard to trace at times as one of the main heroines has wished away all of her expressions.Despite the magical nature of the stone cat, there aren't any fights or other heavy action scenes. As for ecchi, expect pretty much everything short of exposed nudity. You have your accidental grabs, falls, as well as a lot of verbal sexual harassment that earns the protagonist the title of hentai ouji.Sound:The OP is sung by Yukari Tamura and thus made me do a double take as I thought I was watching B Gata H Kei for a second. It's a playful tune though it reminds me too much of the aforementioned series. The ED has Yui Ogura singing a playful tune in her non-monotone voice, which I guess we should be thankful for considering her monotone humming in the actual series. The BGM is standard fare with nothing all that worth mentioning.The VA cast is fair overall though I personally didn't find the return of Accel World's South Park character all that great. If anyone deserves praise for effort, it would probably be Kaori Ishihara for her role as tsundere Azuki.Story:The story is loosely arc-based as our protagonist interacts with the different heroines. It eventually meanders its way to a final conflict that presents itself a bit tad darker than the other issues up to that point. With the final mystery solved, the show ends without giving any sort of closure to the characters. Thus I conclude that there will either be a second season or the producers screwed up and ran out of money.Obviously, there are a few loose ends that the story never explains. Given that there's a cat that can grant any wish, you can assume that anything is game in terms of possible resolutions to conflicts. While there is ample character-based humor in the show, I did find myself questioning the intelligence of the characters as they apparently don't learn that the stony cat tweaks their actual wish.While not the most coherent or detailed of stories, it's a fair and entertaining progression overall. It's just a tad short on the resolution.Character:If you were hoping for a protagonist that openly proclaims his inner desires, unfortunately you'll be disappointed. The protagonist is more of your standard, nice guy who happens to be in the right place at the right time over and over again. The majority of the character value in this show comes from the heroines, who all have something to do with the stone cat at one point or another. Unfortunately, their struggles over the hentai ouji fall upon deaf ears as Youto is quite slow when it comes to love. Apparently there is a lot of viewer hype about Tsukiko. It was interesting seeing her compete for Youto with her outward lack of emotion but I don't think it was worth all the hype.Though there is some character development, I don't find it fair to call it such if it's as a result of an abnormal influence such as the stony cat. Don't expect any significant romantic developments.Value:If you watch this with a notebook and a serious expression, prepare to be utterly disappointed. This is a light-hearted show that is meant to be watched accordingly. Sit back and enjoy a few laughs at the protagonist's idiocy.

But this soon leaves place to other matters, with the series involving some all-mighty cat statues which grant wishes. One would think that with anything having the chance to become possible, things will become serious at any moment. Well, they don\'t. The series mostly involves a lot of monotonous slice of life.Characters seem very weak. One extremely big error is to deprive the feminine protagonist of her emotions at the first episode. This is not cute at all, it\'s as depriving Goku of becoming a super saiyan. One...way to be cute is to show emotions.Also, with the protagonist being called ""The pervert prince"", one would expect a pervert, not a guy who wanders into an occupied bathroom by chance.

I really didn't expect anything that this anime ended up becoming. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would.The story has no right being so complex yet intriguing. It started off as I expected, but it ended up being so much more. Sometimes the story didn't make much sense, but it recovered in the end. With so many twists and turns, you can tell the story had the most focus in this anime. The quality of the story isn't what I expected at all when looking at it at a quick glance.The characters, at least to...me, are all an array of positions or statuses. They all represent a certain viewpoint and want, and it plays well with the main plot (which is the statue). However, because of this, they stand out too much from each other, which ends up losing focus in certain parts. At times, they even felt dull and unfinished, but this was very minimal. Tsukushi is the best girl here imo (mostly because the other three seem too loli-like so...). She's dumb and ambitious, and always has a goal of some sort, so I guess I'm a sucker for that.The animation isn't something to write home about, but it is pleasing. The aesthetics and character designs are very well done. A very average quality of animation with a chill and relaxing style.Overall, this anime was fun to watch but did fall off at some points.

Never read the manga, I decided to check out the anime for the first time. Mainly, I think of myself as the manga reader before I become the anime watcher, and this show was not an exception. The interesting thing about this anime was the simple fact that the main character, Yōto, is that he wants to feel like an actual person, despite the fact that he\'s well-known of being a pervert. These type of stories are just the ones where...you sit back, relax and not really think things through. I\'m not saying he\'s the worst character, but he really isn\'t that interesting when it comes to wanting to have real emotions and getting rid of his perverted thoughts. It was not until I saw the Golden Cat, where I thought, ""Hm. I could stick around with something like this. It\'s not that original, but at least its somewhat entertaining.""That\'s how I felt when watching the first half of this anime.The second half started to bring in some life, despite the fact that it was up to the female characters in the last three episodes to do this. When Yōto and Tsukiko transform back to their younger selves, I see that Tsukiko\'s mother was more fond of him than her own daughters. It started to add a little bit of context through it all. Yōto treated Tsukiko\'s and Tsukushi\'s mother with more respect, that he wanted to give all to her. In the end, wishing your thoughts away is the only ordeal which started to make me wonder I watched this anime in the first place. Some of the supporting characters (with the exception of Emi) couldn\'t really stand out that much to me. It\'s not a bad anime, but if they started it out with characterizing the fact that he wants to be accepted by people as a person with real feelings and things to say, then I think they wouldn\'t have to strangely delve into the fact on why he\'s such a pervert through the first two episodes.

Overall Hentai Oujo is one of the better sort of harem/romance anime, though not one of the better supernatural mystery anime.Good: As someone who hates harem endings, the anime makes it somewhat clear early on who the MC is going for. The backstory of the characters is compelling and really the backstory and how they tie it up in the end is the main thing boosting the story above other similar anime.Bad:...I feel like the creators were a bit haphazard with plot and characterization. Sometimes going with generic cliches, other time breaking with it, but overall making things a bit confused at times. I feel like the creators were a bit haphazard with plot and characterization.

Good triumphing over evil, a mystery solved, a pair of lovers.But there are also stories that choose to convey something a little bit more ordinary– something more human. A story not about the apocalypse, but one focused on a normal person growing up and finding their place in the world. A story where the antagonist is not some cackling lunatic, but a sibling or a friend.What is interesting about something so mundane? Sagara Sou\'s ""HenNeko"" has the answer.

However, as poorly as the serious and the silly mix, the overall impression of both is good, and overall makes for a good anime. The serious plots help develop genuinely good characters like Tsutsukakushi Tsukiko, who despite not being able to use any tone or show any expression due to the omnipotent Stony Cat is developed extremely well. The relationship between her and the main character Youto Yokodera is developed to be...deep and complex as she has well-supported desires and wishes and the main character is just trying to figure out what is going on. Each of the rest of the characters is given similar treatment and structures to their ills and their actions and in general, the seriousness gives an entertaining and impactful story. On the other hand, the silliness, despite sometimes coming very quickly after very serious sections, does allow for breaks from an otherwise heavy anime. These tend to be of lower quality than the serious parts and with many tropes with the classic harem anime, but overall they are not bad. As for the animation, art style, OP, and ED, they all can be described as the classic early 2010 trashy rom-com anime style, which isn’t a bad thing for me.

Cardfight: Vanguard finally has a full-size plot.In former series the characters just participated in tournaments and rescued the world (or even entire universe). Now they are at school, starting their own cardfighting club.I like the new plot mainly because it features life of high-school students (a very popular theme in manga and anime). There are new characters and some background characters now become foreground. What's more I think that the characters have become some kind of more mature (they are in high-school after all).I think that art has slightly improved compared to the former series.What is really good...about this series is that it simply makes me laugh.

Cencoroll,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3087/Cencoroll,"['Every so often anime throws up something completely out of the ordinary, not simply in terms of content, but also in terms of production. There\'s many a title that can boast an extremely original plot, or cutting edge animation, or some other aspect of it\'s production that has the potential to shake the foundations of the entire medium. A case in point is Shinkai Makoto\'s much acclaimed Hoshi no Koe, which proved once and for all that a quality anime could be produced by one person (with some time and effort of course). It\'s a sad fact that the current trends within anime have precluded...other such innovations in favour of what\'s popular or what will sell.With Cencoroll though, the winds of creative change that were long thought becalmed, may have started blowing once more.The anime is simply about a boy named Tetsu, a girl named Yuki, a mysterious amorphous blob with a transformation ability and eyes in odd places named Cenco, and a fight (kind of).It sounds completely uninteresting right? That\'s what I thought too before I watched it, and to say I was extremely surprised by Cencoroll would be an understatement.The anime is based on a one shot manga called Amon Game by Uki Atsuya, and it deviates from standard anime practices in almost every aspect, from plot to production. The story itself is laced with a large number of metaphors and symbols, some of which are easy to spot while others are far more subtle. While this can sometimes be a bad thing if used too much, in the case of Cencoroll it can, more often than not, promote discussion about the various references or symbolisms present in the anime, and more importantly, their usage within the context of the story. An example of this is the scene with the giant pudding that carries Tetsu for a while, which made me think ""I wonder what King Kong would be like if it was made by Salvador Dali?"". This is merely one of a large number of ""I wonder.."" thoughts that popped into my during the 27 minutes of this anime.The entire show has a large dose of surrealness about it which is reinforced by the presence of Cenco and other ""creatures"" like ""him"". The symbols and metaphors present within the show also lend themselves to the overall sense of wierdness, and while the show can sometimes feel like it\'s overdosing on odd, it always manages to reel itself back to the main plot. That\'s not to say that the story is great though. It\'s too short to do any serious development in terms of plot or characters, which some people may find unfulfilling, however the show has a lot to offer if you approach it with an open mind.Aside from the ED, which was produced by Supercell (an 11 piece doujin music group), the anime has almost no thematic music whatsoever. This lends the show a strange, almost eerie, feeling of calm (bordering on apathy). Unlike most anime that are reliant on music to heighten the impact of a scene, Cencoroll studiously avoids using such techniques for the most part. The impact of this is most apparent when one considers the characters in the show, and while some may find the lack of music a little disconcerting, leaving the major part of the anime free of music enhances the characters in a big way (more on this in a bit).The one area where Cencoroll really separates itself from the crowd though, is in it\'s art and animation. While the character designs are a little on the plain side, they are extremely expressive, and their actions are well animated throughout the show. This, in particular, goes for Cenco\'s transformations which, although surreal, are extremely fluid. The backgrounds are very well rendered from start to finish, with some scenes reminding me of the stunning artwork from Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto ~Natsu no Sora~, and it came as a real shock to find that this level of quality was the work of one man.That\'s right. You didn\'t misread me. Cencoroll is, aside from some bits of music, the work of Uki Atsuya, who wrote the screenplay, designed the backgrounds and characters, directed the show, and animated everything. In that respect it has a great deal in common with Hoshi no Koe, yet even this can\'t keep the show static for any length of time. Unlike Shinkai, Uki actually received the backing of Aniplex for the production of the film, something which made his job easier. This marks one of the first occasions where an established production company has backed a single person in this way, and while producing an anime alone may not be a rarity nowadays (there are hobbyist animators after all, who regularly publish their work on the internet), the ripples from Aniplex\'s decision will be felt in anime for years to come.In terms of characters there is very little in the way of characterisation or development, which is due to the running time of 27 minutes. That said, there are those who would argue that the apathetic nature of the characters signifies that they are not believable in any way, which is a fair assessment for the most part. There is an argument in favour of the characters though, and that is the fact that they are teenagers. Consider, for a moment, that the majority of teenagers actually do display a degree of apathy, uninterest, boredom, etc, and one begins to understand the character\'s reactions in the show. While all three characters display a certain amount of boredom, Yuki also shows a good deal of curiosity during the first part of the show. In the case of Tetsu though, the strange occurences and wierd creatures are everyday occurences, so much so that they are no longer astonished by events, and this ""boredom"" with his daily routine is what is most emphasised by the lack of music.Cencoroll is a surprisingly well designed show, so much so in fact that it managed to catch me completely off guard. There are a number of aspects to the show that deviate greatly from normal anime practices, with many of those deviations occuring as part of the story. There are also several scenes which are simply moments of creative genius, the giant pudding being one such moment, however the scenes that occur inside Cenco\'s stomach are also memorable for their oddness. Granted the story and the characters lack a good degree of development, but given that this is only one episode, and is mainly the work of one man, I believe such failings can be forgiven.After all, many forgave those same failings in Hoshi no Koe, and while Cencoroll is decidely wierder than, well, most other anime out there, it also challenges the medium in a way that, in recent years, no other show has done. other such innovations in favour of what\'s popular or what will sell.With Cencoroll though, the winds of creative change that were long thought becalmed, may have started blowing once more.The anime is simply about a boy named Tetsu, a girl named Yuki, a mysterious amorphous blob with a transformation ability and eyes in odd places named Cenco, and a fight (kind of).It sounds completely uninteresting right?

The movements are of choppy but fluid quality and the sound blends perfectly into the production's texture. As expected for OVAs and the budget they normally receive, the drawings never seem half-assed. But unlike others, Uki is able to capture his manga roots within each snapshot, transition and moving scene. The result?

Shortly after, these two meet when our female protagonist Yuki discovers that our male protagonist Tetsu is in possession of one of these blob alien creatures, of which he has his named as ""Cenco"". His creature specializes in transformation.Cencoroll is quite an average film individually from its yet-to-be released sequel, featuring an interesting premise, but lacking in.. well.. lots of stuff. Most of the time the anime is silent with no soundtracks. People who are fond of music utilization in anime will...realize how quiet the whole film is. However, this is left up to preference.. because the silence of the show do symbolize the mood of the film and its characters, particularly Cenco and its linked owner Tetsu.Male protagonist Tetsu is the ""go with the flow"" type of character while simply doing whatever it is that he so desires. His mood seems to signify that he is devoid of curiosity or any sort of excitement or joy. Yuki on the other hand is quite the difference to Tetsu\'s personality, which makes it seem as though their personalities compliment one another to fit as relief.Even though the art is nothing too exquisite, it is actually quite a pleasure to the eye in its simplistic art and smooth animation. It\'s especially quite nice when watching Cenco use his abilities.The concept of this anime is unique in accordance to the alien monsters that we get to see. These monsters and their symbiotic bond with their \'owners\' make the show entertaining as we get to see how the characters make use of them as well as interacting with one another during and outside of battle scenes. However, we don\'t necessarily get an abundance of that in this short film, as there is only one antagonist and three shown monster/creatures.The characters do lack a lot of development as well as interaction in favor of exploration of the creatures\' innovative abilities and how it plays out in combat or work in practicality. The human characters didn\'t have much explained about themselves to us.. any thoughts about them would just have to be assumptions based on their personalities and the actions that they take, as there is no background to any of the characters including the antagonist. There is no backstory to them and there certainly is no elaboration on what/when/where/why/how these \'monsters\' came to be. And this ultimately is the sole reason why I see this film as lackluster, as there is no justice as to why this anime even deserves the praise that it gets when simple concepts and fundamentals are never even touched upon.By the end, Cencoroll leaves you with no conclusion along with no elaboration on any of the events that have taken place in the movie. So you\'re left to question and wonder what was the point of the wasted 25 mins you just gave into watching this short film. It makes me a little more than confused at people who praise this anime so much given how unexplained Cencoroll is. But I will say one thing: Despite my views about this anime being highly average, its sequel -if it ever releases- may very well change the mind of many people who have watched Cencoroll including myself. That is, if it lives up to the hype.If you have any opinions on why my review is terrible then please, share why. Thanks for reading. realize how quiet the whole film is. However, this is left up to preference.. because the silence of the show do symbolize the mood of the film and its characters, particularly Cenco and its linked owner Tetsu.Male protagonist Tetsu is the ""go with the flow"" type of character while simply doing whatever it is that he so desires. His mood seems to signify that he is devoid of curiosity or any sort of excitement or joy. Yuki on the other hand is quite the difference to Tetsu\'s personality, which makes it seem as though their personalities compliment one another to fit as relief.Even though the art is nothing too exquisite, it is actually quite a pleasure to the eye in its simplistic art and smooth animation. It\'s especially quite nice when watching Cenco use his abilities.The concept of this anime is unique in accordance to the alien monsters that we get to see. These monsters and their symbiotic bond with their \'owners\' make the show entertaining as we get to see how the characters make use of them as well as interacting with one another during and outside of battle scenes. However, we don\'t necessarily get an abundance of that in this short film, as there is only one antagonist and three shown monster/creatures.The characters do lack a lot of development as well as interaction in favor of exploration of the creatures\' innovative abilities and how it plays out in combat or work in practicality. The human characters didn\'t have much explained about themselves to us.. any thoughts about them would just have to be assumptions based on their personalities and the actions that they take, as there is no background to any of the characters including the antagonist. There is no backstory to them and there certainly is no elaboration on what/when/where/why/how these \'monsters\' came to be. And this ultimately is the sole reason why I see this film as lackluster, as there is no justice as to why this anime even deserves the praise that it gets when simple concepts and fundamentals are never even touched upon.By the end, Cencoroll leaves you with no conclusion along with no elaboration on any of the events that have taken place in the movie. So you\'re left to question and wonder what was the point of the wasted 25 mins you just gave into watching this short film. It makes me a little more than confused at people who praise this anime so much given how unexplained Cencoroll is. But I will say one thing: Despite my views about this anime being highly average, its sequel -if it ever releases- may very well change the mind of many people who have watched Cencoroll including myself.

It was a good idea, and it fit the production very well.The Seiyuu all did a great job voicing their respective rolls.Same in the Sound effects department.All the characters have that bored teenage mentality to them, but it is never to the point of annoyance.It\'s almost like they are all at that stage between childhood and adulthood, there\'s just no emotion.It\'s directed in such a way where it feels realistic and fits the production.---I knew that I was going to enjoy this show, but I enjoyed it even more than that.

In the movie’s universe there are these giant white “monsters” that are not even named. None of the W’s questions needed for an explanation or even just a theory are answered (who, why and how). Both for the people who apparently can control these...kinds of monster or the monsters themselves.Regardless, it was a very good adaptation, focusing not on how’s, but on the actual main happening: the match between the boys.

I can go even further and say that if there were actual themes, this anime would not have came out with the vibe that it did.On this area we can notice sparks of minimalism as we did on the art, which just serve to add to each other and create a calming feeling to it, contrasting with the story.Characters.

Yeah....Cencoroll has very apathetic characters, but they\'re also flawed and motivated. And, nothing about the story is dull, it\'s extremely interesting. And sometimes, even grander than the scope of its runtime. This much is true, since there\'s a part 2 and an upcoming part 3 in the works. But yeah, Cencoroll is amazing. It\'s not for everyone though, but if you\'re up for a one-of-a-kind anime fix / show that is experimental and daring, then this is the one.

Dantalian no Shoka: Ibarahime,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12879/Dantalian_no_Shoka__Ibarahime,"['Words convey a lot of things; our thoughts, our memories, our feelings, and everything else we can imagine are written and recorded into history. Speaking of history, how long has it been since we last saw that adorable, gluttonous, but also intelligent black princess by the name of Dalian ""Kuro no Yomihime, Black Reading Princess”? Too long, I\'d say! It\'s been over a year and our Black Biblioprincess returns in this special episode with her partner, Huey. We miss her and it\'s here in this episode that we see Dalian who once again presents some supernatural mystery.Dantalian no Shoka: Ibarahime (also known as The Mystic...Archives of Dantalian: Ibarahime) is a special all new original episode contained within the fifth volume of Chako Abeno\'s Dantalian no Shoka manga adaptation. For any die hard fans of the original series, this special episode should be a special moment.Though it has been long, Dalian returns as her usual self. From the very beginning, she begins complaining just about...everything. And of course, her stomach speaks for herself just like from the original series. Just give her a candy and she\'ll shut up. Then, there\'s also Huey who returns in his usual role and maintains a calm composure despite Dalian\'s 24/7 complaining.Being known as part of the supernatural mystery genre, this episode brings forth some mystery. Surprised? You might be. That\'s because most OVA or special episodes these days are often one of those beach, onsen, summer festival cliches. Yet, Dantalian sticks with its style of mystery and doesn\'t fall into the cliches. That\'s just one of the little gadgets that makes this special episode unique in its way.However, let\'s remember that the original series wasn\'t exactly a hit smash, or at least in my opinion. It lacked smoothness and tries to characterize its characters too much. Needless to say, the characters\' personalities does not balance although they sure bring out entertainment by just watching Dalian and Huey battle it out and about verbally using non magical words. But drop the arguments in this episode because a new character brings forth some trouble for the duo. Working together, the duo once again delivers just deserts.As for the animation, it\'s just alright. Gainax once again is in charge here but nothing much has changed. The episode retains its 1950s feeling of the old English Ages that brings out some realism. The Victorian like dress that Dalian wears retains its original design while Huey still wears his signature hat (see the promo poster if you don\'t believe me).The music/soundtrack doesn\'t change much either in this episode. It still has the usual choir music tone and the English style soundtrack. It retains its classical style and I do have to admit, it brings back some nostologia of the old school music. It is definitely well choreographed with the ED song being once again a smash hit in the strangeness department.Overall, Dantalian no Shoka: Ibarahime is one of those episodes that gives the fans a heads up that the original series is still something to treasure like words in a book, the words written from our memories, or the words delivered by our feelings. However, it once again lacks story or characterization just like the original series. The art is also nothing special to take notice of despite its subjective realism. On the other hand, the soundtrack is quite pleasing to the ears that is appealing and gives off the audio tone which reflects the classical style of the English Ages. It\'s difficult to say if this is enjoyable for me or not as it lacks originality (aka the Gosick clone theory). However, it brings back some nostologia and I\'ll leave it at that. Whether you\'ll like the episode or not is up to you to decide. Maybe, you can write your thoughts and record them in a book, come back later, and then think about it. Archives of Dantalian: Ibarahime) is a special all new original episode contained within the fifth volume of Chako Abeno\'s Dantalian no Shoka manga adaptation. For any die hard fans of the original series, this special episode should be a special moment.Though it has been long, Dalian returns as her usual self. From the very beginning, she begins complaining just about...everything. And of course, her stomach speaks for herself just like from the original series. Just give her a candy and she\'ll shut up. Then, there\'s also Huey who returns in his usual role and maintains a calm composure despite Dalian\'s 24/7 complaining.Being known as part of the supernatural mystery genre, this episode brings forth some mystery. Surprised? You might be. That\'s because most OVA or special episodes these days are often one of those beach, onsen, summer festival cliches. Yet, Dantalian sticks with its style of mystery and doesn\'t fall into the cliches. That\'s just one of the little gadgets that makes this special episode unique in its way.However, let\'s remember that the original series wasn\'t exactly a hit smash, or at least in my opinion. It lacked smoothness and tries to characterize its characters too much.

Doraemon Movie 11: Nobita to Animal Planet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2677/Doraemon_Movie_11__Nobita_to_Animal_Planet,"[""Doraemon is an anime that always puts a smile on my face & I always enjoy watching it as many times as possible. This movie is also one of  those great movies of doraemon that has an underlying social message in it that gives you life lessons while you enjoy your time. The story is great & it has a message about what will happen if we don't use our resources properly & keep taking our planet towards it's destruction. For some people the art is a bit old but it isn't much of a problem. The characters were great & memorable and were...really fun to watch. It had a great ending & I really enjoyed my time watching it.#happy_watching really fun to watch. It had a great ending & I really enjoyed my time watching it.#happy_watching"", 'My overall take: An alright 90s environmentalist movie, but doesn\'t present much new for the genre or the franchise.In this movie, Nobita sleepwalks to another planet, where he and his friends meet a civilization of anthropomorphic animals. I always came away from this one with the feeling that it doesn\'t do a whole lot with the concept of an animal civilization. Instead, the animal planet mostly serves as set-dressing for a 90s environmentalist story. (""Look, their society runs entirely on renewable energy and synthesizes food from sunlight and air and releases no waste into their environment!"")And it\'s a very 90s environmentalist story: the peaceful animals...living in harmony with their environment are threatened by mysterious aliens, who turn out to be humans whose ancestors had already devastated the natural resources on their own planet (not Earth). Not to worry though, because the ending reveals that there are also good humans from that planet who oppose the aspiring conquerors and are working to restore their home!The main characters do enough to justify their presence in the narrative, but none of them receive much characterization except maybe Gian, who gets to showcase a more vulnerable side of himself that isn\'t seen often. However, even that doesn\'t end up affecting the plot substantially.Ultimately, I think this movie is okay for what it is. It has little in the way of what I\'d consider to be actual flaws, but at the same time, I feel like it doesn\'t bring much new to the table. living in harmony with their environment are threatened by mysterious aliens, who turn out to be humans whose ancestors had already devastated the natural resources on their own planet (not Earth).

I'm writing this view mainly on the assumption you are a fan of either Rave or Fairy Tail.*Fairy Tail x Rave takes place sometime after the Oración Seis arc in Fairy Tail and the Blue Guardians arc in Rave Master.*If you've watched the Fairy Tail x Rave trailer then this should be spoiler free.Story- As this is a crossover don't expect much story. The way the chain of events played out was decent but its not really the focus of this OVA anyway. Both Dark Bring...and Magic are referenced throughout the show.Art- No different than the usual Fairy Tail animation. There wasn't enough time to cover lots of moves typical of both Fairy Tail & Rave but what was there was done well. I especially enjoyed the animation on Haru's abilities.Sound- The scores and VAs from both the Fairy Tail and Rave return and mix really well. There is an emphasis on FT's soundtrack but scores from Rave still do appear and are paced very well. I've always thought FTs sound track was excellent and FTxRave is no exception.Characters- Even though it's not in a logical setting its an enjoyable experience to see some of my favorite characters mix together. With it being 25 minutes long there isn't enough time to cover each character thoroughly but regardless what is there is enjoyable. Nastu/Haru, Gray/Musica and Lucy/Ellie to an extent share characteristics so naturally mix together well. For Let, Julia and Wendy they all share Dragon-like abilities and its nice to see the brief companionship between them.Enjoyment- Being a fan of both Rave and Fairy Tail I really enjoyed this.

As a Mashima fan, this OVA has gotten me quite excited, although I watched it late due to my busy schedule. OTLNow, let\'s start with my review. (I\'m sorry if my writing is lame orz)FT x Rave is a crossover OVA of two of Hiro Mashima\'s popular works, Fairy Tail and Groove Adventure Rave, both having quite different plots, but quite similar characters, both in looks and personalities.STORY (7) - The story is pretty bland and rather too typical. I\'ve seen it too much in Fairy Tail, its getting rather boring. But since its only an OVA to reintroduce the characters...of  Mashima\'s previous work, I guess it\'s not really much of a big deal. Although it would have been better if it had a memorable plot.ART (10) - The art is GREAT. I think the animation got a lot better here in this OVA than in Fairy Tail, and hopefully they\'ll continue it on FT\'s second season, \'cause I swear, it would be a LOT more fun to watch. AND, let\'s appreciate how HOT Haru is in Mashima\'s improved art style. X3 (and ofc the other Rave charas too XD)SOUND (8) - Music was ok, they used the same OP and ED from the previous FT OVA, which was again, an ok. (Apparently I am no good at critiquing anime osts sorry orz)Character (8) - Characters, oh the characters. Well let\'s not expect much from the Fairy Tail characters. They\'re all the same as usually with their funny personalities. Natsu, being his wild and hotheaded self, Gray, stripping, Lucy and her loud mouth, Erza beating everyone up, Wendy and Charle being cute, Juvia fangirling as always and Happy being, well Happy.The Rave characters didn\'t change much either. (but I\'m not sure \'cause my memory\'s foggy-) Ellie\'s still an airhead, Musica\'s still an egoistic hottie, and the other characters I actually kinda forgot how they acted orz. Haru was a little bit different from what I remember though. I think he was more carefree and less mature? (But I\'m not sure, please correct me if I\'m wrong. OH AND HE ALSO BECAME HOTTER /shot)Enjoyment (8) - Well, the OVA didn\'t disappoint me despite how lame the plot was. The comedy kind of paid it off anyway, plus ofc the Rave characters presence and their interaction with the Fairy Tail characters gave me the feel of excitement. The only thing I didn\'t enjoy was (as always) the pointless fanservice. Well I should be getting used to this because of FT but apparently I haven\'t. I mean seriously, ""Disappearing Panty Bonus""??? Really pointless.Overall (7) - Well I certainly enjoyed watching this, it\'s something nice to watch when you\'re bored and just need a good laugh. If you\'re not a fan of FT or Rave, I recommend you watch this if you\'re really bored or have nothing else to do, but to the fans, I\'m sure you\'ll love this, ESP Rave fangirls, \'cause I swear, HARU IS SO HOT HERE.

You shouldn't take this episode too seriously because it doesn't take itself as such. It's basically a gag where characters of Fairy Tail and characters of Rave run into each other and somehow end-up fighting each other, only to be attacked by a common (ridiculous) enemy and having to cooperate. Pure stupidity but it actually makes it fun if you take it as such.One remark though - While this episode seems to take place somewhere during the second season of Fairy Tail, it takes place a lot after the events of Rave. If you've...watched Rave you may know that the anime does not conclude the series and that the manga continues much further and the episode takes place after those events as well. While it doesn't affect the episode's plot too much (it hardly has any anyway) there are some characters that you won't recognize unless you've read the Rave manga. watched Rave you may know that the anime does not conclude the series and that the manga continues much further and the episode takes place after those events as well.

For that alone I almost want to give it a bad grade, I really didn't enjoy that show. Rave was like a proto-Fairy Tail with a lot of the same character archetypes and plot points and the same generic fantasy setting. Having the two coexist now in the same universe felt weirdly natural and unnatural yet the same time. I guess if you've just been a long time fan of Mashima and his work you might get a kick out of this, but as established I was not and had to do my...homework just to understand what was going on.Here's to the inevitable Fairy Tail x Edens Zero special sometime down the road. 7/10 homework just to understand what was going on.Here's to the inevitable Fairy Tail x Edens Zero special sometime down the road. 7/10"", ""Now almost 20 years since I first saw Rave, still stunning.

Aku no Hana,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16201/Aku_no_Hana,"['DISCLAIMER: FOR THE SAKE OF THIS REVIEW I WILL BE OPERATING UNDER THE ASSUMTION THAT THERE IS AN UPCOMING SECOND SEASON. The anime said there would be a part two and I’ll trust that for now. If there is no season two then I\'d have problems with the conclusion and the score would have to be lowered. But the anime created interest in the manga, they haven\'t exhausted the budget, they previewed pt. 2 scenes that they\'ve supposedly finished, some of the most powerful scenes have yet to come, etc. At this point, it seems very safe to assume there will be a second season...even if the anime sales haven\'t been great.Ah, adaptions. The bane of all manga readers. Understandably, this is simultaneously claimed to be one of the best and worst anime adaptions there is. It has attracted much criticism and ridicule due to the huge change in character design, but this change was actually approved by the mangaka and I would tend to agree with him that it was good stylistic choice.For some reason, fans think all anime characters, besides the comic relief ones, must be attractive. They can’t take ugly characters seriously or treat them like humans, but they have no problem falling in love with cute bug-eyed alien creatures. That’s superficial to a disgusting degree.The characters are often ugly, but why does that matter? Do you hate all movies with unattractive actors? Not all actresses look like supermodels, nor do the vast majority of women, so why should all anime characters be beautiful? I actually didn\'t like how, in the manga, Nakamura was meant to be ugly or plain, but the mangaka drew her attractive. It\'s like the manga version of ""Hollywood Homely.""  When I read the manga, I was kind of annoyed that something like that tried to evoke a masterpiece like ""Les Fleurs Du Mals."" In the anime, I wasn\'t offended by the reference, and it heightened my appreciation instead.Aku no Hana is a work about descent into decadence, libertinism, and the meaning of freedom; mental and physical. Should the characters really be moe? Is it really important that their eyes cover half of their face? This adaption took advantage of all of the manga\'s squandered potential. This is exactly what a good adaption does, rather than following in every folly of its predecessor.One thing that should be noted about the realistic nature of the character’s faces is sometimes they look better than others. Like a real person, some of the screenshots will make a character look ugly and some will make a character look normal, although normal is ugly by anime standards. The point is that you shouldn’t assume all the characters are ugly based on a couple unflattering screenshots. They’re not poorly designed, they’re real.I love the collision between realism and minimalism in the character designs, additionally contrasting with the fact that the city is one of the most realistic I\'ve seen in anime; kind of emphasizing the insignificance of humanity more subtly than the manga ever did. It should be noted that the fact that the city seems to be ""decaying"" or in poor shape is a reference to a major theme of Les Fleurs du Mal. This animation captures the atmosphere really well and if it was done differently it would have flopped thematically. It had an interesting and creative artistic direction that had a clear purpose to it.There is much of symbolism and depth to the art, just as there is in the general plot, and it is arguably the best aspect of the show. The animation seemed a bit choppy at times, but the art was generally flawless.The atmosphere created by the art was enhanced by the incredible OST. The first OP perfectly captured Kasuga’s character, the second OP Nakamura’s, the third Saeki’s, and the fourth was like a victory lap that captured the very essence of the anime. The BGM complimented and accented the atmosphere perfectly while the ED always kicked in with genius timing, changing subtly as the series progresses, culminating in it playing for half of the finale and a new ED coming on at the end. The ED is one of the creepiest things I’ve ever heard. All in all I’d say this is the one of the best and most fitting anime OSTs out there. It certainly has to be the only OST I’ve heard that’s influenced the atmosphere of a series and my opinion of it to this extent.The plot seems a bit generic in the description, but unlike similarly premised titles, it is not a hentai or a comedy and it plays out very differently. The show is more about presentation than plot, but the plot is still engaging, unpredictable, and unique.The characters were among the stronger points. Kasuga’s development was the entire point of the show (it appears to be a bildungsroman) and it was very well done. Under the guidance of Nakamura (a great character in her own right) we see him go from a mindless puppet who can only spout out the thoughts of others, but longs to be unique, to a free individual. At first he can only express himself in Baudelaire poems, poems he clearly doesn’t really understand, but looks down on others for not getting although he doesn’t really want anyone else to read them either. This whole concept infuriates Nakamura and she tries to “break down his walls.” Later, even in the classroom scene, he’s just writing what Nakamura says. It isn’t until he faces the prospect of losing her that he really manages to form a thought of his own, in an incredible scene and finale episode.Nakamura helps him, and seems to treat him like dirt, but she also needs him. Her character is very interesting and the changes to how the audience views her over time were well done. Saeki is a foil to her character and there are many parallels and contrasts between them, both subtle and overt. She wants to understand Kasuga, but she can’t. She would accept him no matter how he is. Some of her character developments towards the end and alluded to in the preview/flash-forward were very unexpected and her character is as complex as any. All of the side characters are also interesting and serve their purpose well.Enjoyment would be the hardest category to score. I enjoyed it more like I would enjoy a horror movie than a thriller, romance, or comedy. My eyes were not glued to the screen and sometimes it was hard to watch. I couldn\'t take it in more than one episode at a time, which is a testament to how powerful the atmosphere is. The whole thing was slow paced and tense and chock-full of second-hand embarrassment and humiliation. You really feel for the characters, and as they are dejected for most of the anime, you will be too.This anime is arguably the best of its season and the best in years, but I wouldn’t recommend it to most people. If you appreciate the decadent literary movement, if you thought the manga could be better, if you aren’t bothered by unattractive characters, if you’re looking for something different or more realistic, or if you are just open minded then this anime is for you. even if the anime sales haven\'t been great.Ah, adaptions.

It seems as though Aku no Hana was meant to be something that was going to be the “change” some people were looking for in the wake of entertainment controlling the masses. But boy, did it fail at doing that on almost all accounts.Let's reveal the elephant in the room, the animation. It is flawed, but not to the extent where it should be castrated...out of someone’s psyche after viewing the first episode. For starters, the animation that the studio decided to use is called rotoscoping, a style of animation where people are filmed in live action and animators draw over the film frame-by-frame. Considering that this is the first anime show to do this animation style, how is the quality of the rotoscoping? Not too well, that’s for sure. The lip-syncing is atrocious, and the facial expressions are devoid of any character. They don’t fit well with the emotions that the characters are trying to convey, and given how low the budget was, the animation isn’t very fluid in most places. Though these flaws are mentioned, the show isn’t necessarily unwatchable due to the average animation, so it gets a slight pass in this department.With this in mind, however, the art design of the background in the show’s setting is truly spectacular. The grime and rust from the buildings and the dark tone of the outside world succeed in enveloping this dark, depressing story. It fits with the style Aku no Hana is trying to capture, and its effectiveness is relatively good. Another thing that also improves Aku no Hana’s mood is the music. Its subtle ambient and minimalist influenced sound is one of the most beautifully crafted scores that I’ve enjoyed listening to.On a technical level, the show is mixed with good music and art but average animation, but how does it compare to the narrative and writing? Not too well, that’s for sure. For one, the characters and how they are written are not well developed or fully realized with anything happening with the plot. To address this even further, the relationships between the protagonist Kasuga and our two main heroines, Nakamura and Saeki, are as well put together as one could get from a high schooler’s attempt at writing a story as this, a bad one at that. What makes these characters so bad in terms of a writing perspective is how poorly paced it gives us a clear indication that Kasuga has a bond with either Nakamura or Saeki. With Kasuga and Nakamura, there is no chemistry. They play off as a couple of degenerates who spout out vapid angsty monologues towards one another whenever they are on screen.Kasuga himself is not an enticing protagonist to be on-screen. Just because you make him this Holden Caulfield type of character where he is obsessed with a dark poetry book doesn’t make him have any more depth than any other character in the show. Are we to sympathize with him just because he acts pessimistic about the world around him with his pseudo-intellectual jargon? Not if it’s done with careful precision in Kasuga’s archetype, which is not the case in Aku no Hana.Nakamura and Saeki are two other characters who are unfortunately not spared in mediocre character writing. The romantic development between Kasuga and Saeki was rushed to the point where we only see very few inclinations that they are a couple. We get two awkward dates and a moment where she invites him into his room. Not only that but Saeki’s reasons for liking Kasuga are not at all convincing to the slightest degree. With all of the things Kasuga did or forced, in this case, to Saeki’s property, any ordinary girl would quickly never speak to him again. Still, just because the writers want to keep the story going, they’ll have to hope that anyone with half a brain would buy into this—no explanation for Saeki’s reasoning for liking Kasuga.Then there’s Nakamura, Kasuga’s “sidekick” in the show. As you might predict, she is about as explained throughout the show as any other character. This is, of course, the intention because Nakamura is something that we should be wary and suspicious about whether she’s evil or not. Once she forms a contract with Kasuga, the only thing we get out of Nakamura is that she is nothing more than the show’s attempt at pouring empty melodrama into the mix to make the plot seem too deep than what it already is. Her primary goal to the plot’s theme is never given any deep context other than the fact that she thinks the whole world is bullshit and should be destroyed. If you want to provide me with an existential angst plot device, try to deliver a better explanation than just a one-dimensional written one. The character can be portrayed in a reasonably sympathetic light. Unfortunately, Nakamura just doesn’t cut out to be a deep convincing anti-hero with how poor the writing is.While the show's tone is solid, the atmosphere tries too hard to be frightening to the point where it almost does the opposite effect of what it was initially trying to impose. Whenever there is a faint rumbling noise in the background that’s supposed to resemble a heartbeat, that is hardly effective in establishing a mood, or whenever the music starts to grow in its dynamics with a dark droning noise that is unsettling in a wrong way. What’s funny is that some of the build-ups in some of the scenes are unnecessary and fail to capture any fear. Once you do it multiple times throughout the show, it loses its momentum quickly, and all you are left with is just an empty white noise in the background.It’s not often I talk about the actual “acting” rather than the voice acting in this show. While good in a few areas, the acting is often overly dramatized and doesn’t reach that greatness of any drama TV show you could be watching right now. Actors constantly spout out their lines and try to carry out as much emotion as possible in scenes that don’t seem as though it was needed in the first place, such as one that involves a bathroom area.The numerous plot holes drag down the plot from making it convincing to anyone watching. Usually, plot holes can be forgiven if they are tiny to where they are not noticeable to ruin the show's flow. With Aku no Hana, many coincidences can easily be accounted for lazy writing, such as no one noticing the blackboard writing being blocked out the day after the vandalism scene. Anyone could have easily deciphered what the saying was in two seconds flat.In the short scheme of things, Aku no Hana is just a failed experiment that probably never should have been fully realized given its source material. In all honesty, the original manga’s story is quite fascinating. If only they had hired more competent writers to fill in the wide gap that crippled Aku no Hana’s chances of becoming an intriguing psychological drama. It wouldn’t be a shock to call this a “wasted opportunity” given how the creators were ballsy in making it with the rotoscope technique; it just goes to show when you want to do something “different,” you might want to focus more on your writing structure than your artistic integrity.Grade: D+ out of someone’s psyche after viewing the first episode.

I thoroughly enjoyed this series for many reasons. First I\'ll address the elephant in the room that got this series so much hate: the art style. At first I couldn\'t stand the art style myself. I thought it was going to ruin the series the minute I saw it, but to my own surprise I was completely wrong. After getting into the story, I felt the art style fir the show perfectly. By not having cartoon-looking characters, it made the show much more believable that these...characters could possibly exist, which only makes the show even more troubling.Next thing I want to address is the story. Right after the first episode, this show had me hooked. I found myself eager to watch the next episode right after the last. Even though it is not categorized as one, the first few episodes disturbed me more than any ""horror"" anime ever has. And don\'t even get me started on the creepy music when the end credits roll. Throughout the story, we see a boy who tries to be different from everyone else because he feels like he does not fit in anywhere. This made me feel like I was going to be faced with a boring protagonist and little to no character development. Once again, I was wrong. After Kasuga spends so much time with Nakamura, we get that hint that these two may slowly be falling for each other. I enjoy how the mood of the show changes along with the opening credits music throughout the series. At first, everything seems very troubling and eventually changes into a story of a boy who is trying to find himself. Because of Nakamura, he questions everything he has ever known, and even later admits he has been lying to himself for his entire life. Because of one girl, Kasuga\'s entire perception on life is changed and that is what I found so appealing about the story. I must admit, the last episode did kind of disappoint me and I\'m really hoping for a part two. One of the only problems I had with this series was some of the dragging scenes. No, I do not want to watch a five-minute animation of Kasuga walking through the streets accompanied by sad music. Besides these minor problems, I really enjoyed this series and recommend to anyone who likes psychological anime. characters could possibly exist, which only makes the show even more troubling.Next thing I want to address is the story.

Which one of the two sides arguing against each other is right?Story: The story of Aku no Hana takes place in Japan and revolves around Kasuga Takao, a quite normal boy, who goes to school, loves books (especially Baudelaire\'s ""Aku no Hana"") and has a crush on what is supposed to be the beauty of the class. One day he finds her sport clothes as he wants to get the book...he accidentally forgot in the classroom. He takes them out and hears a sound. In the hurry he just takes them and leaves quickly. Later on the psycho child of the class, being Nakamura Sawa tells him she saw him stealing the clothes. From then on she makes him do things that...well are kind of awkward. The whole story is really well executed and as far as I know follows the Manga quite well (didn\'t read it). It is really enjoyable to watch and it keeps unfolding in directions that the viewer doesn\'t expect to go to. It was a good story, but no masterpiece! 8/10Characters: The characters are the shining point of the show. Even though the only ones that get any focus at all are the three main characters that everything revolves around, they are that good developed that that is no problem at all! Kasuga Takao seems to be one of the most normal students we\'ve seen in a while in Anime. He likes books, has a crush on a girl and doesn\'t have any powers or things he is really good in. That is until he gets seen by Nakamura stealing the clothes and his life gets more and more messed up, just as his mind. Nakamura Sawa is a psycho. That\'s what everyone agrees upon. But it is a kind of psycho, that seems more pleasant than the ""I\'ll kill you all"" type, and rather is someone that is claims himself to be a deviant and searches for people that are the same as she is. Saeki Nanako is the girl Kasuga has a crush on. She is a kind and good looking girl. I am not gonna talk a lot about her since I\'d just end up spoiling. One must be said: The characters aren\'t likable at all! It is hard to really like them, but that is the point the series wants you to be in. It\'s a point were you can look down on the show from a spot a lot higher, which makes every single character a lot more human and makes their built up incredibly well done. 10/10Art: Well....the first thing that comes to your mind while watching Aku no Hana is the character design, which looks to say it in a polite way different. It is not a bad thing to make them look this way, since it is just another point that makes you feel more distant to the characters. The point were the art fails is the animation itself. The characters suffer from either to much movement at the same time and you just can\'t seem to concentrate because the characters look as if they would tremble without a reason or they don\'t move at all. The amount of still screens in this show is incredibly high and makes the show feel as if it was something based on an incredibly low budget, which it probably is. Later on the Animation gets a lot better but still not good enough to make up for what they did within the first episodes, which makes the enjoyment go down by far and the hate level rise in the same way. 4/10Sound: The Soundtrack of Aku no Hana is incredibly simple. It mostly consists of tones getting louder and louder which creates a suspense that really fits the show as something dark and awkward. Aku no Hana has one of the most memorable endings ever created. A song only sung by a computer voice singing about the flowers of evil definitely is really creepy and fits the whole show really well. Just as the 4 Openings do. Every single one of them is weird in it\'s own way but still it fits the show so well that by now I really enjoy hearing them on their own. The voice acting is nothing that really stands out. While it definitely is not horrible, it is nothing I do love. 8/10Enjoyment: I have no idea how to score this...honestly! This show is nothing you will enjoy! However it is something that makes you want to shut down your browser and never open it again. At parts I couldn\'t watch an episode in a single sitting, but had to constantly pause it to calm down a bit, since my nerves were blank, but this is what makes this show so good! 9/10Aku no Hana is not a show everyone will enjoy, that is for sure. It is hard to watch and if you aren\'t into thrillers or that kind of stuff you really should stay away from this, but if you like them or if it even interests you a little, go watch this and make your own picture of it. he accidentally forgot in the classroom. He takes them out and hears a sound. In the hurry he just takes them and leaves quickly. Later on the psycho child of the class, being Nakamura Sawa tells him she saw him stealing the clothes. From then on she makes him do things that...well are kind of awkward. The whole story is really well executed and as far as I know follows the Manga quite well (didn\'t read it). It is really enjoyable to watch and it keeps unfolding in directions that the viewer doesn\'t expect to go to. It was a good story, but no masterpiece! 8/10Characters: The characters are the shining point of the show. Even though the only ones that get any focus at all are the three main characters that everything revolves around, they are that good developed that that is no problem at all! Kasuga Takao seems to be one of the most normal students we\'ve seen in a while in Anime. He likes books, has a crush on a girl and doesn\'t have any powers or things he is really good in. That is until he gets seen by Nakamura stealing the clothes and his life gets more and more messed up, just as his mind. Nakamura Sawa is a psycho. That\'s what everyone agrees upon. But it is a kind of psycho, that seems more pleasant than the ""I\'ll kill you all"" type, and rather is someone that is claims himself to be a deviant and searches for people that are the same as she is. Saeki Nanako is the girl Kasuga has a crush on. She is a kind and good looking girl. I am not gonna talk a lot about her since I\'d just end up spoiling. One must be said: The characters aren\'t likable at all! It is hard to really like them, but that is the point the series wants you to be in. It\'s a point were you can look down on the show from a spot a lot higher, which makes every single character a lot more human and makes their built up incredibly well done. 10/10Art: Well....the first thing that comes to your mind while watching Aku no Hana is the character design, which looks to say it in a polite way different. It is not a bad thing to make them look this way, since it is just another point that makes you feel more distant to the characters. The point were the art fails is the animation itself. The characters suffer from either to much movement at the same time and you just can\'t seem to concentrate because the characters look as if they would tremble without a reason or they don\'t move at all. The amount of still screens in this show is incredibly high and makes the show feel as if it was something based on an incredibly low budget, which it probably is. Later on the Animation gets a lot better but still not good enough to make up for what they did within the first episodes, which makes the enjoyment go down by far and the hate level rise in the same way. 4/10Sound: The Soundtrack of Aku no Hana is incredibly simple.

It is the single most disturbing piece of fiction I have ever been witness to, and rightly deserves to be named a psychological horror.But this is not an easy anime to watch, as  it is broken and incoherent at times. What you can expect is a lot of cringe worthy moments which build an incredible tension that borders on fetishism. The protagonist is placed in a position of utter despair contrasted with sheer bliss. He goes from one to the other at a moments notice, further adding to the tension we are witness to.Animation:...10The drawing and animation style is difficult to adapt to at first. However, it is perhaps the primary reason to watch this incredible anime. The simple lines and faded colors are inherent to the surrealist style which this anime pays homage to.

It is the only animation style fitting for this great work, and should not deter viewers from watching it.Story: 9The story is difficult to follow at times, and may seem stagnant at others.

The story manages to do what it was intended for beautifully.Characters: 10The characters have incredible depth. Each character is crafted as a riddle which refuses to be solved.

Few animes can claim to fully explore the psychological depth of their characters.Enjoyment:0This is an incredible anime, but it is truly painful to watch. I wanted to rip my hair out, tear at my skin and gouge my own eyes out. The anime has such a profound affect on the viewer that they cannot but help constantly feeling uneasy.

If at any point it lets up, that is merely to betray you moments later with a feeling that is much much worse.TLDR; Don't watch it if you can't appreciate a masterpiece.

It shows in a realistic scenario how a simple, impulsive action can bring one in a very ugly situation. There is an atmosphere of despair and hopelessness throughout the whole anime and you can basically feel the emotions of the characters.ART-Well, the Art. What to say about it. It definitely is unusual. I wouldn't say that...it's bad, but I'm sure it's not everyone's taste. There are not many typical anime characteristics and it is, like the plot, very realistic.

Nakamura constantly screams these words, or some variation of it. To whom, you ask? Mostly to Kasuga, the ever spineless and submissive male protagonist in the midst of budding puberty. To the audience as well, who judged and silently watched Nakamura wither away in a boring, stagnant town, in which she chooses to embrace all that is depraved and immoral. Twisted, perverted, unnatural, yet oddly beautiful. Loathed by all who know her; loved by those who think they understand her. These are feelings towards Nakamura, or maybe befitting of the anime itself. It\'s awkward. It\'s dark....Frustrating and cringe-worthy at times. But more than anything, there is beauty beneath the decayed surface. This is Aku no Hana, a dark and perverse take on the classic adolescence story.Aku no Hana is the end product of artistic vision seldom experienced in the medium of anime. A masterpiece, some will say. Still others, a laughable, steaming pile of excrement. The verdict? Straddling the lines of masterclass and tragically missed opportunity. Aku no Hana is a veritable master of atmosphere. A King among kings. The haunting and minimalistic music, the morbidly gray yet excruciatingly detailed art, the omnipresent feeling of dread and perversion. An orgasm of the eyes and ears that can leave you limp, wheezing and gasping for air and salvation. Aku no Hana lies submersing and drowning in its own pool of narcissism and sheer artistic ambition and vision. What beauty.Rotoscoping: the animation style of Aku no Hana. It\'s a daring and ambitious adaptation of an otherwise plain and forgettable looking drawn manga of the same name and story. It expresses in animation what mere pen and paper can only dream of, yet the very source of this series\'s extreme scrutiny. An animation style that few know of and even less appreciate, relegated to the knowledge banks of basement dwelling movie nerds and hipsters. It defies all the clichés and identifiable traits Japanese animation has come to represent. No big eyes. No panty shots. No flashing lights. It\'s anime only in the sense that was made in Japan. Love, or hate. No middle ground. I first struggled with the rotoscope. I reject this, I told myself. This was not what I expected, my second thought. Then came acceptance. Then appreciation. And now? A bold choice by the director to visualize the heart and soul that Aku no Hana as a narrative seeks to tell. And what is that narrative? Watch it. Bask in its insufferable ego and glory.Aku no Hana\'s inconsistencies?  It\'s a daring vision that, within the confines of a 13 episode series, struggles to strike an effective balance with the atmosphere, story pacing, and character progression.  Begrudgingly, it drowns in the very narcissistic pool that birthed it. Story progression and pacing suffers considerably. Arguably, its slow progression is an aspect of the entire artistic package, but a sometimes unnecessary burden. The art? Background art aside, the character line art would fade as distance increased. Missing anatomy. It\'s hard to distinguish whether the art is sublime and infused with meaning, a flaw of rotoscope, or a result of rushed deadlines. One other point of contention is the ending. It cuts off and ends prematurely with clips and visions of what could come. Is this a sign of a second season? Who knows. I see the ending as an artistic device. Like a clairvoyant seeing the future but the prophecy of it not yet realized in reality. The prophecy of what\'s to come is more powerful than the actual occurrence of those events, to continue the logic. Or, perhaps equally so, a selfish art project not given enough time, money, and resources.I will say this much. The music, art style, pacing, symbolism, all of it is deliberate. All of this is meant to coalesce with the holistic message that Aku no Hana visually and aurally represents: the darkness and perverse depravity that society shuns and refuses to embrace in the light of day. Metamorphism. A state of pure craft that pen, paper, and manga panels could only ever dream of expressing. Driving hipsters wet with rabid, throbbing excitement, thirsty for the torrent of juicy ecstasy and lustful desire. Kasuga\'s dark and twisted story of adolescence, of budding sexual tension, and of crossing the boundaries of morality, is not one from the bottle. It is the special one. Standing tall with arrogance among the anonymous pile of Japanese anime of years past, present, and future. Art, for art\'s sake. Yet in the shadow of its many highlights, enough maddening errors of omission (continuing the story) and seeming art and production problems gnaw away and detract from the experience. It has the atmospheric ambition rivaling any Coppola movie. The execution has enough pitfalls that mimics the fumbling of an awkward teenager. If it had ended in the right place, this production would be among the greatest works of sublime and vainglorious art to have ever come from Japan. It came up short and wanting. A masterpiece, a disaster and dirty stain among anime, or or just one hell of a wild sojourn. Your mileage may vary. Some parting words: just watch it. Seriously. And if you\'re still meandering, try it out—for Nakamura\'s sake. If not, you may very well be one: a shithead.

What most people don\'t realize is how difficult it is to interpret a manga into an anime and still stay true to the story.  Scenery in a manga doesn\'t translate very well into anime and most readers of manga could care less about how long it takes them to read a chapter.Aku no Hana has received a lot of mixed ratings due to its slow pace and long annoying scenery shots.  Most people comment about the rotoscoped animation or the fact that the characters don\'t have big...eyes and colorful hair.  I think most people have a hard time watching this anime because it highlights just how much boredom effects our daily lives.  Humans tend to mentally dwell on pointless things simply because we have nothing else with which to occupy our minds.  Maybe this anime is a very good portrayal of what many people suffer with on a day to day basis.  After reading the manga and then watching the anime, I am content to accept the theory that the director wanted as little glamour or fan service as possible in order to stay true to the story.Many reviews wrongly comment on how deeply disturbing this anime is.  It isn\'t, not really.  I\'m going to go out on a limb here and consider that most of the people who use this site have never had the ardent pressure of conforming to society the way Japanese teenagers do.  Sure, we have our morals and the golden rule, but a few documentaries and some research about Japan should really shed some light on how mentally draining it can be to suppress your individualism at an early age.  So why do many consider it to be something so psychologically deep when many of us enjoy our free spirit and unique behavior?  The best way to hide something is in plain sight, where everyone sees it so much that they grow tired of it and just excuse the thing as a regular occurrence.Maybe you have personally shelved something in your life or kept it under wraps for fear of what others might think or say about you.  Continuously throughout the anime there are classmates teasing Kasuga for being shy or reclusive.  They tease him even though he goes to so many lengths to conceal his inner thoughts.  Those who have read ""Ningen Shikkaku"" will notice that there are similarities in behavior for the young version of the protagonist in the novel and Kasuga.  Where the protagonist in Ningen Shikkaku tends to be a class clown in order to disguise the empty feeling inside him, Kasuga tends to go with the flow and agree passively with everyone.  I brought up Ningen Shikkaku simply because it is mentioned (or rather read in class) in the manga; so obviously the mangaka was influenced by this book.The anime does a decent job of revealing the human component which the manga leaves to imagination.  So, if you are looking for an anime with moe characters or special powers in a fantasy land, this is not the work of fiction for you.  However, if you want to experience something that might be floating on the surface of your own conscience, this might be a story to which you can relate. eyes and colorful hair.

I might as well address this issue before remarking on other aspects of the anime. Rotoscoping\'s been a controversial style of animation for years. While the style allows for one to animate more lifelike characters and movements, there are acclaimed animators that don\'t consider it a legitimate form of animation since live-action shots are animated over in order to accomplish the style and such animators think it kills creativity in...the medium. Personally, I think rotoscoping made for an excellent fit for Aku no Hana considering the mundane story it depicts with Kasuga\'s ordeals with Nakamura and Saeki. The style helps to better depict the dull routines of everyday life seen through Kasuga\'s eyes and allows the viewer to become immersed in the experience with him. The style also helps enhance a number of the title\'s uncomfortable moments with Kasuga and Nakamura\'s interactions. Going for a more conventional style of animation would have killed much of the effect this series would have to immerse the viewer in its story.Backgrounds are depicted to be photo-realistic with realistic details and color that are quite pleasing on the eyes. Character designs are just as realistic with believable facial details on characters that make them actually look Japanese instead of the typical doe-eyed, rainbow-color hair designs of conventional Japanese animated titles. The designs are a bit rough in early episodes, but gradually improve throughout the span of the series. The animation, though, is a bit of a mixed bag. It\'s clear the makers of Aku no Hana are working with a TV budget as there are points where character designs are rendered still in movement, particularly during classroom scenes. However in major moments of the series involving Kasuga and the two girls, movement is quite fluid and there aren\'t too many instances of this leading to degradation of quality from the rotoscoped characters.Moving on to the title\'s story, Aku no Hana is prominently focused on Kasuga\'s interactions with Nakamura and Saeki pushing his fragile teen mind to the breaking point. The kid behaves much like any teen would at his age as he tries fitting in with friends, yet is feeling out of place with what society considers ""normal"" as he retreats to reading books. The series is pretty much a psychological drama that gets into Kasuga\'s head as he thinks about his interactions with the two girls, each representing a different world that he considers to be out of his grasp with Nakamura being the deviant outcast and Saeki being the popular girl of the class he has a crush on. The former plays enough of a big role in messing with Kasuga\'s head when she believes him to be a fellow deviant like herself and pushing him to do twisted acts involving Saeki after Kasuga steals her gym clothes in the title\'s second episode. I don\'t come across many recent titles that offer this level of depth in exploring the mental condition of a teenage boy getting ripped apart mentally by two girls his age. Only issue I have with the plot is that it looks like the series lacks a proper ending with the abrupt way it concluded and dropping hints that things would get worst for Kasuga in his present situation, likely teasing viewers for a possible second season.Another major element of this series that was also somewhat controversial was its pacing and atmosphere. Aku no Hana devotes a good amount of time in some episodes to focus on the mood and atmosphere of a scene, mainly during major moments of the show or whenever Kasuga is in thought over whatever predicament he gets caught up in with Saeki or Nakamura. For the most part, the pacing and focus on atmosphere work rather well as they help enhance the discomfort and fear going through Kasuga\'s head as he contemplates things and shows how disconnected he is from ""normal"" people. However, the series usually gets in the bad habit of getting too focused on its atmosphere as it can unnecessarily focus on scenery shots for several minutes at a time at points and cause progression of the anime\'s plot to drag.The music for Aku no Hana does very well at sticking out and flowing with the mood of the series. Its use in the series is minimalist, yet consists of haunting and tense insert tracks that go along well with the uncomfortable and mundane mood prevalent throughout the show\'s run. The OP and ED tracks are just as haunting with twisted lyrics accompanying the title\'s several OP songs meant to convey the mentalities of its main cast throughout Aku no Hana\'s run.Overall, Aku no Hana is quite easily my favorite title of the Spring season for being bold enough to be completely different in how it conveyed its story and overall presentation. Some elements of its approach on presentation have their issues, but they don\'t completely hurt the experience of exploring the complicated and twisted world of adolescence seen through Kasuga\'s eyes. Not to mention that the slow pacing, focus on atmosphere and rotoscoped animation won\'t be for everyone. But if you\'re looking for something that is completely out of the ordinary for an anime series, Aku no Hana would be a definite watch for you. the medium. Personally, I think rotoscoping made for an excellent fit for Aku no Hana considering the mundane story it depicts with Kasuga\'s ordeals with Nakamura and Saeki.

The kid behaves much like any teen would at his age as he tries fitting in with friends, yet is feeling out of place with what society considers ""normal"" as he retreats to reading books. The series is pretty much a psychological drama that gets into Kasuga\'s head as he thinks about his interactions with the two girls, each representing a different world that he considers to be out of his grasp with Nakamura being the deviant outcast and Saeki being the popular girl of the class he has a crush on. The former plays enough of a big role in messing with Kasuga\'s head when she believes him to be a fellow deviant like herself and pushing him to do twisted acts involving Saeki after Kasuga steals her gym clothes in the title\'s second episode. I don\'t come across many recent titles that offer this level of depth in exploring the mental condition of a teenage boy getting ripped apart mentally by two girls his age. Only issue I have with the plot is that it looks like the series lacks a proper ending with the abrupt way it concluded and dropping hints that things would get worst for Kasuga in his present situation, likely teasing viewers for a possible second season.Another major element of this series that was also somewhat controversial was its pacing and atmosphere. Aku no Hana devotes a good amount of time in some episodes to focus on the mood and atmosphere of a scene, mainly during major moments of the show or whenever Kasuga is in thought over whatever predicament he gets caught up in with Saeki or Nakamura. For the most part, the pacing and focus on atmosphere work rather well as they help enhance the discomfort and fear going through Kasuga\'s head as he contemplates things and shows how disconnected he is from ""normal"" people. However, the series usually gets in the bad habit of getting too focused on its atmosphere as it can unnecessarily focus on scenery shots for several minutes at a time at points and cause progression of the anime\'s plot to drag.The music for Aku no Hana does very well at sticking out and flowing with the mood of the series. Its use in the series is minimalist, yet consists of haunting and tense insert tracks that go along well with the uncomfortable and mundane mood prevalent throughout the show\'s run. The OP and ED tracks are just as haunting with twisted lyrics accompanying the title\'s several OP songs meant to convey the mentalities of its main cast throughout Aku no Hana\'s run.Overall, Aku no Hana is quite easily my favorite title of the Spring season for being bold enough to be completely different in how it conveyed its story and overall presentation. Some elements of its approach on presentation have their issues, but they don\'t completely hurt the experience of exploring the complicated and twisted world of adolescence seen through Kasuga\'s eyes. Not to mention that the slow pacing, focus on atmosphere and rotoscoped animation won\'t be for everyone. But if you\'re looking for something that is completely out of the ordinary for an anime series, Aku no Hana would be a definite watch for you.', 'Aku no Hana was originally a manga written by Oshimi Shuzo, named for a collection of poems from the French poet, Charles Baudelaire. The anime adaptation was written by Itami Aki. It\'s a psychological drama, which is a genre I like when handled well. Of course, it\'s usually not. The adaptation was handled by Zexcs. The only anime I\'ve seen that they were involved in have been Mushi-shi and My-Hime. Which is somewhat encouraging, but there were other studios responsible for the major aspects of those anime. So I have no conception as to what a work they\'re primarily working on might be like. I...won\'t lie, it\'s a bit refreshing to go into something with no idea what to expect. Let\'s look at Aku no Hana.We start Aku no Hana with our protagonist, Kasuga, stealing the gym clothes of the girl he likes. Isn\'t it just a treat to have a protagonist lose any likability they could have had the first time they do anything with story relevance? It\'s not the very first thing that happens, but it is the first important thing that happens. This anime loves to waste your time with long, drug out scenes in which nothing is accomplished. Presumably, to try to build atmosphere, but that only works when you actually do something. That\'s one of the biggest problems with the series, very little that happens is relevant. Back to the ""plot,"" and I use the term loosely. Kasuga\'s perverted stalker behaviour is observed by a girl named Nakamura. She agrees to keep it a secret, if Kasuga will make a contract with her. At its core, this is a story about deviance, which fits the title since Baudelaire believed that art and morality had to be kept separate and many of the poems in his collection were considered deviant. Six of them even being banned from publication after their initial release until 1949, almost a century after the initial volume was released. The issue with this theme, as used in this series, is that there are virtually no consequences for the deviant behaviours. The worse thing that happens is that Kasuga gets a talking to. Because this is a magical city where consequence is something that happens to other people. This level of disconnect from reality is an absolutely unforgivable problem in a series that professes to be psychological. Speaking of psychological elements, those are done extraordinarily poorly. Aku no Hana mistakes moving at a ridiculously slow pace, putting in music that\'s supposed to be creepy, and still shots of scenery for psychological depth. Slow pacing, creepy music and still shots could all work in a true psychological piece, but they need something to work off of and Aku no Hana doesn\'t have that integral piece. As such, they\'re just stupid.Moving on to the characters, there are really only three who merit mention since the rest can be described in simple terms like ""Kasuga\'s mom"" or ""that guy with the funny eyebrows"" and don\'t have anything going on beyond a few scenes in which they may or may not do something that\'s supposed to be important. The first is Kasuga. He\'s a whiny little pervert who likes to make excuses for his bad behaviour and has very little depth whatsoever. He reminds me of Shinji Ikari. Then we have Saeki, Shinji\'s... I mean Kasuga\'s crush. At first she seems like the typical ""out of reach"" girl. It\'s only when we spend some time with her character that we realise she\'s actually one of the dumbest characters in all of fiction, in addition to her general lack of personality. She makes DBZ\'s Goku look like a genius. I\'m surprised she managed to reach secondary school without Darwinising herself. Finally, we have Nakamura. Our self-proclaimed deviant and blackmailer. There\'s not much to her except being loud and insulting. She\'s the only character I don\'t hate. Because, if nothing else, she insults everyone I can\'t stand.The animation in this is terrible. Characters frequently lose their facial features because... the artists suck with perspective. The movements are jerky. The mouths don\'t even come close to natural movements during dialogue scenes. A lot of the slow movements and frozen images might be better explained by lazy artists than attempts at atmosphere since these scenes enable them to do minimal amounts of work and they clearly aren\'t doing well in those scenes that require actual animation.There are some good actors in this. Both Hikasa Yoko and Ise Mariya are very skilled. Although you wouldn\'t know it to hear them in this. Since the series has a general problem with characters being either over or under-acted. This is a psychological series. There\'s no room for subtlety of emotion here... Wait, what? the creepy music gets tiresome. It could have worked if they\'d used it only when relevant instead of using it constantly. They even us it when it\'s just a shot of people walking.The yuri factor is a 1/10. Expect no yuri.Aku no Hana fails to deliver any actual psychological elements, resorting instead to one and two-dimensional characters who are sure to annoy you. The series both looks and sounds bad and very little happens that results in any kind of consequence and nothing happens that results in character growth.  It\'s unworthy of sharing a title with Baudelaire\'s work.  As such, I\'m going to just refer to it as Cheese Steak Suppository. Cheese Steak Suppository gets a 2/10. As either a psychological work or a drama, it fails on every conceivable level. I\'m going to re-watch Perfect Blue and get some real psychological content. won\'t lie, it\'s a bit refreshing to go into something with no idea what to expect.

I\'m going to re-watch Perfect Blue and get some real psychological content.', 'Well, frankly best psychological anime I have seen in years, though I am not a big watcher of the kind. I am out of words really, because anime tells so much I feel like telling any feeling, any detail would be a spoiler. I will attempt to summarize what I have seen in this anime that makes it different from the other stuff out there. Then I will try to touch more specific issuses like story, art etc.What makes it different overall?First things first, this anime is NOT for enjoying your leisure time; because they use visual imagery both as the narrator of the story...and as the element that establishes the overall atmosphere, meaning you need to effectively concentrate on what the visuals tell you. For example, lighting of a room will tell about the character much more than his/her conversations. Most of the time you can see how the characters feel just by looking at their faces.Secondly, this is NOT an anime you would want to watch in one go. Just like a good meal, you have to eat it slowly, bit by bit. Overall slow pace itself is obviously designed for this purpose.Thirdly, what we have here belongs to the order of poetry, unlike most of the other anime which belong to the order of I would say novel, or compilation of stories. The title ""Flowers of Evil"" is already announcing such order, yet it is important to keep that in mind throughout the entire series.Now let\'s pass on the more specific details:Story   8/10Well story is pretty simple actually. It takes place in a Japanese school in modern times. Broadly speaking, we see the change or the inability to change of Kasugi through his relation to Sawa and Saeki. But it is almost impossible to identify what the genre of the story is clearly; because they put so much emotion to it. It is as if looking at a simple object like a pen through a microscope. Thus seeing every coherent detail makes harder to identify clearly the genre of the story. Yet it does its job, which just like any other psychological work, is the depiction of characters. Let\'s say story in here is just an excuse for presenting the characters.Art 10/10Great. Some may like it, others may not. I loved it. Reality in drawing adds a lot to the reality of emotion. And as I said in the beginning the story and the characters are depicted with visuals not with dialogues. It is hard to describe it with words but I hope in your life, you have seen a scene, a frame in reality which is so poetic that it immediately evokes certain feelings. The art in this anime is designed for recreating that feeling. Visuals are filled with so much meaning that they are naturally poetic, which is also difficult to be in a completely fictitious environment. The art is, if I may call it justly, cathartic.Sound 9/10When the visuals are this much strong, the only thing left for the sound is not to kill the visuals and support it. This is exactly what sound does in this anime.   It carries the visuals to the next level by creating the reality of the overall atmosphere. The credits music “Last Flower” by its form and content is a concentration of the story of the anime meaning if you compress the entire series into a song, you will probably get something like “Last Flower”. It is sadly weird.Characters 10/10I have never seen more real characters in anime, they are almost more real than the characters of some of the regular movies I have watched. We see three major axis on which the characters are built. One is ferocity towards the mediocrity of the town and its people. Two would be confounding lust with love, a typical trait for teens. Third is lack of courage, thus doing everything on impulse and trying not to face its consequences. Besides these foundations, we can also see the consequences of these foundations on the characters. A clear example would be the repetitions made by Sawa like “Boring boring boring”. These repetitions indicate a small autism which is a product of being shut out of the society which she lives in. Thus her ferocity towards the mediocrity of the town and its people, a trait which determines the nearly all of her actions, is based on her isolation from the society which manifest itself as a small autism indicated by such repetitions. There are other examples for other characters but I will not give them here, because I do not want ruin the fun of understanding such connections.Enjoyment 9/10I enjoyed the show because it has been a while since I\'ve seen such genuine stuff. But this show is not designed for enjoyment.Overall 10/10As someone who did not read the manga, I feel like the show attained its purpose which was the portrayal of the characters for the 1 part. If the show ends here, I am OK with that because once you understand that the events are solely for the exposition of the characters, not much of an event is needed after you understood the characters. The possible next season will show us either how they change or how they stay the same, and the options to what they will change into are pretty limited, so in all cases what happens in the next season is not really important in terms of plot, because the general purpose of the plot is already designated, but the thing that will be important for the next season is the art for sure. Now that we can see where everything is going, what matters is how they are going to portray it. This firm establishement gained by an ""ouverture"" should be the purpose of every first season. That is why overall I give 10 to this anime. I recommend it not only to watchers but to the producers as well. As a first season, it has function, style, uniqueness, a key combination for establishing anything great. and as the element that establishes the overall atmosphere, meaning you need to effectively concentrate on what the visuals tell you.

Pacing on the impulses that the story gives, it feels irresistible to try not to break through Kasuga's soliloquy and Nakamura's obsession.So far the story fulfills the void in which we seem to fall and the music emphasizes it amazingly well.the animation is, in my opinion, superb! though you may find a new depiction world in these lines and colors, one mirroring nearly reality, and many people will not be able to embrace it.The characters definitely catch your eyes being something you see day after day. Erupting their emotions from a...sweet smile and a brief moment of happiness, to a downfall in hopelessness and despair; to the very bottom when you feel like you're a piece of shit. Overall, i believe you can find a part of yourself in this anime, and i do have high hopes for Aku no Hana! sweet smile and a brief moment of happiness, to a downfall in hopelessness and despair; to the very bottom when you feel like you're a piece of shit. Overall, i believe you can find a part of yourself in this anime, and i do have high hopes for Aku no Hana!"", 'The psychological genre is my favorite genre in anime. I love the emotions characters show as they go through the ups and downs and trials and tribulations of the story. Unlike many people who hate the “real life” backgrounds and scenery or the fact that the characters are “ugly”, the thing I hate most about this show is the lack of emotion shown by the characters which I have come to love from similar psychological stories.I started Aku no Hana shortly after the season ended not knowing what to expect and with no idea whether I would hate it or love it. I had been...putting it off after seeing the art style and how it varied from the manga that I had greatly enjoyed. I also thought I knew exactly where this season would end but damn was I wrong. Instead of ending it at a place where the manga changes pace and I thought left a perfect spot for the season to end, they slowed down the pace and made it so that the climax of the story will probably come around the fourth or fifth episode of the second season.Story – 6/10It kind of pains me to give this story such a low score. I would have dropped this show after the first episode or so had I not read the manga and known how much better the plot gets. However, the plot gets really good shortly after where this relatively uneventful season ends.The story of Aku no Hana begins with a bored-out-of-his-mind middle school boy named Kasuga Takao. The town he lives in is surrounded by mountains on all sides, and is cut off from the rest of the world. Kasuga loves reading books and his favorite is “Flowers of Evil” (Aku no Hana in Japanese) by Charles Baudelaire. He even has a picture of Baudelaire in his bedroom and carries a copy of the book with him everywhere he goes. One day, he forgets the book at school and goes back to get it. When he does, he finds the gym uniform of his crush, Saeki Nanako, lying next to the lockers at the back of their classroom. Kasuga picks up and the clothes and smells them, and, startled by a sound behind him, gets scared and takes the uniform home with him. Kasuga decides to just put the uniform back the next day and avoid any problems, but things become difficult once he finds out that the loner in his class, Nakamura Sawa, saw him steal Saeki’s uniform. In addition, Saeki and everyone else is freaking out over the event. From there, Nakamura uses the knowledge of what Kasuga has done to force him into a contract and use him to have some fun in this boring town town full of boring people.As much as I love the plot of the manga, the anime is just too slow paced. What could have had the climax of the manga (so far) at its end, instead decided to waste time on slow scenes and put off the real story for later. This show tries to build up tension too much, but fails in the end with a strange ending that forces a second season.Art – 3/10As I mentioned, I do not dislike the backgrounds that use rotoscoping (tracing over real life images and making it look animated). The one place where there is an intersection and there is a mirror that they use to split up Kasuga and his friends I thought was a very nice touch that showed how distant he was from everyone else.While I don’t really like the designs that people consider “ugly,” it’s still not what ruined the show for me. What I dislike is the lack of emotion they portray. Despite sounding distraught or maniacal (for Nakamura) at times, the characters faces never show more blushing, tears, and sweat. Compared to something like “Higurashi” which shows emotions to the extreme, their faces are just boring. I just could not get attached to emotional scenes when I kept looking at the characters’ faces and seeing the same expression I had seen in regular scenes. Even real life people show more emotions than these characters, which is not something I can say for almost any other anime.Another thing I disliked was how characters only gained faces after they were large enough and how faces gradually appeared on them as they moved “towards the camera.” This also detracted from the emotions of characters showed. It wasn’t a problem for background characters, but it was for the main three and Kasuga’s parents. One time Kasuga’s mother is supposed to look distressed and crying but she (as well as Kasuga’s father) has no face and instead is just sitting there for about half a minute before it lets you see her do anything to show that she is feeling distressed.Sound – 4/10There’s not much music in this show. While the piano tones do set up a good mood, there’s not much variety in the soundtrack. The one song that has one piano note every so often is about the only one I really noticed, and I’m not sure if there were any songs other than that and the ED. I don’t usually mention ending or opening songs, but this one starts prior to the end credits in every episode and is occasionally played during scenes. I really do not like the ending. It’s a creepy, computer generated voice that isn’t really even singing. I think it would work okay for a science fiction-horror but not for Aku no Hana.Character – 3/10Well, I didn’t even like Kasuga in the manga until after where the anime ends (right after where I thought it was going to end actually). Still, between the strange character designs, the lack of emotion they show, Kasuga’s fairly annoying VA (who kind of had to be annoying to fit the role), and just the lack of anything that really happens to develop the characters during these 13 episodes, I do not like main character cast. The background characters all blend together and with their strange designs, all look kind of similar (except for one of Kasuga’s friends with curly hair). Since the real interesting character development happens later than where the anime stops, there’s really nothing much to say.Enjoyment  4/10I kept hoping it would improve and become more like the manga I love, but it was just an uneventful, disappointing season in the end. I would recommend the manga over the anime if you want to experience the real emotion of the story and to not have the story cut off shortly before the climax. If you want something similar (but better) you could also try reading Chikan Otoko, Sundome, or Onani Master Kurosawa. putting it off after seeing the art style and how it varied from the manga that I had greatly enjoyed.

I don’t usually mention ending or opening songs, but this one starts prior to the end credits in every episode and is occasionally played during scenes. I really do not like the ending. It’s a creepy, computer generated voice that isn’t really even singing. I think it would work okay for a science fiction-horror but not for Aku no Hana.Character – 3/10Well, I didn’t even like Kasuga in the manga until after where the anime ends (right after where I thought it was going to end actually). Still, between the strange character designs, the lack of emotion they show, Kasuga’s fairly annoying VA (who kind of had to be annoying to fit the role), and just the lack of anything that really happens to develop the characters during these 13 episodes, I do not like main character cast. The background characters all blend together and with their strange designs, all look kind of similar (except for one of Kasuga’s friends with curly hair). Since the real interesting character development happens later than where the anime stops, there’s really nothing much to say.Enjoyment  4/10I kept hoping it would improve and become more like the manga I love, but it was just an uneventful, disappointing season in the end. I would recommend the manga over the anime if you want to experience the real emotion of the story and to not have the story cut off shortly before the climax. If you want something similar (but better) you could also try reading Chikan Otoko, Sundome, or Onani Master Kurosawa.', ""Zexcs has probably done the most bold thing of the season by animating Shuuzou Oshimis manga, Aku no Hana.Apparently the manga was quite popular in advance and many people were looking forward to the adaptation. Yet after the first episode an uproar of many angry fans has shaken the industry. People were pissed and the show suddenly went to the lowest rated TV series on MAL.I on the other hand finished the episode and it left quite a good impression on me. After I went to the forums I saw the gigantic flame war and was confused. Why are people so mad?The answer lies in...rotoscoping. A technique, were you take live action footage and draw over it so it looks like an animated show. Shows like Waking Life, A Scanner Darkly, or Mind Game all use this Technique, as well as many other shows.Without questioning whether it is good or bad, I ask a different question. If Aku no Hana is based on live action footage with real actors, can it be considered an anime? I think yes, though it is in this weird middle ground between live action drama and anime.Disregarding whether or not it is an anime, I ask a second question, is it good?Story________________________________________Aku no Hana takes place in a small town in the middle of nowhere in japan. Takao Kasuga is a middle school student who is interested in literature, especially into Baudelaire’s work, Aku no Hana.He is also in love with one of his class mates, Nanako Saeki, who is his “muse” and source of inspiration.One day he forgets his book in class and picks It up after everyone left, as he spots Saekis gym cloths and steals it on impulse. He feels guilt and shame and tries to bring it back but the antisocial loner, Sawa Nakamura saw him steal the gym clothing and now controls his life, trying to turn him into a deviant.Though it is set in a normal middle school it takes a more dark approach than most other school based anime, and right from the start focuses on drama and tension instead of romance and comedy. It’s interesting and comparatively unique as a school anime and quite fresh especially in light of all the more cute and fun shows that normally air.The show is extremely slow paced. I haven’t read the manga but many people complained it covers only a little of it so I guess it is much slower than the manga version.Yet I have no problem with the slow pacing as it creates immense atmosphere you don’t see that often anymore. There are sometimes scenes of people walking or just background lasting several minutes with very minimalistic ambient music in the background. It’s quite daring to do this, in nowadays more fast paced oriented anime world and I liked it quite a bit. It reminded me of some scenes in Serial Experiments Lain, Texhnolyze and Neon Genesis Evangelion.If you are not a fan of slow pacing though I think you will not like it for that.The Events and interactions are all quite simple though, you have Kasuga being controlled by Nakamura the entire time. They mostly talk and sometimes do things. It revolves mostly just around the 3 main characters and side characters just spice it up, but are never directly involved in the events.Though it’s not super interesting. The things that happen revolve around normal first love/dating events plus Nakamuras devilish twists to those. It gives the overall story a good amount of tension and you always wonder “how in the world will this end well?”.Speaking of how it will end well. The things that happened were also quite realistic, nothing internally destroyed the logic of the show, though you sometimes asked yourself how stupid Kasuga is, yet everything that happens makes sense within the personalities and world. There are no visible plotholes or desu ex machina, consequences are real, though not always as you expect them to be.Sadly the show ends in a preview for a possible second season. I will most likely watch it when it comes out because it picks up where the buildup left.Characters________________________________________Aku no Hana had some of the most realistic written characters I’ve ever seen in an anime. Maybe it comes from the fact they were actors, but it’s also the things they say, the way they react and the world around them. There are no silly school archetypes, no moe girl, no tsundere, no slapstick or fanservice as in other shows that revolve around school.Takao Kasuga, is somewhat an outsider. He thinks of himself as better than others, though is introverted. He has a massive sense of righteousness and romanticizes not only Saeki but also his literature and the fact that he feels so different.Yet he is easy to manipulate, emotionally unstable and is drawn to the wrong decisions. No really he is that guy in a horror movie who opens the door to the monster and gets killed and you are screaming “NO NO NOT THAT DOOR YOU IDIOT WHAT ARE YOU DOING, YOU GONNA GET KILLED!”.It was pretty frustrating to watch him stumble from one bad decision to the next, especially when Nakamura takes over his life and he is to weak minded to fight back. There are several occasions he could have gotten out of the mess he was in. Burry Saekis clothing in the ground, throw them in a river, burn them down. But he never did. He only once tried to get rid of them but was too hysterical to do so.His naïve sense of right and wrong is also extremely annoying but at the same time interesting. He is insecure and has a low self-esteem but hides behind his supposed intellectualism and books.Sawa Nakamura is the crazy girl from Takaos class. She is offensive, insulting and acts how she likes. She is manipulative and overall I would call her a true sociopath. She is not intelligent but very charismatic. She was just as unlikable as Takao though. I hated her and her attitude and emotional instability. If I was Takao I would not have given her any attention and probably blamed the stolen underwear on her.Yet she is one of the more interesting characters in anime history. Her evil nature and playful destructive behavior is sometimes quite entertaining. She also is the driving force for all the drama in the show, as she puts Takao into worse situations the more they spend time together.My biggest problem though is that is never explained why she is such a “crazy bitch”. She comes from a relatively normal household, grew up without a mother and just her father who seems like a nice guy as well as her grandmother who also is very nice. It kinda feels sketchy and she is just crazy so the story has a crazy person.You know Yuno Gasai from Mirai Nikki, she was also insane, but at least it was explained why she was insane, while Nakamura is apparently just insane.Saeki is the class’ most popular girl. Kasuga loves her but at first he is invisible for him. Later when he stands up for Nakamura she adores his brave protection of her and seeks him out. Her character is also hard to understand. She later finds out about what Kasuga did but still likes him nonetheless.Apparently she hates her sheltered perfect life and sees Kasuga as an interesting boy. Also she explains how she never had any male friends before and Kasuga seems to be the first interesting male she came into contact with.The rest of the side characters are just extra and I don’t feel the need to go into them as they are almost unimportant for anything that happens.Overall the main characters of Aku no Hana are very realistic and have a deep intertwined relationship. From this the entire plot and drama derives and makes the show interesting. Even though none of them is likable (at least for me) but their characters are interesting enough to watch.Art and Animation________________________________________I will try to make it brief.I liked the artstyle of Aku no Hana. The rotoscope was special and different. We might argue about the quality of it and how it makes the show less of an anime and how the characters are not cute and all.But fact is, if Aku no Hana would have had a traditional artstyle with traditional character designs like those in the manga, it would have been less interesting as it is now. It’s good that a season has a black sheep that goes against the norm so it doesn’t stagnate and becomes the same shit we’ve seen a million times before. And I reward differentness.Also the backgrounds are fucking beautiful looking. They are highly detailed (probably because they are based on real life) and add to the immersion and atmosphere.The sometimes used evil flowers also add to the slightly surreal nature of the show and were a great addition effect wise.In the end I enjoyed the art of Aku no Hana as it was something that I don’t see often and it made the show more interesting. Sure it doesn’t look perfect and beautiful like other school anime do, but it fits the more mature and dark tone of the show much better.Sound________________________________________I can’t really call it voiceacting in Aku no Hana as they actually had their own voice. So I will just call it acting.And it was great. The actors did a fantastic job, they had a great variety of emotions and gave the personalities of their characters great impact.The openings were all pretty weird and had this ironic tone. They didn’t fit music wise but lyrics wise and I think it was intentional. I couldn’t like them but give credit for their dementia feel.The ending song on the other hand is great. I don’t know what the song is called right now but you can find it and give it a listen, it’s very avant-garde and the first time this song kicked in in the first episode I was almost blown away. Definitely my favorite song of the season.The rest of the soundtrack was also great. It was mostly atmospheric ambient. Some might find it boring but it hit my nerve and I will get my hands on it soon. It makes the show much more gloomy and atmospheric and helps the dark themes.Enjoyment________________________________________It’s hard to say how much I enjoyed Aku no Hana. It was a very exhausting show to watch. The tension and stupidity of the characters made me cringe but also look for more. As I said about Kasuga it was like watching a horror movie in which the characters always did the wrong things. It pisses you off but you want to see how it all ends.Overall though I think it is one of the best show of the season and that’s thanks to the fact of how daring it is.Scores________________________________________Art and Animation 6/10Artstyle +1 (rotoscope is different and special)Quality -1 (the execution was pretty bad though)Background +1 (Fantastic backgrounds)Character Designs 0 (They are real humans what do you expect them too be designed after?)Visual Effects 0 (sometimes the flowers of evil but rarely used)Sound 7/10Voice Acting +1 (for overall good acting)Opening and Ending 0(the ending was great, the openings weird)Soundtrack +1 (Gloomy and Atmospheric)Sound Effects 0 (Nothing notable)Story or Content 4/10Premise and Setting 0 (It's still just a school drama...)Pacing 0 (Slow but increased the feeling of dread)Complexity 0 (simple story, simple world, interesting themes though!)Plausibility 0 (internally coherent but will make you facepalm at how stupid the MC is)Conclusion -1 (no real end...)Characters 7/10Personality +1 (some of the most realistic and excentric people you've ever seen in an anime)Behavior and Chemistry +1 (Kasuga and Nakamura create great tension)Development and Progression +1 (Kasuga slowly becomes a worse human being and removes his sense of righteousness)Motivation and Backdrop 0 (not everything was well explained, though the motivations are not out of no where)Likability -1 (argh those people piss me off!)Enjoyment 8/10Art and Animation +1 (I like different)Sound +1 (great soundtrack)Story and Content 0 (interesting but hard to watch)Characters 0 (interesting but fucking idiots)Value +1 (special anime and went into MAL history and probably everywhere else as well)Conclusion________________________________________Aku no Hana is not for everyone. It is tough to watch, has some of the most annoying characters and an off putting artstyle.If you are looking for something that sticks out of the normal then please go ahead and watch it. It's not a master piece and has many flaws. But at least it is ignoring what is popular and makes its own thing which I respect deeply.6/10 (Fair) rotoscoping.

Ah, what could have been. It\'s obvious from the final episode that the creators had every intention to make a second season. Based on the manga, the second season would have been earth-shattering. This first season was just laying the foundation for all that excitement - and what a great job it did!Let me say, the flack this show gets totally goes over my head. Poor adaptation? Are...you kidding me? This anime is about a million times better than the manga. Where the manga feels half-baked, this season did not shy away from or sugar-coat it\'s themes of isolation and boredom. And where the manga art does zero justice to it\'s dark and ""alternative"" themes, the anime is art is edgy and, yes, very ""alternative"". Why do people hate the animation so much? It\'s not cute because it\'s not supposed to be. I don\'t believe it\'s supposed to feel overly polished, either. The realistic proportions and movements of all the characters makes scenes that felt camp in the manga feel believably tense in the anime. And Nakamura\'s actress is just brilliant. I do agree with other fans, though, that the single best part of this season was the soundtrack. The ending theme has to be my favorite anime ending to date. And the rotating opening themes are super cool for expanding on one character at a time. The quiet background noise for sure also adds an interesting layer to Kasuga\'s day-to-day boredoms and almost an outer-body attitude to the mess that he is creating.I have to say, this whole show is a brilliant character study. Kasuga, who prides himself on being ""different"" for reading classic poetry yet doesn\'t want to be called a deviant. Nakamura, who\'s sick of people like him wearing masks, yet deeply troubled and lonely because while she has a hunch that plenty of people share her views, none of them can admit to it. And even Saeki, who finally proves she\'s not just an angel or muse for Kasuga, but another lying ""shit-face"" tired of playing the part she\'s been assigned. I like the characters here much more than I EVER did in the manga. Interesting, since scene-by-scene it\'s very faithful to the manga. The animation, acting, and music really does make that big of a difference. It feels like a brand new story.Finally, poor pacing? Okay, this complaint drives me crazy. Because obviously you\'re crazy to say such a thing. The pacing in this show is so, so, so consistent. That\'s more than I can say about the pacing for most anime. Consistency is the single most important aspect of pacing, and it takes effort to achieve. Yeah, this show is slow. Maybe that\'s not your style. But at least it was intentional. Everything about this show is very intentional, if experimental, and done with care and purpose. This show has vision. It\'s okay if you don\'t like it\'s vision or angle, but don\'t dare put it in the ranks of other thoughtless, forgettable shows. The director did say he wanted this show to make a strong impression, even if that impression is a bad one. I guess I shouldn\'t be so upset this show gets so much hate, because as they say, the opposite of love is not hate - it\'s indifference. Bad publicity is good publicity?Still upset about this show\'s poor ratings. Forever pissed that we didn\'t get a second season.People who flame this anime without even giving it a try are the kind of people Kasuga and Nakamura hate - boring people glued inside a comfort zone. Such experimental and creative anime should be celebrated and encouraged. I\'d much rather watch a show that takes risks, even if some of those risks fall flat, than one with a dime-a-dozen formulaic plot and style. Take Nakamura\'s advice and embrace the deviant inside of you. Embrace the risque, embrace the abnormal. Embrace this show. And shows like it. Hopefully, next time something this unique rolls out, people will give it a chance and give it a second season. you kidding me? This anime is about a million times better than the manga.

Hopefully, next time something this unique rolls out, people will give it a chance and give it a second season.', 'Teenage angst, love triangles, and melodrama are all really tacky aspects for a series to handle, but if there’s one series that does a near impeccable job handling these aspects, it’s Aku no Hana.The pacing is slow. It’s really, really, really slow, but it works. It works brilliantly. It was a little jarring at first with how slow events were taking place, but then it became clear that this show just would have never worked if it paced itself faster. Aku no Hana takes its time building up the atmosphere, beautifully fleshing out the characters and bringing them to life. Aku no Hana doesn’t like...to make scenes snappy, instead it takes as much time as it wants drawing them out.While watching Aku no Hana, I didn’t feel like I was watching ordinary anime anymore, but real life events unfolding right in front of my eyes. I felt like I was actually a passerby standing right in the scene, observing everything that was going on. I wasn’t in my room anymore, I was there. That’s how immersed I was with the whole experience.And an ugly experience it was.  A beautifully ugly experience.Aku no Hana never once showcases the beauty of human nature, society or the world we live in. It doesn’t even end on a hopeful note. Aku no Hana throws you out of your comfort zone and blatantly tells you how cruel and cynical our world can really be at times, that sometimes there really is no hope.Aku no Hana achieves this bleak theme with the main cast who no longer feel merely as characters, but as actual human beings. They’re fantastically well-acted and far from likeable in a believable way. Kasuga isn’t a terrible person, but he makes rash decisions and digs himself deeper and deeper into a hole by running away from his problems. Nakamura is so insecure and broken down inside, that she instills this narrow mindset where people are either deviants or not. Saeki is foolish and completely driven by her infatuation for Kasuga.By the end, all three characters wore me down so much that I was yelling at their naivety and ultimately putting my face in the palms of my hands, but not because the decisions they made were poorly written and delivered, but  quite the opposite. Every character mirrors reality perfectly, so much that’s it’s almost terrifying.Aku no Hana screwed with my perspective on life the same brilliant way Aoi Bungaku and Welcome to the NHK did as I watched it. But alas, there are just a few flaws with the series. Yes, it was a little uneventful at first, the series ends on a major cliffhanger, but more importantly the series just became so abrasively dark that I eventually grimaced through the final episodes.Do I recommend?: Aku no Hana is a rare anime that captures the atrocious side of life perfectly, but it’s hard for me to recommend a series like this. The fact that the show is so downright cynical will turn people away as well as the incredibly slow pacing. If you like dark psychological drama, give this one a chance and see for yourself. to make scenes snappy, instead it takes as much time as it wants drawing them out.While watching Aku no Hana, I didn’t feel like I was watching ordinary anime anymore, but real life events unfolding right in front of my eyes. I felt like I was actually a passerby standing right in the scene, observing everything that was going on. I wasn’t in my room anymore, I was there. That’s how immersed I was with the whole experience.And an ugly experience it was.  A beautifully ugly experience.Aku no Hana never once showcases the beauty of human nature, society or the world we live in. It doesn’t even end on a hopeful note. Aku no Hana throws you out of your comfort zone and blatantly tells you how cruel and cynical our world can really be at times, that sometimes there really is no hope.Aku no Hana achieves this bleak theme with the main cast who no longer feel merely as characters, but as actual human beings. They’re fantastically well-acted and far from likeable in a believable way. Kasuga isn’t a terrible person, but he makes rash decisions and digs himself deeper and deeper into a hole by running away from his problems. Nakamura is so insecure and broken down inside, that she instills this narrow mindset where people are either deviants or not. Saeki is foolish and completely driven by her infatuation for Kasuga.By the end, all three characters wore me down so much that I was yelling at their naivety and ultimately putting my face in the palms of my hands, but not because the decisions they made were poorly written and delivered, but  quite the opposite.

Flowers of Evil is a pretty good example of the kind of manga you should be doing this with. A teenage boy idolises a pretty girl in his class but then gets roped into stealing her gym clothes by nothing more than his own secret desire to defile her. It\'s a reactionary piece to trends in popular culture that references a 19th century poem which was also a reactionary piece to trends in poetry and art at the time. The mangaka didn\'t want a straight adaptation of his work, and only accepted when the...director of Mushishi Hiroshi Nagahama came along with his radical idea. His adaptation was a reactionary piece to the response people who saw Flowers of Evil as, to put it in the words of the original author, ""Nakamura unf unf"".I can see what they were going for with this adaptation. It shoves back in the face of the people who saw, in what was supposed to be a story about our creepy desires to defile the ideals we hold to be pure, an overly elaborate piece of NTR erotic fiction. These are real people, not the idols that you fetishise. It\'s supposed to heighten the sense of unease we get over the actions the characters take in this elaborate piece of NTR erotic fiction. At least, that\'s what I think it\'s supposed to be doing. It\'s certainly what a lot of the early chatter around this show suggested it was trying to be. Problem is that this was not only poorly implemented, but also seemed to have fuck all to do with the main theme of the actual story Flowers of Evil was telling.Tell me Flowers of Evil, what are you supposed to be about? Is it about the mind-numbing mundanity of everyday life and screaming to get out, or is it about wanting to defile the things you hold pure? Because one half of the series focuses on one of those themes and the second half on the other. You could argue the two are connected, but then you\'d be wrong. The directing likes to spend forever showing a decaying town and characters walking really slowly along streets with the only background music being a man randomly hitting a piano key every 10 seconds. I guess this is supposed to show how friggen boring everyday life is, although that\'s the director deliberately making his show boring and tedious to watch to make an artistic statement, for which I would like to kindly ask him to please take his head out of his own backside.The second half of the story tries to focus more on trying to escape this mundanity, but this mundanity is presented as a crappy thing. The idolisation of purity is presented as a more careful balance between whether purity or defilement is the way to go. There\'s one attempt made in the entire show to marry these two scenes in an absolutely amazing scene at the end of episode 7 where the two characters destroy a classroom in a giant obvious metaphor for sex. But the series seemed to blow its load in that episode and after that spent its time piddling away doing next to nothing. Then again, before that scene, the show spent most of its time piddling away doing next to nothing. At least then it was novel and I could kid myself this was going to lead to something. Spoiler warning (although this isn\'t really a spoiler at all) no it doesn\'t go anywhere. Instead the show ends on a fucking montage of all the things that happen later in the manga that will never get animated because this show was never going to get a sequel and was pathetically stupid of the creators to even think that it would.The biggest problem of all is simply that it\'s a goddamn boring anime to watch. Once the novelty wears off, and it will, you come to the realisation that only one thing happens per episode. No really, only one thing happens in each episode. The rest is padded with shots of people walking and the main character panicking. The camera liked to linger on the town falling apart, which I think was supposed to tie into this idea of the town being decaying and boring. But the show also lingered on Nakamura, lingered on the main character, heck it even lingered on the picture of the poet the main character kept in his room. This rendered the entire directing choice of lingering on anything completely pointless and only served to drag out the episode even further, which on reflection probably was the only point. The main character...also talks...like this...most of...the time...taking...deep breaths...between every....other word....he says. It\'s supposed to show his panicked mind, but I couldn\'t take it seriously after a while and just started hearing the kid from Malcolm in the Middle in the wheelchair with the missing lung.Also I\'m just going to say it: The rotoscoping looks dumb. I\'m not a fan of this animation technique even when it\'s done well, but here it has characters spazzing out when they move and that curious way faces aren\'t drawn in when they\'re too far away from the camera but as they get closer the faces get drawn in as though we\'re on a crappy video game system and the textures only just loaded in. They got people in their 30\'s to play these middle school kids so it\'s way more difficult to swallow their middle-school stupidity when you can clearly see they don\'t look 14. Sometimes it\'s able to capture these wonderful moments of expression on their faces, particularly the joy on Nakamura\'s face during the classroom destruction scene, but most of the time their features look like they\'re are drooping off their face like they\'re made of plasticine and they\'ve been out in the sun for too long.I do appreciate the effort, and at the time I did enjoy picking Flowers of Evil apart to get at its juicy core themes. Unfortunately the more it went on and the more I picked at it, the more it started to come apart for me. There\'s evidently fuck-all enjoyment you can get from it on a surface level, and it was clearly asking to be picked apart for its themes. I like that it got weird moe fans all angry over their beautiful manga waifu longer being pretty, but stripping the sexuality away from a story that was precisely about dealing with sexual urges diminishes the point of the story in retrospect. All in all I\'d class the whole thing as a failed experiment. An interesting experiment certainly, albeit one that is very boring to actually watch. director of Mushishi Hiroshi Nagahama came along with his radical idea.

In the ""Reviews"" section of this fairly revolutionary-wise visual presentation, those are the only two kinds of reviews you will ever find. In the ""Ratings"" section, however, you will find a wide range of different people, who have either enjoyed, endured, or dropped this newly classic saga of adolescence. Those traitors! How could they have rated Aku no Hana as anything BUT a 9.0 or higher?! How could they have not savored...the decadent scenes of Kasuga-kun walking through grass for basically half of one entire episode?! How could they have not delighted in the cliffhanger at the end of the series?! All of these little nuisances serve only to truly please the true fans of Aku no Hana. Yes, I am referring to masochists such as myself, who were taken aback by the god-tier skill and passion that was put forth into making each episode painful, and were constantly asking for more by the end of each episode. Let us unite and spread the good word amongst the deviants!Anyways, on to the review. Please note that the actual novel, Baudelaire\'s Les Fleurs du Mal, does not play as big a role as you might have thought. Sorry for the disappointment, folks.STORY l 10 lIn this particular anime, we start off by being introduced to Kasuga-kun, our beloved protagonist for this series, and the dull setting that he is immersed in. Basically, he lives in a tranquil, quiet town, where nothing commercial/big has reached. The buildings are soft and crumbling, and the shrubbery and trees softly melt into the clear, distant sky, setting the perfect mood for absolute chaos to bloom. Kasuga-kun is a junior high student, and is walking to school, when suddenly, BAM! nothing out of the ordinary happens at all. Anyways, in his class, Kasuga-kun is almost a complete loner, save for the geeks that he has attracted. Most of his classmates view him as weirdo, who is obsessed with books (Baudelaire\'s Les Fleurs du Mal, in particular); and it turns out that he is. It turns out that we get to listen in on almost every single thought that enters his mind, narrated in the voice of Morgan Free- Ueda, Shinichirou, I mean. Anyways, he\'s obsessed about this one girl named Saeki, Nanako, who just so happens to be one of his classmates. He literally acknowledges her as his reason to live, and seriously worships her accordingly. Despite this, he hesitates to check her out during P.E., as the other guys do (Good Guy Kasuga-kun). Too bad Saeki quite literally does not acknowledge him at all. Another important character to take note of here is Nakamura, Sawa. Alright; now, the actual story is set in motion when Kasuga forgets his copy of Les Fleurs du Mal at school. When he comes back to retrieve it, he is greeted by Saeki\'s bag of goodies (her bag of gym clothes), and upon an impulse, he grabs it, and runs like hell, the bag in one hand and his book in the other. Little does our Kasuga-kun know, though, that a certain girl (Nakamura) was loitering afterschool, and caught a glimpse of a certain someone stealing another certain someone\'s clothes. Oh, boy.ART l 9 lNow, despite how everyone was complaining about ""rotoscoping"", a technique of animation which they probably picked up from this anime page\'s forums, have no idea about the ethics of it, and have been tossing it around like monkeys with their own feces, I\'d like to state otherwise. Although it\'s verily painful at first glimpse, it\'s simply beautiful once you get used to it, and it\'ll grow on you. Anyways, onto the concept of rotoscoping, and its ethics in being used in anime. Rotoscoping is basically an ancient form of art, with evidence of its use in any type of animation being as early as 1915. It is quite literally, the art of drawing over recorded material; just drawing anything at all is incredibly hard, so you should get off the animators\' backs when you criticize any type of animation. Also, for those who have claimed that rotoscoping was used in this instance because there wasn\'t enough funding, let me tell you why that is bull feces. Instead of simply animating out of scratch and having voice actors create their magic, so much more was financed in renting a place to film, having a film crew, also having animators, and paying extra for actors who would fit the role, and work twice as hard as simple voice actors. If this was too long, and you didn\'t read it, then it can be summed up with: Anyone who criticizes animation should just go do it themselves.SOUND l 9 lAku no Hana has one of the most beautiful original soundtracks my ears have ever been witness too; and I\'ve even listened to Yoko Kanno\'s works. You have Uchujin\'s already well-established works with different vocalists doing the opening songs, and ASA-CHANG & JUNRAY\'s simply genius song, ""Hana -a last flower-"", fit one of the anime\'s most important themes about evil blooming like flowers. Aside from the OST, the background sounds to several settings within the anime are done masterfully, effectively simulating the exact same feel as though it were a picture. That is, assuming they didn\'t just use the clean-cut background sounds from the footage that they had recorded. If so, then anyone may correct me on that point. Also, the actors had done a wonderful job of voicing who they were meant to act as.CHARACTER l 8 lCharacter. The lowest point of 8 in my rating. I might be mistaken in judging these characters, but what the hell. Alright, first, we have our first main character, Kasuga-kun. At first, we are shown that he is a vigilant bookworm, with a passionate love/desire for Saeki. With time, his character quite literally withers into an emo teenager who actually does repeat ""I\'m empty!"" several times in a certain episode. By the end, though, you become witness to the beautiful emergence of Kasuga-kun out of a symbolic cocoon; anything more would spoil the entire anime for you guys. Next up, we have Nakamura-san, who is, instead of Saeki, the next most important character in this anime. All throughout the anime, basically, you can sum up Nakamura-san as an absolute bad-ass angel of chaos, who seeks nothing but a companion for the end of the world (symbolically); or, if you\'re a normal person, then a crazy, red-haired demon. Also, by the end, you are shown more of what had motivated her to do the things that she had done. Next, is Saeki-san, the next important character within this story. She is basically an angel from heaven, a blessing for her friends and family, and a sight for sore eyes if you\'re an abstinent male. Kasuga-kun has completely fallen for her, and with this honest emotion, she can\'t help but feel it mutual. It\'s a relatively short relationship, though, so celebrate Kasuga-kun\'s luck with brevity! Anyways, later on, Kasuga-kun is put between a rock and a hard place, when he absolutely must decide between two of the lovely ladies. You must watch it in order to find out what happens next!ENJOYMENT l 10 lEvery Saturday/Sunday/Monday (whenever it was available to me from ggsubs), I would sit dutifully in my chair and watch Aku no Hana in perfect silence, absorbing all that I could from it. I honestly enjoyed this anime a lot, because again, I am quite the masochist. This anime will fulfill anyone looking for chaotically pristine drama, and will destroy anyone who isn\'t looking for salvation within this anime. I very much recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for something to marathon when you have nothing else to do, because there literally is no other way to watch it but in a marathon (unless you were stuck in purgatory, waiting each week for the newest episode to be subbed, like I, and many of my brothers in the Spring of 2013 anime season). I might have enjoyed it quite a bit due to the fact that it sort-of mirrors my adolescence a bit. Oh well, whatever.OVERALL l 9 lAlright, I\'m not gonna be a tyrant here and absolutely make everyone who bore through my review watch it, but just watch it, if you have even the slightest interest in it. the decadent scenes of Kasuga-kun walking through grass for basically half of one entire episode?!

The continuity of themes and information is all there. If you start watching this anime sometime after the 1st episode, I guarantee you won\'t know what\'s going on. It is also well paced, making sure that the...events in the episode are substantial enough to deviate from the ""filler"" label, and leave the viewer wanting to see the next episode. Aku no Hana does this in a unique way as well, usually ending episodes with a scene that could qualify as the episode\'s true climax.Art was dope, nuff\' said. Aku no Hana uses realistic, truly humanoid depictions of characters without seeming pretentious. Mannerisms and speech are very richly pronounced. The scenery is awesome, not too particle-based Heaven\'s Lost Property cartoony awesomeness, but detailed, almost freehand landscapes and features. When you see the way they show the water in a river, you\'ll know.The soundtrack for Aku no Hana isn\'t anything too amazing, but for the series and its intended purpose of scaring the shi-- I mean establishing a rather darker mood, the music works. Aku no Hana opens up with not necessarily brighter, but more up-tempo and instrumental music pieces with very well written lyrics. The episodes tend to contain moon-setters as opposed to signature themes with replay value. Monotone humming for scenes with great tension, that type of deal. At the close of every episode, they transition into the abstract ending song by playing the vocal part by itself behind dialogue, then letting the instrumentation drop in. It\'s a great fit for the ending scenes especially, and if you watch, you\'ll get it.The characters were well developed across the board. I think Kasuga, our protagonist\'s purpose was made very clear. Typical conflicted teenager met with stimulus he\'s not built to sustain yet making poor decisions and later having to face them. Though, his monologues are usually rich with foreshadowing and poetic allusions, making them twice as intense. And of course, Nakamura, the backwards red-headed antagonist of the story, as well as maiden Saeki, are developed quite well.I gave Enjoyment a low rating, cuz frankly I don\'t really ""enjoy"" the anime, but I can appreciate it. Like a good horror/psychological piece, I don\'t particularly enjoy watching it as it frightens me/disturbs me, but I can give it ups and downs towards its production. It will definitely stick with you on a negative note, but you\'ll keep coming back simply because it\'s as interesting as a believable ghost story.Overall, Aku no Hana is a well made series thus far and frankly I encourage those who haven\'t started it yet and like a little bit of strange, eerie tension to compliment their dark nights alone at home, to watch it.LunoA96, signing out. events in the episode are substantial enough to deviate from the ""filler"" label, and leave the viewer wanting to see the next episode.

It\'s a great fit for the ending scenes especially, and if you watch, you\'ll get it.The characters were well developed across the board. I think Kasuga, our protagonist\'s purpose was made very clear. Typical conflicted teenager met with stimulus he\'s not built to sustain yet making poor decisions and later having to face them. Though, his monologues are usually rich with foreshadowing and poetic allusions, making them twice as intense. And of course, Nakamura, the backwards red-headed antagonist of the story, as well as maiden Saeki, are developed quite well.I gave Enjoyment a low rating, cuz frankly I don\'t really ""enjoy"" the anime, but I can appreciate it. Like a good horror/psychological piece, I don\'t particularly enjoy watching it as it frightens me/disturbs me, but I can give it ups and downs towards its production. It will definitely stick with you on a negative note, but you\'ll keep coming back simply because it\'s as interesting as a believable ghost story.Overall, Aku no Hana is a well made series thus far and frankly I encourage those who haven\'t started it yet and like a little bit of strange, eerie tension to compliment their dark nights alone at home, to watch it.LunoA96, signing out.', 'Overview:Flowers of Evil is a coming of age story that borrows its title from the very famous volume of poems by Charles Baudelaire. This was based on a successful manga and directed by the same guy that did Mushishi. These elements seem like they would combine to make an absolute masterpiece of universal acclaim...unfortunately that isn\'t quite what happened.Production:When the original mangaka, Shuzo Oshimi, talked to director Hiroshi Nagahama, they had some creative differences that in my opinion adversely affected the anime. Nagahama felt that the story was very personal and realistic, so it would lend itself more towards a stage production or perhaps a...TV miniseries. However, Oshimi was insistent that it be turned into a successful anime, so Nagahama decided to compromise by using rotoscope animation to give it a more realistic feel. In case you were unaware, rotoscoping is an animation technique in which animators trace over footage, frame by frame, for use in live-action and animated films and TV shows. An excellent example of Rotoscope animation done right would be the year 2000 film Titan AE. Incidentally, this was also the film that almost single-handedly ended the use of rotoscoping in big budget animated films in the West. Despite a solid script by Joss Whedon and fun characters, it struggled to find an audience and lost a LOT of money at the box office, becoming one of biggest bombs in Hollywood history! This is because good rotoscoping is an INSANELY expensive process and after Fox Animation Studios went bankrupt as a result of Titan AE bombing, it was seen as far too risky vs. cheaper and less labor intensive CGI animation. It is possible to use rotoscoping on a small budget, but it will look UNGODLY horrible like Adult Swim\'s ""Tom Goes to the Mayor"". If you know anything about Japanese film and television, you are well aware that the Japanese generally don\'t believe in having sky high budgets. The decision to use rotoscope on a highly limited budget was the single largest flaw with this anime. Fans accepted that Mushishi moved at a snail\'s pace because it had beautiful art and animation. If it looked like Tom Goes to the Mayor, it simply wouldn\'t have the same critical acclaim that it does!Story and characters:The main character is named Takao Kasuga and he is a socially isolated teen in a small town that likes to read classic poetry and feels isolated from his rural, working class peers. He is sort of like a less abrasive version of Holden Caulfield if I had to compare him to anyone. Takao especially loves Baudelaire and constantly bemoans the fact that none of his peers like French literature. Meh, if he wanted to know what isolation feels like he should try being a Russian literature fan in the deep south United States! Takao has a crush on a pretty girl (it is difficult to tell with the puke inducing animation) named Saeki and considers her to be his ""muse"". One day, Kasuga decides to impulsively steal Saeki\'s gym clothes and bring them home, but he is caught by the class stalker and social outcast named Nakamura. Kasuga feels extreme, crippling guilt over stealing the underwear and allows himself to be blackmailed by Nakamura and forced to do outrageous deeds in order to prevent Saeki from learning the truth. The problem is that the plot often seems like a comedy, but plays itself extremely straight faced and serious! Kasuga\'s guilt over stealing panties and acting like he just murdered his own family is so melodramatic and absurd that it is impossible to take seriously! Imagine taking the famous painting ""Ivan the Terrible and his Son Ivan"" and replacing the corpse of his murdered son with a pair of ladies underwear!"" Look into his horrified, tormented eyes and feel his pain!!! This anime expects you to observe such a painting thoughtfully and NOT laugh your ass off, which is asking a lot! The other major problem is that the romance between Kasuga and his blackmailer Nakamura is telegraphed from the 2nd episode, and yet at no point does she EVER become remotely likeable or sympathetic!Art:I mentioned in the production section pretty much everything I wanted to say about the art. Basically, it isn\'t just bad, it is an absolute effrontery to your senses.Sound:There really isn\'t much of a soundtrack to speak of. Occasionally an atonal and unsettling theme will play, but mostly it uses silence. Once again, the silence worked in Mushishi because there was pretty art to look at and allowed the viewer to become absorbed. When your art is an absolute abortion, the strategic use of silence doesn\'t work effectively!Overall:Flowers of Evil is an anime with a LOT of problems in my opinion, but that doesn\'t make it a horrible anime. This was a highly ambitious project that tackled real themes that teenagers must deal with and has some instances of good writing, high culture, and impressive intelligence. The main character at times can be sympathetic and if this were a well directed stage play that perhaps toned down the panty stealing ""played straight"" melodrama, it would be at least very respectable if not loveable. It turned out kind of a mess, but I DO award points for effort and I think a 6/10 rating is honestly pretty fair for this one. TV miniseries.

Ever.It was clear from the start that this show didn\'t have anything resembling a budget as proven as the terrible decision to rotoscope the entire show. It looks bad. It might have been ""done on purpose"" to add more ""depth"" to the show, but it still looks terrible. Then there\'s the pacing. Or lack there of. Most of the show is just nothing. Literally, nothing. There was an episode where about half of it was just walking. No...dialogue, no inner-monologue, nothing. It just felt like a waste of time.Then there\'s the characters. Ho man, the characters. I didn\'t like any of them. Not one. Was that the point? Probably, but it doesn\'t change the fact that none of these characters even interested me.

The mad princess of Hamlet, in one scene, after hearing of her father’s death, goes mad and begins to sing bawdy songs in front of a shocked cast. The appearance of Ophelia in this state is simultaneously comic and tragic; she is walking the line to her death yet the surprise of the madness shocks the audience into laughter. Only a good actress can find the perfect balance, to tinge laughter with sadness yet not overtly so for “in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, the...whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness” (Hamlet Act 3 Scene 2, when he teaches the actors the proper methods of acting). A good Kasuga Takao has to be both pitiful and sublime.How well an adaptation of Aku no Hana fares depends on this ability to walk between pitiful impotence and sublime exaltation. The whole weight of Aku no Hana falls on the pitiful crescendo to its sublime set-piece moments. People who have read the manga know this scene: the classroom scene. The weight of that scene depends on the director’s capability to depict wildness and fury. With this regard the manga has a greater weight. The reader can flip through pages; decide his or her own pace as to how to approach the event. The watcher has to follow the director’s pace. That single scene redeems everything that comes before it and sets the tone for everything that comes after. We know now why Kasuga seems so irritatingly idiotic for the first few chapters; the shock of the change is worth the price of admission.Shinchirou Ueda plays the pitiful side exceptionally. His voice is cracked and whimpering. His screams are inert and more like squeals initially. His posture is always like a crumpled heap. He is a laughable creature. This is the part where I deal with those criticisms dealing with the art style. The idea behind rotoscoping is to portray a humanity of movement. Each slight nod, twist, turn of the human body is captured entirely. Without rotoscoping there lacks weight to the characters animated. On how they made the characters caricatures of their moe-fied(?) manga forms I will deal with in a different paragraph.In the manga the pitiful and sublime balance each other. The weight of each setpiece scene is felt and burns itself into the hearts of those who can empathize with the scenario given. The anime pulls back the sublime and hides it behind the seams. The pacing is at a snail’s pace and many shots are spent on repetition: the twisted road sign, the school building and the familiar sights of the town… the atmosphere is crushing.  Rather than fury it strikes with a melancholy slowness. The pitiful is compounded upon the pitiful and the Romanticized exaltations of Anarchy are stripped away. The characters are ugly because they have to be ugly in the Anime. While the themes of the manga were pretty nihilistic the Anime makes it even more so.

When you scream you feel the words leaving your lips. You feel the shock of relief and loudness. You’re taken by yourself and for a moment leave yourself. Then afterwards your throat becomes hoarse and breathlessly you fall onto the floor wracked in pain. If instead you scream internally you feel the pain throb inside your heart. The feeling is a constant bassline that lingers not enough to overcome you but it repeats and repeats and reinforces itself. It never leaves.

THIS WILL BE MORE DETAILED ONCE THE SERIES HAS FINISHED)Flowers of Evil (Aku no Hana) may very well be one of the most controversial, polarizing anime in a while, mainly due to its unnatural animation. The use of rotoscoping, if you will. From the first episode alone, it was met here with most users either dropping it immediately, rating it at 1/10, wrote first episode reviews claiming it to be the worst anime ever, or all of the above. My question is does the rotoscoping really make this the worst anime in existence? Then again, take a look at...Sword Art Online's mean score, so that'll pretty much say some things about MAL's credibility.This 13-episode ZEXCS adapation of Shuuzou Oshimi's manga follows Takao Kasuga, a literature enthusiast high school student. One day, he forgets his book at school and goes back to retrieve it. He also sees the gym clothes of his crush, Nanako Saeki, and impulsively steals them. However, he is caught by a friendless, pottymothed girl named Sawa Nakamura, who decides to blackmail Kasuga for her own evil desires.Now let's get to what mostly everyone have been on about: The animation itself: Yes, the rotoscoping isn't the greatest. People here are acting like rotoscoping is the bane of anime, even though you've seen it before. For example, a number of scenes from Kids on the Slope (Sakamichi no Apollon) were done using rotoscoping. Why is it now people are bitching about it? I think it's because in this day and age, most anime-watchers are used to watching plotless, bland moe anime with the girls' eyes taking up about third of their faces. The movements do look janky and the designs themselves look half-done (I'm hoping that they improve on this for the BD/DVD release), but is it really that big of a deal? Does the animation actually tell the story in any way?Honestly, I think the odd animation helps set up the atmosphere, because there are some moments that probably wouldn't have produced the same disturbing effect if it was done in the traditional animation we're used to. Like in one moment, Nakamura forcibly puts Saeki's clothes onto Kasuga. Also, keep in mind I haven't read the manga as of this review's posting, so I can't say if it provokes the same effect.Believe me when I say this: This show is dark and twisted. Kasuga knows what he did was low and appalling and he despises himself for it. Nakamura knows it as well, and plans to make his life more hell than it already is. In one instance, Kasuga finally gets the cojones to ask Saeko out, but during the date, Nakamura makes him wear her gym clothes underneath his clothes.And speaking of Nakamura: This chick I can't even begin to describe. As the series progresses, it becomes clear that Nakamura isn't just blackmailing Kasuga for her own amusement. She seems to want to show that the world is full of perverted shitheads and Kasuga's just her guinea pig.I really don't understand why Flowers of Evil was rated so low here, other than idiots whining about the character designs and the rotoscoping. Personally, I love it. The rotoscoping actually makes it more believable. If you think otherwise, then I apologize that it just wasn't moe enough for you.

The anime quests to find something new, something different that can set us apart from the oppression of the mundane life. The dread of seeing time pass without offering any excitement is a familiar feeling for everyone. Therefore this is an anime we can all relate at some point in our lives.The main character Takao Kasuga starts with a desire to be different. He reads books not because he finds them interesting, but to fantasize that he is someone others cannot understand. He is pathetic.  He also...has a crush on his classmate Nanako Saeki. He embarrassingly calls her his muse, his angel, his goddess. If the anime just ended with the first episode, he would forever stay a whiny, delusional idiot beyond salvation. However, thanks to his relation to Saeki and Sawa Nakamura, the third main character, he discovers a thing or two about himself.Sawa Nakamura is the avatar of change. She flouts basic conventions and values of society. She has the role of a catalyst. Without her, wimpy Kasuga would never dare to stand for what he believes or even openly voice his thoughts. Nanako Saeki, the last main character, has her enigmatic side as well. Together these three undergo an experience they wouldn’t do if they were alone.The art style is not beautiful. It adds realistic features to character designs which naturally make them uglier. But more facial details enrich the characters’ emotional reactions. The background is also more detailed. Realistic details, such as cracks, and other imperfections of the real world emphasize the desire to break free from everyday life.I watched Aku no Hana because a friend said it was deep. Actually, there’s nothing deep about it. What moved me in the end was how it honestly tries to face the dissatisfaction with our everyday life. It tries to find a way out, something better. But it does not find any meaningful solution. Avoiding ordinary everyday life doesn’t necessarily translate into a better life experience. Characters struggle to reach beyond the mundane but beyond does not promise a tangible alternative. Nevertheless Aku no Hana offers a great perspective to reflect on our everyday lives. That is why rather than enjoyment I felt uneasiness when watching. The anime was constantly attacking individuals’ beliefs that they are unique.

So what happens when the most anti-moe anime ever comes up? People complain about it. Sigh.Aku no Hana tells the tale of an ordinary high school student named Kasuga, who likes to read this book by some French poet called the Flowers of Evil. (Aku no Hana means the Flowers of Evil, by the way) He has a crush on his fellow student, Saeki. One day, while going to his school after class to pick up something he forgot, he sees Saeki's gym...clothes and decides to take them home. The next day at school, everyone is gossiping about how a pervert stole Saeki's gym clothes. No one should know it's Kasuga, however, a girl called Nakamura happened to see it. Nakamura happens to be a very twisted girl, and decides to blackmail Kasuga and torturing him mentally in several ways.Let's begin with the most infamous part of Aku no Hana- The animation. You see, Aku no Hana used this technique called rotoscopping, which means that you film real actors and just draw over them. Apparently, rotoscopping is cheap. That might be true, but it looks freakin' awesome. Everyone, for once, looks Japanese. The characters are in near constant movement, something not even some other anime with great animation can claim. The unique look greatly adds to the disturbing nature of the show. Also, the style allows them to do some rather neat camera angels that give the anime it's own unique style.  And even if you claim the animation style is so called ugly, you cannot deny how realistic the backgrounds look.Now, the story. One thing that always confuses me about the complaints this show gets is that people say that it's slow-paced. Even the people who like it say that it's slow-paced. It's true that there's no action scene every episode or something, but this show is far from slow-paced! It might be one of the best paced anime that I've seen. It uses every scene to increase the amount of tension in the show and add to the disturbing feel of it. And that is what Aku no Hana does best, disturb you. It's not a horror and has no horror elements to it, but just the way it plays with the characters' emotions. You never know exactly what is going on in any of the characters' minds during it. You just can't look away while watching it.The characters of Aku no Hana are another strong point. While they do have a habit of acting like idiots sometimes, especially near the ending of the show, they're just so fleshed out, and you find yourself sympathizing with even the insane Nakamura. Kasuga is perhaps one of the best characters made for the sole purpose of getting the audience to so called “connect” with them. While it's true that he doesn't have that much of a personality (which kind of comes into play in later episodes) he actually reacts realistically to the situations around him. He's not overwhelming dull like a lot of other male protagonists like him due to the situations he is placed in. Nakamura is the other main character, who can best be called an insane perverted freak. She blackmails Kasuga more or less just because she's bored with the world around her, and just wants some fun. She's really fleshed out throughout the show, and despite the terrible things she does to Kasuga, she's still a rather sympathetic character. I was never sure whether to like her or hate her during the show. She's certaintly interesting.Aku no Hana also has perhaps one of the best anime soundtracks ever. It's a very haunting soundtrack, and there's many moments of silence  in the show where it plays, giving it a chance to really stand out. And the ending theme, oh my god do I love the ending them of this. It's probably my favorite anime ending theme. It has this really unique sound to it (it more or less has the same idea as Vocaloid, expect it's much more scarier and actually sounds good) and has a habit of starting about 30 seconds before the actual episode, where the most disturbing event tends to happen, and it just sends chills down your spine whenever the song starts. The openings are also interesting too. The main characters take turns singing it, and while they cannot sing at all, the lyrics do give you insight on their personalities.Aku no Hana is a deconstruction of the romance genre. It takes apart the tropes in this drama and subtly tears them apart. While I wouldn't call it realistic, it is a breath of fresh air. Unique in every way possible, while it's not perfect (it doesn't really have an ending, and while it wasn't the worst selling show of the season it was airing in, I do think we can all agree that the same day this gets a season 2 is the same day where the third Puella movie only sells 500 copies), it is still awesome, and a must-watch. I give it 9 stars. clothes and decides to take them home. The next day at school, everyone is gossiping about how a pervert stole Saeki's gym clothes. No one should know it's Kasuga, however, a girl called Nakamura happened to see it. Nakamura happens to be a very twisted girl, and decides to blackmail Kasuga and torturing him mentally in several ways.Let's begin with the most infamous part of Aku no Hana- The animation. You see, Aku no Hana used this technique called rotoscopping, which means that you film real actors and just draw over them. Apparently, rotoscopping is cheap. That might be true, but it looks freakin' awesome. Everyone, for once, looks Japanese. The characters are in near constant movement, something not even some other anime with great animation can claim. The unique look greatly adds to the disturbing nature of the show. Also, the style allows them to do some rather neat camera angels that give the anime it's own unique style.  And even if you claim the animation style is so called ugly, you cannot deny how realistic the backgrounds look.Now, the story. One thing that always confuses me about the complaints this show gets is that people say that it's slow-paced. Even the people who like it say that it's slow-paced. It's true that there's no action scene every episode or something, but this show is far from slow-paced! It might be one of the best paced anime that I've seen. It uses every scene to increase the amount of tension in the show and add to the disturbing feel of it. And that is what Aku no Hana does best, disturb you. It's not a horror and has no horror elements to it, but just the way it plays with the characters' emotions. You never know exactly what is going on in any of the characters' minds during it. You just can't look away while watching it.The characters of Aku no Hana are another strong point. While they do have a habit of acting like idiots sometimes, especially near the ending of the show, they're just so fleshed out, and you find yourself sympathizing with even the insane Nakamura. Kasuga is perhaps one of the best characters made for the sole purpose of getting the audience to so called “connect” with them. While it's true that he doesn't have that much of a personality (which kind of comes into play in later episodes) he actually reacts realistically to the situations around him. He's not overwhelming dull like a lot of other male protagonists like him due to the situations he is placed in. Nakamura is the other main character, who can best be called an insane perverted freak. She blackmails Kasuga more or less just because she's bored with the world around her, and just wants some fun. She's really fleshed out throughout the show, and despite the terrible things she does to Kasuga, she's still a rather sympathetic character. I was never sure whether to like her or hate her during the show. She's certaintly interesting.Aku no Hana also has perhaps one of the best anime soundtracks ever. It's a very haunting soundtrack, and there's many moments of silence  in the show where it plays, giving it a chance to really stand out. And the ending theme, oh my god do I love the ending them of this. It's probably my favorite anime ending theme. It has this really unique sound to it (it more or less has the same idea as Vocaloid, expect it's much more scarier and actually sounds good) and has a habit of starting about 30 seconds before the actual episode, where the most disturbing event tends to happen, and it just sends chills down your spine whenever the song starts. The openings are also interesting too. The main characters take turns singing it, and while they cannot sing at all, the lyrics do give you insight on their personalities.Aku no Hana is a deconstruction of the romance genre.

But if originality is used poorly, it could lead to a failure of a masterpiece. Aku no Hana,unluckily, is one of those who did not manage to use its originality well.Story:4/10The story of Aku no Hana is one that most people can relate to: it is about a person who committed a sin and living with it for the rest of his life. This,however, does not say that Aku no Hana is relatable. The sin that the main character...committed is stealing his crush's gym clothes and the regretting it. This already make it hard to relate to. And what more, throughout the show, we were constantly reminded that the main character is a 'deviant' or 'pervert' and that puts us off the thought of relating us to him as we do not want to be called a 'deviant' or a 'hentai' whether we are one or not.The anime also loses its intention of being a dark anime to a more romance-centic anime, but it would be fine if they forgot the dark theme altogether, but they didn't, throughout the romance scenes, you would still have this uncomfortableness and sinisterness around you, even when it is totally unnecessary and ruins the mood.The general plot goes like this:Our main male character, the one who committed the sin, was blackmailed by a girl who saw him committing the sin. And the male protagonist hate her for blackmailing him and resents her, wanting a way out of her torment.Okay, so far so good, everything feels dark and sinister.*MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT*Then the male protagonist starts to develop feelings for the sadistic girl who was making him do all sorts of perverted actions and verbally abusing not only him, but his crush as well. The male protagonist then realises that he need to abandon his crush for the sadistic girl and admits all the verbal abuse such as 'deviant' or 'pervert' and starts to live with it. Accepting it as a part of his life....What...The...F.....So the plot is about a guy who gets released from his sin by accepting his personality as a masochist, enjoying being tormented and bullied.This is why originality should be contained.Art: 4/10This is where the originality also failed. After seeing the rotoscoping used in this anime, I thought to myself 'Could they have just used a normal anime style?'. The answer that came to me was 'No'. But that is not to say that rotoscoping is allowed. Normal anime style does not mix with the dark tone that the director tried to express. However, they turned to rotoscope, a time-consuming technique, for a anime series that lasted for 13 episode. There are many places that the art style just felt out of place and blurry and chaotic when it shouldn't be. And when it should be chaotic with fluid movement, due to the limitations of rotoscopes and time, the animation seems to be frozen or 'lagging'.The art did intrigue me for the first two episodes but without a good plot, the art seems to fail as well.Sound:8/10This is the only place where Aku no Hana deserve a praise, its opening is catchy and I often find myself humming it and the ending is genuinely creepy and sinister- just like the show intended to be. When the ending came up in the first episode, it immediately had me crawling in to a ball. Because it just have that same dark tone and evil sound to it as the scene that the anime was trying to cover. But then due to the anime lacking consistency in its romance and dark plots, some episodes the song ruins the romance mood or the song just loses its purpose at all.Character: 3/10*Yet another spoiler alert*Let me make a tick list of the characters and their personalities:A masochistic male who abandons his love for a person who will abuse him for the rest of his life? Check.A anti-social, sadistic female who acts like a thug but says philosophical things that only the male protagonist understands? Check.An all-good female who had her sports bag stolen from her by a person who had a crush on her. But then comes to terms to love him and forgive him ONLY to be ditched in the last second by some thug that treats your boyfriend badly? Check.The show does not follow the common logic at all. The male protagonist could have escaped the chains of torment that the sadist girl had on him on several places but instead, he succumbs to the torture and abandons the crush.Overall:4/10Don't get me wrong, although some people praise this as a masterpiece for its originality, I just think that people shouldn't over look other things and let originality cloud their judgement. committed is stealing his crush's gym clothes and the regretting it.

It doesn't get enough recognition even though it could easily be called a masterpiece. It's definitely not an anime for all audiences, if you're a happy-go-lucky person who has never really experienced mental illness or turmoil, I can almost guarantee you will not understand it. But if you have struggled with depression, insecurities, dysphoria, etc. chances are you will relate heavily to the main character and perhaps the other characters in the anime.Aku no Hana is one of those anime I can confidently say changed the way I see the world. It was an emotional roller...coaster and I could identify with many of the characters. Basically, it's is a slice of life anime, if you will, but with a psychological twist. Manipulation, depression, insecurity, and deception are major themes in Aku no Hana.  I found myself feeling pretty down in the dumps while watching it, but for me that was a sign of how incredibly immersive and realistic it was. Many scenes in Aku no Hana are moving and the type that you will probably remember vividly in 20 years.The animation was, to me, beautiful in a million ways. The animators used rotoscoping techniques, which means they hired actors to portray the main characters and filmed them, then traced over the live action film to make the anime. Many people disagree with this choice and the fact that they chose to make the characters so simplistic, but I personally enjoyed every second of it. I think the fact that the characters were so simplistic yet conveyed so much emotion is amazing. One of the main characters, Nakamura, was especially animated and every facial expression and action from her is a visual treat. I also have to give a shout to the director/storyboard artist/camera man? because the choice in camera angles is spectacular.This review is already much longer than I planned, but I guess that's a sign that I have a lot of good things to say about the series.TL;DR In my opinion, Aku no Hana is, in the most literal sense, an outstanding anime. If you're into fast-paced action sequences this...is definitely not the anime for you. But if you're into surreal, unsettling fiction, and unique animation, I highly recommend it. coaster and I could identify with many of the characters.

What does it mean to truly say something you think without taking the opinions of your surroundings into account?Tackling heavy themes, especially in a school setting, requires extreme care and delicate writing in order to fully capture these themes within the nature of the average teenager that can often be characterized as moody, unpredictable and unstable. Aku no Hana tries to present its dark themes through playing with the regular archetypes of a calm and collected main character simply seeking normality, an outcast girl with an unexplainable interest in him and the nice popular girl. Aku...no Hana introduces these 3 types in its 3 main characters; Kasuga, Nakamura and Saeki. Upon establishing the groundwork for the characters, Aku no Hana abolishes them completely, showcasing the flaws within each of these characters and it does so in a fairly normal manner with an intriguing twist which sets the groundwork for later character interactions. With the first few episodes presenting interesting themes and the dark groundwork being set decently, Aku no Hana unfortunately flopped later on.Handling character interactions within a school setting and adding onto the delicate themes that need further exploring but also leaving enough room for the characters to get explored is a difficult task. Aku no Hana fails in doing most of these, leaving only a very lackluster amount of its core themes to be explored and fully dove into by the show. The characters are stagnant for most of the series without any exploration of them whatsoever. This only works in Nakamura’s case since she was made to be a mystery and an enigma to both the audience and Kasuga, putting further emphasis on her archetype. While that does work with Nakamura, the lack of exploration and development heavily hurts Saeki’s and Kasuga’s character, leaving them to be empty characters with futile attempts to add to their personalities. In Kasuga’s case, his character is attempted to be put into the show through literature and some deeper meaning which does not really exist in the show. All it does is put further emphasis on Kasuga altering his archetype with him not fundamentally understanding the literature he is reading.Kasuga and Saeki have such a mind boggling relationship. It is not really a romance but more so a random thing they decided to start. It is not explored at all throughout the show. All the screentime their relationship and dynamic got were the 2 dates and one house visit they did together. Apart from that, it was nothing more than just a plotpoint which existed for no real reason other than to slow the pacing of the already slow adaptation even more. While it did have potential in the way of putting emphasis on their flaws and overcoming them together or bringing out the dark in each other, it ended up just doing nothing. The show had slow pacing for most of its run time, yet the only part where it truly needed to slow things down and thoroughly explain the deepness of the relationships and the interactions between Saeki and Kasugya, was rushed to the point of it feeling like a random 2 date thing where they did it for fun and not for any sort of attraction towards each other.Aku no Hana portrays normality as a bad thing. A character having a skewed view on the concept of normality and what it means to be normal is fine, as long as that view is brought to light as a genuine flaw and not used as a way to bring out the core theme of the show. Aku no Hana repeatedly presents normality as the worst thing a human can be. With Kasuga’s main theme being his desperate attempts at being special but ultimately being like everyone else and him truly reaching uniqueness through finding himself within Nakamura whilst Nakamura sees the unique in Kasuga and repeatedly attempts to bring it out. This dynamic works simply because of the wrong message the show is trying to send. Normality is fine and should be viewed as such.Aku no Hana tries way too hard to be scary. The tone of the show is amazing and portrays how bizarre Kasuga’s and Nakamura’s relationship truly is and it repeatedly manages to put emphasis on the dark side of humans and how flawed our mentality truly is. The atmosphere it sets up, however, fails miserably at following up the tone. With repeated sound effects mimicking a heartbeat, breathing and sweat dropping all comically failing in enhancing the horror aspect of the show, instead just making the scenes feel awkward instead of genuinely creepy like it should have stayed at. Genuine fear is incredibly difficult to showcase, especially within animation and should not be attempted without full focus being put on it. Aku no Hana attempted to enhance the importance of scenes with the atmosphere it sets but it ends up doing nothing.The animation and art are neither good nor bad. The whole show is done in rotoscope, which is actual actors getting animated, including their mouth movements. The backgrounds are absolutely gorgeous with insane attention to detail within them as well as the music. The music uses subtle noises and tones which serve not to grab the viewer’s attention but to enhance the viewing experience without the viewer even noticing and it does what it intends to do with insane precision and care.With all of the bad things about Aku no Hana and its characters, the final scene of the show might be one of the best climaxes in animation. With the core themes of rejecting normality and having truly free will, the final scene of the show brings out these themes to their fullest and encapsulates everything Aku no Hana had tried to accomplish in its whole run time. What could have been as amazing as the final scene was, Aku no Hana feels disappointing to look at. It is experimental with both its visual and story aspects which it deserves credit for, but those aspects were not utilized to their full potential. At the end of the day, while it is not entirely bad, Aku no Hana feels like a failed experiment that was meant to achieve great things but fell flat with its weak character writing and the story direction.To articulate a thought is to truly be free. no Hana introduces these 3 types in its 3 main characters; Kasuga, Nakamura and Saeki.

Which one of the two sides arguing against each other is right?Story: The story of Aku no Hana takes place in Japan and revolves around Kasuga Takao, a quite normal boy, who goes to school, loves books (especially Baudelaire\'s ""Aku no Hana"") and has a crush on what is supposed to be the beauty of the class. One day he finds her sport clothes as he wants to get the book he accidentally...forgot in the classroom. He takes them out and hears a sound. In the hurry he just takes them and leaves quickly. Later on the psycho child of the class, being Nakamura Sawa tells him she saw him stealing the clothes. From then on she makes him do things that...well are kind of awkward.The whole story is really well executed and as far as I know follows the Manga quite well (didn\'t read it). It is really enjoyable to watch and it keeps unfolding in directions that the viewer doesn\'t expect to go to. It was a good story, but no masterpiece!8/10Characters: The characters are the shining point of the show. Even though the only ones that get any focus at all are the three main characters that everything revolves around, they are that good developed that that is no problem at all!Kasuga Takao seems to be one of the most normal students we\'ve seen in a while in Anime. He likes books, has a crush on a girl and doesn\'t have any powers or things he is really good in. That is until he gets seen by Nakamura stealing the clothes and his life gets more and more messed up, just as his mind.Nakamura Sawa is a psycho. That\'s what everyone agrees upon. But it is a kind of psycho, that seems more pleasant than the ""I\'ll kill you all"" type, and rather is someone that is claims himself to be a deviant and searches for people that are the same as she is.Saeki Nanako is the girl Kasuga has a crush on. She is a kind and good looking girl. I am not gonna talk a lot about her since I\'d just end up spoiling.One must be said: The characters aren\'t likeable at all! It is hard to really like them, but that is the point the series wants you to be in. It\'s a point were you can look down on the show from a spot a lot higher, which makes every single character a lot more human and makes their built up incredibly well done.10/10Art: Well....the first thing that comes to your mind while watching Aku no Hana is the character design, which looks to say it in a polite way different. It is not a bad thing to make them look this way, since it is just another point that makes you feel more distant to the characters. The point were the art fails is the animation itself. The characters suffer from either to much movement at the same time and you just can\'t seem to concentrate because the characters look as if they would tremble without a reason or they don\'t move at all. The amount of still screens in this show is incredibly high and makes the show feel as if it was something based on an incredibly low budget, which it probably is. Later on the Animation gets a lot better but still not good enough to make up for what they did within the first episodes, which makes the enjoyment go down by far and the hate level rise in the same way.4/10Sound: The Soundtrack of Aku no Hana is incredibly simple. It mostly consists of tones getting louder and louder which creates a suspense that really fits the show as something dark and awkward. Aku no Hana has one of the most memorable endings ever created. A song only sung by a computer voice singing about the flowers of evil definitely is really creepy and fits the whole show really well. Just as the 4 Openings do. Every single one of them is weird in it\'s own way but still it fits the show so well that by now I really enjoy hearing them on their own. The voiceacting is nothing that really stands out. While it definitely is not horrible, it is nothing I do love.8/10Enjoyment: I have no idea how to score this...honestly! This show is nothing you will enjoy! However it is something that makes you want to shut down your browser and never open it again. At parts I couldn\'t watch an episode in a single sitting, but had to constantly pause it to calm down a bit, since my nerves were blank, but this is what makes this show so good!9/10Aku no Hana is not a show everyone will enjoy, that is for sure. It is hard to watch and if you aren\'t into thrillers or that kind of stuff you really should stay away from this, but if you like them or if it even interests you a little, go watch this and make your own picture of it.Overall: 8/10 forgot in the classroom.

Later on the Animation gets a lot better but still not good enough to make up for what they did within the first episodes, which makes the enjoyment go down by far and the hate level rise in the same way.4/10Sound: The Soundtrack of Aku no Hana is incredibly simple. It mostly consists of tones getting louder and louder which creates a suspense that really fits the show as something dark and awkward. Aku no Hana has one of the most memorable endings ever created. A song only sung by a computer voice singing about the flowers of evil definitely is really creepy and fits the whole show really well. Just as the 4 Openings do. Every single one of them is weird in it\'s own way but still it fits the show so well that by now I really enjoy hearing them on their own. The voiceacting is nothing that really stands out. While it definitely is not horrible, it is nothing I do love.8/10Enjoyment: I have no idea how to score this...honestly! This show is nothing you will enjoy! However it is something that makes you want to shut down your browser and never open it again. At parts I couldn\'t watch an episode in a single sitting, but had to constantly pause it to calm down a bit, since my nerves were blank, but this is what makes this show so good!9/10Aku no Hana is not a show everyone will enjoy, that is for sure. It is hard to watch and if you aren\'t into thrillers or that kind of stuff you really should stay away from this, but if you like them or if it even interests you a little, go watch this and make your own picture of it.Overall: 8/10', 'It is sad (if unsurprising) that this little gem is getting mixed reviews.Ultimately, I find this show beautiful, exhilarating, funny and tragic at the same time. So I\'m finding it difficult to answer the amorphous mass of misguided criticism that this is receiving.I wrote in my first review that this is a show about puberty. As such I found it furiously amusing. It is also a show about existentialism. Existentialism, however, needn\'t be philosophy. It could be…(spoilers, any?)...a red haired girl with glasses, screaming, howling, devoured by an insatiable urge to project her fantasies onto the dull frame of a quiet, provincial town.Now, if you...don\'t see how this connects with existentialism, or why, or think that \'being a deviant\' is a shallow, relative concept (relative to what? as if social norms weren\'t choke-full with universals), suit yourself.On the whole, anime is a very codified genre. It is subculture, not anarchy: so, if you haven\'t got it yet, I\'ll spell it out for you: Aku no Hana is atypical.Some label this \'psychological horror\'. Well, yes and no. It does have more than a fair share of cringe moments but not the kind of psychological horror found in Lovecraft or Poe. The emphatic, heavy, atmospheric effects of Aku no Hana partake more of psychological tragi-comedy than psychological horror.The witty, original soundtrack provides good support for this.The plot follows like a music score. Full of understatements maybe, but nothing illogical.One reviewer wrote ""I apologize this wasn\'t moe enough for you"". So much for rotoscoping. The effect is jarring at first, but I\'ll still encourage you to give it another try. I found that it grew on me as the show progressed, as it manages to capture emotions in a creative, uniquely original way.I\'ll have a hard time convincing a purist anime audience that this is a masterpiece. So I\'ll just say this: if the screenshots don\'t put you off watch the first 5 minutes of ep 1. Thanks. don\'t see how this connects with existentialism, or why, or think that \'being a deviant\' is a shallow, relative concept (relative to what? as if social norms weren\'t choke-full with universals), suit yourself.On the whole, anime is a very codified genre.

An anime that's worth of getting the lowest score possible 1/10. The so called underrated unsettling anime masterpiece that is Aku no Hana. This is probably going to contain small spoilers, but they won't really impact your viewing pleasure since there won't be any.I'm gonna start by talking about what everyone seems to talk about and that's the animation. The anime uses rotoscoping for its characters and honestly, it may look weird on moments with their movement and lip-synch being pretty wack, but in general it was pretty good and watchable. The artwork...of the backgrounds is much better thought, but I don't wanna stick much to the way it looks since it's the least of the problems this anime has.Now, I have not read the manga, but I can only assume that if the plot is close to what it is in the anime that I would also not like it. Our story follows three characters, out of which I can't really decide which one is the dumbest. Our hero, Takao, steals the gym clothes of a girl he likes, and Nakamura, the other weird girl from the class sees him do it, of course. That's the first point I want to address, the plot is so unbelievable with all the convenient things that happen. Nakamura is literally everywhere, she always accidentally stumbles upon Takao where ever he is. She is able to overpower him in seconds, take off his clothes on multiple occasions, make him do all sorts of things that he has no reason for doing. The same happens with Saeki, the other girl, as she also just happens to perfectly appear when the plot needs her to appear.So, Takao stole the clothes. Okay, you would expect he feels a bit guilty, but he goes on a rant that he shall atone for his sins for the rest of his life. They try to make this one little act appear so much bigger, almost as if he raped or murdered someone. He then follows it by literally creating non existent problems. Whatever crazy thing Nakamura says, he does it. He then somehow ends up in a relationship with Saeki, which is probably the most non sensical thing ever, it is never developed, the just randomly throw them in a relationship and expect us to believe all that and the things that Nakamura does. For the first 7 or so episodes we have the same pattern over and over again. Takao talks about Saeki being his angel, something happens in their non existential relationship, Nakamura appears randomly, tells Takao ooh you're a hentai just like me, he says that he isn't, throws in some random Baudelaire crap(yes, I realize that you will be like oooh but he is merely pretending to know Baudelaire, I know, it's still dumb) and just go on to do some of the dumbest and unbelievable sh*t ever.Next, I want to talk about the episodes themselves and the directing of them. The anime really tries to make itself seem much more unsettling than it really is. We had creepy sounds for no reason, we get scenes of literally nothing happening, now that can be good sometimes if the plot actually is unsettling, but not here. For example the 8th episode starts with just our crazy heroes holding hands and walking for the first 9 minutes of the episode. No dialog, nothing. You just have to be like ooh so deep they're so cool. No, it's not deep, it's just edgy, just like most of this anime is.In conclusion, I feel like the author tried to make an actual deep story about regret and shame, but failed miserably. He probably read Ningen Shikkaku and was like oh damn let me make a deep story, but he has no talent so he just made this edgy mess of an anime. No, it wasn't unsettling and hard to watch, it was just cringy and edgy, I can't stress how many times I had to pause the episode and hold my head to how dumb this was. of the backgrounds is much better thought, but I don't wanna stick much to the way it looks since it's the least of the problems this anime has.Now, I have not read the manga, but I can only assume that if the plot is close to what it is in the anime that I would also not like it.

It\'s definitely weird and really far out there, but at the same time it\'s extremely realistic. I would categorize this as a psychological slice of life anime. Pretty weird combination, but this anime is something truly unique. I will go ahead and say this now, alot of people that watch this will probably drop it and say that it sucks, I can\'t really blame you for that. This anime isn\'t meant to be watched by everyone, it appeals to a certain, specific audience that doesn\'t have many people in it....Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but don\'t talk about something you know nothing about.Story- The story and characters are what make this anime. The basis of the story isn\'t anything spectacular, anyone could come up with the idea of someone with social issues that\'s a pervert and he has to deal with that while dealing with two different girls. What makes the story in aku no hana unique though it what it does with that basis and how it manipulates that basis and makes it into something that is truly unique. It sounds like a typical harem anime, but it\'s definitely not. It fits the description of psychological alot better. The story is a very slow burning one, the entire anime takes place in just under two months or so, there are 5 and 10 minute scenes of people just walking down the road, but it\'s alot more than that. It\'s slow burning, but very well paced.You don\'t ever feel like you\'re missing out on any information or that anything is being skipped, everything seems to just fall in place. It might be a little extreme or weird at certain points in the story, but that\'s what it\'s about. It\'s about someone that is weird, someone that is a social outcast, it\'s about his journey to becoming a normal person, or so that\'s how it seems. For an anime with such a simple theme it has quite a few twists and turns and I was always wondering what was going to happen next. It honestly surprised me because I thought it would be straightforward and rather boring. It\'s a fantastic story, my only complaint about it would be that it does have a semi-cliffhanger to it, but it\'s implied at the end that there is going to be a second season, or ""Part 2"".Art- The art for this anime is a tricky one. On one hand it\'s a very unique and interesting art style that I personally love, on the other hand there are some parts where they\'re talking and the lip syncing isn\'t exactly right, or they\'re talking and they have no face.  This might have been something intentional, but I don\'t really like it. It\'s still a very unique art style though, some people will love it, and some will hate it.Sound- For me the sound was tricky aswell. I liked the intro songs themselves, but they feel out of place for the tone of the anime. It brought me out of that immersion everytime it played and wasn\'t really fitted for the anime in my opinion. The ending songs were amazing though. It\'s a very creepy and fitting song for the anime, one of the best ending songs i\'ve ever heard in fact. As for the ambient sounds and noises they are spot on aswell. It gives the anime a very creepy undertone and really adds to the mood.Character- The characters and story are the best things about aku no hana. There are 3 main characters, all of which are really well designed. Kasuga considers himself someone that is unique and almost looks down upon other people for not understand what he understands. In a way he is a bit arrogant. He is also a social outcast, he only has a few friends, which they don\'t seem that close to begin with, but everything changes when he\'s caught sniffing a girls gym uniform. The girls uniform he was sniffing is saekis.She\'s another main character. She\'s a bit of your stereotypical popular girl, except that she\'s never had a boyfriend and is also unique in her own ways. The last and final main character is nanako. She is the one that catches kasuga sniffing saekis gym clothes. She\'s a pervert and outcast, she also causes alot of trouble around school. She\'s in the same boat as kasuga. She\'s extremely weird, but her side of the story goes alot deeper beyond just being weird. They all have great interactions with each other, whether it be good or bad. I personally think that they are all fantastically designed characters.Enjoyment- They enjoyment part is something that\'s tough. Personally I really enjoyed it. I was enthralled by the story and atmosphere of it all, I was always wanting to know what was going to happen next. At the same time I can easily see a ton of people not enjoying it, or even finishing it. It\'s something that you will just have to try and see if you like, hopefully my review helps you decide whether or not it\'s something that you will enjoy or not.Overall- Overall I think this is a spectacular anime. Just because alot of people don\'t like it doesn\'t mean that it\'s a bad anime and vice versa. Fundamentally it is a very well designed anime that I don\'t think deserves to be this low on the rankings. It\'s understandable why it is this low, it still doesn\'t deserve it though. If you\'re someone that enjoys very artistic animes or just artistic stuff in general I can recommend this to you. If you\'re anyone else I can\'t recommend this to you. It\'s a tough anime to write about simply because of the way it is, but I think it\'s something worth writing and talking about, it\'s a fantastic anime.

One day she leaves behind her gym clothes, Takao takes them without a moments thought, the following day the rumour around school is a ""pervert"" stole Saeki Nanako gym clothes, Takao is nervous because if she finds out he stole them, the goal he wants to be loved by will hate him. But if he destroys the clothes no one will know? well he thinks that until another girl in his class Nakamura Sawa saw him.Overall, the Story is good,...My slight issue is that after this initial plot it doesn\'t really evolve much and simply relies on the relationship(s) between the character(s) to pull Aku No Hana to the end.Art: (6)Backdrops in this series are really nice i have to say that first because the next is a very debatable topic, one that doesn\'t house a right answer, one that is subjective and thus creates issues.The style behind Aku No Hana is done via ""rotoscoping"" This method pretty much is drawing over a real life film. The problem is there is far too many times it feels rather patchy and not that great, For example the distancing till when someone has features, Some key scenes lack any facial features which simply shouldn\'t happen. secondly at points when the characters are running or quick movement the animations feel laggy which felt sloppy.Last negative is that the Art Style as it\'s being drawn or animated over Real Life people they carry the proportions of that, issue with doing this is characters are more rounded and look ""Fatter"" this can be rather worrying if you\'re fan of the manga because key characters don\'t look right, For example  one of the main characters Saeki looks fatter and less attractive than what she does in the manga.Overall, The art will usually be something you love or loathe, for me it\'s in the middle, i can understand the ""Strange"" vibe it gave the series but i simply don\'t think it was worth the risk.Sound: (8)Always a tough category to mark, The OP/ED Are good enough i\'m paticually a fan of the outro to ED they use for every episode, really fit the strange and crazy vibe this series has. The voices are really suiting to who they represent, Saeki having a delicate, cute voice and Nakamura having a harsh and scratchy tone.Character (8)Nakamura Sawa - She is the driving force the catalyst for this series, An Incredibly strange individual who during the course of the series just intensifies her behavior, My overall view is she is looking for someone like her, completely odd, crazy, a deviant. She believes Takao is one, the way she manipulates and blackmails him is tough to watch, but what makes her the person you tend to fear at points rather than love.Kasuga Takao - His character development is huge, As many people say ""Never trust the quiet ones"" and this quite resides in Takao, At first shy and what you can see from their on out is how his relationship (s) change and shape him, maybe some may say releases a side of him no one has seen, one he has kept hidden until the right person/people come along who he trusts to show it to.Saeki Nanako - Her development is good too  watch too, Takao puts her up on this peddle-stall and the side he see\'s is the ever loving/caring side who she truly is, But during the series you see that demeanor change slightly, she bares the stresses and strains a grown up relationship can create, it effects her and this is shown rather well during the later parts of the series.Overall, the development of the characters is what makes this series progress, after the initial story not much happens and the characters have to drag Aku No Hana to the finishing line of 13 Episodes.Kasuga Takao and Saeki Nanako arc nearer the end really didn\'t make any sense and brought this section\'s ratings down a bit.Enjoyment (2) During (8) AfterWhy have i given 2 scores? Well Aku No Hana is one of the most intense, strange series i have watched this resorted in many nervous episodes where it was at times painful to view what was happening, I\'ve not had that feeling where i really didn\'t enjoy it while watching because of how tense and tough to watch it was, but after it\'s done and i had time to reflect that\'s when you see the great side to the show.So what i\'ve done is - the during and after to get the final score of 6, It\'s tough viewing don\'t get me wrong but it\'s rather enjoyable is a strange way as well.OverallAku No Hana as my header described as ""Something so painful shouldn\'t be enjoyable"" this term sums up this show perfectly, Each episode was incredibly tough to view, Tense,Nervous,Fear were a handful of feelings i felt during the season, But on the flip side it was enjoyable, Kinda of like how Horror films are scary and we hate being scared, but for something to be able to MAKE us scared we appreciate the series/film for that. Aku no Hana is the same for me.As mentioned in the story, it does feel like it lacked a direction, the pacing at times were slow to show off the rotoscoping scenes which in my eyes were a mixed bag. The character development was great but on the other hand what happened between them didn\'t make sense in many places and even frustrated me (How Takao treats Saeki) really annoyed me, and all these negatives i have said during the review does leave a sour taste in my mouth over Aku No Hana..... It\'s something i know annoyed me, made it sometimes tough to even view, but i appreciated the series, It\'s far from being perfect but it\'s good in my eyes and worth your time watching.The end hints at ""End Of Season One"" so that would suggest there will be a S2, I Hope this is the case because i feel the series needs it with how it finished S1. My slight issue is that after this initial plot it doesn\'t really evolve much and simply relies on the relationship(s) between the character(s) to pull Aku No Hana to the end.Art: (6)Backdrops in this series are really nice i have to say that first because the next is a very debatable topic, one that doesn\'t house a right answer, one that is subjective and thus creates issues.The style behind Aku No Hana is done via ""rotoscoping"" This method pretty much is drawing over a real life film.

I am usually rating way lower then most of the rating, however I do find the average rating of this Anime to be low.Yes, it is a 5. But it is a strong 5 and would very likely become a 6 someday. This means that It is better then some of your more celebrated shows, like Accel world, Angel Beats, Guilty Crown, Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, Sacred Seven.so now you might be wondering why am I award a Five, right? as usual, I am going to defend my rating and my POV, with SPOILERS...ALERT.for me, the biggest flaw of the show lies in a few aspect. First and foremost, the art. I am not happy about the art not ONLY because it is horrifyingly bad, but also how unnecessary the producer would think their gimmicky ""revolutionizing"" ideas would pay off. It still amazes me that how someone would think these gimmicky ideas would sale, especially nowadays, you have got to have MOE, HAREM or some FIERCE FIGHT to sale (peaking at Sword Art Online). Playing Gimmicky doesn\'t and would NEVER work.besides the Gimmicks, the still motions of scenes, or the landscapes are actually AMAZING to say the least: In detailed, stylish, realistic and generally unique. The character\'s arts, however, are a complete mess. there are NO shadows when a character had her/his facial expression. It was beyond the level of Unique or even style - it is really unacceptable at times.also, consider how slow pace this show is, it is really hard for me to give the show credits. there are a incredible amount of time that was spend on internal dialogues, Monologues, reading Baudelaire. I am not saying I don\'t like Baudelaire - In fact, I like reading poems. It is just not the right thing to do in an anime like this. Think about this: What would you think if you buy your ticket to watch an hour show, and the actor\'s been reading and reciting Shakespeare\'s sonnets with a mere linkage with the show? if you are not sleeping, congrats. you are a true hipster.so now you\'ve got two things going AGAINST the show. it doesn\'t seem to be a 5 at all, right?My first defend for a 5 is the plot. despite the plot is slow-paced, it really got into the detail thought of the character. it builds some of the more memorable character of the season, and you might be amazed how a total of 3 people can create such an intense drama. It would be easy to sum up their relationship: Nakamura holds the secret of Kasuga. Kasuga Likes Nanako. The secret would blown up the relationship between Nanako and Kasuga and Kasuga\'s doing whatever he can to prevent the leak. I am trying to keep the secret - but I would have to say it is a Naive, or even a silly secret that could have been resolved since the second episode.I am not done with proving my scores yet. I do agree that the plot of this thing is sometimes silly and Naive, but when you add the personality we had into the mix, everything seems to run smoothly. Since Kasuga is always doubting himself and suspecting the others, even though he can get over and handle the secret in many ways, he can\'t: not because he didn\'t, but because he was doubting himself and suspecting the others of knowing the secret. such kinds of ""doubt"" were vastly available upon Kasuga\'s development as a character, and you can find lots of good example showing how he doubts the world and his friends, even Nanako at times.Nakamura could also been summarized as someone that loves to watch drama. she\'s not interest in interferring any of Kasuga\'s business. however, she believes that everyone had hidden their true identity - which was evil behind them. She attempts to ""strip off your mask"" and does actually no harm to the people around her......that is, upon now. Nanako is the simple ""girl-next-door"" kind of character that is an obedient student. she does no harm as well......at least upon the airing of the sixth show. I am NOT trying to suggest anything, \'cause I actually have no idea, just thinking and hoping my predictions would come true.To add on, the Sounds of this show is perhaps not the most thrilling sounds that you\'ve ever got, but it is special. Ambient/Drone/Minimal music were rarely used as anime soundtracks; from what I remember, Lain was one the shows that I watch that used some. still, considering how good this anime complements with the peaceful, sometimes intriguing Drone Sound, would probably be a pleasure to many music fans.further more, their opening and ending is really unique. I am not a fan of the opening track, but I do appreciate they change their lyrics every time they choose a different protagonist to sing. the new lyrics certainly complement and suits the character well. the Ending was actually a real BLAST for me. despite it is Pop, it comes with an arrangement featuring orchestra and Glitch elements on their vocal that these things actually goes well together. The vocals sound so much like a Vocaloid that freaks me out the first time. The auto-tuning only adds to the creepiness of the song, which makes it stands out and unique among the general anime song. It might be somehow inappropriate for me to do a review base on the TV version, but I think these elements should be accurate when the full version\'s out.Consider how special this show is, it might appeal to someone who enjoys dark humor and twisted fantasies. 2ch had a slang called ""独男"" (Dokuo). that means males that were single and can\'t social well with females. such terms were usually equivalent to Low self esteem/Nerd/geek/Virgin, and sometimes Otaku. Understanding that kind of culture will kind of help you to understand and appreciate how interesting and how ""strange"" it is for this show to happen. I am probably one of those ""Dokuo"" and I could only jealously watch the show every week. But well, what can you complain? It\'s a good life, and you\'ve got a show that is great - At least it has some kind of logic and a neat portrait of characters, plot-wise and character-wise.If you are still not convinced, you just can\'t get used to the art, skip it then. It is not that big of a deal. But please, don\'t call this as ""bad"" - this is certain not the all time classics and not one of the year top 5s, but watching and saying ""YES"" to this show is nothing to be ashamed of, since this is not that bad of an anime either. If you still feel like complaining, you\'ve got loads Harem acts waiting for you to get their ass kicked - now MOVE and press ALT+F4.5.5. ALERT.for me, the biggest flaw of the show lies in a few aspect. First and foremost, the art. I am not happy about the art not ONLY because it is horrifyingly bad, but also how unnecessary the producer would think their gimmicky ""revolutionizing"" ideas would pay off.

Because you wont find it in Aku No Hana.So in direct consequence due to how minimal the plot and story are ,there is very little happening in each episode.These 13 episodes could have easily been condensed into around 4-5 episodes without much of a problem and without missing any vital information.What keeps it at 13 episodes is a absolute indecent amount of padding and just wasting the viewers time with very long shots of the scenery,close up of objects and in one case just the 2 main characters simply walking for half a episode.*final episode spoilerAlso in the final episode they even had the nerve to recap what little has already happened that far in the first half of the episode and in the second half to show previews of ""things to expect"" in the second season,which to this day has yet to be announced because of its bad reception and lack of sales.The studio actually animated some short scenes/moments from the second half and were cocky enough they would get a green light for of this abomination.Well to our luck we were sparred of this second season so far.CHARACTERSAnd here we go right into the belly of the beast,all the characters are completely unlikable and simply a pain to have to endure watching.While i did hear that\'s what the producers were going for it still doesn\'t excuse how undeveloped they are and just how things happen because the plot dictated that way not because of the characters motivation.Starting off with Mr Personality himself :Kasuga Takao.

The realism and the tension that is constantly in the atmosphere of this anime is brilliant. The painful awkwardness of the character Kasuga and the weird behaviour of Nakamura I really liked. Their very different behaviours were a good combination along with the other main character Saeki who gives off what is seemingly a normal and innocent vibe.Yes, there are scenes that are a few minutes long which could be cut down...and reduced to only a few seconds long but they would just not have the same effect if they were not real time. It would ruin the strange and tense atmosphere of the anime. It is an anime set in everyday run down, miserable looking town with a very eerie feeling about it. The slowness is a really important part of the setting. However, I admit the slow pacing can be somewhat frustrating at times. It wasn't too bad though. I'm the kind of person who is really fussy when it comes to pacing and it's always one of my biggest complaints about any anime but if someone like me was fine with it then you should be too.The rotoscope animation is actually perfect and aids the psychological element of the anime. It makes it a little more life like in appearance and also much different in appearance compared to the typical anime which Aku no Hana certainly is not. Without the rotoscope the anime wouldn't be the same at all. Those who refuse to watch it because of the 'ugly' animation are childish. You are really missing out on a unique and intriguing anime by rejecting Aku no Hana due to its appearance.The music used is also very different to the average anime soundtrack. It is really quirky and odd like everything else within this anime. Don't be expecting the typical J-pop/rock artist/band kind of songs for the OP and ED. The ED in particular is great but probably not something you would have on you iPod. I loved Aku no Hana's soundtrack though because it adds to the overall eerie feeling the anime gives off.I don't want to spoil anything but I must warn you that this anime can be a little disturbing. Some may find it too weird. It is a psychological anime though! I know Aku no Hana may be an acquired taste but if you are sick of the normal slice of life school romance then check out the great but twisted Aku no Hana.However, if you watch this anime then prepare for an ending that does not resolve anything. The final episode just gives us a glimpse of what is to come to persuade you to go and read the manga. I myself have started to read the manga (the manga is great!) because this anime has left me intrigued. I think it is a real shame that it will most likely never get a second season due to its lack of popularity though.I would recommend Aku no Hana to those who fancy something a little bit different!I originally laughed at the screenshots (Nakamura's derp face and the manly looking girl!) like many others but a week after episode 1 aired I started watching. I expected to hate it but I didn't. I admit it took several episodes to get into but after that I really looked forward to watching it every week. It's definitely one of those anime you should at least check out an episode or two at some point. It taught me not to judge an anime by its animation style immediately.

A theoretically good story doesn\'t promise that the execution of the plot is well done. While the manga got it right, the anime screwed the pooch.Aku no Hana is one of manga fairly decent manga that get an anime adaption so aggressive shitty that it should be filed under as a hate crime. I\'m not even going to harp on the character designs as a sole reason as to why the anime is so bad since there are many other issues, such as pacing, Saeki herself being a mediocre character, and...Nakamura essentially carrying the entire series.The average length of a chapter in the manga is about 35 pages. Even though it\'s almost double the length of your typical manga chapter, you can burn through the three dozen pages at breakneck speeds due to the numerous one-panel pages and stretches of little to no dialog. The anime takes away this quick read and slams the brakes on the pacing. While the urban scenery is beautifully done, it\'s not enough to compensate for NOTHING FUCKING HAPPENING for long stretches of time, which creates a new problem: we are treated to characters who are not named Nakamura for more time. Takao Kasuga\'s inner monologues drone on for ages, taking the feeling of his internal anxieties and turning it into a chore for the viewer to shift through to get to the next scene. For most of the material the anime covers, Saeki functions more as a plot device than an actual character with little to no aura, functioning more as a trophy or an object of desire than a human being. Nakamura, in contrast, has so much stage presence she honestly makes the rest of the cast look  bad in comparison, especially with Ise at the helm, giving an A+ grade performance. With a core cast of a mere three, having one being so unanimously dominant results in a horrible balance where every scene of which she is absent from is torturously boring to sit through.While it\'s not the main reason why this adaption is shit, the animation (or lack thereof) is salt on the wound. As we all know, Zexcs is a shitty studio that has NO FUCKING MONEY WHATSOEVER. When you are a studio that has little budget and capital, the last thing you should do is opt to experiment with an expensive and difficult animation style, like rotoscoping. You know what happens when you try something hard like rotoscoping when you\'re a broke company who makes Godawful shit like Sister Princess, H2O, and Cuticle Tantei Inaba? It looks like GARBAGE. In an animated work that\'s supposed to have a more realistic appearance, characters having no details is inexcusable. A person\'s face can tell you about a lot of what is going through their heads. They can tell stories just from their appearance. There are some words or thoughts that are best conveyed through the face of a person. A show that prides itself on being a more ""serious"" show with an art gimmick should not have faceless characters, or at least have them not look like they have Down\'s while they\'re breaking into a cold sweat, panicing trying to remember what number comes before ""potato"".The animation was already unimpressive in episode one, so to see it get worse as the series went on felt like they were spiting Oshimi by making it look bad on purpose. All of the sensuality and youth of the characters has been castrated in this adaption, replaced by a fifth-finished character details and 16/17 year-olds looking like they\'re hitting their mid-late 20s and suffering from birth defects, breaking atmosphere and immersion in record-setting time thanks to the characters being set against the wonderfully done backgrounds. Rusty bent metal has never looked so pretty. Nice backgrounds are the only thing that the Mushishi director has seemed to carry over into this series, and it\'s not nearly enough to pardon the numerous flaws it has in regards to both the directing and the source material.Aku no Hana could have been one of the crowning gems of 2013, but instead gets treated as a 3rd class citizen and practice grounds for Zexcs failed animation experimentation. On the bright side, the anime bombed, but encouraged people to buy the manga, with hopes that they can filter out this disastrous adaption from their consciousness, resting easy that a season two is out of the question.

Nakamura, in contrast, has so much stage presence she honestly makes the rest of the cast look  bad in comparison, especially with Ise at the helm, giving an A+ grade performance. With a core cast of a mere three, having one being so unanimously dominant results in a horrible balance where every scene of which she is absent from is torturously boring to sit through.While it\'s not the main reason why this adaption is shit, the animation (or lack thereof) is salt on the wound. As we all know, Zexcs is a shitty studio that has NO FUCKING MONEY WHATSOEVER. When you are a studio that has little budget and capital, the last thing you should do is opt to experiment with an expensive and difficult animation style, like rotoscoping. You know what happens when you try something hard like rotoscoping when you\'re a broke company who makes Godawful shit like Sister Princess, H2O, and Cuticle Tantei Inaba? It looks like GARBAGE. In an animated work that\'s supposed to have a more realistic appearance, characters having no details is inexcusable. A person\'s face can tell you about a lot of what is going through their heads. They can tell stories just from their appearance. There are some words or thoughts that are best conveyed through the face of a person. A show that prides itself on being a more ""serious"" show with an art gimmick should not have faceless characters, or at least have them not look like they have Down\'s while they\'re breaking into a cold sweat, panicing trying to remember what number comes before ""potato"".The animation was already unimpressive in episode one, so to see it get worse as the series went on felt like they were spiting Oshimi by making it look bad on purpose. All of the sensuality and youth of the characters has been castrated in this adaption, replaced by a fifth-finished character details and 16/17 year-olds looking like they\'re hitting their mid-late 20s and suffering from birth defects, breaking atmosphere and immersion in record-setting time thanks to the characters being set against the wonderfully done backgrounds. Rusty bent metal has never looked so pretty. Nice backgrounds are the only thing that the Mushishi director has seemed to carry over into this series, and it\'s not nearly enough to pardon the numerous flaws it has in regards to both the directing and the source material.Aku no Hana could have been one of the crowning gems of 2013, but instead gets treated as a 3rd class citizen and practice grounds for Zexcs failed animation experimentation. On the bright side, the anime bombed, but encouraged people to buy the manga, with hopes that they can filter out this disastrous adaption from their consciousness, resting easy that a season two is out of the question.', 'Aku no Hana was the first anime i watched that really made me want to write a review. Why? Thats what im going to try to explain in these 5 categories below.After the 5 main points there will be a SPOILER zone where i will share some thoughts.1.  StoryAku no Hana takes place in a post-industrial japanese town. The main character is a bookworm and especially loves the book ""Flowers of Evil"". He has advanced vocalulary and is in love with a girl from his class - Saeki, to whom he refers to as his muse. One day after school, he impulsively grabs Saeki\'s...gym clothes and runs off, thinking that no-one saw him. However, Nakamura - a quiet careless girl from his class sees him and starts to make plans on how to make the best out of this situation.2. ArtThis is the point where most people will have split opinions. Firstly i want to say that the landscape and backgrounds are AMAZING. Never before have i paused an anime so many times just to look at every frame. The shadows and all the detail are breathtaking. Huge kudos to whoever drew all this. However this also means that many frames are frozen, with only the characters moving - i like it since it doesnt give a 3D-feel about the whole thing.The characters are very originally drawn. The anime is almost completely unsexualized and all character faces and proportions are in realistic standards.3. SoundI didn\'t really see any unique sound qualities, just the usual grasshopper chirping. Some scenes in particular have very powerful sound because of the given situation.4. CharacterThis point is pretty hard to go into without spoiling so im going to keep it short and continue on further down. The three main characters Kasuga, Saeki and Nakamura have different personalities. Saeki and Nakamura are contrary to eachother. Saeki is a hardworking student while Nakamura doesnt care about school and is very unpleasant to everyone. Kasuga can be seen as a little of both, and a huge chunk of the story is about that he has to make his mind up about his personality.5. EnjoymentI loved this anime. It\'s definetely in my top 3. Of course this varies for each viewer but that is my opinion.------------SPOILERS-------------I can definetely relate to the characters feelings. Growing up in an post-industrial town, knowing very little about the world outside of it. Just looking at the half-run-down industrial landscape is enough to make one feel depressed.The main character, Kasuga, doesn\'t know what he wants. He goes to school just as everyone else and has a few friends, but from reading western litterature he understands that there is something bigger outside of his town. He is in love with a girl from his class, the top student Saeki who seems as lively social girl with a great life.After getting confronted by Nakamura about the gym clothes that Kasuga stole, she begins to influence him and lets his desires out. This is possible due to Kasuga\'s timid nature with Nakamura being the one in charge. This is where Kasuga starts getting torn between two choices. Either going with Saeko and living a proper life, or going with Nakamura where he doesnt really know what to expect.After going on a date with Saeki, we see a turn in the story. It turns out that Saeki is also in love with Kasuga. Now the only thing that stands between them are the dirty secrets that Kasuga holds from Saeki - and Nakamura since she is a part of them. What Kasuga fails to understand is that love is a strange thing, and that Saeki is willing to accept him despite everything he has done.With Saeki and Kasuga sharing their timid nature, none of them go chasing after eachother leaving Kasuga for Nakamuras infkuences. She makes him go crazy and let all of his feelings out and eventually cultivates the idea they both share - getting out of their town.One day they decide to set off, with their sight on the hill-chain encircling their town. When they finally understand how poorly prepared they were. Saeki, who is chasing after Kasuga eventually finds them and the 3 of them have an argument with Kasuga in the middle. Here Kasuga gets his final chance to decide who he wants to go with, either with Nakamura or Saeki. Things start to become too much for Kasuga and he breaks down, unable to choose.After a while the police comes and picks them up, i think that in the car Kasuga finally understands that what stands in front of him is not a choice anymore. He simply cannot poison Saeki with his foul nature.The ending really puts a cherry on the top of this masterpiece. Kasuga finally  understands the reality of his situation, and with confidence he chases after Nakumura after which he suggests that they find the other side of the hill together, but inside of their own town. This shows great character development from Kasuga\'s side and even though Nakamura doesnt take his words that well it doesnt matter, because he now feels what Saeki felt for him earlier - love. gym clothes and runs off, thinking that no-one saw him. However, Nakamura - a quiet careless girl from his class sees him and starts to make plans on how to make the best out of this situation.2.

And unlike some others, I will be reviewing this anime based on what has been shown, not what is to possibly come... because screw that... why try to review something that hasn\'t even been shown?Now to say the least, Aku no Hana is absolutely one of the most controversial animes of the season for sure. When the first episode was released, I was not even 2 minutes in before realizing this anime was different. As many have seen or even heard, yes this anime is not traditional animation, but rotoscope....This caused huge controversy over whether or not to watch it right off the bat. Even after I saw the rating of a ""4"" that it once had, I said to myself it can\'t be that bad. So I watched the first episode and quit after a few minutes. I thought it was awful looking to be quite honest.But then, about 7 weeks later I wondered how the anime was doing. I looked at the rating and saw it had done better, and so I figured it must have gotten somewhat better. I went back to watch it, saying to myself to at least give it the old 3-episode-rule that I give every other series. I also told myself to just simply look beyond the animation style and look at the story...lol. And so I watched 3 episodes (looking past the rotoscope style, which honestly isn\'t as bad as I thought in the first place) and then all the way until I was caught up to the recently aired episode.I was completely hooked and it was because of these three things:""MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.... I guess. Read the next 3 points at your own risk.""1. Why is Kasuga such a pathetic little piece of trash? He\'s a complete spineless wimp and hardly stands up for himself, ever. He is just a doormat basically.2. Why is Nakamura such a crazy psychotic bitch and why does she give two shits about Kasuga? Honestly...3. Why is Saeki such a fool to even be interested in Kasuga? Again, WHY? It makes little to no sense at all.""SPOILERS END HERE.""These three things kept me interested, and so I kept watching. HOPING to find an answer to all of these 3 questions, or at the very least 1 of them. So then, here I am on the edge of my seat as I am just waiting to find out an answer to one of these questions in the final minutes of the last episode... and then..............................................................Exactly.LOL Get it?In short, this anime was a huge waste of time. For those interested about a more ""in-depth"" review, here it is:ART: The art wasn\'t as bad as they say, it was alright. Also, they could have cut down the pointless walking scenes. Therefore, 6/10.SOUND: The sound was... wait there was sound? Exactly. There were many empty moments with no sound at all to make a ""eery"" feeling to ""engulf the viewer"" as some say. However, I did enjoy two of the opening songs of the four and I still hum them to myself sometimes. The ending theme was... strange. Therefore, 6/10.CHARACTERS: The characters... really, need I say anything? Just refer to my 3 spoiler points if you don\'t care about spoilers. Therefore, 3/10.ENJOYMENT:... eh... probably a 5/10.OVERALL: The overall story, a 4/10.So now it\'s time to end this wonderful review:Basically, I only kept watching Aku no Hana to find out the answers to my 3 questions. But, some of you might still be wondering (if you didn\'t get it), did you ever find out the answers to your questions? Well if that\'s the case, please refer back to the last sentence before a few dots up and think it over. This caused huge controversy over whether or not to watch it right off the bat.

It’s directedby Hiroshi Nagahama (creator of Mushishi and Detroit Metal City). I had highexpectations from this series. With 2 episodes yet to be released online, I don’tthink I have been let down. What I say hereafter will be based only on thefirst 11 episodes.Animation and art: The animation is like real life humans tracedin 2D. When they are in a distance it’s just the rough outline, no eyes, nonose, no mouth… just the outline of the figure. The backgrounds are really...gorgeous, the landscapes too.Soundtrack: The series has very little background music, mostlymelancholic piano pieces. In many scenes there is no music at all, just plainsilence and it adds to the eeriness of the atmosphere… something that you will appreciateif you like the series. The opening theme was a regular one, okay and good atits best. But the ending theme is discordant. It’s more like a recitation thana song. It is bound to catch your attention.Characters: Only three characters develop over the series. Takao,the male protagonist, is first seen as a shy character. He literally worshipsSaeki, the class idol, as his angel. As the series progresses he is manipulatedby Nakamura, the class outcast, after she witnesses Takao stealing Saeki’s gymclothes. For the first 11 episodes that I watched, Saeki came across as a goodhearted individual who reciprocates Takao’s feelings. Saeki doesn’t seem to bethat weak at heart as the series develops. Takao switched over from a shycharacter and bloomed into the “evil flower”. He doesn’t think he belongs tothe same world as the rest of the ignorant people in the town. The classvandalism, his awakening to his inner self after being manipulated by Nakamura…it all makes sense somehow. It’s different from being bullied in a way. (At onepoint of time I thought he’d get raped by a girl but that didn’t happen). Hispreferences and feelings change over time. But the character that made thedeepest impression was Nakamura. The way she blackmails Takao, forces him intofacing his “deviant” (though the Japanese audio said “Hentai”) self is quiteremarkable. After a long time in an anime I found a character that I thoughtwas screwed up in the head like crazy and I would give the world to stay awayfrom her and her mind games. She is one of a kind. What interested me in herwas her persistence and her saying “Take me beyond that hill”. With 2 moreepisodes to go I am really keeping my fingers crossed to witness how tocharacter development finally turns out.Overall, I like the series. It is seriously absolutely wonderfullyslow paced. It goes deep down into psychology and its aspects of romance. Thereare no demons other than the ones in your heart; there is no action, no guns,no bombs… just a battle raging between your mask and your soul. There will be alot of people who will hate this series, maybe, but there will be a lot of peoplewho will extremely love it. But I don’t think it will be a series worthignoring. Give the first episode a try and decide for yourself. On my part, Iwill be waiting for the last two episodes of the series. I think it has tooffer yet more.(The same review can be found on my blogs over the net). gorgeous, the landscapes too.Soundtrack: The series has very little background music, mostlymelancholic piano pieces.

First of all, the anime takes action in a world that we can easily put ourselves in, it\'s just realistic. Unlike all the other school-type animes. Everything is kept real, even characters and their purely natural development as the situation in the anime progresses. Even though not having a very imaginative or interesting plot, the presentation of it will keep you going through it (what makes the plot unpredictable)Whole series is focues around Kasuga Takao - boy who loves reading books, even those from outside Japan, especially Les Fleurs...du Mal. Basically Baudelaire was a exiled poet, his poetry was about sins and how people cant resist doing wrong things. He claims he is better than other people for reading that.His character is a mindless puppet, he\'s not even half intereting when you look at it, and then he develops, in a quite opposite way where he was at first (he does that with help of the other main character Nakamura Sawa)- And lastly we meet another important character Saeki, a person that Takao shows attraction for, and is the main problem in the anime.VIBE:First of all, I wouldnt recommend this anime to everybody, it\'s a rather different experience. If you dont enjoy unattractive characters or slow progress with the plot, then well better don\'t watch it, you will sleep more. Second of all, what I reckon is (but I guess some people might not agree with it) that people not familiar with japanese culture and how social and sexual life works there wont be able to enjoy, just because of lack of knowledge about it, main problem is a problem that only japanese culture has in store and only they will suffer from such situations.BUT LETS GET INTO ITThe atmosphere in this anime is different, as you can clearly see from the animation way of going, and the whole art style. Here we will enjoy minimalistic dialogues (mostly even monologues, thoughts) with none or tiny amout of music. This anime will purely stand on sound effects of the background they are at, which makes you wanna listen to it closely.What this anime basically makes is a atmosphere of mystery and an atmosphere of thoughtfulness, yes thats the word. Problem, even though being a quite simple and common one in the japanese standards is greatly presented (as I said before this series is about presentation not plot itself)But basically it\'s slow and gives you time to think about the whole situation, or just giving you time to put youself in their place.ART STYLE:Well let me repeat myself, it\'s different. The background drawing is basically static, while all the characters and things they touch are ""active"". Not only that, the artstyle on the very characters is unique, they look like theyve been rendered into the anime. Overall the whole anime is drawn pretty nicely, and I personally like the artstyle. Allthough when you look at their faces, they seem to be missing their noses.MUSIC/VOICEACTING:Well as mentioned earlier, music part is small in this one. I don\'t really like the opening, BUT the ending is superb it is creepy and always starts before the credits in great moments what builds more tension.But let\'s focus more on voiceacting, coz this is what\'s important. Voice acting gives more to realism in this case. You can hear that actors are chosen wisely every and single one of them (even for those characters that are secondary). They surely made the effort to make what\'s the best from these few senteces talked through the anime.STORYLINE:Personally I liked the storyline, as I was saying the plot is understandable for those with knowledge of japanese culture. It\'s not very interesting, but the presentation of it is cool. Also the development of main characters is great, how they change and develop into an entirely different person, which is still logical and makes sense from the beggining till the end.Conclusion:In conclusion Im just gonna that this anime is one of the best in it\'s year. Its unique, different and controvertial. Therfore I can\'t recommend that to everybody and Im sure that most people won\'t enjoy it. Therefore for those who are fans of slow and more realistic atmospehere, well go on. Give it a shot.Video Review: https://youtu.be/avdQngBeHPM du Mal.

To be fair, it does exist within the same universe; this isn’t some avant-garde work that has nothing in common with it. But what’s refreshing about this series is how it takes the stock elements of a school series and then constantly corrupts them, makes them perverse. If Flowers of Evil doesn’t qualify as an all-out attack on the institution of the school anime, it’s simply because it’s still a part of that genre. Whereas before the emotions of characters have been normal, cute ones about growing...up and first loves; now, everything that bubbles to the surface is nasty and dark. Instead of celebrating the “mono no aware” of youth or whatever, it sets out to corrupt that image through the subversion of school anime archetypes and its aesthetic daring (in its pacing and animation).The story as done in another manner could seem like the beginning of a fun ecchi adventure. Kasuga has a crush on Saeki. One day he feels overwhelmed by his feelings and steals her gym uniform. However, Nakamura, a supremely anti-social classmate, catches him, and they enter into a contract together so his secret won’t be revealed. Taken at face level, that plot description could head into many directions, and be approached/portrayed in many different ways. What’s important is that this is a stock situation that can be molded into basically anything. This is a School Anime Template.In Flowers of Evil, we get a clinic on genre deconstruction. All the elements that you’re familiar with, that you might latch on to, are either missing or deployed in a way that pushes them out of our comfort zones. You’re used to fun sidekicks who liven up the more dramatic moments? Our hero’s “best friend” is a non-entity who constantly annoys, picks on, or ignores Kasuga. You’re used to the most popular girl being basically perfect and somehow still having a crush on loser protagonist? Our hero’s “dream girl” is subjected to the madonna-whore complex, and reveals all her worst insecurities and comes out as pathetic as everyone else. You want slice of life trademarks such as the empty classroom after school, the walk home, roll call? Every single one of those is treated mundanely and shown in their utter banality (the 1st episode is basically all about this). You want crushes, some drama, something cute that goes down easy? Look somewhere else.While that deconstruction is admirable and interesting, Flowers of Evil’s status as a masterpiece resides in its aesthetics. After a ton of rotoscope jokes, what we are left with is the work itself. Why is the aesthetic so essential to the effects of Flowers of Evil? I believe it’s another attempt by the creators to take what is cliché and obvious and de-familiarize it. You’ve seen shows with these same plot elements, but you haven’t seen it done this way. I believe that as anime fans, we’ve become used to certain things out of series, not only tonally, but also aesthetically. So, when something comes along that upends all the rules and conventions that we’re used to, it feels strange.Flowers of Evil’s pacing is undeniably slow when compared to other Spring 2013 shows. However, I think most of the artistic forebears of this show aren’t to be found in anime, but, rather, Japanese live-action films such as Harmful Insect, All About Lily Chou-Chou or Nobody Knows. These are works that can be both understated and yet ferocious. Chou-Chou in particular is both incredibly serious and yet intensely poetic and often dreamlike, which are adjectives that can apply to Flowers of Evil as well. Time and time again the show will return to basic setups and images throughout the series, like they’re some kind of refrain, as it takes a break from the main narrative action. They often highlight the decaying nature of the town where the protagonists live in, and that seems to mirror the moral state of the characters. But, even then, I don’t feel this is an impossibly slow show – every episode is filled with incident, drama, even small bits of humor. Even the ostensible “slow” parts are not meant to be taken at face value, they’re valuable artistic choices. The slow walk home at the start of episode 8 is just as much of a bravura moment as the classroom freakout of episode 7. It’s beautiful and hypnotic in a way that most anime wouldn’t even dare. But it’s an absolutely essential moment: both characters need that space, that silence, to register what they’ve done. What I hope comes across is that the deliberate pacing isn’t there because the studio somehow failed to make it entertaining; it’s a valid choice for a certain mood and tone.In a sea of homogenous anime, Flowers of Evil was always going to stand out. Like a sore thumb, it’s a reminder that just because it’s anime, it doesn’t have to be cute or moe or whatever else is popular right now. But it isn’t ugly. This is ultimately my biggest problem with the reception that this show has gotten. Not once did I find the rotoscoping to be ugly or dull or unimaginative. Aesthetically, this show is actually quite restrained. Its animation is mostly committed to capturing the mundane banality of the character’s life – empty city streets, darkened rooms, ambiguous facial expressions. The series’ genius is that it saves its stylistic coups; episode 7’s classroom freakout is so powerful because it comes as a release after episode after episode of restraint.It’s possible that Flowers of Evil doesn’t add up to much in the final analysis. Is there a point to all this angst and creepiness outside of the subversion that I’ve outlined? It’s hard to tell. There are certain thematic strands that are explored throughout, but that might be a topic for another post. What’s certain is that a series like this in the current 2013 anime climate is an anomaly and its effects are powerful and singular enough to merit close analysis (not rash dismissal).

Instead of celebrating the “mono no aware” of youth or whatever, it sets out to corrupt that image through the subversion of school anime archetypes and its aesthetic daring (in its pacing and animation).The story as done in another manner could seem like the beginning of a fun ecchi adventure. Kasuga has a crush on Saeki. One day he feels overwhelmed by his feelings and steals her gym uniform. However, Nakamura, a supremely anti-social classmate, catches him, and they enter into a contract together so his secret won’t be revealed. Taken at face level, that plot description could head into many directions, and be approached/portrayed in many different ways. What’s important is that this is a stock situation that can be molded into basically anything. This is a School Anime Template.In Flowers of Evil, we get a clinic on genre deconstruction. All the elements that you’re familiar with, that you might latch on to, are either missing or deployed in a way that pushes them out of our comfort zones. You’re used to fun sidekicks who liven up the more dramatic moments? Our hero’s “best friend” is a non-entity who constantly annoys, picks on, or ignores Kasuga. You’re used to the most popular girl being basically perfect and somehow still having a crush on loser protagonist? Our hero’s “dream girl” is subjected to the madonna-whore complex, and reveals all her worst insecurities and comes out as pathetic as everyone else.

But it was the ""Intensity"" and ""spaz"" that you can feel in the plot. the story was awesome even though i never finished it, and you\'ll never know, you will be hooked in to...this masterpiece, then in time, you will like it.1st point is the concept of it. It was truly original. Very good points, very good events...2nd point is the art. For my opinion, the model of the characters was from their seiyuu, which is great.

Tips, if u want to watch this, PLEASE, go for the story. You will never know what\'s next to expect from good animes like these. Aku no Hana, awesome anime...', ""Aku no Hana, yes.Well, at least you can call this anime unique. It really is unique, but in a rather strange way. My opinion may not be a popular one. But I’ve got a couple of things to say…Story (7/10): I really do like psychological anime series. Always provoking your mind and make you question yourself. Things don't go as you want them to, and they surprise you greatly, sometimes in a good way, and sometimes in a bad way.Aku no Hana though... rather than being excitingly psychological, it just made me angry and irritated. The story was dragging, and it all was...thanks to the characters, the terrible art, the cuts they made from the manga and the failed attempts to set the right mood. It was shockingly awkward to watch at times. It’s not really the story that is the problem, it’s the bad usage of characters and other visual details. I really like the idea of Kasuga having dark, perverted secrets and Nakamura being a terrifying brainwasher and the whole dark, suffocating tone about it… But there is no way that I could enjoy it with these characters!Characters (3/10): Ah yes. Of course a person can be weak, of course they can be cowards, of course you can be brainwashed. But this went too far.ALL the characters were weak. Expressionless, mentally ill and far too easy to mess with. The whole situation Kasuga was in with Nakamura was ridiculous, for me at least. How can a person be this mentally weak and so easy to brainwash. What's wrong with all the characters? (And I really mean ALL of them. Like, seriously, how can EVERYONE in the same class be mentally ill?) Things were so uncomfortable to watch. Not because they were mind-provoking, but because they were far too unrealistic and irritating.Art (1/10): Don't get me started on this one. Rotoscopy, really? And this low budgeted version too? Not to mention how bad the actors portrayed the characters emotions, and then they made it worse by drawing over it... Really? Is this another attempt to be unique and different? Why does it have to be this way? The story is unique enough without the bad art. I really liked the art of the manga though, so I am quite confused about the choices they made for the anime…Sound (7/10): The sound wasn't bad. I really liked the mood-lifting music it had. Even though the anime lacked in emotions from the characters... the sound never failed to deliver the right mood where it was needed. And that is exactly what music and sound in movies and series should be like. But whatever mood there was, was ruined by the horrible acting.Enjoyment (1/10): I'm very sorry. I actually enjoyed the manga from time to time. But sadly, they took away many of the good scenes from the manga, because they were too explict. This made me a lot angrier than I already was. Some of the horrifying scenes were so badly portrayed that they gave a whole other feeling than they were supposed to. I am truly disappointed.Overall (4/10): The story itself isn't a bad one. Actually, it is very creative and thought out, even though it sometimes just goes over the top. Unfortunately, those over-the-top times goes so far, because of the bad personalities of the characters, that you forget about what really was good with it. It is a shame, after all. I guess it's not my cup of tea. I would love the series more if the characters weren't ruining it all.As I said first, Aku no Hana is one of a kind.

Because of this disconnect you have to really try to put yourself into the shoes of a social reject. Nakamura.PubertyOur story starts with a nerdy boy who is infatuated with a girl in his class, he pays a ton of attention to her and puts her on a pedestal despite not knowing what kind of a person she is, without having ever talked to her, she seems oblivious to him, and his friends make fun of him, the artstyle seems to bridge a gap in attractiveness between all of the students, which I really like, their facial expressions too give you some information about what kind of a person they are and out of any anime these characters actually look japanese in their expression and in their contour, this removes the need for a spectrum of hair colors to show differences, however there is one character that jumps out just because of their hair, which is a very important character in the show, she stands out just like how some people IRL stand out coloring their hair, both the character artstyle, the extremely beautiful detailed backgrounds of the city and the other touches create a strong link to our reality, it tries its best to set itself above fiction.Takao is set up as a character that is proud of being different, maybe even a little self absorbed thinking himself to be better than his friends because he reads books, this is an important contrast to what is to follow because one day when he goes back to class to fetch his favorite book, the gym clothes of the girl he's infatuated with drop in front of him and he feels the temptation to explore them, there is undoubtably something sexual to it but he doesn't want to admit and still looks at his infatuation as pure love.Nakamura, the girl with the red hair, who openly insults her teachers, appears to know about it but it is unclear whether at some point she's made a calculated guess or if she really saw him take the clothes, since she's sitting behind him, she would have caught him looking and deduced it was him purely from his behavior, she waits to tell him she saw him take the clothes until they meet on accident and only when she can use it as blackmail, Takao being weak runs away that first time, he's trying to keep himself from turning into the pervert he is, but fails. Nakamura is excited by this and tries to get him to partake into these sinful behaviors and asks him to tell her how it feels. She thinks of him as kindred spirit a deviant one.Takao's parents start to find out that their son is acting strange, coming home late because of nakamura's influence, his dad is the more patient of the two and attributes it to puberty.Here the idea is that Takao having been a good boy towards his parents has started to change, but I believe the most important thing to take from this is that his puberty started through the discovery of a dark aspect of himself, an aspect that Nakamura is very familiar with and she is the one who seems to act as his evil mentor spurring it on or if you want to use the theme of the anime she is causing it to bloom. Aku no Hana.God's TrialDuring one of their meetings in the library Nakamura inadvertently causes a connection between Saeki and Takao, causing them to start talking, It's not something Nakamura thought would happen but she seems to celebrate it when Takao is successful in asking her for a date, ofcourse the celebration is because she can torment Takao by making him wear those gym clothes on their date, she also reveals that she's intent on breaking the walls the prevent him from seeing himself like a deviant, he's still resisting that he is a pervert and fails to tell Saeki the truth, it seems like on their date Saeki has never really had a boy confess to her and she takes this as something dear to her, which is why the nature of this date isn't so vibrant or special yet she still wants to make it work, Saeki comes across as a dreamer, a person who pictures a fantasy in her mind, just like Takao's fantasy of her being his angel, his muse... Saeki's fantasy is just as naive, she sees him as special because he is the first one to ask her out, later Nakamura seems to also reveal something about Saeki, that she deep down wants to have sex with Takao, how she really knows is unclear, Nakamura says that she looked like she wanted to have sex. From this you have to ascribe some kind of knowledge to Nakamura, the knowledge of the distasteful aspects that people hide underneath their ideals.This idealism and crude disgraceful nature stands against each other and while Takao is in agony over it Saeki is not, her's is perhaps more acceptible, in the same trend she seems to be accepting of Takao's perverted nature and tries to love him like he is. This is interesting, it's almost like she is able to surpass this agony, she's willing to erase the guilt that Takao feels with how she behaves, she's also not corruptible, there's a moment in the forest where Nakamura undresses Takao in front of Saeki almost to tempt her desire of seeing him bare, it's not a good time for that but it also does nothing to provoke her, saeki stands her ground and is only interested in whether Takao wants to come with her or Nakamura, This scene is a crossroads between returning to civilization and giving into nature this is what it is really about underneath it's Nakamura against Saeki, These parts of the story are also beautifully supported by the music at the start of each episode.ExodusIn the ending we get a little bit about the cause of all of this suffering, the wave of suffering that rippled through all the people connected to Nakamura and Takao started with a broken household, there's not much explanation it's left open and perhaps rushed but if you wonder how the flower took roots this is the most obvious answer, I haven't read the manga. There are a few moments throughout the story where you see Nakamura unleash her pain by screaming, and she is visibly relieved and happy after they vandalize the classroom, perhaps she is special, is it common for people in pain to orient themselves towards destruction? Maybe it's the fact that all of this was beyond her control, maybe her satanic reactions are because god dealt her a bad hand. It's an open ending, there are flashes of the future as they both lay on the ground, a future that isn't a future, a future that only further breaks down their lives and the lives of those around them,Definitely not a happy ending, but hey it promises a part 2, maybe it gets better, I'm actually fine with this ending, a happy ever after story would have detracted from the theme.The positive take is hidden, god gave them both another chance, but they had to sacrifice a part of them, the part that they wanted so hard to be free. Saeki could do it, she's an actual angel in this story. Light in the darkThe Actual ReviewThe artstyle was something to get used to, but I understood it as a design choice to compliment the theme and it wasn't hard to adjust to it, I think it added value since I was able to more easily differentiate characters from each other, I wouldn't mind if more studios started to take Rotoscoping seriously, maybe optomizations could be made since it seems like some scenes were slower than others, perhaps it's not something that should become a default because that would take away from the artists who want to create characters different from human contour, or the ones who want to focus on personality rather than looks.The story was simple but good, it did the job in trying to convey the philosophy behind the poems, the ending lacked a lot of depth and it felt rushed I'm not sure if that can be as easily forgiven, they could have added more romance too, the relationship between Takao and Saeki lasted for like 2 seconds, perhaps it shouldn't have been put into a mere 13 episodes and been given a larger budget, because this anime would definitely be able to get a cult status, the artstyle is a hurdle for that so maybe they should have made compromise there, I'm glad they didn't but also mixed about it.The music was good, it felt like they def. had talent there, it was unlike anything I'd heard before and it worked, it gives you the chills when it was supposed to, the little variations also kept you listening to it with every episode. I think then ending song was supposed to represent beautiful dysharmony and I wonder if this is an actual genre or if this was just something they came up with just for the show, you have to be really talented to create something unique on demand. I have mad respect for whoever did that.Overall this anime is going to be bland to most people, I don't see many of you be able to enjoy it, but I consider it an important voice that people who want to understand the world should listen to, usually that only applies to those who have suffered greatly from the same type of moral boundaries but maybe it's even more crucial to people who haven't, they could learn something that they aren't subjected to it could help them understand and plan to interact with those who are. If learning lessons from philosophy is ridiculous to you perhaps you appreciate the mention of Baudelaire and consider this an excuse to get familiar with his work and derive it's secrets this way, be safe and don't fall into temptation or do I don't really care. full meaning behind the poems I believe it is just as hard for us readers and watchers to really get it, the reason for this is that none of us really lived through that period and few of us experience the same feelings the work is trying to bring forth. Because of this disconnect you have to really try to put yourself into the shoes of a social reject.

Light in the darkThe Actual ReviewThe artstyle was something to get used to, but I understood it as a design choice to compliment the theme and it wasn't hard to adjust to it, I think it added value since I was able to more easily differentiate characters from each other, I wouldn't mind if more studios started to take Rotoscoping seriously, maybe optomizations could be made since it seems like some scenes were slower than others, perhaps it's not something that should become a default because that would take away from the artists who want to create characters different from human contour, or the ones who want to focus on personality rather than looks.The story was simple but good, it did the job in trying to convey the philosophy behind the poems, the ending lacked a lot of depth and it felt rushed I'm not sure if that can be as easily forgiven, they could have added more romance too, the relationship between Takao and Saeki lasted for like 2 seconds, perhaps it shouldn't have been put into a mere 13 episodes and been given a larger budget, because this anime would definitely be able to get a cult status, the artstyle is a hurdle for that so maybe they should have made compromise there, I'm glad they didn't but also mixed about it.The music was good, it felt like they def. had talent there, it was unlike anything I'd heard before and it worked, it gives you the chills when it was supposed to, the little variations also kept you listening to it with every episode. I think then ending song was supposed to represent beautiful dysharmony and I wonder if this is an actual genre or if this was just something they came up with just for the show, you have to be really talented to create something unique on demand. I have mad respect for whoever did that.Overall this anime is going to be bland to most people, I don't see many of you be able to enjoy it, but I consider it an important voice that people who want to understand the world should listen to, usually that only applies to those who have suffered greatly from the same type of moral boundaries but maybe it's even more crucial to people who haven't, they could learn something that they aren't subjected to it could help them understand and plan to interact with those who are. If learning lessons from philosophy is ridiculous to you perhaps you appreciate the mention of Baudelaire and consider this an excuse to get familiar with his work and derive it's secrets this way, be safe and don't fall into temptation or do I don't really care."", ""Aku no Hana or ''The flowers of evil'' is an absolutely disgusting creation. I did not notice any charachter development whatsoever.  The story follows a perverted young boy who steals another girls panties and brings them home to engage in filthy activity with them. This child is obviously very damaged. The child and his father surround themselves with books , so much so that the house overflows with them. This leaves the mother spiraling into a depression that gets progressively worse as the anime continues.The poetry supposedly adapted from Les Fleurs du mal is quite scarce. Much of it is changed and so...it gives it not a modern feel , but a fake one. The flowers of evil manga is a much more enjoyable experience than the anime in my opinion as it goes more in depth into issues raised and is obviously absent of rotoscope animation. it gives it not a modern feel , but a fake one.

We were talking about the worst anime we\'ve ever seen, and on the list he produced, Aku no Hana was at the top. Why I decided to watch any anime on a list titled, ""Worst Anime Ever"", is a very good question. I could be a masochist. Point is, I didn\'t expect very much going into Aku no Hana, and I got, well, something. Here are my thoughts:Story:7The story for Aku no Hana, is, in a word,...abrasive. It revolves around a cringe worthy main character that does perverse things that get progressively worse to impress someone he hates. Why he does these things is because our main protagonist is so desperate for acceptance that he makes many obvious bad choices. I used the word abrasive because this story is rough and will wear you down over time, to where you think things can\'t possibly get any worse, and you don\'t give a damn about what happens to this guy anymore. If you\'re like me, you\'ll spend an inordinate amount of time between pausing to brace yourself and recover from the awkward, cringe, moments, and yelling ""What the hell are you thinking"" at your monitors. Kinda like the ""No, don\'t do that"" when watching a scary movie. I still give it a 7 though, because despite all that, the ending ties everything together well enough that it\'s almost worth all the discomfort of getting there. Almost.Art:6This anime receives a lot of hate for its art style, so much so that if you watched it on Crunchyroll like I did, the comments for the first episode were disabled from all the flaming. It uses Rotoscoping, which aesthetically, doesn\'t please my eyes. To be honest, when I started to watch Aku no Hana, I hated it. I thought it looked really dated. But as I progressed through the series, It bothered me less and less, probably because I was more focused on what I was watching, and less on how it was drawn. Overall, it\'s a bit annoying, but definitely bearable.Sound:8This is another anime that relies heavily on sound, and fortunately, the sound is great. The music throughout is best described as eerie, and unsettling, but it definitely fits the overall mood. It\'s probably because throughout this anime, there will be plenty of moments where you, as the viewer, will feel uncomfortable, unsure if you want to continue watching. The music personifies that discomfort beautifully. On its own, it\'s definitely creepy though(in a good way), so if you try to play a song from the anime to a friend, expect them to take two steps back and possibly avoid you indefinitely. Just a word of warning.Character:7I feel like a seven is too high here, because out main character Takao takes second place in my ""Worst Protagonists Ever"" list( behind Makoto from ""School Days"", who will forever be reigning champ. What a Douche). I don\'t even like using the word protagonist, because to me, a protagonist is the lead person who does good things(as opposed to an antagonist who is the lead who does bad things). Takao does not do good things. He does things that are obviously bad for him, that he knows are bad, and then complains about how screwed up his life is. But surely given the chance to fix it, to put himself back on the morally right track with zero(yes ZERO) repercussions, he would right? No, he doesn\'t. As a main character he is terribly flawed, and yet I still don\'t think he deserves a lower score. Why? Because the fact that he can bother me this much, even after I watched this a couple months ago, tells me that he is a good character. If the creators can make a character that sticks with you this long, and still elicits the same emotional response(in this case, disdain), then it\'s a well written character in my book, even if he is an annoying little shit. Also, the antagonist Nakamura is brilliantly written, so bonus points for that.Enjoyment:5This is where I think this anime suffers, because it can be absolutely painful to watch. Using my ""How many episodes can I watch in a row"" enjoyment scale, Aku no Hana scores a 1-2, with me usually regretting the second episode. Aside from the fact that I was cringing through most episodes, this anime likes to trick you into thinking things will get better, that Takao will fix things. So many times I watched that second episode because the preview at the end of the first one made me think things were about to resolve for the better, only to be slapped across the face my the creators with an even worse situation. Not only is that lack of resolution irritating, but I don\'t think that anyone likes to get their hopes up, only to be disappointed. Again, the ending does do a nice job of making it seem almost worthwhile, but a nice lesson learned in episode 13 doesn\'t really equal 12 episodes of discomfort.Overall:6(Fair)Aku no Hana isn\'t a bad anime if you look at it as a whole. By the end, you tend to forget how much you dreaded watching the episodes leading up to it. But just like a bad movie can\'t be redeemed by a great ending, if you didn\'t really enjoy the first 12 episodes, the ending in episode 13 can only do so much to make the series enjoyable. I\'m hoping that this was just the necessary evil in order to set up a second season(which seems likely), because a second season would probably score higher now that I know what to expect. Aku no Hana is worth a watch if you like anime that makes you uncomfortable(looking at you ""Watamote"" fans), or even if you can stand the uncomfortableness if you like anime that make you think. Otherwise, I would avoid it, because if you\'re like me, curled up in a, cringing, ball of regret is not how you like to spend your free time. abrasive.

Things get slightly more complicated (okay, *insanely* more complicated) when the news of said act reaches outcast (and sociopath in the making) Nakamura Sawa, who uses her newfound knowledge as blackmail.While the events described may sound like the premise for an over-the-top sitcom,...the show promptly establishes itself as anything but a laughing matter.  In fact, for a story of petty preteen drama, Aku no Hana is quick to present itself as one of the darkest and tensest series in its genre.  In fact, one could almost argue that the creators took the most anxious moments and scenarios that middle school life can provide, and made a TV show out of it.  That being said, I certainly would not have given it a perfect score had this show been as lacking in charm as it sounds.  In fact, it is the execution of this premise, characterizable by its subtlety and its delicate channeling of human emotions, that has made this my favorite anime I have watched thus far.Here’s the catch (and your litmus test regarding whether this show is right for you):  Think of the last time someone was telling you about a book, a movie or a TV show, and warned you that you were missing out on the show if you only focused on the literal plot points, and paid no mind to the thoughts and motivations behind each character’s actions.  If you decided to approach Aku no Hana in such a mode, you’d be doing yourself a greater disservice than just neglecting the true fruit of the show – in fact, you wouldn’t even be watching the show.  Period.  While the physical events for any given episode are few and far between, the unspoken thoughts of each of the characters move at a mile a minute.  It’s the mastery of this cinematic technique that, more than anything, puts the show in a class of its own.Of course, far more components of the show exist that drive home the point that it isn’t for the masses.  The animation style is an almost century-old technique involving hand-drawing images over live footage, better known as “rotoscoping”.  It’s a style that flawlessly captures and supplements the show’s slow and plodding ambience – but as anime watchers well know, it’s a controversial choice, and has seldom, if ever, been used before in the anime world.  Fans of American film director Richard Linklater (of School of Rock fame) might be familiar with it in films such as Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly (but fear not, Aku no Hana’s use of rotoscoping isn’t nearly as chaotic).  On a separate note, the soundtrack, while far from unlistenable on the whole, has yielded some songs that are definitely tough on the ears.If you’re the type to bite your nails at moments of nervousness or suspense, this definitely won’t be your cup of tea.  If you’re looking for something that offers more traditional anime themes, such as fast-paced action or dazzling sex objects, this show will probably not be up your alley.  But if you’re a worry-wart like me, you’d be surprised – you might even be delighted – to see how much Aku no Hana can take the tension you’ve held inside on a daily basis, and reproduce it on screen.

It is delivered for us in an anime form, in anime ways. But what we get isn\'t what most of us are waiting for in this medium. Rather than your general anime, where we get a stereotyped story that makes it easy for us to classify it - The action filled shonen; the humoristic harem or school club - the bittersweet, funny ecchi comedic-romance - we are presented with a story wich wants to send us more than enjoyment, but also a message. Doing so, it can\'t fit in any...common anime theme we may quickly think of, and it develops in it\'s own personal way, and I\'ve got to say, this is were anime, and all kinds of art, really shine for me.I can but laught of that description they came about of this anime - not because it was lame, but  because of how it could be miss interpreted by many people. It, firstly, signals a comedy-harem setting, letting down most of watchers who were expecting that. Actually, 90% of audience dropped just because of the realistic art style, and maybe for good, as it\'s art style isn\'t the only part of the anime incompatible with standard anime expectations.I will try the most I can to not spoil anything, while trying to transmit my feelings and toughts about this anime to those who watched it.I will starting saying that this anime has high philosofical and psychological impact to those who watch it open mindedly, and enjoy learning a thing or two with a story. The characters have very strong caracterization towards what the diretor planned them to be. Nothing about their personality helps in comic relief, or anything that would serve to any other purpose away from telling the story and proving it\'s point. And I think they work very well with the plot. I might even say that they ARE the plot.We can tell that the diretor really couldn\'t care less about what we might think of his storytelling. While the story and characters are very deep, It will hardly make you smile even once, you won\'t want to be any of the characters - you will probably get upset about how they act- but it\'s just part of the point of this tale.By now, I will assume that the second season will be aired, for it seems obvious that the part two is already fully animated and ready to be presented.This anime shows us a deep, ugly truth about kasuga and the others, and also about all of us. It also shows psychological aspects that amuse me. The way they act, their toughts, and the development of the plot alog with the subtle messages is what made it enjoyable to me. As the foruns and my anime experience shows me, these points may not be very atractive to most anime watchers, so I cannot recommend this to most people, even qw I think of Aku no Hana as a great work of art and a great story that might teach you some importante stuff.We like to think how safe we are inside of ourselves, how we are ""normal"". Yet we delve hiding into worlds that doesn\'t exist, trying to feel what we can\'t in real life, and yes, I\'m telling this directly to most of you anime watchers, who just can\'t apreciate and learn form a story that tells us about problems we might have inside. - I might even go further and say that this is the main reason a lot of people dislike Aku no Hana - They want shows that give them characters they feel good pretending to be.Well, away from the bashing, watch Aku no Hana if you\'re like me, who loves an original story that makes you think, and in this case, might even give you a minor life lesson. I must add that I have not read the manga and I won\'t read it ever, I will just wait for season two. For my score, I will give it 9 out of 10, as the anime pacing really was a bit, just a bit exagerated.

It will grow on you, like it did for me. In the end the art work really complements the story telling and mood of the anime. It kind of provides a sort of surrealism to the whole think. It seems real, but really isn\'t, kind of feel.Kasuga, the main character, lives in a pretty boring town. He wakes up goes to school, reads books, etc and dreams about his ""muse"" Saeki. That\'s all...he does, but Nakamura, the deviant, has other plans for him. Kasuga like I said is a pretty boring guy, until he does something that draws the attention of Nakamura. Nakamura is pretty much a deviant. She hates the town she lives in, hates her life and is bored out of it. So she needs some amusement and ""freedom"", so she tries to turn Kasuga into something that he isn\'t so sure about. Saeki plays the love interest of Kasuga. She\'s smart, pretty and very well liked by everyone. By the end of the anime, that boring feeling in the beginning turns into something else; it pretty much turns into despair and darkness.The way this anime is directed is incredible. They provide us with such a dark mood at times, you even get depressed watching the characters do their things. It definitely is not an anime for kids. A lot of adult and dark themes are explored. From sex, perversion, etc. The characters while not many are enough to garner your attention. Before you know it the episode is over and it didn\'t even seem like the 20+ minutes passed by. Heck even the ending music is creepy, but delivers a message of what the anime is pretty much about. ""The Flowers of Evil."" Definitely recommend it. Ignore your first intuition to dump it because of the artwork. You won\'t be disappointed. Trust me! 9/10. he does, but Nakamura, the deviant, has other plans for him.

all and with their madness it remains open.it also questions the conformist life style and shows it’s ups and downs.AnH is based on a manga by Oshimi, Shuuzou or at least the story is based on it but the studio that adapted it decided to mix it with a reality style animation (rotoscope or w/e) and the result was an unholy mix...not just because they tried to make...it look real though it is because mixing anime world with reality is not an easy thing to do and they tried to make the characters and other things real as well in a bad way.sadly Aku no hana anime failed but at least it tried but as a result what could have been an 8/10 turned into this.Aku no hana is a different read from the usual things around.we all like unexpected things in the stories and the Aku no Hana tries to be unexpected.but we need a reason or motivation to like them.simply caring for mad characters that harm others is...a waste of time.although it can be considered a good thing when we have time to waste….sadly it seems that I am mostly going to talk about negative things about this anime but that doesn\'t mean it doesn’t have good points.for example it makes you yearn for more to see what happens next cause it is unusual and Aku no hana is good at presenting the story so it helps a lot and also the opening songs are interesting but the negative points were the things that drove me to write a review since it didn\'t do justice to the manga.in reality Aku no hana manga is about a boy that turns into a freak for the sake of a girl and it was about the madness that sorrounds them and took the shape of a flower.the story itself is simple.it is about mistakes and misunderstandings of teenagers about the events of their life.although not sure that is what the mangaka wanted it to be but in reality that is what this anime is.the main focus is characters take on the events of the story.Takao is in love (or so he thought) with a girl name Nanako and by pure accident one day he finds her gym cloths in the class and without thinking he is forced to take them with himself.while what he did was wrong it wasn\'t the greatest sin of all times and he could just laugh about it when he grew up but since he was a teenager he was more pure and it was enough to make him feel very bad about himself.although since middle schoolers in Aku no hana have thinking patterns and psychologies of adults one cannot simply accept that whenever they make a wrong call it is becuz they are middle schoolers but sadly many anime these days have this loophole.although the anime is yet to reach deeper parts of the story where characters express their thoughts more so maybe its too harsh to judge the anime for that yet.Nakamura is another character in the story that tries to be weird.although in the manga she doesn\'t need to ""try"" but in anime perphaps because of it’s style she just doesn\'t fit.she saw what Takao did and use that chance to tame him into a man he wants him to be.Nakamura hates everyone and thinks that life is boring and she doesn\'t want to be normal and boring.while she could be a good character she is too extreme and that makes her annoying at some points specially in the anime.in the end even Takao wants to be like her and that explains why he never resist her abuses to an extent.but what both characters didn\'t realize again maybe becuz they were too young was that if they think everyone else is normal and boring then no one is or maybe those things that are deemed normal like love/hate and marriage are bound to meanings of life and many people values them and while they didn’t need to accept it they have to respect it!but one thing that takao got right about himself was that he is empty.that is why he was easily changed by Nakamura even though probably he had a talent for being a perv too.also sadly the only normal person in the story is Ai, Nanako’s friend and others are just too extreme.Nanako thinks that what Takao did is completely alright while Takao thinks that he did the greatest sin and Nakamura things everyone is trash and sadly there is no middle ground and no one else tries to teach them that.and like many other animes their parents are just useless.(or maybe becuz they were useless that the kids turn out like that).although I am not saying that main characters should be more logical to be acceptable,I am saying that no one is completely logical in the story…the irony that the anime decided to make aku no hana more real while it is not fit for one.not just becuz their parents aren\'t real enough as characters but becuz characters like Nakamura can\'t easily get adapted anywhere besides anime world.not that it is impossible but it is a hard work.one good thing about the anime is that the viewers are yet to see Nanako turn 180 completely since even if you fake your personality for a long time it will become a part of you no matter what and while changing yourself Is not impossible it can’t be done so quickly and a kid can’t be that complex in the first place...as you get close to the ending the anime gives you “school days” vibe a little although those that alrdy did read the manga knows that it won\'t go that way at least for now.another thing is that there are a lot of wasted times in some episodes.characters walking for minutes or just stay silent for minutes...it just makes you wait more and by the end you just get a recap episode and some random shots from future chapters of manga and the anime just needed to adapt one more chapter for better ending but they decided to waste time with recaps and long walking scenes...(even though they were probably bound to limited budgets they could use it better).let us hope that they really do make another season with higher quality.although in the end AnH\'s manga wasn\'t a masterpiece itself so the anime at best could get an 8/10,now it is 6.5/10 and I rounded up to 7 in hopes of a better next season if there is going to be one. it look real though it is because mixing anime world with reality is not an easy thing to do and they tried to make the characters and other things real as well in a bad way.sadly Aku no hana anime failed but at least it tried but as a result what could have been an 8/10 turned into this.Aku no hana is a different read from the usual things around.we all like unexpected things in the stories and the Aku no Hana tries to be unexpected.but we need a reason or motivation to like them.simply caring for mad characters that harm others is...a waste of time.although it can be considered a good thing when we have time to waste….sadly it seems that I am mostly going to talk about negative things about this anime but that doesn\'t mean it doesn’t have good points.for example it makes you yearn for more to see what happens next cause it is unusual and Aku no hana is good at presenting the story so it helps a lot and also the opening songs are interesting but the negative points were the things that drove me to write a review since it didn\'t do justice to the manga.in reality Aku no hana manga is about a boy that turns into a freak for the sake of a girl and it was about the madness that sorrounds them and took the shape of a flower.the story itself is simple.it is about mistakes and misunderstandings of teenagers about the events of their life.although not sure that is what the mangaka wanted it to be but in reality that is what this anime is.the main focus is characters take on the events of the story.Takao is in love (or so he thought) with a girl name Nanako and by pure accident one day he finds her gym cloths in the class and without thinking he is forced to take them with himself.while what he did was wrong it wasn\'t the greatest sin of all times and he could just laugh about it when he grew up but since he was a teenager he was more pure and it was enough to make him feel very bad about himself.although since middle schoolers in Aku no hana have thinking patterns and psychologies of adults one cannot simply accept that whenever they make a wrong call it is becuz they are middle schoolers but sadly many anime these days have this loophole.although the anime is yet to reach deeper parts of the story where characters express their thoughts more so maybe its too harsh to judge the anime for that yet.Nakamura is another character in the story that tries to be weird.although in the manga she doesn\'t need to ""try"" but in anime perphaps because of it’s style she just doesn\'t fit.she saw what Takao did and use that chance to tame him into a man he wants him to be.Nakamura hates everyone and thinks that life is boring and she doesn\'t want to be normal and boring.while she could be a good character she is too extreme and that makes her

The anime itself isn't very well known but it really does have a overall feeling of the balance between good and evil to it. The art/graphics were not the best and more than likely a huge turn down to most viewers but once you are able to look past it you realize it actually is quite amusing. I personally chuckled every time a characters facial features were a bit sloppy especially the elusive gender bend character with the face and voice of...a male but hair and social status of a female. The character development was just amazing, I personally enjoyed learning all the characters individual quirks. The story itself has a deep meaning and to really understand it you kind of have to put yourself in the anime. The story line goes above and beyond some guy stealing his crushes clothes, where from there it turns into a mystery, romance, and slight comedy ( if you have the right sense of humor). I also enjoyed how the book itself played a huge part in the story as well a times it almost seemed as if the book was a character on it's own.  Once you start watching I can almost guarantee that you will binge watch, but maybe not. I believe that people whom have great imagination and also those who see the beauty in life will personally be touched.

I mean the plot was brilliant and so creepy that it can end up being a real life situation. It’s plots like these that I wonder if the writer or creator of this had some sort of dark past or a similar experience when they were growing up. It’s depressing, it’s dark, it’s absolutely an inspirational plot. For a writer like me, and a literature student, I can go very, VERY deep into this plot that I can end up writing a three to five page essay. But...I won’t do that. I can say that this story held some psychological aspect of betrayal, depression, OCD, Post-traumatic stress, and other mental issues these characters do carry. This story really dwelled deep into real life situations. The book that was mentioned: Flowers of Evil is a gateway or symbol of the whole story. Like The Nameless Monster was in Naoki’s Monster. It symbolized forbidden thoughts, lost childhood, and of course, Death.Art: 8/10It seems as though it was probably originally filmed in the outside world, then animated over the layer. It’s very realistic. The background is too detailed to be a normal drawing, but otherwise beautiful. The characters…not so much. If the background can hold that much detail, so can the characters. Meaning the design should be clear from far away the same it is close up. I don’t want to see a no face character far away. It’s sloppy, lazy, and just plain creepy. Come on guys, you can do so much better than that!Sound: 7/10No…just no. The opening song will change btw. It’ll seem kind of off at first but will soon slowly start sounding like a normal person and not a screaming kid. The closing song…just plain no. I got chills when I heard it and went straight to the next episode. It really did set the dark tone of the theme of the anime though so I do give them credit for coming up with a great and scary song.The voices are subbed and I doubt will be dubbed. Now as someone who doesn’t watch subbed very often I loved this. I really do hope they don’t dub it because it can ruin the voice of the characters and the mood of the story itself. It’s so realistic that English speaking characters will just throw it all away.Character: 8/10This is where the whole anime comes together. The characters in this were not only so realistic, you can find them just walking in your town, they were showing a side of an anime character that is rare to find. No, there is no death; there is only death of the mind almost. With a perverted school boy obsessed with the girl of his dreams and a stalker blackmailer who will do anything to make the school boy pervert’s life a living hell, you got the best OTP ever. Just kidding. But the Stalker, Sawa Nakamura, does have some personal issues that we do learn about. The same goes for Takao Kasuga, the school boy pervert. These two characters might seem just plain stupid and probably very hateful…trust me, I’m not a fan of them, but the way they were represented and characterized, man they are a pure masterpiece.Enjoyment/Overall: 7/10This was a weird anime, not going to lie. I hope they make a second season to tie up some loose ends. The character’s situations and they conflict in the plot was so real it was scary. It makes you think: can this happen, is this happening right now; do I know anybody that is in this situation? It can give you complete chills thinking about it. Keep in mind guys; this is not about black flowers with eyes that can kill you. Those flowers really just represent the theme of the story. Someone is always watching….and you can never get away with anything without a price.I give this a 77% on the evil flower scale. I won’t do that.

Rotocoping is not my personal favorite genre of animation, however, I am sure the artistic team chose this style for a reason. I believe that reason to be discomfort. Seeing these moments almost acted out in real time. This then begs the question of why not go completely live action? Aku no Hana certainly has enough dramatic content to create quite a shocking TV series. I personally don't think the animation style suited the story in any way. In fact, I found it alienating.The anime also pulled some punches, as most anime...does, when compared to the manga. While I understand some folks just cannot get into reading manga, I always push people to find a way to consume it, otherwise you will never get THE REAL STORY. I'm not saying that animes which soften the blow (see Naruto, plenty of examples in that), are inherently bad or missing the main story beats, it just takes away the real impact of a lot of scenes.I encourage you even more to read the manga considering the anime never made it past the first incident. It gets even worse from here. This is a story that goes to very dark and believable places. Out of everyone in this story, the character the audience is expected to hate is the one who arguably has done the least offensive things.This is another one of those FEELS BAD stories. It is uncomfortable and horrible what these kids do to each other. I would not recommend watching this if you are in a bad place mentally. It could potentially make it worse.

With its striking, spectacular and original art style and very realistic characters, I find it deserving of a 10/10 score, even if some might only appreciate it for how completely different it is from other anime.(This is technically a spoiler-free review, but it's not really that spoiling the plot would be an issue, as the plot is almost not the focus of the anime, but it's more the premise; so take into consideration that I would like to comment on things that are original...and fascinating about this anime, but I can't, because it would detract from the series' subtleties for you)Story: 9/10Aku no Hana seems to get a lot of harsh criticism from fans of the manga due to the way the anime cuts off partway through the story with the implication that there will be a second season. In reading the manga, I have found that the anime is really something of a separate entity, and has taken on a life of its own. I don't think it's necessary to appreciate the manga to appreciate this anime - in fact, I think the anime takes a much more mature and realistic approach the the story. Others seem to dislike it for its slow pace and the fact that it does not provide immediate gratification. However, I feel that these factors work to create an incredibly realistic story that ends up being very intense, dark and forboding without resorting to obvious symbolism.This anime does not treat you like you're stupid. In watching it, I felt like I wasn't being told a story - instead, I felt like I was bearing witness to a chunk of time, watching the events unfold without needing an upfront explanation. There was no need to watch characters have conversations about the premise for me to understand what led to the events shown in the story.It's not really possible to accurately summarize this story. The plot this anime follows is not the most outstanding aspect of it - instead, the story is just a vessel for the characters and the atmosphere, and I feel it is very rare to see this in anime.Art: 10/10The art in this anime is absolutely breathtaking. The characters are set against frankly stunning backgrounds that remind me of the art in Ghost in the Shell. The repeated images of certain places on Kasuga's route to school showing a somewhat run-down, quiet town beautifully depict the dreary and somewhat oppressive atmosphere of the anime, and really add something to the story.As for the character art, I have never seen another anime done in rotoscope, and I think it made for an incredible experience. The way it captured the realism in the characters' movements and expressions was truly a unique experience, and definitely gave me a feel for the individuality of each character in a way the art in the manga didn't. The episode in which the art really took my breath away was #7. Just watch it. I can't say anything to spoil it because it truly gave me goosebumps.Sound: 10/10The soundtrack was very subtle, but was in perfect sync with the atmosphere at all times. In episode 7, the soundtrack really stood out alongside the art.Character: 10/10Aku no Hana is a slow-burn, very convincingly realistic anime that centers around the 'descent into madness', so to speak, of the lead character Kasuga. It's difficult to explain how realistic the characters and their development over the short period of time really is without giving anything away, however, I will say that I was genuinely taken aback by how realistic the characters, especially Kasuga and Nakamura, turned out to be for me. There is no perfect character in this anime - nobody you can really wholeheartedly love or hate - which is something that makes Aku no Hana so realistic, and, once again, gives the viewer the feeling of simply watching a chunk of time rather than being fed a story.Enjoyment: 7/10The reason this is not a 10/10 is because of the lack of immediate gratification provided by this series. It's an anime it is necessary to almost push through to get to the payoff, but that is because of its realism - there aren't incredibly suspenseful cliffhangers like there would be in a horror or action anime. It's about the internal conflict within Kasuga, and for this reason it's not the kind of series one binge-watches out of sheer addiction to a rollercoaster ride of a story.Overall: 10/10If you enjoy anime that delves into concepts of psychology, good, evil, identity and emptiness, alongside outstanding art/animation, fascinating characters and a highly realistic portrayal of them, this is the anime for you. and fascinating about this anime, but I can't, because it would detract from the series' subtleties for you)Story: 9/10Aku no Hana seems to get a lot of harsh criticism from fans of the manga due to the way the anime cuts off partway through the story with the implication that there will be a second season.

Whether it succeeds or not is up to each individual, but in my personal opinion this anime is a masterful work of art.I am a big fan of experimental art styles and I think the art is striking in an unconventional way. It doesn’t look like a stereotypical anime where the characters are moeblobs and have eyes that take up half of their face. The rotoscoping captures the awkward nuances of being a living, breathing human being. The characters look and act human. The art perfectly fits a show that...is about the uncomfortable and ugly aspects of the world.Aku no Hana is very moody and atmospheric; there are sometimes long stretches of moments without dialogue. The show does an excellent job of capturing the mundane and cyclical nature of everyday life as well as Kasuga’s feelings of alienation and claustrophobia. He is terrified of being ordinary and deludes himself into feeing like he’s above everyone else by reading “sophisticated” books and conjuring grandiose, romanticized delusions.Aku no Hana, much like Baudelaire’s works that the show is named after, evokes the artificial and paradoxical aspects of life. Ensnared in a mire of failure, sin, agony, and moral degradation, with one hand outstretched towards grace and elevation, and the other towards the animalistic and wretched depths. The suffocation of the spirit and the attempt to rise above the sin, decay, and hypocrisy of the world. is about the uncomfortable and ugly aspects of the world.Aku no Hana is very moody and atmospheric; there are sometimes long stretches of moments without dialogue.

I know this is a really late review, but since I finished this one late I think it would be a good one to do for my first review. This Aku no Hana's art was original, and I really thought it was going to be refreshing and well done at first. One thing I could not stand however was the blank faces and zoom ins on random characters. Mayu  always made the same faces; such obvious faces that you could tell they were the same. Maybe the zoom...ins and blank faces are not too big of a deal, but in the end it made the anime very dull and boring to watch. The story was really good I felt it would be one you would either really enjoy, or just not understand the meaning. The ending made me feel empty and not complete, but maybe it was just meant for you to not understand and wonder about what they were going to become. I fell in love with the song at the end. It's honestly hard to even call Kasuga a character. His idenity was completely warped during the whole series by his angel Saeki, or by the devil named Nakamura. Nakumara changed an easily resolvable situation into hell. She changed Kasugas whole personality showing how his mind was so easily warped. Honestly when it comes down to it this anime was not one where I would try to finish it in one night. I usually wasn't too excited to watch the next episode, but I felt I had to finish it to know what was going to happen next.

Just as a had originally thought, I had to force myself through most of it until the last few episodes.Characters: The anime just does not seem to do a great job of placing the main characters into their respective age group as defined by the anime. Which left me with a subjective view of the characters from the very beginning. The only attribute that fit Nakamura and Kasuga from their age-group was childishness. The way they acted about their situations was interesting, complex, and childish at the...same time. They will at times leave you confused and struggling to understand them but try not to put too much thought into it. (Kasuga kind of pisses me off but, hey, nothing I can do about his character development.)Story: The story in itself can hold your interest but it feels like a lot of meaningless emphasis was put on the boredom of the town. I understand the fact that it was meant to be that way, but it only required a minute or two of that emphasis at most per episode to get that point across.

They will at times leave you confused and struggling to understand them but try not to put too much thought into it. (Kasuga kind of pisses me off but, hey, nothing I can do about his character development.)Story: The story in itself can hold your interest but it feels like a lot of meaningless emphasis was put on the boredom of the town. I understand the fact that it was meant to be that way, but it only required a minute or two of that emphasis at most per episode to get that point across.

I don't know how to describe the string arrangement at the end of episode 7. Its placement in the entire series is directed incredible. Highlighting potential the most important pivotal moment of the series. It almost had me reduced to a babbling idiot :) I'm only half way though but already holy moly, this is a masterpiece.The sound design is sublime.

Highlighting potential the most important pivotal moment of the series. It almost had me reduced to a babbling idiot :)"", ""This is the anime you watch when you want to forget that you're watching anime. Take the synopsis for example. You've probably seen that plenty of times before. However, awkwardness and perversion that would be played for laughs in any other anime are laid bare for the viewer in Aku no Hana. This is done in the most uncomfortable and honest way possible. In the same manner. the rotoscoping only barely conceals the honest, living faults and imperfections of our characters. This technique allows for the creators to give us the illusion of animation. The bright colors can only do so much to mask the...oppressive reality that bleeds through in their every movement.No matter how you look at it, this is a character driven story. Kasuga is our main. We follow him on his walks to and from school every day. The beautifully illustrated backgrounds showcase the rust, decay, and weeds that seem to take over his town and that make up the monotony of his daily life. It is this monotony, this slow moving boredom whose pace becomes the pace of this series, that seems to drive him to Baudelaire and books. Not to mention the decay of the city is a theme taken straight from Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal. (It's not only the title).The tragedy of Kasuga's character is his misunderstanding of his own identity, and most importantly: love.(It is important to note, these are only middle school students!)Initially, Kasuga takes an approach from literature, he only wishes to love Saeki, his crush, in the most pure way possible. In his mind, this is tantamount to using her as his 'muse.' As selfish as this is, this limitation that he has placed on himself further drives him away from the decaying city and the people who live there. He looks down on them as apes, refusing to see Saeki as one, and thus strives to become more than an ape himself. It is through an impulsive action, stealing her gym clothes, that Kasuga shocks himself into having to admit a part of his own nature.Enter, Nakamura. Fully believing in her own apeness, she sees Kasuga as someone who is close to fully becoming a deviant. Nakamura's identity is wrapped up entirely in that of the deviant. This limitation she places on her self is similar to what we see with Kasuga initially. However, Kasuga is unable to hold on to the identity he has created for himself, and replaces it with the one Nakamura has constructed. Going from one extreme to the other, Kasuga becomes confused about the nature of his own deviancy, thinking of it as freedom that will 'burn this fucking town to the ground.' Of course, we should know, at least, that freedom is not about being unbound. Their desire to escape both physically and mentally from their surroundings can be chalked up to their youth, but also their damaged psyches. They are truly people who are unable to  understand and cope with their own behaviour, They're not even sure how they want to behave, in some instances! This naive misunderstanding of love, deviancy and freedom is pretty much what defines Kasuga and Nakamura. Despite any similarities they are both very deep characters in their own right, and their development is done in a satisfactory way, despite it being frustrating for me.Saeki may be the most interesting character. She is neither angel nor ape. Kasuga is shocked to be approached by a 'flesh and blood' Saeki, however, Saeki is not put off by Kasuga's impulsive, 'deviant' action.  Her seeming understanding of 'deviance' is the healthiest of our main trio. Because she sees the necessary interplay between love and lust, the balance that makes us who we are. She is even able to understand Kasuga's behaviour, despite him being ignorant of it himself. When she articulates this to him we can see how different their characters really are. She is not a deviant in the way Nakamura wants Kasuga to be, nor the way in which Kasuga is scared to see her as. Saeki and her relationship with Kasuga may be the most frustrating and tragic  aspect of the series.My interpretation is that Aku no Hana is a character-tragedy, however others can interpret it in any way they wish. Depending on your outlook, you may agree more with the author/creator. (This frustrating aspect is why I'm giving it an 8, but that's just me).I'd recommend this series to anyone who desires to see a very interesting character study. At times I thought the authors/creators intentions were just as naive as some of these characters, however Aku no Hana is a strong series, and one of the better coming of age stories I have seen.

If you are in this kind of mood or immature, just run away from this.What i often praise about the art of Manga and Anime is the easiness that these artists have in creating new stories and new unlimited emotional concepts. There are no barriers standing like the ones mainstream content suffers in the western world.This anime is psychologically terrifying. It's a masochist spectacle than bring depravity in your face. Characters are running themselves into the ground at an astonishing speed...in a way you find hard to understand.Among all this repugnant mess of kids destroying themselves for no apparent reason, you'll find yourself drowning in their struggle and you'll feel hooked on these lives like never before.And by the end of it all, it's nothing but another love story. A staggeringly different one from all the other you have seen before. Something really new and that leaves you with an impact lingering in your mind for weeks.Finally, about the art. Good lord. Some of the most gorgeous backgrounds ever made in anime story and a weird way to present the characters. First, you find it strange and unappealing. They chose to actually FILM the characters and then to transfer an manga like animated version of it into the series.The mix between vibrant and realistic backgrounds and these cartoon like characters will more than probably put you of... for a couple of minutes!.Thing is, the expressions captured by real live actors are unbeatable. The way that it helps the narrative is astonishing and it perfectly fits the need of real emotion on the characters once that we are talking about a story that will rip your guts inside out.This was one of the greatest anime i ever saw. in a way you find hard to understand.Among all this repugnant mess of kids destroying themselves for no apparent reason, you'll find yourself drowning in their struggle and you'll feel hooked on these lives like never before.And by the end of it all, it's nothing but another love story.

It can be viewed as a love story, a love triangle even. Or, a phycological journey that the main male character goes through from start to finish. Our protagonist is an introverted guy. He is shy, awkward, and spends his time reading books. He has a little crush on his class mate, Saeki. Yet he never got the courage to confess his feelings for her, especially that she is the main topic of the guys in his class. However our introverted guy’s life is changed forever when he finds Saeki’s gym clothes after...school one day.Aku no Hana combines the complexities of romance, with psychology. The gym uniform becomes the biggest component in our protagonist’s journey to Saeki’s heart while trying to conceal the fact that he is the one who has her gym uniform. His very own shyness and fear lead him to befriend the class’ outcast student. A girl with no friends, one who does not respect anyone. With these elements: A crush, a stolen gym uniform, a witness who uses her knowledge to blackmail the guy, and you have the whole that is Aku no Hana. This nature complex of the show, the psychological nature of the events and the behavior the characters display has not appealed to many.It is dark in nature, the mood of the anime is reflected in colors; the sky is always grey in color. It reflects what is going trough with our guy, Kasuga Takai. He is quite, and miserable most of the time; engaging with inner monologues to try and reason with himself. However none of his monologues has lead him anywhere, nor did they provide him with answers. He seeks salvation and a way to redeem himself.The three main characters in this anime are the min component of the show. Introverted shy Kasuga. Beautiful, soft-spoken Saeki, and the trouble maker, Nakamura. Having all three combined together spells trouble. Having found Saeki’s gym uniform and found out by Nakamura was the beginning of Kasuga’s plight. He is a coward, hesitant, and a defeatist. He cannot voice his thoughts or even be assertive about them. He is easily goaded by Nakamura who uses him as she pleases, he is the perfect prey for her to toy with. Saeki is quite oblivious to what is happening; all she knows is that Kasuga likes her and that is it.The characters are what makes this show. They are the driving force that gets everything moving. The focus is only on those three; it is all that is needed to get the plot moving. Their actions and interactions makes up the greatest part of the anime. The characters represent extremes: good/innocence and evil, and the one tossed in between. Nakamura lies at the evil/experience end, with Saeki on the other good/innocence end. Kasuga is in between them, he is somewhat of an innocent inexperienced guy, who has to experience things he is not very comfortable with, yet he has no choice in the matter.It is similar to life’s experience; what we go through pushes is to make stands we might not be comfortable with, yet we have to do them anyways. Those three are a representation of life, how everyone starts off as an innocent inexperienced person, and as they grow and go through different phases of life they become more knowledgeable and sometimes downright evil. It is that experience that shapes us an make us who we are.What really sets the mood for this anime, and also adds to it’s theme is the art. Aku no Hana is quite realistic; the mundane everyday life of school kids. Getting involved in deviant actions and the psychological spiral Kasuga goes through. He is a miserable boy, that’s for sure. He rarely, if ever, smiles. The art reflects his persona very well. The atmosphere is dark, the sky is always grey, and everything is not so colorful despite it being colored. The colors are sort of dull, they are just there, but they don’t shine or stand out. They just blend into the background and the overall grey-ness of the sky.Decadence of human spirit is seen through the colors and buildings as well. They are old, broken down, decayed, and rusty. Baudelaire is mentioned throughout, his very own Les Fleurs du mal (Flowers of Evil) is what moves the plot, not to mention the title of the anime. Baudelaire’s Flowers of Evil poetry depicts decadence and eroticism, which is what this anime is about. The art plays out these two themes, by the background colors and the designs of the buildings and roads. Decadence is seen clearly in the buildings and signs, the colors nearly gone due to their age and rust.Sounds are very simple; there are no elaborated musical peaces to accompany heated dialogues. When two characters argue, the only sounds come from them, their yells and intakes of breath. The musical pieces are quite and they get higher in tone when intensity picked up in some situations. The sounds simplicity adds further to the theme; it serves as an extension to the characters (mainly Kasuga’s) thoughts and feelings. The low tones reflects his inner weakness and lack of motivation, and as they get higher we see how he becomes more determined and speaks up. The sounds serve their purpose, to further add to the overall atmosphere and the mental state of the characters.The Ending theme is very innovative, and quite catchy.Aku no Hana is not an anime many would love and enjoy. It provokes more questions than answers; the slow pacing, and the inner monologue of the main character provide the main component of the show. It deals with the self; how one views themselves and how they react when pulled out of their comfort zone. Would they try to adapt? Or would they snap?Aku no Hana does not provide you with comfort; on the contrary. It pushes you out of your comfort zone, engages your senses, get on your nerves, and doesn’t give you the answers you seek. Not only for the viewers, but for the characters themselves. It pushes and pushes, until they snap, and when they do? Things start to get out of hand. This anime is thought provoking, keeps you guessing what is going to occur next. It shocks you, repulses you, and alienate you. It throws you in this vortex with no way out, from the minute is starts until the credits roll after the final episode. school one day.Aku no Hana combines the complexities of romance, with psychology.

There are three principal characters.The first of the three is the protagonist, Kasuga Takaro an introverted and widely read third year middle school student.  He lives at home with both parents.  His mother is a typical housewife, usually cooking dinner.  Kasuga’s father is also a bookworm and passes along reading suggestions including the eponymous “Aku no Hana,” a collection of poems by the mid-Nineteenth Century French author, Baudelaire.The book, “Aku no Hana” has a profound...effect on Kasuga, although he confesses that he doesn’t understand the text completely.  While there are no direct quotes from the work, the anime suggests that “Aku no Hana” has an existential quality, one that has a greatly affect young readers who are dealing with self-identity.The quest for self-identity develops in a depressing setting.  Kasuga describes his isolated town as “rust, gaming parlors, and weeds.”  It is surrounded by mountains which act as both a natural and figurative “fence” to be crossed.  Striking down barriers and fences is the mission of the second principal character, Nakaumra Sawa, another introverted and troubled classmate of Kasuga’s.  She defies authority and the “system,” showing blatant disrespect to her teachers and refusal to participate in exams, turning in blank pieces of paper.  She is very intelligent and insightful with a strong judge of character, but is greatly troubled.   Her search for a kindred spirit leads her to Kasuga.The third character is the class star, straight A student, popular, bright, brilliant and beautiful Nanako Saeki.  Kasuga is smitten and while his male classmates make fun of his attraction to Saeki, fate twists a triangle of angst and attraction that bring all three together.Kasuga, while going home realizes that he has left a book in his desk.  He returns to an empty classroom, gets the book, but notices Saeki’s used gym clothes that have fallen out of her locker.  He sniffs the gym clothes and in a moment of indiscretion, steals the clothes.   Kasuga believes that he is alone, but Nakamura has seen him.Kasuga encounters Nakamura on a bike path.  They talk, and she climbs on to the back of his bike, saying, take me to the other side of that mountain pointing to a distant hill.  She has discovered another “hentai” such as she describes herself.  She threatens to expose him as a pervert if he doesn’t do what she asks.In the following days in class, Nakamura is falsely accused of stealing lunch money.   Kasuga defends her, saying that she did not, and that the accusations are groundless.   Saeki is impressed with Kasuga’s courage to stand up for what’s right.  Later they meet and Saeki discovers that there is a lot more to Kasuga than what first impressions tell.  They date and begin a romantic relationship.Thus the triangle is formed.  Kasuga has moments of courage, but more often than not, his cowardly side wins out and he runs away.  Saeki is hurt by his actions, but as the story unfolds, she begins to understand that she has no real identity.  Everything she has done, study, cram school, piano lessons, etc .have all been imposed by her parents and teachers.Nakamura continues to have a profound effect on Kasuga as well as Saeki.  She says that she is determined to break down the walls that they have built around themselves.  Three young teenagers, each with character defects placed in an isolated setting and being influenced by Baudelaire’s esoteric  poetry sets the tree on a path to disaster.I was drawn into the story and followed it intently, not being sure where things would lead, but having a strong hunch.You will have to watch the remainder of the anime to see how things turn out.

The plus side is, besides the great theme, that it goes places you couldn't imagine.The purpose and the message of this work is really cloudy in the beggining, which is the part they managed to transform into an anime, but as it continues you understand it better.The animation style is really diferent and really matches the story. The characters don't get behind in quality, alhtough they didn't have time to develop a lot in the first season, in my opinion, with the exception of Kasuga.I'ts really sad...they didn't do the whole story, it'd be the bomb :((If you have watched it already, I definitely recomend reading the manga. To those who have already read it, I'd also recomend you watch the anime. they didn't do the whole story, it'd be the bomb :((If you have watched it already, I definitely recomend reading the manga.

Well come Aku no Hana, and as intriguing as the visuals of the flower of evil, the trailer and the first episode were, it just goes nowhere, it doesn't pick up up, the ratio of psychological tension to the events happening is unbalanced, so you have a bombshell moment that leads nowhere, it defeats the point of watching a show when there is no pay off.So enduring 12 episodes of a wimpy male lead, the same bit over and over, a ditzy love interest, a sadistic purposeless bully was...all for nothing, and if you're thinking well maybe the source material has the answers, nope, it only gets more underwhelming after the show is over.The art isn't worth it, I don't mind the style as much but it definitely caused the show to suffer, all in all, a waste of time, not worth perusing, you can read the entire story summary of off Wikipedia if still you're curious, but you're not missing much. all for nothing, and if you're thinking well maybe the source material has the answers, nope, it only gets more underwhelming after the show is over.The art isn't worth it, I don't mind the style as much but it definitely caused the show to suffer, all in all, a waste of time, not worth perusing, you can read the entire story summary of off Wikipedia if still you're curious, but you're not missing much."", 'I was immediately intrigued when I started watching Aku no Hana. The rotoscoping adds to the atmospheric nature of the show and further gives a much more chilling influence. The ED builds on to the already heavy tone the episode ends on hence it creates quite an impact to the otherwise mundane life of our MC. This is a rollercoaster of a ride, which has shaken me in ways I didn\'t think possible. Dark and gritty, with depravity and morality going hand-in-hand, this remarkable coming-of-age story will hook you in. You\'ll either love it or hate it but you will not come out as a...winner, that\'s for sure.I\'d gone through a range of emotions every episode. I was excited, sad, angry, depressed, happy, shocked, but I was mostly livid. The entire runtime of this anime, I was on my toes, sitting at the edge of my seat. It is that emotionally engaging and TAXING because of how invested you are with each character. I felt incredible heaviess at the end of every episode; I felt exhausted because of the psychological and emotional turmoil.This anime is the perfect example of the saying ""a person is the company he keeps"" and, sadly, puberty is a difficult place to be in when emotions run rampant and confusion is evident within every action. Hormones play a villainous role and it is the age when cringe is common and mistakes are made. However, that is also when we learn and find ourselves. At one point I just threw the towel in because character development be damned, we’ve full-blown hit delusion valley.Be careful, kids. Reading books can turn you in to a sociopath. This show has made me understand why the ancestors have been burning and banning books since eons. Understanding the text is different but pretending to understand something really wreaks havoc within us, mind and soul, and sometimes in order to fully understand certain context or concepts, it\'s important to have empathy and a degree of relatability. When you have neither, you won\'t have it easy.I now feel for parents when they say “we’ve raised our child wrong” because the older we get, we forget it’s more about outside influences than anything else. It’s one click, one tick, one trigger. Provocation amplifies something already within us and not always for the better. It’s worse for those who have lived sheltered lives and are set on a predetermined path instead of choosing it for themselves, like Saeki.Now that Nakamura’s family life has been shown, I’m not surprised she comes from a broken home. However, does she blame her father for the divorce? If so, that’s highly unfair. I’m sure her mother chose to leave and that is who she might be emulating by wanting to leave the town. I don’t want to assume but we don’t have the full backstory yet but her father and grandmother seem decent enough. Maybe she has misunderstood how the divorce happened and who’s at fault since she was just 5 but she seems to think everyone is lying behind a guise of normalcy and respect. I’m intrigued by Nakamura’s character and what goes on in her head. She’s, by far, the most complex out of everyone in this show just because we haven’t delved in to her life to fully understand her psyche.Every episode was brilliant, full of raw energy and pent-up emotions, especially in the last-half. Beautiful, heart-wrenching, with such heavy atmosphere that lightens your soul at the end, surprisingly. The voice acting, especially Nakamura’s, is first-class. The entire show feels so natural, and real, that I kept forgetting I was watching an anime. I’d been captivated with the eyes throughout the show. I’m in love with the rotoscoping effect; it just pulls at your heartstrings. I love the animation style and it makes me mad how underrated this show is!The complexity of the characters’ emotions and the growth in their personalities is relatable and brings so much depth to the entire premise of the show.The ED is brilliant, as is the OP, since the tone of both changes with every episode.This is not a light watch but it is worth it and anime being open-ended was a good decision. I can’t wait to read the manga now since the show basically covers about 40% of the manga.An innocent boy makes a mistake because he is frightened and his mind was flustered, a girl aids this boy because of her own twisted and convoluted mindscape of despair and depravity and forced him to become someone much more sinister than he actually is, in turn further ruining this boy’s reputation when he simply could’ve listened to his conscience and confessed early on.I’m livid about Takao being such a coward and running away when Saeki deserves to know the truth; I’m livid for Saeki being such a sweetheart but her apologising for an idiot’s actions when she has nothing to do with it I understand but I don’t have to approve of this unwarranted validation from a male. She deserves better. She did nothing wrong except try to be there for someone who wasn’t even there for her when she needed him to be. I am equally distraught over Nakamura’s intentions and the direction she decided to help Takao towards.I’m just glad Takao finally made a decision and evolved from a weak, spineless, wanna-be deviant to someone who now truly understands who they are and what they want.At the same time, sweet Saeki\'s downward spiral just caused havoc in my brain and heart and I wish things could\'ve turned out a bit differently for all of them and I keep coming to the one who pushed everyone\'s buttons: Sawa Nakamura.I was ready to hate someone but I feel for them all and understand them, in more ways than one.This anime showcases the worst of human nature and how even the kindest, most compassionate of people are forced to look at themselves in a negative light while losing what makes them special but regaining a semblance of digity and honesty as they grow up and learn from mistakes. Just as Takao mentions horror and laughter being two sides of the same coin as they warrant an element of surprise, love and deviance come out to be two sides of the same coin. We\'re surprised but understand that in order to gain something, we must lose something precious; in this case it is innocense. All three MCs lose their innocense, chipping away at the illusion of decency, to come face to face with life\'s a well as their own perverse selves. winner, that\'s for sure.I\'d gone through a range of emotions every episode.

Negatively speaking, I wish the dynamic between Kagusa and Nakamura was established with a better foundation, her pull didn't seem weighted enough for me as pointed out earlier on.The rotoscope doesn't bother me, I think it actually fits the story pretty well. It's realistic and at the same time foreign, the portrayal gives a feeling of alienation to the characters visually while also allowing the uneasy tension and anxiety...resonate with the viewer.

Though after watching it, I can confidently say that it definitely unalike anything I\'ve ever seen. Aku no Hano is something that I didn\'t necessarily get enjoyment out of, but I feel I have to take away immense respect and overall appreciation for the show.Story (8/10): the main story was personally torturous to sit through. It follows main main character Kasuga Takao, a middle school student, who keeps to himself and is...a fan of obscure books. One day as he finds himself faced with the opportunity to take his crush\'s, the angelic Saeki Nanako, gym clothes, so he guiltily does. To his horror, the class pariah Nakamura spots him doing this. She uses the knowledge of Takao having Saeki\'s gym clothes as the ultimate blackmail, forcing him to do terrible things. And if he refuses her, she threatens to tell the class of his actions. This is the main driving factor of the swiftly moving plot, along with an undertone of dark romance. But not only what Nakamura does to Takao made me very uncomfortable, but also the fact they\'re supposed to be middle schoolers. They\'re doing some pretty fucked up shit for just hitting puberty!Art (7/10): the simplistic/realistic art style I thought worked well. A unique story deserves a unique representation, I suppose. I can see how people have issues with it, but overall I thought it didn\'t take anything away, but just added something a little more interesting.Sound (8/10): the varying openings and the super ominous ending theme worked very well with the vibe of the show. The music overall just added a touch of unease, which only triggered more mixed feelings.Character (9/10): the characters are probably the best thing overall. You have the fairly demure, average ""deviant"" Takao contrasting with the outspoken, perverted ""deviant"" Nakamura- which leads to interesting chemistry as they find themselves seemingly entangled with each other. Then you also see the genuinely sweet Saeki, who seems to be Nakamura\'s complete opposite in almost every way. The way the characters interacted got me hooked, and I was very motivated to see if they would ever end up happy.Enjoyment (5/10): I found it very hard to enjoy this show, one of the main ideas of the show being blackmail. I felt terrible for Takao as he went through Nakamura\'s psychotic treatment, and how his character began to twist due to the constant pressure he was experiencing. Also, I grew to despise the concept of deviance, and how Nakamura abused it to slowly chip at Takao\'s sanity. Looking back, I can appreciate the show much more, but as I was watching it, I definitely did not feel the same admiration.Overall, I\'d recommend Aku no Hana to anyone looking for something very psychologically intriguing or something they\'ll be able to feel an array of strong emotions while watching. a fan of obscure books.

Kasuga is a shy middle school student who’s an avid reader, his favorite book being Baudelaire’s ""Les Fleurs du Mal"". One day he notices the girl he loves from a safe distance, Saeki, has left her gym uniform at school. He has loved this girl for a long time but had never been able to act upon it. In a fit of juvenile impulse, he steals the uniform.""Flowers of Evil"" was filmed using rotoscoping, the technique of animating over pre-recorded footage. This brings a sense of natural movement to an...animated world. The contrast between movement and the mores tilted, traditionally rendered backgrounds presents an air of surreal isolation. Being out of place with your world is something most teenagers feel, and this technique brings that emotion to the story in almost every scene.It’s a tale of youthful perversion and manipulation, the turmoils of growing up with such confusing desires and how the world will see them. The animation expertly conveys that confusion, showing characters so fundamentally at-odds with the world around them. All of them are well-developed, and who they start off as in the beginning of the series is not how they end up as.Not one of the main characters is an angel, or (in some cases) even a halfway nice person. But it also helps making them easy to relate to. ""Flowers of Evil"" is not afraid to show the creeps, the perverts, the snobs, the depressing, and the unpleasant. It shows school life exactly for what it really is; a dark, depressing, and at times even scary part of one\'s life. animated world.

Contrary to most other opinions, I actually liked the artstyle and thought it added to the atmosphere. There are no waifus to be found here tho. You have been warned.The underlying theme of the show is to be true to one\'s nature. Not conforming to society\'s standards but instead giving into you carnal desires and acting without fear of consequences. Sadly the show itself fails the litmus test. The story is told from the perspective from the biggest man-pussy in the world. At every scene, the indecisiveness, uncertainty and unwillingness to stand up from himself...radiates out like a beacon which sucks all and any hope the series had. His ""growth"" through the show is his opening up to his masochistic tendencies as he realizes that he loves the person who is essentially making his life a living hell. To pad up the fact that this is all there is to the plot, we have obscure philosophy drone on in the background. This is make people feel that they have seen something deep and original when it really is as shallow as I make it sound. We keep getting quotes from this book ""Flowers of evil"" like its meant to have a deep, significance when in reality it does nothing to add to the show. The main character at around midway in the series confesses that he is an empty man who reads books to make himself feel special. Oh, Kasuga, you are so right. You are indeed an one dimensional character with absolutely no growth throughout the series (finding yourself to be a masochist is not growth)Yeah, yeah, we get it, Kasuga was shit! How about the others? Well, they aren\'t great either. The other mains are Nakamura who is bullying Kasuga as she knows Kasuga\'s secret and Saeki who is a plot element purely meant to act as love interest. Saeki has absolutely no role apart from confessing her love to Kasuga even though no sane person on this pale. blue dot can physically fall in love with him. Seaki\'s thought process is to say ""Why the fuck not!""We spoke first one day ago and you want to ask me for a date? Sure why the fuck not"" ""We just went out on the first date and you want to enter a relationship with me? Sure why the fuck not"" ""I just saw you in the library being physical with another girl and you want me to trust you? Sure why the fuck not"" ""You steal my fucking uniform, completely ruin the classroom, make a mockery of my uniform and put it up for the whole fucking class to see? You want me to understand your broken, weak, pathetic excuse of a mind? SURE WHY THE FUCK NOT"" Saeki is one fucking dimensional with zero presence but to be a foil. Nakamura is the series\' Joker. Evil without a proper explaination why? Oh her parents got divorced. PLEASE UNDERSTAND!! Her character is deep, you just gotta read fucking ""Flowers of Evil"" and understand the deep subteties.This show had so much potential. Kasuga idolizes Saeki. It could have explored Kasuga slowly becoming unenamoured as Saeki shows more of her human side. It could have shown real growth by having Kasuga grow a fucking spine and facing his problems instead of being a whiny, fucking biatch. It could have made Saeki less of a ""Yes lady"" and given her more character. Hell it could have even made Nakamura a tsundere and have her develop feelings for Kasuga (Nvm the last one happens). Nopety, nopety nope. Lets take the most boring path forward and sprinkle it with crappy philosophy to make it seem ""deep"".The story, characters and philosophy are all shallow and poorly thought out. The music and the art on the other hand are truly inspired. The art and music meld together gloriously to create a gloomy, oppresive almost claustrophobic atmosphere. There isn\'t a single joke/light moment in the series. This isn\'t an easy watch and sadly isn\'t an engaging nor a worthwhile one either. 3/10 is my final score. radiates out like a beacon which sucks all and any hope the series had.

This is make people feel that they have seen something deep and original when it really is as shallow as I make it sound. We keep getting quotes from this book ""Flowers of evil"" like its meant to have a deep, significance when in reality it does nothing to add to the show. The main character at around midway in the series confesses that he is an empty man who reads books to make himself feel special. Oh, Kasuga, you are so right. You are indeed an one dimensional character with absolutely no growth throughout the series (finding yourself to be a masochist is not growth)Yeah, yeah, we get it, Kasuga was shit! How about the others? Well, they aren\'t great either. The other mains are Nakamura who is bullying Kasuga as she knows Kasuga\'s secret and Saeki who is a plot element purely meant to act as love interest. Saeki has absolutely no role apart from confessing her love to Kasuga even though no sane person on this pale. blue dot can physically fall in love with him. Seaki\'s thought process is to say ""Why the fuck not!""We spoke first one day ago and you want to ask me for a date? Sure why the fuck not"" ""We just went out on the first date and you want to enter a relationship with me? Sure why the fuck not"" ""I just saw you in the library being physical with another girl and you want me to trust you? Sure why the fuck not"" ""You steal my fucking uniform, completely ruin the classroom, make a mockery of my uniform and put it up for the whole fucking class to see? You want me to understand your broken, weak, pathetic excuse of a mind? SURE WHY THE FUCK NOT"" Saeki is one fucking dimensional with zero presence but to be a foil. Nakamura is the series\' Joker. Evil without a proper explaination why? Oh her parents got divorced. PLEASE UNDERSTAND!! Her character is deep, you just gotta read fucking ""Flowers of Evil"" and understand the deep subteties.This show had so much potential. Kasuga idolizes Saeki. It could have explored Kasuga slowly becoming unenamoured as Saeki shows more of her human side. It could have shown real growth by having Kasuga grow a fucking spine and facing his problems instead of being a whiny, fucking biatch. It could have made Saeki less of a ""Yes lady"" and given her more character. Hell it could have even made Nakamura a tsundere and have her develop feelings for Kasuga (Nvm the last one happens). Nopety, nopety nope. Lets take the most boring path forward and sprinkle it with crappy philosophy to make it seem ""deep"".The story, characters and philosophy are all shallow and poorly thought out. The music and the art on the other hand are truly inspired. The art and music meld together gloriously to create a gloomy, oppresive almost claustrophobic atmosphere. There isn\'t a single joke/light moment in the series. This isn\'t an easy watch and sadly isn\'t an engaging nor a worthwhile one either. 3/10 is my final score.', ""A hidden jewel of the Japanese animation, it excels in every point. The value of what Aku no Hana exposes is priceless, there is no other serie that goes so deep and so well into the human darkest side.The most brilliant yet scaring thing about Aku no Hana is the level of feeling I experienced the whole serie. One gets involved by the situations and emphatize so deep with the protagonist that I can tell I felt all the feelings he did while watching.Story starts common but every twist in the events is unique, characters develop smoothly as rarely seen in animation. Animation technique which...supposedly was a turning down for anime fans   ends up adding the rawness our eye needed to have one the most vivid anime experience until now.Sound is perfectly handed, the opening and the ending couldn't have been better... Nothing else to talk about this masterpiece, it repeals fools that need traditional animation style to watch a relatively unkown serie. supposedly was a turning down for anime fans   ends up adding the rawness our eye needed to have one the most vivid anime experience until now.Sound is perfectly handed, the opening and the ending couldn't have been better...

This is the first and probably last time I\'ll write one.DISCLAIMER: This is written entirely by my interpretation of the story and characters.For starters, I surprisingly don\'t have a problem with the animation. Indeed, the lip sync and some facial expressions sometimes do not match with the intensity of the situation but it wasn\'t actually terrible. I definitely enjoyed seeing a different art style for once. Really looking forward to more of...this animation. It is quite realistic but minimalistic at the same time, which is why I thought it was stunning.The backgrounds and scenery were amazing, I have to admit. Everything is done carefully and with much detail. The people walking around, the cars, everything included made it so calming. If we include the soundtrack to those calm moments, you have truly a beautiful thing to look at as a result.The story. I\'ve seen some call it ""generic"" but I thought it was quite original at first. That is, until it started to have a ridiculous amount of plot holes. Usually, I\'d be okay with only a few but this show left so much blank spaces. I am specially bothered by the vandalism scene, as I believe anyone could have read the text in the board. Maybe it\'s just the way I interpret the story, but sometimes it felt forced. As if it tries so hard to grasp the viewers attention by being ""frightening"" but failing at the attempt. The unnecessarily long shots of the characters walking were hard to look at, it made me just want to skip them as much as I enjoy the scenery scenes.My major problem with Aku no Hana are the characters. I don\'t see how they are so deep or how they had any development at all. Personally, I thought they were as deep as the background characters. Nothing at all.Kasuga seemed interesting at first, as he seems to be carried away by what his friends or family think. He is just a normal teenager that likes dark poetry that he, himself can\'t even understand. Pessimistic and full of discontent with his surroundings. Socially awkward and the typical ""quiet"" and somewhat intellectual student.The adorable Saeki, a girl that one day feels nothing and the other feels everything. The relationship between Kasuga and her is the definition of ""rushed"". There was never an explanation for her sudden feelings for our awkward protagonist. They went in a date in which they barely crossed a word, which makes everything seem even more wrong. She might be the most flat character in Aku no Hana, as there was never a reason for her to overlook how the things Kasuga did, then proceed to insist on wanting to be with him and understand him. Any other person would have either explain their reasons to act this way or run away from Kasuga immediately.Nakamura, the classic ""outcast"" that believes the whole world is full of bullshit and wants to see it burn down to ashes. All she ever does is throw temper tantrums and make Kasuga miserable. The boy that wanted to be free, is now stuck with someone that orders him around and humiliates him. Apparently that\'s ""deep"". Now, as well as Saeki, her role in the plot is never given any context. There wasn\'t any explanation for her actions except that she is an angry teenager that wants to run away. A very poor attempt of creating a deep anti-hero.There wasn\'t any depth or character development. My expectations were high for Kasuga, as I waited for him to realize how toxic his relationship with his “sidekick” was. When he realized that Saeki can live without him, I obviously hoped for him to think the same with Nakamura. If he grew as a character and became independent that would\'ve been a shocker, but of course not. I\'d be lying if I said that I didn\'t at least expected him to eventually snap due to all the emotional abuse he was put into and commit murder.To finish. I was surprised by how poorly the writing in Aku no Hana is. It did had much potential. Certainly, it was a failed attempt to create an extravagant, original and full of meaning psychological drama story.If there is ever part 2, I can only hope that the creators will do a better job with the writing and the attempts for a frightening atmosphere.Extremely disappointing. this animation.

I completed the manga not too long ago and enjoyed it, however  this anime kind of had the feeling I was completing a task rather than enjoying it.The first downside to this anime is the art and animation. The method they used is rotoscoping. It felt like a lagging video game. The options available for animation are far and wide it is beyond why they used this method. I don't know if this was a purposeful decision to be more artistic and the such, but it came off as a little pretentious. It's a shame because the art...aspect of environmental drawings looked really good and very detailed. If there is a second season I hope they improve on this by using a different method.I liked the story overall, but at times it came off as trying a little too hard. I understand this anime was going to be slow paced but not this slow paced. There was basically one half an episode of two characters walking through the town with no talking. The manga version of this Anime presented the story in a much better way. A person who never read the manga and ended up watching this show would probably find it confusing as to why characters did what they did.The sound in this anime pretty good. Opening and ending themes were fitting of this sort of anime genre, as well as the voice actors portraying their characters.The characters were all pretty melodramatic. If you like that sort of thing good for you, but I don't. Lets start off with the main character Takao Kasuga. Kasuga is a half-wit for lack of better words. He has no mind or will of his own. Then we have Sawa Nakamura who is clearly certifiable. I guess that is part of her appeal. Finally, we have Nanako Saeki who is in my opinion is the most well-rounded character. She is the girl that is smart, athletic, and good looking. Basically every guy in the class wants to be with her. She spends a lot of time crying. Throughout the series the characters deteriorate instead of progress forward. Maybe in the second season we'll see more character development. The characters reactions overall were unrealistic. This is the kind of anime that aims to be realistic but instead comes off as extremely exaggerated. I feel like you can enjoy the show more when you have a character in it that you can personally relate to, but that was missing here for me. I find Yamada to be the most entertaining character even though his part is small. At least he is the comedic relief in an otherwise dull anime. aspect of environmental drawings looked really good and very detailed.

But as anyone who\'s ever climbed out of their teenage years can understand, it\'s a fairly hollow and superficial subject. What\'s normal is obviously subjective, and the idea of being a ""deviant"" is only a persona we assign ourselves or others to catagorize the world in a quantitative, but ultimately futile, way. We wouldn\'t want to...face a world where we\'re all just humans, we have to put everyone in pens and assign them roles and scales and numbers and quantities so that we can imagine an order to the chaos. (Easily seen in almost every anime where characters are fit neatly into stereotypical roles). At least the roles of these characters weren\'t the usual anime stereotypes. I\'ll give them that. But it clings to the theme like Kate Winslet on a peice of the Titanic... gripping it for dear life because it\'s the only life line. I suppose that\'s my main problem with the show. Life doesn\'t center around a central theme.Sawai comes off as someone who simply has ""small town syndrome"". She\'s basically just bored with the small world around her, living in a small town. Her obsession with ""breaking down walls"" of normalcy is nothing more than an over glorified fight against cabin fever. She\'s also not a deviant... or rather, she\'s a ""forced deviant"". A real deviant wouldn\'t go around saying that word all the time, nor would they recognize that there were ""walls to break down"" inside oneself because they never would have had those walls to begin with. They just go about their ""deviant"" life acting ""deviously"", maybe realizing that others see them as different, but not really able to grasp how different they are and why.Takao, the main character, is a drama queen (which is especially off putting because he\'s a GUY). He sees the world in the color of poetry, and it makes his world view unrealistically idealistic and emotional... which is why he idealized Saeki as some sort of object or idea instead of a human. He wants to quantify the world, but in an emotional, qualitative way (if that makes any sense).Saeki, of coarse, is just a normal inexperienced girl, who jumped on the chance to explore a new facet of life (dating). She wanted it so bad she was willing to put up with that sad sack Takao. Kind of pathetic, and not too enjoyable to watch.The story is slow paced, which is nice. It matches the background music / sound well, and helped stretch out the show\'s lack of  content. Nothing really gets faced or resolved despite the many confrontations, especially due to the main character\'s reluctance to face life (he\'d rather hide in a book he doesn\'t really even understand). I don\'t even know if you can call the last scene a resolution, but, there may be hope.

I remember reading the description of the series and the feeling of my brain oozing out of my ears due to the confusion I had endured within that twenty second time-frame. But that description alone brought no justice to what was soon going to grace the TV screens of many unsuspecting Japanese citizens. Ladies and gentlemen, please strap on your seat belts because we are about...to embark on a 13-episode flight with major turbulence and no pilot.Aku No Hana, based on the manga by Shuuzou Oshimi,  puts us behind Takao Kasuga, an introverted middle-school boy. Takao lives at home with his parents, who seem relatively normal. Both Takao and his father share a passion for reading, which ultimately leads to Takao\'s father lending his son a copy of Charles Baudelaire\'s ""Le Fleurs du mal"" or ""The Flowers of Evil."" For those unfamiliar with the content of ""Le Fleurs du mal,"" keep it that way if you know what\'s good for you. For after reading the book, Takao\'s behavior changed. And by no means was that change for the better.The next day in school, Takao wanders into his classroom after school and winds up stealing the gym clothes of his crush (Nanako Saeki.) However, he was not alone at that time. He was spotted by another female classmate (Sawa Nakamura) and called out on it in private. Fearful of this act of deviancy escaping unto his classmates, Takao joins into a ""contract"" with the girl who spotted him. But this is no ordinary contract, this girl aims to break him down, piece by piece.What the description of this anime on various websites will NOT tell you is that it is the journey into the terrifying minds of several different deranged teenagers, struggling to grow up and live normal lives. It strays from the typical character advancement that is commonly depicted in currently-airing shows, and focuses more on the dark undertones of what confused children can wind up doing without the attention or the help they need. The beautiful thing about this show, however, is just how completely dependent our three main characters are on each other.I have dissected the anime into a few key components to better illustrate the different aspects of it.Music: 9/10I fell in love with the soundtrack of this anime the second the first opening song came on. Being so unlike anything I\'ve ever heard in an anime before, I was extremely taken aback. Each of the three main characters winds up getting their own opening song, but the best part of this is that the lyrics within their respective songs all apply to the internal conflicts the characters face in some way or another. The BGM during the actual show will make you feel incredibly uncomfortable, while as the ending song will creep you the hell out and leave you suspended in mid-air until the next episode. This soundtrack was almost perfect.Characters: 9/10Never before have I witnessed characters as dark, and yet realistic, as this. Takao is a boy struggling to fit in, trying to cast away his problems and live a normal life. But he keeps getting sucked back in by Sawa Nakamura, an isolated and incredibly deranged girl that knows no boundaries and will say whatever she wants to say to whoever she wants to say it to. All the while, Nanako Saeki is sitting on the sidelines and internally disintegrating. My favorite part of this entire series was just watching her character basically destroy itself from the inside out. It was truly fantastic.Art: 6/10Here is the falling point of the series. The art within Aku No Hana is completely rotoscoped. Or in other words, it looks like shit. Being so different from the art in the manga, this aspect drove many viewers away within the first five-ten minutes of the show. Character\'s faces don\'t appear until they are closer to the imaginary camera, lines are constantly fading in and out, it just doesn\'t look good. HOWEVER, it is just this that makes you feel so much more uncomfortable while watching. The characters look so incredibly odd and the rotoscoped art style displays real facial expressions, rather than typical animated ones we have seen time and time again.Story: 9/10I\'ve always been a fan of darkness when it comes to a story.

And watching these characters fall deeper and deeper into darkness is what makes Aku No Hana astounding.', 'Flowers of Evil (or Aku no Hana) is one of the most divisive anime of the past few years. Many decry it as an ugly waste of time, while others praise it for being a brilliant work of artistic expression. Seeing as it ranks this high on my all-time favorites, it is obvious where I stand in this argument. Flowers of Evil is as core-shaking an experience as I have ever had watching an anime. It is a show that so perfectly frames itself in the minds of its disturbed characters that it is honestly frightening.The story is one of adolescent angst, insecurity, anger, and...sexual deviance. It follows Takao Kasuga, an introverted middle school student who has a love for literature and a distaste for most of his classmates, even those he frequently associates with. The one person he doesn\'t think badly of is his crush, Nanako Saeki, whom he idolizes but hardly has any interaction with. That is until one evening, in a single moment of horrible judgment, he goes through Saeki\'s P.E. uniform and ends up sneaking off with it in a panic when he thinks he might get caught. Unfortunately, he was seen by someone, resident trouble child Sawa Nakamura, who blackmails him into a ""contract"" with her. From here the show becomes a slow- burning nightmare of adolescence, digging into the darkest recesses of the teenage psyche.If it isn\'t already evident, Flowers of Evil centers around deeply flawed, fairly despicable teenagers. Needless to say, they aren\'t exactly the most likeable of characters. They are, however, incredibly interesting ones. Kasuga is an accurate and brutally honest depiction of a disgruntled teenage misfit who reasons the fact he doesn\'t fit in because he\'s special and that \'no one else understands him\'. Kasuga is rather asocial, preferring to spend his free time reading rather than socializing with his classmates. He idolizes Baudelaire, but has no admiration for the people in his life (except Saeki). He looks down on most of his classmates for not being as well-read as him, but paradoxically doesn\'t want them to think badly of him despite actively isolating himself from them. Like many teens, he\'s self-absorbed yet lacks self-control and maturity, which makes him very susceptible to Nakamura\'s poisonous influence.Nakamura, on the other hand, clearly doesn\'t give a damn what anyone thinks of her; she\'s violently antisocial and her contempt for everyone around her is palpable. Her foul mouth is only matched by the bleakness of her outlook. She takes pleasure in her wanton harassment of Kasuga, and seems happiest when she is prodding him into doing something wrong. Yet behind all the malice, there is something humanly broken about her. Through glimpses into her personal life and the rare crack of vulnerability in her otherwise sadistic demeanor, it is shown that Nakamura is a self-loathing individual who\'s frustration manifests in her nihilistic worldview.Rounding out the central characters is Kasuga\'s crush, Saeki. Unlike the other two leads, she\'s actually fairly popular at school and seems like a perfectly well rounded teenager... at least at first. The layers of her nice girl image are peeled back as she becomes entangled with Kasuga and Nakamura in a twisted love triangle, revealing deep seeded insecurities. For as popular as she is, Saeki perceives herself as a painfully unremarkable and empty person. She sees Kasuga as someone interesting because of his love for literature, and wants to be close to him because of this. Her uneasiness about his relationship with Nakamura leads her to have an unhealthy possessiveness over him. This is where the brilliance of the narrative lies. Where most other anime are picturesque in their depiction of adolescence, Flowers of Evil is biter and uncomfortable; enveloped in never ending melancholy. While it mighty be overwhelmingly bleak, there certainly is truth in this pessimistic version of adolescence, especially for the damaged characters of this warped coming-of-age story.Now, it\'s time to address the elephant in the room, the cause of the controversy surrounding this anime: the art style. Flowers of Evil utilities an animation technique called rotoscoping, in which the animators trace over live-action footage frame by frame. This technique is hardly anything new, it\'s been used in films such as Richard Linklater\'s ""A Scanner Darkly"", and even used for certain scenes in anime. What sets Flowers of Evil apart is the strange lack of detail in the character designs, which needless to say aren\'t the most attractive and a far-cry from those of the source material. This, of course, is what generated the controversy.Strange as this might seem, I think this was a brilliant visual decision. The minimalist character designs contrast with the highly detailed backgrounds, which makes the show look and feel like a waking nightmare. It\'s as if the characters\' negative emotions and warped worldviews are leaking in the visual design; the town is rotting and filled with ""shit-eaters"" as Nakamura would call them.Hiroshi Nagahama\'s direction of this nightmarish tale is impeccable. As with his other works, Nagahama demonstrates his affinity for cinematic flourish. The constant re-use of the same backgrounds creates a constricting atmosphere. Kasuga and Nakamura feel like they trapped in their small town; likewise, the viewer is inescapably stuck in the heads of these immensely screwed up adolescents. The languorous pacing of events captures the ennui and emptiness that the characters feel. The minimalist ambiance of the soundtrack encapsulates the looming dread which permeates throughout the show, punctuated by the sound of rolling thunder. The moments when tension finally snap, such as the classroom destruction scene, are simultaneously cathartic and horrifying; microcosms of teenage frustration in of themselves.Though it doesn\'t adapt the entire manga, and probably never will due to poor Blu-ray sales, Aku no Hana feels like a full experience. It captures the darkest parts of adolescence with its unique aesthetic and brutal honesty. Perhaps most admirably, it is an example of artistic risk taking in a medium that all too often is too commercially driven. sexual deviance. It follows Takao Kasuga, an introverted middle school student who has a love for literature and a distaste for most of his classmates, even those he frequently associates with. The one person he doesn\'t think badly of is his crush, Nanako Saeki, whom he idolizes but hardly has any interaction with. That is until one evening, in a single moment of horrible judgment, he goes through Saeki\'s P.E. uniform and ends up sneaking off with it in a panic when he thinks he might get caught. Unfortunately, he was seen by someone, resident trouble child Sawa Nakamura, who blackmails him into a ""contract"" with her. From here the show becomes a slow- burning nightmare of adolescence, digging into the darkest recesses of the teenage psyche.If it isn\'t already evident, Flowers of Evil centers around deeply flawed, fairly despicable teenagers. Needless to say, they aren\'t exactly the most likeable of characters. They are, however, incredibly interesting ones. Kasuga is an accurate and brutally honest depiction of a disgruntled teenage misfit who reasons the fact he doesn\'t fit in because he\'s special and that \'no one else understands him\'. Kasuga is rather asocial, preferring to spend his free time reading rather than socializing with his classmates. He idolizes Baudelaire, but has no admiration for the people in his life (except Saeki). He looks down on most of his classmates for not being as well-read as him, but paradoxically doesn\'t want them to think badly of him despite actively isolating himself from them. Like many teens, he\'s self-absorbed yet lacks self-control and maturity, which makes him very susceptible to Nakamura\'s poisonous influence.Nakamura, on the other hand, clearly doesn\'t give a damn what anyone thinks of her; she\'s violently antisocial and her contempt for everyone around her is palpable. Her foul mouth is only matched by the bleakness of her outlook. She takes pleasure in her wanton harassment of Kasuga, and seems happiest when she is prodding him into doing something wrong. Yet behind all the malice, there is something humanly broken about her.

Let me explain it.If you were to ask a stranger what do they associate with Anime, they would either answer with silence or label it as ""disturbing japanese stuff"". Which, when you think about it, isn\'t necessarily that far from the truth. No one will be shocked by the fact an anime protagonist is a 14 year old girl with big breasts and pink hair. Japanese culture is different, things like that are just accepted. And Anime takes full advantage of the fact that those who don\'t watch don\'t care.And...in such wacky world of anime Aku No Hana was created.The first thing I noticed about Aku No Hana is its pace. It\'s slow. Instead of constantly pandering to the viewer, Aku No Hana methodically achieves its own pace. If you get annoyed by the fact there\'s lots of scenery shots instead of more dialogues and monologues, Aku No Hana isn\'t for you.ARTOne of the strong points of Aku No Hana is definitely the art. It\'s realistic, somber, simplistic and depressive. You feel like the author wasn\'t trying very hard but still displayed human beings a lot more realistically than 99% of other animes do. There are not many bright colors, in fact Aku No Hana is dominated by grey, and I found that very fitting. No complaints from me, I can only conclude that the artwork was outstanding.SOUNDThe opening themes were ok, but nothing that you\'ll remember two weeks after watching the series. The background music is very fitting, ranging from quiet piano pieces to sheer silence. The ending theme however was truly something else and a truly remarkable way to end every episode. If you like the series, you\'ll like how it sounds.I quite liked the character development. The main characters face many obstacles throughout the course of the series, and always DO THEIR BEST. I question their morality, but their efforts are impressive. Yet, due to human imperfection most of the time they just flat out fail. And, even when they succeed they often question their decisions and/or feel regret. due to their incompetence. The motives that drive the protagonists are those of disobeying modern society and protecting their friends, which fits their age. You could also interpret it as if their incompetence comes from the lack of experience in life, which is of course due to their age. I didn\'t especially like any of the characters, but that\'s probably the last thing you\'d want from an anime that deals with the topic of life\'s boredom.The story is told not only through the actions of the protagonists, it\'s also told through the great audio-visual work put into this anime. And with all that said I still have to add that I didn\'t enjoy it in the traditional sense of the word. I think that you\'d have to be disturbed for Aku No Hana to bring you joy, and that a psychological horror is a perfect description for it. Aku No Hana is creepy-and creepiness lies between the known and the unknown. And Aku No Hana walks that line almost perfectly. in such wacky world of anime Aku No Hana was created.The first thing I noticed about Aku No Hana is its pace. It\'s slow.

And Aku No Hana walks that line almost perfectly.', ""Honestly, I'm not sure what I expected from Aku no Hana's anime adaptation. (While I haven't read the manga, I hear significantly better reviews about it compared to the anime). The plot seemed quite interesting, but the animation style was what attracted me the most.I feel like rotoscopy was a good way to go for the plot it has, and it does set the work apart from others with similar themes. It seems like the art style was generally underappreciated by viewers, but it definitely added to the plausibility  of the story. The anime generally lacks a soundtrack, but the silence throughout the episodes,...as well as the ending theme, add to the strangeness factor.My real problem with Aku no Hana lies with the characters themselves and their portrayal and development. The three protagonists are incredibly unlikable even after 13 episodes, and there's no real effort shown to convince the viewer to change his/her view on these characters.The anime is a lot darker than MAL's synopsis makes it seem, and the story is interesting to say the least but it is excruciatingly slow. While I personally hope a second season isn't released due to the lackluster storytelling of the first, the first season doesn't seem to have much of a direction alone. If a second season is released, hopefully it will show some redeeming qualities. After all, the flashforward shown in the last episode alone was more interesting than the entire first season.In essence, Aku no Hana wasn't awful, but it did fall short on various aspects. as well as the ending theme, add to the strangeness factor.My real problem with Aku no Hana lies with the characters themselves and their portrayal and development.

I myself was very hesitant to watching this anime because I wasn't used to the art designs of the characters, but as you progress through the anime, you might end up adapting to the appearance of the anime and focus more on the story. But first I want to say, the main protagonist Kasuga,  has no common sense! Why would you...steal sweaty gym clothes in the first place? I know it's because of lust, but still why?!? But if he didn't steal them then we wouldn't have a story will we? Basically our antogonist here which is Nakamura, the girl that knows all about the stealing incedent blackmails Kasuga and forms a contract with him. As we progress through the story we see that Nakamura is a complete sadist and continues to blackmail Kasuga in a very disturbing way that makes you sympathize the main character. Nakamura is certainly a character that would piss of a lot of people including me, but Kasuga is also to be blamed because of his lack of common sense.The psychological part of this anime is well played off and the scenary is a good collateral for the lack of the character design. This anime has its WTF moments and is a good anime, I don't think it deserves a 1 or a 2 like seriously c'mon it's not bad, just give it a chance. Overall my score is 7/10. Although at first it was an 8, the reason I changed it is because the later episodes pissed me off, just personally how dimwitted Kasuga is. steal sweaty gym clothes in the first place?

However, the first part was really well-written and performed. The way it ended (no spoilers here) implies there would be a second part but sadly there isn\'t as its 2016 now. So, a perspective shift is needed at the end otherwise you feel like youre left at somewhat of a cliffhanger.Aku no Hana is in fact, a pretty twisted anime. It\'s not ""edgy"" twisted, or really implausible, either. Basically, the main Character, Kasuga, as said in the description, ends up stealing a gym uniform on total impulse, and this...crazy girl who hangs out in the sidelines sees him.  The girl, Nakamura, is a bad-news bitch who believes that deep down, everyone is very messed up, hiding all their carnal desires and instincts through walls in their hearts.  She sees Kasuga take the uniform and it fills her with excitement that she saw another person acting like a deviant.  She then sets out to force him to do things he thought he never wanted to do, like making him wear those stolen gym clothes while on a date with the girl he stole them from.Now, the whole time I\'m watching this go on, I\'m thinking ""why doesn\'t Kasuga just spill the beans? There are plenty of opportunities like when Saeki, the girl whose uniform he stole, basically makes it clear she would not be upset the slightest if he did it.  Still, I realized this anime wasn\'t about the passing of events regarding the stolen uniform, because well, that would make the plot seem kind of tacky where things got stretched so far out of hand and somehow could get fixed by just telling the truth.  Which, if i\'m being totally honest, is what I wanted it to be about.//""How-I-Feel-It-Ended"" Spoilers//For the first half of the series, I thought it\'d be about how far a lie gets taken and that possibly the truth can set you free.  Then, after a certain point, there was literally no turning back and things got very interesting, but they definitely changed because I knew I\'d recoil if somehow telling the truth fixed Kasuga\'s problems. Instead it became about an evil flower; which, you could say both Nakamura and Kasuga are.  However, Im referring more to Kasuga as he basically becomes evil.  That is the way I saw the anime to suit the ending scenes. crazy girl who hangs out in the sidelines sees him.

The manga was pretty popular with its unique story and very human characters, so readers were avidly looking forward to its animation.I was one of these people who judged the show on its animation without actually watching it and so pushed it way down on my to-watch list.Finally I got around to watching it and all my complaints were completely wiped out. I fell in love with the story...telling style. In my anime watching years I havnt seen an anime so true to its manga. Each shot is so close to the way it was drawn in the manga (Unfortunately this put restrictions on how much of the chapters could be covered in the episodes). Aku no Hana really made me appreciate the depth rotoscoping  can give to a story. (In case you don’t know rotoscoping involves recording scenes in live action and then having animators draw over each footage frame by frame. I think its amazing!)Aku no Hana’s story is very unique. For years movies and books have told stories about adolescence. About how our innocence is snatched away and we finally begin to see the world as it truly is. Raw and corrupted. Aku no Hana attempts to tell the story of a boy, Kasuga, who has a very poetic and romantic view about life. But his ideals are shattered as he gets involved in a spiral of events triggered by his confrontation with the black sheep of his class, Sawa Nakamura. Sawa makes it her duty to tear away the last shreds of innocence kasuga has and reveals to him his own perversion and the grim realities of their small town and existence.The story is kind of heavy but the way it is told is simply remarkable. I loved every moment of watching this show. I got used to the animation pretty quickly and at times even thought that the girls looked pretty cute. The animation style truly complements the subject of the anime and actually makes the scenes more powerful.The soundtrack is amazing. I don’t know if everyone would agree with me here but I fell in love with the track list of Aku no Hana. The openings and endings help carry through the eerie feeling of the plot and especially one scene in the anime just took my breath away. I think I just sat there with my mouth open for a good 20 minutes when I saw the “wrecking the classroom” scene. The track in that scene was Hana – A Last Flower which was used brilliantly, its very hard to explain so you need to see it to know what I mean.My only complaint was that there weren’t enough episodes! I wanted more! Im really hoping and praying that this series gets more season because the story covered in the anime was just the tip of the ice berg (Check out the manga).Aku no Hana breaks away from the typical high school animes that come out one after another with its story and style of animation. It’s a must watch and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. telling style. In my anime watching years I havnt seen an anime so true to its manga.

Something in the style of prison school. The protagonist would a pervert and then a girl who knows it would get him in trouble, giving us decent laughs. Well... THAT\'S NOT THE REALITY. Aku no Hana is a THRILLER, surely. It has drama. And it has all the characteristics from a psychological horror. And this something that makes the anime really good. Nakamura isn\'t a funny girl, she\'s sadistic and crazy and all she wants is to put Kasuga...in trouble. But not because it\'s funny. It\'s because she loves and feel pleasured when she sees him desperate or crying. In one of the scenes, feeling pressured by her mind games, Kasuga has a mental breakdown and starts crying. All Nakamura says is ""I love when you do this face"". I guess you can understand how sick their relation is. The anime makes you tense, since the beggining. You feel the fear, the despair, the agony of Kasuga.ANIMATION AND THE MAIN REASON WHY THIS ANIME GETS HATEAku no Hana is the kind of anime that people can consider either awful or a masterpiece. There\'s no mid term between them. And I\'m on the team of the masterpiece. First of all, let me say something. The main reason why people hate on this anime is because of it\'s animation. People are used to the traditional anime animation, so when there\'s an anime that uses some different kind of animation style, they don\'t like it. And I understand it, it\'s completely normal. I felt really umcofortable with the animation in the first episode, but after that I got used to it and started liking it. It\'s necessary to understand that the animation style isn\'t something random. It\'s not like the producers thought randomly ""oh let\'s make some different"". There\'s a reason behind it and once you understand it, you start appreciating this style animation. The anime focus on the characters body language instead of their faces. That\'s why we barely see the characters faces most of the time, but we can see their bodies moving more fluidly and realistically than in animes that uses the traditional animation style. It\'s not essencial to understand the characters faces, but their body language is what matters, you can feel the emotions by the way their body moves and this is something I loved.But if you don\'t have án open mind, to watch a different style of animation and really enjoy it, you shouldn\'t watch this anime.- This is my first review and also I\'m not a native english speaker, so please forgive my grammar mistakes or if my text isn\'t good at all.

The hyper realistic sounds that sometimes seem underwater, the disturbing dichotomy between overly detailed and simple animation, shockingly slow pace, twitchy transitions, cerebral intensity, overly matured dialogue. All of this makes for a semi-psychedelic nightmare. I almost didn't keep watching at first bc it was actually painful. I am so very glad I persisted because in its entirety this is a work of art. Somehow, all of these different elements came together to create something sort of magical.This series is haunting. It transports you into a twisted but extremely believable version of reality where these kids grapple...with some of the harshest bits of existence like understanding oneself, society's expectations, and the uncouth. The creators were able to encapsulate the exact experience of going through youthful depression and drag you down into it as you watched. with some of the harshest bits of existence like understanding oneself, society's expectations, and the uncouth.

So let\'s talk about newborn babies. Yes, babies are those defenseless creatures that everyone begin their life with. And since they are defenseless, if they fall pray to other humans away from their genetic pool they are in danger. But they have a hidden weapon - being cute. Yes, you humans evolved in a such way to find the youngest of their kind cute, so they do not harm them. But since brain needs a reason and since eyes develop faster than the whole head, babies have greater eyes-to-face ratio. And so, we...have implied program in our brain to find any human face with large eyes-to-face ratio cute. Woman know this secret from centuries and since eyes cannot become bigger, they enhance their eyelashes creating an illusion for big. But is there a limit. Osamu Tezuka answered that as ""no"". The bigger the eyes, the cutter the characters. And so anime/manga trend was born. And masses of people drowned by the big eyes we pulled. No wonder there are so many people that prefer 2D waifu, instead of 3D girlfriend - you can stop watching your waifu at anytime and you know - the eyes.Aku no Hana took different approach, for the first time it actually created an animation with realistic eyes-to-face ratio. And what I read in most reviews, people find characters ""ugly"". Well, Hello, here is the real world and most woman without mascara looks exactly like this. And we are talking about middle-school Japanese girls. Japanese eyes-to-face ratio is smaller than the western. As a result, all those people hyped by waifus and anime, could not comprehend how a real character must look like. Therefore, this anime ends up as a commercial failure, even when it has all quantities to succeed.Now what about the story? Let\'s talk about middle school, this is the start of puberty. At this time the innocent look of the child world is mixed with the ego of the (very) young adolescence. Yes, ego - children are incapable to use theory of the mind and adolescence worry about their image. Given that, we have typical middle school romance, a boy likes a girl, but in his child view he does not see her as a human being, but as an angel, a muse, something unreachable. And then the dilemma happens - he returns to school because he forgot something and surprise, he sees her used gym clothes forgotten in the room. And he steals them, but the lone girl of the class sees him and decide to use what she saw against him.Now, this would be pretty generic anime story, if it was not for the fact that the way relations form between the characters and the way the characters can escape from their mundane norms in order to do something crazy. The freedom they experience going against the rules and being in a hot situation build their unusual relation. Yet, our MC is too dense to see, but it is not density like other anime, it is density about his ego. How he react according to how the world he imagine, not to the world he is actually in. How living in a small town, building an image (as a reader of convoluted literature), and presenting his own view onto the people does not actually matter. It is a way the character discover himself while being pushed by Nakamura. It makes all situation funny and I had genuine laugh, while this was not a comedy.The characters are quite likable and experiences they have are amazing. While it is quite difficult to break up from the anime/manga norm of the big eyes, eventually getting use to it, allows you to comprehend the dialogues between characters the same as any other anime. The tension of hiding unconformable secret from you crush while date her is really amazing. The freedom when the MCs destroyed their classroom. It was unique. However, it might be somehow difficult to relate to. While all the vandalism they did is small in my view, it was approached in such a way by the teachers, that it was like a huge crime. I suppose part of it, ""Aku no Hana"" relates something about Japanese middle school culture, I cannot feel (I understand it, I cannot relate to it).As sound ""Aku no Hana"" is mostly silent in terms of background. There is background music when necessary, but in most cases, the anime represents the boring small town, where nothing happens. Playing music in the background would destroy that feeling. Voice actors did a great job, though. The openings are quite strange, and I think the first one is intentionally sang in a really bad voice. The ending is strange, it is not a song, I listened to it once, it fits well with the anime, but it is skippable (you will hear a large part of it in the near end of some episodes).As this is the first part, everything that anime build up was unfinished. There is no second season, because you know, the eyes proportions of real actors is not appealing to the anime community. This is the first time, I will actually engaged enough to read the manga. I want to know how the things end up. I feel sorry that a great anime is buried in such a tragic way, because... money and eyes. have implied program in our brain to find any human face with large eyes-to-face ratio cute.

It for all intents and purposes is a mirror of the source material the good and the bad. This included things involved in the manga that would, and usually didn't work well in the new medium.One of the most obvious of all is the pacing, its abysmal to be frank, the anime went for the same cliffs pauses and stops of the manga, wasting minuets an episode to dead drab silence.  Episode 13 should have been episode 7 or 8 ideally. Another major problem with the...story comes forth from the pacing major events and what should have been the major hooks don't come in at all during the story to justify the ending point, which felt superficial at best.Art while hard to get used to, is perfect for the mood it was trying to convey. Working with a simplistic/minimalist art-style over rotor-scoped actors. (Using real actors as models for the animation). Colors fit well with the mood again.Sound is veeery preference based specifically when it comes to the actors. Its comes to the decision of whether you prefer voice actors who fit the character(hard when you see the character archetypes) or well, good voice actors, and really it is hard to complain about it when they were using rotor-scoping. Ambiance varies and when it doesn't drag on is used well. The ed was fantastic op was only slightly worse.Character is one of the real kickers. Without the development or the full development arc of the characters they were either unfathomable or cliche.Creepy delinquent girl, class idol, awkward teenager, pervert friend, unlikable teacher, gossiping girls.It is hard to enjoy it at all as the pauses were numerous the dialogue was frankly embarrassing and the story was rarely at the right pace almost always going too slow, with some of the more pivotal events going by to fast.Overall it was hard to enjoy at the best of times bad at most of the times and horrible at the other times. There are so many better ones out there and well the ending WAIT FOR PART 2 and well I don't think there is going to be a part two at this rate. story comes forth from the pacing major events and what should have been the major hooks don't come in at all during the story to justify the ending point, which felt superficial at best.Art while hard to get used to, is perfect for the mood it was trying to convey.

I mean, very different.Story:9-greatMeet Kasuga Takao, a boy who loves to read books and is passionate about them. The book that he is reading is (of course) ""Flowers of Evil"" by Bodlaire aka. Aku No Hana. That book changed his way of looking at things in life (or maybe...). He is living pretty much an ordinary life, until the day that he stoles one of his classmates\'(Saeki Nanako\'s) gym uniform. In the rush of hormones, he runs away with it. Although he thought that he was cut away from world in that very moment, someone...spotted him. And that was his classmate Nakamura Sawa. She isn\'t afraid to shove middle finger into anybody; her teacher is no exception. One day, Nakamura told him that she saw him, and they made a contract. No need to say that she will make #$%& with Kasuga in the next 10 or so episodes. And story slowly unfolds. I would say that this was a great plot.Art:5-mediocreMeh. But you shouldn\'t judge the whole anime by the way it\'s drawn. There is also a whole story that waits for you. Even if 3D like anime isn\'t your cup of tea, give it a try. For me, three words: not a fan.Sound:10-outstandingI love it how OP changes on every three or so episodes. And have you heard the ending song? Although it\'s somewhat weird, I like it. *hana ga, hana ga saitayo*Character:8-very goodOf course it\'s very good! How could you make a good psychological anime without a good character development. Just pay attention to the signs that characters give.Enjoyment:3-poorIt felt like story was really slow. Maybe it\'s just me, but I think that something more could have been done. Maybe some fan service? I dunno.Overall:3-poorIt was sad. The ending. I cried so many tears at the end... \'cause it was bad AF. If you watched the anime and read the manga you will understand me: good input-bad, BAD output. So many things could have been done. But no. You had to put 20 minutes of recap, one minute of understandable ending that was cut out because of the budget and ""End of Part One"" at the end. Although its ending was bad, I would recommend you to watch it.P.S. Are you team Saeki or team Nakamura? spotted him. And that was his classmate Nakamura Sawa.

It reminds me of the old adage “too weird to live, too rare to die”. I’ll spare you the flowery intro and just get right into the meat of this thing as I already have a pretty in-depth review of the manga should you be interested in my rambling, incoherent thoughts on Aku no Hana’s general premise. This is mostly going to cover what I did and didn’t like about the adaptation as opposed to the story and such, as it is identical to the manga’s.Things I...liked about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:It is faithful to the source material – The Aku no Hana manga is so good. I have it rated as a 9 right now, but I bet after rereading I’ll bump it up to a 10. The anime covers about the first third of the manga. It doesn’t deviate at all which suits me just fine. The story is so well put together that any changes would have went over like a fart in church.Things I didn’t like about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:The anime only covers about the first third of the manga – The second arc is probably the best part of the manga. The third arc ties everything together beautifully. Hope you hadn’t planned on seeing them because this thing BOMBED.Things I liked about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:The soundtrack is amazing – The OST is melancholic and atmospheric. The ending theme sounds like a dead robot singing at its own funeral. I loved it.Things I didn’t like about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:The last episode is a glorified recap with spoilers for a non-existent second season – Umm, that pretty much says it all right there.Things I liked about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:The acting – Very solid, you can tell the actors cared about their roles and a lot of effort went into creating the atmosphere.Things I didn’t like about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:The casting – That being said the cast was way too old to be playing middle-schoolers. A lot of what made the manga so good was that the characters were just kids. A huge theme of the thing is supposed to be the changes that come with puberty. The guy that plays Kasuga was pushing 20 when this was made…I realize that it would have been pretty risqué to have actual kids in these roles, but they were already making a weird, experimental series. Why compromise there?Things I liked about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:The animation – Yup. Aku no Hana is rotoscoped. They filmed everything with real (old) actors and then animated over it and had voice actors dub it. It’s something that takes some getting used to, but it suits the type of story being told. It’s ugly at times, but these are supposed to be gangly, awkward teens. Yeah I kind of miss cute Nakamura too, but I mean come on, she’s supposed to be a creepy loner, not an object of your (or my) sick fancy.Things I didn’t like about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:The animation – It’s pretty common knowledge that the reason this didn’t get a second season is because everyone hated the rotoscoping. It’s a shame, but that’s the price you pay for experimenting I guess. I would have preferred traditional animation if it meant getting the whole story adapted, even if some of the unique atmosphere was lost, but it was never meant to be.Overall I really enjoyed Aku no Hana. Yes there are some glaring flaws but it’s just so unique and the source material is so strong that it’s pretty easy to overlook them. It’s not something I’d recommend to just anyone, but if you’re looking for something different in a medium where different is getting to be more and more rare, check this out. liked about the Aku no Hana anime adaptation:It is faithful to the source material – The Aku no Hana manga is so good.

I hated it so much that I decided to read the manga (perfect logic), and I absolutely adored the manga - which is now in my top 3. But this isn't a review of the manga, it's about the anime.StoryThe biggest shame in this anime is how long it was. The 13 episodes can only tell the part of the story which - in my opinion - is the worst part of the manga. If there is a second season, then I would probably enjoy it much more as it would tell the best...part. The pacing is too slow.ArtI despise the art style of the anime. The manga was beautiful, but the anime ruined it. I don't care if it's how the original creator wanted it, it's terrible. The art style would be bearable if there was actually a good story however.SoundThere isn't much to say here. The voice acting was actually pretty good, and I enjoyed the openings (the nakamura version is my favourite). This was one of the only things that helped me complete the anime.CharacterIn the anime, I hated all of the characters.

In the manga, I adore all these characters.EnjoymentI did not enjoy this show at all.

Definitely, the story is very engaging.Characters (10/10): Aku no Hana is an anime whose whole focus is on developing the emotions of each of their characters and I can say that they do it with mastery so that you can really get into the story.We have our protagonist, Kasuga Takao, an ordinary boy who goes to school, like all of us. His main hobby is reading ""classic"" books by ancient authors, so he believes he is someone special, different from the others because he faithfully believes that none anyone besides him in this city could understand these books (whereas he couldn\'t understand it himself).He is completely in love with his classmate, Saeki Nanako.Saeki is Kasuga\'s inspiring muse, he sees her as a totally pure and angelic being who never makes mistakes, his admiration for her is something out of the ordinary.Saeki is the typical ""perfect girl"" who does her best to keep up her looks, being very popular in school and looking extremely kind.Lastly, we have Nakamura Sawa, a girl considered ""strange"" by all and who remain isolated.Nakamura is ""strange"" because she believes that this whole city is boring, monotonous and that everyone lives in bubbles. She hates everyone and for that reason keeps herself isolated.To me, Nakamura is simply the best and most developed character in the anime, even more than the protagonist himself.Overall, you look at the anime characters and see something different, you don\'t see that OP hero who kills everyone and have sex with all the girls, nor that busty girl full of fanservice with a forced shy personality. You see only people, just like us , each with their differences and similarities, which is why the characters in this anime are great.Art (4/10): Aku no Hana\'s anime has a different kind of animation, even different from the manga itself.Aku no Hana uses another style of animation, called rotoscopy. In this style, a real actor is filmed or photographed and the capture made is ""drawn"", creating an animation.Indeed, I would view art as something different from the ordinary and somewhat cool, because it breaks the ""taboo"" in which all anime characters are aliens with huge eyes and white skin.However, not quite... the animation did not perform well, demonstrating several flaws in the movement scenes of the characters and also the fact that whenever they are distant, they do not have a face, which makes the animation somehow rotten.Sound (7/10): Aku no Hana\'s OST is especially macabre and somehow sets you in the anime, which was made to be slightly ""dark"".The ending was a good thing, but I didn\'t like the song itself, because it\'s just an instrumental rhythm with a computerized voice that isn\'t even singing.But the most interesting part of anime music would be the openings that change with the episodes.Listening to each opening, we can see characteristics of the characters we\'re used to, which I find very interesting.Achievement (10/10): Aku no Hana is an anime with a great storyline and story development as well as the characters, it also has a slight edge of social criticism, demonstrating the monotony of people\'s daily lives. You can certainly get into the story and that\'s great.It\'s extremely engaging, when you watch an episode, usually either to understand the story or want to watch even more, because you always expect to know what happens next, the suspense in the end always killed me.Anyways, Aku no Hana is the kind of different anime that is worth watching. extremely similar to her, decides to blackmail him just so she can have fun with him in a city where all the people you think would be extremely monotonous.Some people for some reason see this anime as disturbing, but to me it\'s extremely normal.A bad point of this anime is that it does not cover the whole story of the manga (although there\'s a subtle hint of a second season).Story (9/10)The story revolves around Kasuga Takao, an ordinary boy who likes books and is in love with a girl in his class.He finds her gym clothes in a bag when he returns to the classroom to pick up his copy of ""The Flowers of Evil"" that he has forgotten on his desk and decides to pick it up impulsively.From then on, everyone believes that some ""perv"" has taken these clothes and must be doing ""disgusting things"" with her.No one should have seen him take these clothes, but we all know that if no one had seen there would be no plot, isn\'t it?Well, the strange girl in their class named Nakamura witnessed the whole thing and decided to blackmail him with a ""contract"" in which Kasuga would be obliged to comply with all her orders, otherwise she would tell everyone about her actions.Even though it seems extremely simple, the anime goes beyond simplicity, using it as a starting point for something deeper, something that takes in our own lives, which can be identified in the story.

You can certainly get into the story and that\'s great.It\'s extremely engaging, when you watch an episode, usually either to understand the story or want to watch even more, because you always expect to know what happens next, the suspense in the end always killed me.Anyways, Aku no Hana is the kind of different anime that is worth watching.', 'Aku no Hana - if the pace had been better handled, one could speak of a ""Coming of Age""-psycho thriller about inhibited romance in puberty, with an interesting visual approach that gets more and more sinister with each episode. Unfortunately, although the anime manages to create a gloomy, oppressive atmosphere, it can\'t reach the aura of manga.  Although I chose the anime, my review will also reflect my opinion of the manga.Story: Gloomy and oppressive it lures the viewer into the darkness; Manga (8/10); Anime (4/10)Kasuga, Takao is a quiet middle schoolboy with a penchant for classical literature and Saeki, Nanako, the prettiest girl...in his class. He\'s incapable of confessing his love to her and does something really stupid on top of that. As if that wasn\'t bad enough, he was observed by his classmate Nakamura, Sawa, who is known for her antisocial behavior. So the delinquent has taken his first step into darkness as well as into his personal psychological hell. A severe point of criticism is the pacing in the anime adaptation, which in contrast to the manga is so slow at some points that the viewer loses focus on the actual climax of the scene. The desired dramaturgy is lost or even reversed. The bad implementation of the original story is the real weakness of the entire show. Basically, the manga defines the story as the strongest aspect and the fact that the adaptation, regardless of its other weaknesses, cannot create the same mood even though, unlike the manga, it has the manifold possibilities of animation techniques and music at its disposal, is the true cardinal error.Characters: Manga: credible, authentic (8/10); Anime: unfortunately potential left unused (5/10)Another serious mistake can be seen in the figure portraits. The anime tries to arouse the same impressions and emotions in the viewer as the original. But it fails, because the character traits don\'t come across properly because of the badly chosen timing and therefore one can\'t clearly identify with the characters. The portrayal of their character traits seems half-hearted and is therefore perceived as unnatural. The horrible visual realization does the rest, but more about Art and Animation later in ""Visuals"".Kasuga, Takao:He appears in the anime as an ordinary, shy pupil who is blackmailed. At first, the viewer cannot longer grasp of the figure without having prior knowledge of the source. The manga, on the other hand, offers clear character traits that make his behavior and actions comprehensible. Simply put, he is a weakling and submissive. Since he finds no way out for himself, he flees into the poems by Baudelaires, in which he believes that his situation is reflected. All monologues and self-reflexions that Takao expresses are unfortunately only a weak copy in the anime. For this reason, the viewer notices very late that Takao doesn\'t quite understand the poems, but can\'t admit it.Nakamura, Sawa:Diabolically playful, but in anime only the simply destructive facets of the character remain. The implementation of Sawa was so colourless and half-hearted that it is simply a pity to the wasted potential. She is the actual protagonist of the anime and if you describe Aku no hana, you should immediately think of the somber, but somehow cute, playful, devilish girl. More than half the time you try to grasp her character, but only to realize that you were wrong about your interpretation. Her character is tricky and multi-faceted. If you are wondering what I am talking about, please take a look at the manga.Saeki, Nanako:A little light at the end of the tunnel, at least here it was possible to make the character understandable at the beginning. She is pretty and sexy, which could be seen as a plus. On the other hand, according to the original, as a symbol of innocence, she is supposed to be completely devoured, by the darkness of the increasingly gloomy story. Therefore, her outward appearance as very young and innocent is so important. The anime, however, cannot convey this because Nanko seems inexperienced but not uninterested.One could continue with examples of the other characters and supporting roles, but with the three main characters the intention is already clearly expressed. Isn\'t it?Visuals: Not the cardinal error, yet the original was slaughtered (4/10)The view that the rotoscope technique is the reason that the anime is optically ugly, is not true and therefore I do not want to leave it uncommented. The fault is neither the original story nor the rotoscope technique itself, but the catastrophic visual realization. Rotoscoping was developed and patented by Max Fleischer in the early 1910s. The aim was to achieve a convincing and realistic movement in less time. The method was later used primarily for human figures that perform particularly complex movements such as dance scenes. A  beautiful example is Walt Disney\'s Snow White from 1937, the classic has some dance scenes that were realized with rotoscoping. You can imagine the procedure like tracing. The movie scenes are projected frame by frame onto a frosted glass screen so that the animator can draw them. Basically, it\'s a matter of effort, budget or both. That it is possible to make a nice rotoscoping film is beyond question. Last month I reviewed an Anime by Toei Animation from 1962 that was created also by using the rotoscoping technique. It hurts to say that ""Aku no hana"" can\'t keep up, but from a visual point of view and considering the time of creation, the characters in the 1962 anime look better, although there are more than 50 years in between.The beautiful and detailed backgrounds are often praised. I will not contradict, but almost always there are still images in which apart from the protagonist nothing moves. No leaf falls to the ground, no cicada runs around, just beautiful stills. That would not be so bad, but the anime is a dark drama. This means that the characters and their emotions are in the foreground and above all, that the viewer is able to understand and empathize with their feelings. In other words, the background could simply be white as long as the characters can credibly convey the emotions they are supposed to express. That\'s exactly what is missing here. The characters do not convince and even the most beautiful background can\'t mitigate this.Music: different, oh good grief, very hard to bear at times (4/10)The background music is suitable for the series, but the compositions of Fukasawa, Hideyuki, do not convince me. Music arrangements like ""Mangetsu to Keikaku"" or ""Inori no Yuube"" are hard to understand. In general I am enthusiastic about many kinds of music and styles, but the fascination for the sound world of Aku no hana has remained hidden to me. The Gothic elements are all too present, one is unfortunately not invited into the darkness and finally completely enveloped by it. The music is more like a gothic shower and the desired effect is lost. On the other hand music themes like ""Zankyou no Hana"" have an almost melancholic, tender charm, which can hardly attract attention next to the other music influences and thus remains without much resonance with the audience. All in all the music is composed for the series, but exactly for this reason it can\'t convince by itself and strengthen or even adequately describe the actions of the actors. The music is tragic and bleak, that\'s just too dominant and that\'s why it seems so lackluster. This is a bit sad because the composer has already created better works. Many game fans surely know his name and I also like his compositions for FSN-Unlimited Blade Works.There are different openings and endings and honestly, none of them are in my collection.The opening ""Kasuga Takao"" by Noko, the music is good, but the singing is hard to bear.The title ""Nakamura Sawa"" by Gotou, Mariko. Oh, good grief, what a terrible mixture of art-punk and noise-pop. >_<  skip…In contrast, Nanba, Shiho interpretation of the title ""Saeki Nanako"" is almost a typical idol anime pop song, but she reaches high pitches at times not comfortably and ends a little screeching. It feels a little like the melody doesn\'t fit her or she doesn\'t master the technique of transition. Many may think that this is part of the show, but unfortunately not.I listened to the Eds, like ""one last flower"" and ""Hana"" and then skipped them. Overall, the music was the Animes\' biggest disappointment for me.The dubbing voices can improve the impression of the sound section a bit. Surprisingly, it\'s more the supporting roles like Uemura, Ayako as the voice of  Kinoshita, Ai. I liked her interpretation of her role very much, as did Doi, Mika as Saeki\'s mother, although she doesn\'t have had so many lyrics.I can\'t recommend the anime ""Aku no hana"". It was hard for me to watch the whole series and that is really a pity, because the manga of Oshimi Shūzō is good. The adaptation with its horrible visual realization doesn\'t do justice to the manga at all. Moreover, the anime lacks the fascinating roller coaster ride in the dark psyche of the protagonists struggling with their youth. The cliffhanger at the end feels like being left out in the rain.Thanks for reading. in his class. He\'s incapable of confessing his love to her and does something really stupid on top of that.

That being said, the show is not lewd or pornographic, but realistic in it's portrayal of kids growing up and not knowing how to handle being sexual beings. I've read the manga and the art style is really different. I happened to love the animation style (they used a rotoscoping technique) and while people say it wasn't done well I think that the jittery quality added to the overall tense and nervous tone of the show. The show is thought provoking and really emotional....The more you watch the more you realize how complex the characters really are when you already thought you saw through them. The only reason I didn't give this a higher rating is because it's not really complete although it can be viewed as finished. I still think it's definitely worth watching. If you're into poetry, les fleur du mal by Baudelaire is what inspired the story and is really quite beautiful while also possessing the incredibly unsettling themes which make Aku no hana so great.

If you\'re a fan of the psychological/drama genre then this anime is for you, however if you\'re easily deterred by unconventional art - skip this one.Story 5/10While the story revolves mainly around three characters it\'s not too difficult to follow, however along the line it gets highly philosophical and even bizarre in a kind of positive way that is usually common for the psychological genre, it enveloped me completely and even made me feel uneasy about some of the events. Sadly from the 13-th episode the anime turns into a...full recap of the events and a teaser for a season two that isn\'t going to be made.Art 7/10For most people the art either makes it or brakes it. In this case the art is unconventional to say the least, and reminds more of a live action movie than an anime. While the art may seem terrible to most people, I got used to it around episode three and later found that it fits perfectly with the main theme the anime is trying to portray. (character design and animation is what I had in mind.)  Backgrounds on the other hand were done exceptionally well, adding swiftly to the story.Sound 10/10It\'s been quite some time since I\'ve seen soundtrack and sound effects that match so perfectly with the anime, zero complaints there.Character development 6/10Kasuga - Main character your typical cliche anime portagonist, that has difficulty normally communicating with other people except for his friends.Nanako - The girl in class that Kasuga admires from a distance, later she turns out to be more in arms reach than MC originally thought.Nakamura - Another girl from Kasuga\'s class, the only words I can use to describe her - relentless psychopath, that tries to ""destroy the walls that Kasuga has built around himself.""Other than these three, the supporting characters were completely shallow and unmemorable.Intro 1/10I don\'t know if the intro should be addressed, but it felt like it was completely out of place regarding the dark and sinister theme the anime was portraying.Outro 10/10Gave me the creeps every time.Overall 6/10While ""Flowers of evil"" isn\'t an anime for an ordinary viewer, fans of this genre might find it quite enjoyable. While coming to a climax that never takes place, it falls completely under it\'s own shadow. It\'s creepy, it\'s strange, but for some reason I couldn\'t stop watching. However the dullness of the main character and the love triangle sort of ruined it for me, aswell as the ending definitely isn\'t something you\'d hope for. All in all it\'s worth a watch with low expectations. full recap of the events and a teaser for a season two that isn\'t going to be made.Art 7/10For most people the art either makes it or brakes it.

All in all it\'s worth a watch with low expectations.', 'I really wish I could love Aku no Hana more than I did. The concept is bursting with all kinds of twisted potential, and when I saw what the animation style looked like -- so bizarre and unique in a sea of same-same shows featuring green-haired girls with eyes half the size of their heads, I knew I had to watch this. Unfortunately, even though I loved the style and atmosphere of this show, the confused characterization and pacing ultimately made Aku no Hana a letdown for me.Story: Without giving away too much, this show turns into a melodramatic soap opera much too early on...for my liking. A major breakthrough that changes each character dynamic irrevocably happens more than halfway through the show, so the rest of the series seems quite rushed after the fact. It’s unfortunate that Aku no Hana will never get a second season, because if the events were drawn out much longer, allowing each character to simmer in their undercurrents of hatred and anxiety for longer than a day before moving onto the next convoluted plot event, this might be something close to a masterpiece. I think this show shines when it succumbs to just how psychologically and sexually insane it could be, while still making some time (not nearly enough time, unfortunately) for interesting character development. Again, a caveat: the show’s middle school setting made the sexual content -- tied to themes of humiliation, domination, and fetishization of purity -- difficult to reconcile with how old the characters are. That being said, those are some pretty intense and subtly-outlined themes for an anime, so when the show isn’t tied up in tiring “you’re a pervert!”, “no I’m not!” arguments and other boring anime conventions, looking closely at the kinds of sexual behaviors and attitudes happening reveals a lot more than is spelled out about each character. I sort of liked the direction the show took after most of the sexual elements are stripped back in the last few episodes -- the plot twists into a trope that is so prevalent in stories about teenagers for a reason, after all -- but again, the pacing is so off that it felt tonally inconsistent with the psychological torture and horror of previous episodes.Art: Can’t praise the art enough! I’m not very surprised that there’s such hysterical arguments about it -- taking such artistic liberties in a medium where people often spend more time worshiping cute characters than actually paying attention to nuances in the story (if there are any, that is) is bound to make a lot of people pissed off. I haven’t read the manga, but I think the style elevates the material here beyond the conventions of anime (which, unfortunately, makes every time that the story succumbs to such conventions even more jarring and disappointing). You can see by how richly detailed the backgrounds are, how beautifully surreal some scenes are drawn, and little things like the reflections of characters seen in TV screens, that the odd animation and character design is totally on purpose. The fact that this show is rotoscoped adds emphasis on movement instead of detailed character design. Each character is so bizarrely drawn that, although they are certainly more realistic looking than your average anime character, they don’t look entirely human. But they move like a human. In a show where alienation from others is paramount, the style strengthens this aspect more than any bit of dialogue or plot twist could. Each character’s troubles with fitting in and understanding the people around them are only emphasized by their blank, simple appearances...they’re empty characters living in an empty, rusted, hopeless world. I appreciated that Nakamura, who looks like a cute Rei Ayanami-clone in the manga, looks like a normal girl in this show. The animation style makes it difficult to reduce her to the “cute crazy girl” that so many people seem to have done. Nakamura’s blank, semi-realistic appearance allowed me to sympathize with her and understand her as a human being, not a stereotype.Sound: I skipped the main song because I don’t sit through openings with no animation but OH MY GOD, THAT ENDING SONG. I think it’s my favorite ending to an anime yet. Although the show has some problems with maintaining tone sometimes, the ending always brings it all back because it’s so creepy sounding. It’s always cued in at the right dramatic moment, and each time I heard it I began to like the show more, in spite of all my reservations with it. I’ve never actually heard of a show whose ending song actually makes the content of the show better, but goddammit if Aku no Hana isn’t just that.Character: As with most anime, I ended up liking the side characters much more than the main character. Aku no Hana obviously devotes more time to Kasuga than Saeki or Nakamura, but the screen time they do get shows that they are just as muddled and complex as he (supposedly) is. Unfortunately, the show’s horrendous pacing means that right when the contours of Nakamura’s true personality become a bit more defined, it ends. I really wish we saw more of Saeki, as well. It’s rare that such a nice and sweet girl is given a chance to be interesting beyond having a sad backstory. Speaking of sad backstories, although I have major gripes with Kasuga’s characterization, I loved that Aku no Hana never resorted to giving a character a sad or abusive childhood to “explain” the way they are. Each character has a loving family that often only wants to understand them, and in this way, the way each of them act becomes a little more heartbreaking.Now, I don’t know if it’s just extraordinarily difficult to figure out in general or if this show handled the manga’s characterization of Kasuga poorly, but I found it hard to understand if we’re supposed to sympathize with him. He’s pitched halfway between a Shinji-Ikari-shy-blank-slate of a main character and a nuanced criticism of that often-tired anime trope (no shade at Shinji, I love him). He gets tugged around by an insane girl, is disgustingly obsessed with a his crush’s purity even though he steals her uniform for ostensibly sexual purposes, and childishly revels in his outsider status even after realizing that’s...childish...? All things that point to a more intelligent way of looking at this character type, but because we spend so much time with him doing so much over the top screeching and crying and monologuing, I just couldn’t figure it out.Speaking of over the top, I know this is an anime but there were a lot of times in Aku no Hana where characters, specifically Saeki, act in ways that aren’t based in reality at all (or maybe they are, but there wasn’t enough thought given to the pacing to provide a realistic explanation for those actions). Fortunately, the sheer spectacle of the show allowed me to ignore all of that and revel in the insanity and soapiness.Enjoyment: At its core, this is a 1/3 sordid sexual-humiliation tale, 1/3 “get me out of this town” love triangle soap opera, and 1/3 semi-nuanced character analysis. So...it’s pretty enjoyable. There are quite a few long takes that remind me of NGE’s slower scenes, and although I wasn’t anywhere as nearly invested in the events of this show to fully pay attention during those scenes, I respect the decision to include them as much as I respect the animation style. Characters do stupid, outlandish, bizarre shit that sometimes makes no sense but who cares! It’s a lot of fun, if you like being uncomfortable! In the first half of the show, not knowing what Nakamura will subject Kasuga to next is pretty terrifying to watch as the stakes go higher and higher...and when those stakes all get annihilated, it’s impossible to see what will happen next. A shame that the last episode almost entirely hinges on the false assumption that this will get a second season, though. Totally looking forward to reading the manga! for my liking. A major breakthrough that changes each character dynamic irrevocably happens more than halfway through the show, so the rest of the series seems quite rushed after the fact.

Each character’s troubles with fitting in and understanding the people around them are only emphasized by their blank, simple appearances...they’re empty characters living in an empty, rusted, hopeless world. I appreciated that Nakamura, who looks like a cute Rei Ayanami-clone in the manga, looks like a normal girl in this show. The animation style makes it difficult to reduce her to the “cute crazy girl” that so many people seem to have done. Nakamura’s blank, semi-realistic appearance allowed me to sympathize with her and understand her as a human being, not a stereotype.Sound: I skipped the main song because I don’t sit through openings with no animation but OH MY GOD, THAT ENDING SONG. I think it’s my favorite ending to an anime yet. Although the show has some problems with maintaining tone sometimes, the ending always brings it all back because it’s so creepy sounding. It’s always cued in at the right dramatic moment, and each time I heard it I began to like the show more, in spite of all my reservations with it. I’ve never actually heard of a show whose ending song actually makes the content of the show better, but goddammit if Aku no Hana isn’t just that.Character: As with most anime, I ended up liking the side characters much more than the main character. Aku no Hana obviously devotes more time to Kasuga than Saeki or Nakamura, but the screen time they do get shows that they are just as muddled and complex as he (supposedly) is. Unfortunately, the show’s horrendous pacing means that right when the contours of Nakamura’s true personality become a bit more defined, it ends. I really wish we saw more of Saeki, as well. It’s rare that such a nice and sweet girl is given a chance to be interesting beyond having a sad backstory. Speaking of sad backstories, although I have major gripes with Kasuga’s characterization, I loved that Aku no Hana never resorted to giving a character a sad or abusive childhood to “explain” the way they are. Each character has a loving family that often only wants to understand them, and in this way, the way each of them act becomes a little more heartbreaking.Now, I don’t know if it’s just extraordinarily difficult to figure out in general or if this show handled the manga’s characterization of Kasuga poorly, but I found it hard to understand if we’re supposed to sympathize with him. He’s pitched halfway between a Shinji-Ikari-shy-blank-slate of a main character and a nuanced criticism of that often-tired anime trope (no shade at Shinji, I love him). He gets tugged around by an insane girl, is disgustingly obsessed with a his crush’s purity even though he steals her uniform for ostensibly sexual purposes, and childishly revels in his outsider status even after realizing that’s...childish...? All things that point to a more intelligent way of looking at this character type, but because we spend so much time with him doing so much over the top screeching and crying and monologuing, I just couldn’t figure it out.Speaking of over the top, I know this is an anime but there were a lot of times in Aku no Hana where characters, specifically Saeki, act in ways that aren’t based in reality at all (or maybe they are, but there wasn’t enough thought given to the pacing to provide a realistic explanation for those actions). Fortunately, the sheer spectacle of the show allowed me to ignore all of that and revel in the insanity and soapiness.Enjoyment: At its core, this is a 1/3 sordid sexual-humiliation tale, 1/3 “get me out of this town” love triangle soap opera, and 1/3 semi-nuanced character analysis. So...it’s pretty enjoyable. There are quite a few long takes that remind me of NGE’s slower scenes, and although I wasn’t anywhere as nearly invested in the events of this show to fully pay attention during those scenes, I respect the decision to include them as much as I respect the animation style. Characters do stupid, outlandish, bizarre shit that sometimes makes no sense but who cares! It’s a lot of fun, if you like being uncomfortable! In the first half of the show, not knowing what Nakamura will subject Kasuga to next is pretty terrifying to watch as the stakes go higher and higher...and when those stakes all get annihilated, it’s impossible to see what will happen next. A shame that the last episode almost entirely hinges on the false assumption that this will get a second season, though. Totally looking forward to reading the manga!', 'Never in my life I have experienced anything like what I did when I was watching this anime. Aku no Hana gives away so many emotions that go along with the breath-taking story, atmospheric and incredible music, original characters and so much more; I am having troubles putting it all into words.The story carves into your mind like razors cut into your skin. It\'s unique, special, dark, mind-bending. After watching you\'ll be unintentionally giving yourself quite some time to think through what you\'ve just seen. Rather than developing around one plot and one single point, Aku no Hana revolves around mutlitple plots that fit...into each other like puzzle. Expect the unexpected, in fact, expect plots where you\'d never expect them. As the story developed I was feeling... how do I put it.. shocked but intrigued at the same time, this euphoria of emotions just dragged me in like NO ANIME ever did. The storyline is gloomy, it gives away this kind of subtle but yet depressive emotion which is one of multiple factors that will make you not regret a minute you spent watching this masterpiece. Long story short? Shocking, negative, different, gloomy, frustrating, DEEPLY saddening, remarkably unique.One of the most important aspects of this anime is also its art (understandably). The manga is drawn (understandably) quite differently which, in my opinion, ceases to give away the actual Aku no Hana feel that this title has potential for. To the point - the art is unique as well, something you don\'t get to see every day. It\'s alternative but most importantly it\'s something special that only helps the emotions this work gives away to its watchers to come across. At some point it represents what this title stands for. I can\'t imagine Aku no Hana being drawn differently, like this as it is, it\'s something different, something that stands out and partly gives away this seriously serious & terrifying feeling.I am an audiophile myself and so this paragraph I will enjoy to write about. Aku no Hana heavily leans on the background music in the sense of the atmosphere and ambience. The music is very very very well done. Just as this title itself, once again - it\'s special and dark. In fact it\'s so breath-taking I simply had to get the OST of this anime. Simply UNBELIEVABLE atmosphere and ambience that serves as the cherry on top of a cake here. As for the dubbing I think the voice actors did fantastic job, I seriously do not know what else to say.The characters - not quite something I ever saw in an anime. In a good sense of course. A lots of blackmailing, frustration, complications and so on. All of these just build up to the ""psychological"" feeling of this title. The characters simply fit together so well. There\'s a huge contrast of natures of each single one of them which, throughout the story, makes things satisfying, interesting and yet once again very intriguing. I guarantee you\'ll find the story development based on the characters surprising and awfully interesting.To sum up, Aku no Hana appealed to me. Most likely because of the type of person I am which might be the reason I rated this title so high. You might not see it the way I do but one thing I know for sure - regardless, you\'ll enjoy it.

The story overall starts off interesting and you find yourself sympathizing with the main character, however towards the end we realize how much of a piece of shit he really is based on the decisions he made (somewhat spoiler). This is not an easy show to watch due to the cringe and stupidity of the main character and is exactly what you would expect from an anime listed as psychological. The plot twists...are interesting and very entertaining, but overall it\'s just the main character who ends up being a disappointment. Don\'t expect much of a romance, the story is mainly centered around the main character, and if you will go deep enough, it explores the 3 main types of people depicted in Japanese culture.

It told the story of a young man named Kasuga, and his struggles with growing up and youth. He obsesses over the poetry of Baudelaire; specifically The Flowers of Evil, despite not understanding it. Also in tow were Saeki, his love interest; and Nakamura, a devillish powder keg of a young girl that serves as a source of life and youthful expression, as well as a counter to Kasuga\'s self-loating and self-pity. While somewhat unbalanced in terms of structure, it does a good job of telling an...interesting story with odd characters and themes. But I\'m not here to give the manga a big sappy handjob as a means of glorifying the original work while disparaging the anime adaptation that everyone hates.It says a lot about the state of anime and its audience that a show like Aku no Hana was buried and bashed incessantly. The anime adaptation is actually quite good. Its art style is completely unique and memorable, its tone brooding and thick with dread and ever-lingering hostility, and its story is so bizarre and well-executed I wouldn\'t hesitate to call it great. But that opinion unfortunately isn\'t shared by the majority of other anime viewers. It was bashed and bloodied over the artistic liberties it took from the manga and crucified over its choice of character design and animation. This, to me, is simultaneously baffling and completely expected at the same time.I say its baffling because Aku no Hana does everything an adaptation of a visual medium should do. It should faithfully tell the story it\'s adapting, while doing everything in its power to NOT copy every single thing its source material does. First, Aku no Hana\'s story isn\'t dependent on it being depicted visually. It would work just as well as a novel due to its slow as molasses plot structure and independence of flashy plot setting and overly vivid scenes. And what I mean by that is Aku no Hana\'s plot is slow, methodical, grounded heavily in reality, devoid of action scenes, and does not take place somewhere fantastical. It isn\'t Gurren Lagann or FLCL where trying to tell the story without the visuals would be excruciatingly difficult and likely to worsen the experience. Not to imply that anything is missing from TTGL or FLCL but my point is, the kind of story Aku no Hana tells isn\'t one that depends heavily on the way it looks. This is why I don\'t care about the art style being different from the manga. The manga\'s artstyle is boring. It works for what it does but it isn\'t interesting or an absolute necessity to utilize in an animated adaptation.So the staff took an experimental approach to the artstyle and animation, positioning very bizarrely rotoscoped against very detailed photorealistic backgrounds. While clearly poised within the uncanny valley, the sloppy and unpolished animation of the characters does so much to strengthen the dark tone and uncomfortable scenes the creators wanted to depict. The jarring visuals clash with everything the audience is used to with regards to how anime characters look and move, which works brilliantly to instill a near constant state of discomfort in the viewer. However, this also alienated it from most mainstream anime fans who couldn\'t get past its tough-to-loveappearance.Which is what brings me to why I find the rejection and hostility Aku no Hana received completely unsurprising, even if it is extremely frustrating. What killed the anime adaptation of Aku no Hana wasn\'t WHAT it changed or some non-understanding of its source material. What killed it was THAT it changed. Its biggest crime was that it was ugly; that it chose to toss aside the dull visual design of the original manga and try something completely new. And for the type of story that Aku no Hana tells, that change made perfect sense and was executed very well. But in this industry, that didn\'t matter.A lot of people who watch anime just don\'t want to be challenged. They want to see the same thing they\'ve seen a hundred times. There\'s a reason why shows like Attack on Titan, Fate/Stay Night, and Sword Art Online have enjoyed very lengthy stays in the animated adaptation realm. They all feature top-dollar animation budgets, hyper-attractive character designs, and extremely basic fan-servicey plots. That\'s the sort of thing that sells in anime right now. Basically: pretty animation with pretty people that gives the audience exactly what they want without challenging the viewer mentally or emotionally.Keeping that in mind, it\'s no wonder Aku no Hana failed. It IS ugly, challenging, and dared to defy its audiences expectations. And that to me is heartbreaking, as it did so much right and was completely rejected. I can only hope that more people give this a shot with an open mind, as it deserves so much more love than the brutal reception it\'s gotten thus far. interesting story with odd characters and themes.

He has a crush, Saeki Nanako , who he considers as an embodiment of perfection but only admires from afar (naturally). But one day, going home, Takao realized that he forgot a book in his classroom. And when he went to go get it, he saw that Saeki forgot her P.E....clothes and the bastard took it by mad impulse. Of course, the word got around which left both him and his ""muse"", Saeki, feeling ashamed. Not only that, Takao has to deal with Nakamura Sawa; the ill-mannered weirdo from his class, who was the only one that ""caught him in action."" She promises Takao that she won\'t be a snitch in the condition that he will follow everything that she says form that day on. What happens after that are situations set by Nakamura which left my forehead wrinkled and my mind pondered.One of the problems I have with this anime is that some of the scenes are just quiet scenes. When I say quiet, I mean no talking, no BGMs. While understandable, these scenes mean there\'s a silent reflection going on inside the heads of the characters or a method of the animation studio to say that a scene was finished and we\'re on our way to the next one, they are awfully long. Too long. Sometimes, they would take minutes.The art. Okay, first of all, the art is not ugly. Eerie is what I would call it. What many don\'t realize is that the art compliments the overall theme of the show which is creepiness. Though, I understand that for some, anime is their mean of escaping reality ─that they don\'t want to see any reference to the real world as much as possible but the first thing that they see are these realistically-animated characters. Of course, it wouldn\'t be of their liking. And sure, people who read the manga would say that ""The art they did in the anime is different from the manga."" But I like to think that an anime adaptation of a manga is an opportunity of a studio to retell the story without going far away from the source (that and because this site avoids comparisons of adaptations to it\'s source).Sound. I can\'t say alot for the BGMs as most scenes doesn\'t have any. But when it does, they are superb. The OPs are very addictive. The type that gets stuck in your head. Almost makes you forget that you\'re watching a screwed up anime. And the ED is creepy as hell. Then there\'s the voices............ All I can say is, they did a wonderful job. Everyone\'s voice fits the characters and each seiyuus acted out their roles amazingly.Aku no Hana is one of the ""books"" that\'s only been judged by it\'s ""cover"". The setup may be a bit general but what sets it off from the others is the craziness of Nakamura. If you\'re not a fan of the psychological genre, then you might not like this one but if you are, then take this as my strong recommendation. clothes and the bastard took it by mad impulse.

Weird good, or weird bad is the question.I rated this an ""8"", but it can just as easily be a 3 or a 9.  Both are fine ratings.   Here\'s why I consider it an 8 or MAL\'s ""very good"":This show is hard to figure out, but I don\'t think on an intellectual level.  It\'s not really cerebral, yet it does makes you think.  This show is polarizing because it either grows on you or not.  Whether you like it depends on whether you can ""feel"" it.  I know that may sound strange,...but although it lacks greatness for other aspects of production, its tone is effective at emoting.  Pain, sorrow and estrangement are emotions the show MAKES you feel.Aku no Hana is about corruption of self image.  There\'s depth, in the psychological characterization.  The plot includes a growing sense of morbidity not easy to describe.  If it weren\'t for the second half of the show deviating from what I\'d like better, in hindsight, I would\'ve considered this close to a masterpiece.  It has potential in its creativity, exploring the protagonist.Aku no Hana\'s story touches on many issues present with Japanese youth.  It delves into depression, perversion and shame.  But the main notion I saw played with was: corruption of self image.  Aku no Hana is an apt embodiment of Japan\'s repressed sexual culture. And this is what makes it compelling.  Characters take a turn down an unfamiliar path for us.  It is refreshing to see people do complex and heinous things.  The story also grants us another perspective; an inspection of Japanese culture through another lens, albeit mostly hyperbolic.Aku no Hana is an interesting show, and many may not like it for being so, but it grew on me.  It takes an open mind to enjoy.  Likely unconventionalists would favor it.  The reason why it works, is that tonally it accomplishes much by irreverently spitting on our attempts to understand it, and bringing tension through atypical character development.  The thing is, the protagonist arc is strange, leading where we don\'t expect it to go.  More generally, there is a sense of a growing, festering plot, adding unease with each episode.  This \'feeling\' gradually seeps into the plot, aided implicitly (by music, actions of characters, etc. and explicitly, as displayed on screen.  You\'d have to see the show to know what I mean.  But I must say, not everyone enjoys cringeworthy material.  Thematically, however, much is able to be accomplished by the cringeworthy, sickening tone.Therefore, those who are open-minded, unconventional thinkers, or anyone who is....sexually depraved or can appreciate depravity...would likely enjoy this show. but although it lacks greatness for other aspects of production, its tone is effective at emoting.

The story is boring except the classroom-painting scene. They run the story too slow I always fell asleep watching it. And the ending part sucks, it gave me no hypes of seeing the part 2. The sounds (OST) are great I love all the OPs and EDs and OST, they're very creative. "", 'Having been an anime fan for well over 20 years now (yes I\'m THAT old) I\'ve seen pretty much every trick in the book.  The same regurgitated story lines that are decades old, the same character nuances thrown into many different looks, and the worst to the best art.While the art isn\'t my cup of tea the story and characters make up for it considerably.    I found the Art/Sound to not be necessary in this story at all and therefore didn\'t weight them into my Overall rating.The pacing can be slow for a lot of younger folks who are bombarded with...visual stimulation at rates exceeding what\'s needed.  In today\'s ""want it now"" society I can see why some viewers are unhappy with the pacing.  For me it was near perfect.

Takao Kasuga is caught impulsively stealing the gym clothes of his middle school crush, Nanako Saeki. After threatening to reveal his secret to everyone, unpopular “creepy” girl Sawa Nakamura makes Kasuga obey her every order. Nakamura manipulates Kasuga’s feelings for Saeki, trying to convince him through forced perverted actions that he’s a deviant just like her and that his self-image is a lie. It’s a very thematically demonstrative series, but despite the anime ending before finishing adapting the manga it tells a single complete story arc with a satisfying enough conclusion spot....There’s some themes here I was highly interested in, mainly those related to the conflict of puberty: sexual repression and virginal guilt. Repression becomes a theme in general, as both Kasuga and Nakamura are angst-budding precocious pre-teens who find the town’s milieu to be unintellectual or dishonest, respectively. Nakamura tries to tear down the Kasuga’s pretentious inhibitions as he puts up the air of being a literate intellectual.Flowers of Evil’s production values are generally quite impressive. The series’ use of rotoscoping in its animation has been highly controversial, but it’s very misunderstood. Too much attention has been given to the basic act of deviating from the manga’s art style, and not enough people have questioned the effect the new art style has on the narrative. It actually brings together a highly effective chemistry. Yes, the frame-skipping animation of the slow-moving rotoscoped facial features looks creepy, but “creepy” is what defines all aspects of the show. The “uncanny valley” look of the characters is appropriate for Nakamura’s imagined society where people are just pretending to be human, and as their facial features disappear the further they get away from the camera the world begins to look emotionally distant and impossible to empathize with. This is intentional, as Kasuga and Nakamura’s difficulty to relate to other people is their defining link. My only complaint about the character designs is that they look far too old to be middle schoolers, and this more mature impression diminishes the plausibility of the story due to Kasuga and Nakamura’s frustrated, juvenile reactions to things.Their city is portrayed as deserted and devoid of life, with plenty of slow shots of the cinematography showing numerous empty streets and buildings that have no activity inside of them. A muted color palette drapes everything in depressing, lonely greys. Emphasizing the lifelessness of the town is a soft musical score that often utilizes low keyboard drones under greatly spaced apart single piano keys. A mix of the light nature of middle school life and the perceived shallowness that comes with it, and at times, Kasuga’s fears. The four opening songs each play from the perspective of one of the three main characters, with the final song addressing the general themes of repression. Each episode’s transition into the ending song is also among the most memorable in an anime, concluding a series that thoroughly uses music in conjunction with its narrative. The painted backgrounds are gracefully done yet always sullen, and the distinct direction utilizes other surrealist tricks such as dream-like symbolic sequences and live action footage to further create a world of uncertainty. Flower of Evil’s very slow, deliberate atmosphere is both mysterious and unnerving like puberty itself and possibly the best thing about the series. The metaphorically orgasmic finale scene to one of the middle episodes is a particularly well-done scene.The first episode has Kasuga’s friends arguing whether a movie is in the horror genre or romance genre, foreshadowing the blurry line in Flowers of Evil itself. There’s a light horror aspect as Kasuga is trapped in his situation and forced to risk embarrassing himself by the demands of the seemingly sadistic Nakamura who stalks him daily, and these scenes can be tense and difficult to watch. It displays some of the shame of adolescent bullying, but I wish it went further with its themes of sexuality and its psychological impact on those discovering sex for the first time. It was twisting these themes and progressing to more severe places until the final five or so episodes. At this point the series becomes less about taking its themes to new places and demonstrating them in other ways and more about the teen melodrama of its three leads. This strikes me as a mistake that makes the show far less interesting, as it gives some immediate semi-closure of the main characters before it’s given us enough of a metric of their true selves for these revelations to feel meaningful and deserved. The motivations and true feelings of Kasuga and Nakamura are so vaguely defined at this point that the weight behind their emotional drama feels hyper exaggerated compared to what we’ve seen of them so far. This turns their teenage angst into something more slight, like how a teenager overreacts to a breakup rather than the more drastic, darker social commentary that made the series initially gripping. It was too much too soon to turn this psychological drama into a relationship drama. To make matters worse, the already slow series seems to grind its progress to a halt. The cinematography shots and slow walking scenes now become a chore when the introspection behind them is now that same slight teen melodrama rather than alienation and anxiety.After the series uses all of this remaining time just to resolve its plot conflicts, the themes it explored prior to this have ended before they were able to make a powerful statement on adolescence or society. This promising series ends its evolution too soon and slowly declines into a drawn-out, melodramatic conclusion. The end result is something that will probably only stick with me on a conceptual level, thanks to its strong atmospheric direction and ideas of concepts that could’ve been much more than they were. My curiosity was piqued, but it wasn’t followed up with questions or stimulation. Flowers of Evil’s story itself meant very little to me, and there probably wasn’t much meaning to it in the first place.

yeah i\'ve heard manga\'s good"" this is probably how the usual conversation goes among people who haven\'t seen it. and tbf it\'s infamous reputation is earned. this anime is directed by hiroshi nagahama, who\'s mainly known for mushishi. which is what prompted me to check this show out.the art, the use of rotoscoping is controversial - however he uses rotoscoping to great effect - to depict the everyday movement, character acting and to give it a great surreal, psycho- horror atmosphere.aku no hana is one...of the finest portrayal of teenage anxiety, drama and angst i\'ve seen in media - and thats not just anime. the feeling of being special, puberty effects, the angst, to stand out & being something - the anime addresses it all. sometimes comically or sometimes overblown screamingly dramatic. everything a teen & phases we go through.the series protagonist kasuga reads baudelaire & revels in his snowflake feeling, considering himself special. until nakamura, the rogue barges in his life to tear down all his allusions. kasuga\'s crush saeki is what all this crescendo revolves around and all three teenagers embark on a road leading to... well thats the gist.the series is masterful in its thriller/suspense elements, and hiroshi nagahama takes his time to do so. its slow but purposefully. the soundtrack is simply great, but the droning sound effect is ever present that aids in the uncomfortable atmosphere to a great extent. both the op & ED are fantastic, the OP is comically edgy emo with main voice actors singing but the ED is beautifully haunting. it\'ll stay with you.rotoscoping (which is used very well) aside the fantastic & quite eye pleasing part of this show is it\'s backgrounds. done by studio pablo they\'re rich in adding great volume and sombre atmosphere to the setting village. there are at times few visual cues reused which imo is great depiction of mundane elements of life & character\'s life.in a nutshell this is a great anime title with limited exposure due to its art but also one of the shining pieces of anime this decade with its handling of teenage drama & angst. the source material (manga) by shuzo oshimi is fantastic in itself (and you\'ll sense it watching the anime) but the anime does a fine job of bringing this thriller in motion.episode 13 is a sort of a teaser to manga/s2 but even without the first 12 episodes are fantastic in itself. as an anime i give it 9/10 overall but as a recommendation it\'s 10/10. if for nothing else check this anime out for episode 7 - which has one of the best moments in anime i\'ve ever seen. incredibly powerful stuff.and to top this review off - HANA GA SAITA YO. of the finest portrayal of teenage anxiety, drama and angst i\'ve seen in media - and thats not just anime. the feeling of being special, puberty effects, the angst, to stand out & being something - the anime addresses it all. sometimes comically or sometimes overblown screamingly dramatic. everything a teen & phases we go through.the series protagonist kasuga reads baudelaire & revels in his snowflake feeling, considering himself special. until nakamura, the rogue barges in his life to tear down all his allusions. kasuga\'s crush saeki is what all this crescendo revolves around and all three teenagers embark on a road leading to... well thats the gist.the series is masterful in its thriller/suspense elements, and hiroshi nagahama takes his time to do so. its slow but purposefully. the soundtrack is simply great, but the droning sound effect is ever present that aids in the uncomfortable atmosphere to a great extent. both the op & ED are fantastic, the OP is comically edgy emo with main voice actors singing but the ED is beautifully haunting. it\'ll stay with you.rotoscoping (which is used very well) aside the fantastic & quite eye pleasing part of this show is it\'s backgrounds. done by studio pablo they\'re rich in adding great volume and sombre atmosphere to the setting village. there are at times few visual cues reused which imo is great depiction of mundane elements of life & character\'s life.in a nutshell this is a great anime title with limited exposure due to its art but also one of the shining pieces of anime this decade with its handling of teenage drama & angst. the source material (manga) by shuzo oshimi is fantastic in itself (and you\'ll sense it watching the anime) but the anime does a fine job of bringing this thriller in motion.episode 13 is a sort of a teaser to manga/s2 but even without the first 12 episodes are fantastic in itself. as an anime i give it 9/10 overall but as a recommendation it\'s 10/10. if for nothing else check this anime out for episode 7 - which has one of the best moments in anime i\'ve ever seen. incredibly powerful stuff.and to top this review off - HANA GA SAITA YO.', 'This is a SPOILER FREE review.To kick off things, this anime is NOT a 10/10. That is my personal opinion. With a more objective view I would rate this anime at 8 out of 10. It is not anime for the faint of heart or for people who enjoy ""fast food"" anime. It is an anime for people who appreciate the image and can enjoy a much different type of anime, that are not following the ""rules"".Let\'s jump right into the scores:Story 9/10: The only reason this is not a 10, is because of the ending. The story is about a middle school boy,...who\'s troubled by his view of the world, more or less, a confused teenage, typical teenage drama, right? No, it evolves in a breathtaking drama story with stunning visual to go along the way. It depicts the small Japanese town society in an absolutely terrifying way! The strictness of this society, the social dead-ends people meat. The way that other people\'s words can play with your mind. It is a coming-of age anime, in the darkest way possible. Be ready though, for slow scenes. As I said, this anime is for people can appreciate a slower pace.Art 10/10: This section is going to be cut in smaller parts, in order to perfectly define this anime\'s art.#1 Backgrounds: Here, most people will agree, the drawings of the backgrounds are master level, especially for a TV anime, reaching the levels of 5 Centimeters per Second. They are truly eye candy.#2 Character Design: This is either a 10/10 or 1/10. For me, it is the first. The characters look weird, by all means. However, this immensely realistic look, I could even call it hyper realistic (?) is just breathtaking. Each character is really unique, the clothing are just perfect. The anime focuses a lot on body language, since at times the facial expressions are hidden completely, which for me is a really nice touch. Sometimes the body says much more than the mouth. Be warned though, this style is not for a lot of people. It is NOT your typical anime.#3 Animation: The animation is a bit of experimental here. I might have enjoyed something smoother, although by the end of the anime, I liked it so much I wanted more. It is on the slow side, probably less than 20 frames per second, so it needs a bit to get used to, but I believe it is really enjoyable and serves the purpose.#4 Atmosphere: Here is where this anime shines bright! The colors, the locations, the whole creepiness. It all just sits perfect in conjunction with all the rest.Sound 10/10: The OST is magical! That is the best way to describe it. I know when the music makes me cry and I have to search it afterwards, that it is doing something right. The ending was also really nice, cannot say the same about the opening sadly.Characters 9/10: I would have liked to see more character development on Sawa Nakamura, the only reason again this is not 10/10 :) . The main character Kasuga is somehow not exactly your typical teenager! Filled with dark thoughts and doubts, he is probably not relatable to the audience (for the best I guess), somehow if you can relate to him then this anime will become something more. The struggle of love, the magnification of problems that aren\'t really serious, all the s**t a teenager\'s mind can muster, it is in here. It is done in a scarily realistic way, which makes it even better. The girl of the anime, Sawa Nakamura, is a mystery. She is crazy, weirdly sexual and an outcast. Again perfectly depicted with the exception of her background which comes too late in the anime. Generally, all the characters are really well developed, even the not really important ones, which adds to the realism this anime tries to achieve.Enjoyment 10/10: People who enjoy dark/drama stories will probably enjoy this. It is just the right amount of creepiness and sadness for a perfect mixture of sad anime.Extra: The opening really ruined some of the pacing at points, but doesn\'t really ruin the anime thank god. I would heavily recommend this to people who have read Oyasumi Punpun and are searching something similar in anime. This anime is what I would the avant garde of anime. It is more than the stupid ""fast food"" anime like Attack on Titan or Sword Art Online and it is more ""progressive"" than some the best anime out there. I would definitely suggest this to anybody who wants a serious anime, as long as you are ready to handle the art-style, which is not easy! Still, give it a try. who\'s troubled by his view of the world, more or less, a confused teenage, typical teenage drama, right? No, it evolves in a breathtaking drama story with stunning visual to go along the way. It depicts the small Japanese town society in an absolutely terrifying way!

The ending was also really nice, cannot say the same about the opening sadly.Characters 9/10: I would have liked to see more character development on Sawa Nakamura, the only reason again this is not 10/10 :) . The main character Kasuga is somehow not exactly your typical teenager! Filled with dark thoughts and doubts, he is probably not relatable to the audience (for the best I guess), somehow if you can relate to him then this anime will become something more. The struggle of love, the magnification of problems that aren\'t really serious, all the s**t a teenager\'s mind can muster, it is in here. It is done in a scarily realistic way, which makes it even better. The girl of the anime, Sawa Nakamura, is a mystery. She is crazy, weirdly sexual and an outcast. Again perfectly depicted with the exception of her background which comes too late in the anime. Generally, all the characters are really well developed, even the not really important ones, which adds to the realism this anime tries to achieve.Enjoyment 10/10: People who enjoy dark/drama stories will probably enjoy this. It is just the right amount of creepiness and sadness for a perfect mixture of sad anime.Extra: The opening really ruined some of the pacing at points, but doesn\'t really ruin the anime thank god. I would heavily recommend this to people who have read Oyasumi Punpun and are searching something similar in anime. This anime is what I would the avant garde of anime. It is more than the stupid ""fast food"" anime like Attack on Titan or Sword Art Online and it is more ""progressive"" than some the best anime out there. I would definitely suggest this to anybody who wants a serious anime, as long as you are ready to handle the art-style, which is not easy! Still, give it a try.', ""This is just one of those anime that are I dunno how do I put this, bluntly its boring, way too slow paced.Basically it is about this guy called Kasuga who steals his crush's gym clothes gets spotted and is forced to form a contract with Nakamura to make sure his secret is not revealed.Honestly it was so illogical it was weird who just grabs someones gym clothes and runs? Who would actually care about the contract, the girl who fored it with you is doing horrible things to you, like stripping you in a library?I quite liked the art it really made the...characters look Japanese unlike other anime such as Infinite Stratos were different nationalities look the sameOverall this anime was way too slow paced for my liking, I read the manga in high hopes the manga would be just as thrilling and exciting but nope. It sucked. Go read the manga intstead of watching ths trust me you will have a much more enjoyable time characters look Japanese unlike other anime such as Infinite Stratos were different nationalities look the sameOverall this anime was way too slow paced for my liking, I read the manga in high hopes the manga would be just as thrilling and exciting but nope.

Whilst there is NO SPOLIRES I recommend you watch/read the manga before reading this review. I also will be mentioning some difficult subjects such as a SH and Depression but do NOT go into vivid details. Finally- This response is relatively my gut response instead of an long thought out scripted analyses/review. Either way I hope if you decided to read you find my response interesting, if not relate yourself. I would love to hear you responses/reviews to me and/or Aku No Hana itself. :)I hate...this series and its characters; its dirty, its wrong, its pretentious, its ambiguous and most of all its perverted!- yet I found myself engrossed in this sires, unable to look away. With every turn with every twist I felt sick to my stomach, It was so infuriating, frustrating, sickening, yet I kept watching- Like a car crash, I couldn't look away- A car crash so brutal and destructive yet its fires shone brighter than the stars in the sky and my eyes wouldn't lose its sight and neither would my mind.I, as of now, have consumed both, the anime and manga, reading the manga 2 years later after my first viewing of the anime, yet this will mostly talk about my experience with the anime.When I first watch this anime, I was in a very dark place- It was Christmas eve, I just lost my first love through a VERY messy break up, losing my best friend in the process, as well as I had ongoing family issues and struggled with SH and depression at the time, and worst of all I was young, I was so young (I'm fine now, and only mentioning for context of my mind set while I viewed the show, so please don't worry or think I am looking for attention. :)). I was feeling numb, like a hole was inside my chest, and no matter what I did I could not fill it- so I looked for distraction, something to keep my mind of...well everything, and along my search I came across Aku No Hana.I watched the first episode, then another, then another, then another, and before I knew it it was Christmas Day, and I had consumed the entire show. It took awhile before it sunk in. Looking back it all looks like a fever dream, the whole experience.I think for the whole next day I just ran on auto-pilot; meeting family members, presents, Christmas stuff, only when I laid in bed later that night did I find myself pondering over the whole show and all its meaning. It was disgusting yet so intriguing and I truly lost myself in it or did I find myself in it I couldn't tell.To NOT relate to this series and its characters is something I wish I could claim I didn't- But I did- Nakamaru, Saeki, and even Kasuga in every one of them I found glimpses of myself, not always positive, not always negative but they were there, and a lot of that is down to just how human they felt, (witch i felt was further enthused through the medium of rotoscope animation used, but that an argument for a different day.:0) It just felt so real, and even now, YEARS later do i once again find myself come back to this series and rewatch and egrouse myself in it once again- and i believe that's the magic of aku no hana- the magic of connection, and comfort in not being alone. (obviously there's a lot more than that, but that would involve spoiler territory.)  In Spite of this that's eth very opposite of how the characters feel in the show, majorly Nakamura's views and perspectives of the world and those around her, and through the show i feel we watch as they struggle with that loneliness and until well that's something you'll have to find out for yourself. ;)Anyways ima end it here- I have so much more to say but im afraid ill write a whole thesis on this show if I don't stop her.

Whether for the experimental choices or for the rabid teenagerous-driven plot, it has reached an infamous spot in the most underground spaces of anime world. Now, I like the manga and truly find the story\'s ups and downs truly surprising, including the closing.That\'s the main reason why I didn\'t really have a good time with this.***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***Takao Kasuga, our...protagonist, is your typical no-friends shy kid, who is going through the neverending puzzles every teenage goes through. He is a heavy Charles Baudelaire fan, with a special note for the writer\'s most proeminent piece: Les Fleurs du Mal (or The Flowers of Evil, in plain english). He also withholds a platonic love for Nanako Saeki, the idol from classroom and his ""Madonna"", as he mentions a couple of times with a boisterous and passionate voice. Besides them, we have the most iconic character in the plot: Sawa Nakamura, a problematic student, whose main abilities revolve around acting weird and shouting swearings for the teacher in charge (initially).One day, right after the class ends, Takao remembers that he forgot his beloved Fleurs du Mal, and returns to the classroom, leaving his school coleagues behind. That\'s when he find the gym clothes of Nanako on the floor. Right when Takao finds it, a random outside sound blasts, scaring him to such a level that he just threw Nanako\'s clothes into his bag, straight out of fear.What\'s truly interesting about this is that he could\'ve just put in the place where it was, but his mind and unconscious wishes acted for him. Takao\'s true intentions show its face, even though he doesn\'t know about this (yet). In the day after, Sawa, the third party involved, calls Kasuga to the library. There she tells, with more details, the whole story about how she saw what the boy did, and from that very moment she starts blackmailing him; out of fear from having his sin discovered by the class (and his Madonna in special), Kasuga gets trapped in a cycle of menace, physical and psychological pressure. Eventually, Nanako finds out about it, and she accepts Kasuga just the way he is, which leads to a weird love triangle.But this is just the beginning of the story, and the very place where Aku no Hana stops. From all I said, you can guess this is not your usual plot. The idea behind it is very enticing and interesting, so what went wrong?One of the reasons is the direction. From the beginning of the anime to tbe very end, it\'s clear that the production team was aiming for experimentalism and excentricity. However, this not only made the whole plot a drag to watch, but axed the way the relations between characters work.In episode 1, NOTHING happens for FIFTEEN FREAKING MINUTES. With the only important scene being the one I mentioned earlier, regarding the gym clothes. From there on, the anime becomes a mess and a disaster artistically speaking.There are lots of unneeded dragged moments just for the sake of it, which don\'t serve as anything besides boring the viewer. The scene when Kasuga and Sawa are returning from home after painting the classroom (the cathartic moment both share together) was transformed into a Windows background screen. Those who remember the scene know what I am talking about. Not to mention the lazy takes, consisting of a single frame, in order to don\'t waste cash in extra scenes.The songs are okay. Rather freakish, trippy and funky, but nothing really stands out. The opening scenes are just different filters of the same plain white background. The ending was the only memorable OST worth mentioning, with Hana ga Saku being one of the most iconic themes I\'ve ever heard. It is odd, it is musically disturbing and it fits well to the initial concept.Now, the main reason so many people turn a bad eye: the rotoscope. Aku no Hana has been heavily criticized (and still is) for the laugh inducing animation choice. Frankly, it was a really bad call, and didn\'t really serve the ""disturb the audience"" idea; at least for me, since all I did was cringe. But let\'s be honest here. Is this really so important? With all the issues and risky choices this show carries, this is the minor. The only thing that grinds my gears is how did Oshimi thought the rotoscopic choice would be somewhat positive.All in all, this is not an anime I would recommend. I can see why it gained a spotlight in a little group of the community, since it\'s a way different approach to the manga, and a bold leap of faith. It\'s almost like what Casshern Sins is to Casshern, but sincerely the manga did a better job. Still worth a watch if you want to try a different title.Thank you for reading. protagonist, is your typical no-friends shy kid, who is going through the neverending puzzles every teenage goes through.

ABSOLUTELY YES!!I wrote my full spoilerless review on this anime on:https://fanperspectivereviews.wordpress.com/2021/12/06/most-underrated-anime-ever/I really think this is the most underrated anime of all time. It did not get the recognition it truly deserved. But I really do love this anime. It is actually my most favorite one!Also, I loved Mariya Ise here. She's been amazing and astonishing as ever! I would love to hear more from her.I also read the manga on this. All I can say is... JUSTICE! Please read the manga too if you loved the anime. You won't regret it. "", 'This is a visceral, anxiety inducing show. Takao gets blackmailed and bullied and you can just feel the dread, the panic and the paranoia. He fears things going well just as much as he does things going to hell. The first half of this show is fucking brutal in it’s realism. I’ve never been bullied or witnessed bullying but this definitely feels authentic. More and more Nakamaru pushes Takao, trying to make him like her, trying to convince him to live without common sense. The sheer fucking twisted dread of this all is incredibly gripping and it never let go of my attention, before climaxing...in this horrifying yet rejuvenating scene where the caracter gives in. That scene was absolutely astounding. But then afterwards he feels empty, he doesn’t feel happy. He gets the happy ending but he isn’t happy about it. These characters are broken, fucked up, compelling, but most importantly, realistic. The stakes are small but they feel so fucking real. Takao made one mistake in a moment of weakness and it spirals into hell for him. He’s constantly wracked with guilt and fear and we feel it with him. It’s an emotionally draining show. After the climatic scene the next episode starts with a 9 minute walking scene. No dialogue, no actions other than slowly walking. But the music, the amazing cinematography and the character animation just create this melancholic feeling of somber haunting sadness. It’s so fucking good and it doesn’t feel forced in the slightest. The score is haunting and fantastic. But the greatest feat of this show is its animation. It sort of reminds me of Ping Pong the Animation’s animation. It’s really realistic and it’s what sells these emotions and characters. For the first time in anime they actually look Japanese. What this show understands is that humans are always in motion. We’re never just standing still or just walking. We teeter, we itch, we fidget, we shake our leg, we mess with our clothes, etc. Even the way we stand and walk are different. In that walking scene you can tell so much about the characters and how they feel just by looking at their feet. You can tell everything about the characters without ever needing to speak. That is good fucking animation. If there was one issue, I wish they better defined the blackmail because if it was his word against hers I think they would believe him, so the fact he goes along with the blackmail seems odd. in this horrifying yet rejuvenating scene where the caracter gives in.

The anime version of Aku no Hana is a dreadful attempt to capture the feeling of the original manga in shockingly bad animation.Story: 3/10The story follows the plot for the first few volumes of the manga. Not much is left out, nor is any filler added. So why is the story rated a 3? It's because holy shit it is boring...to watch in the anime. It is horribly drawn out to the point where I audibly told the anime to get a bloody move on. Between the snail pace and the other sections of this review, only a shred of the enjoyment from the story of the manga is even possible in the anime. Additionally, the anime has some pretty bad translations of seemingly simple words that really make or break the story. For example, basically the whole motivation of one of the characters is trying to another 'pervert' in the town where she lives, but unfortunately pervert is translated to 'sicko'. This is a seemingly small thing to get upset about but in my opinion it gives the impression that the translators did not even understand the point of the story.Art: 1/10I will admit, the backgrounds in this anime are beautiful to the point where they are some of the best I've seen in anime, and for that reason it was tempting to give the art section a slightly higher score. However, the characters, who are the focal point of the anime, are animated so badly that it cancels out any possible credit for the backgrounds. To elaborate, the characters are not animated in a standard anime style. They appear somewhat similar to characters in Devilman: Crybaby and Ping-Pong, which are two anime that I think have fantastic animation. Aku no Hana failed miserably to become like those anime that have somewhat avant-garde art styles and instead became what is without a doubt the ugliest anime I have ever seen. The characters are hard to look at because it's that bad. It doesn't end with just bad art for the characters, the actual animation is also dreadful. The movements of the characters appear unnatural and have the fluidity of a badly drawn paper flip book, not to mention random pauses that made me think my computer was buffering.Sound: 2/10Sound? What sound? One of the most important parts of any anime is so scarcely used in Aku no Hana that it gives the impression that there was no-one at the studio who was employed to put music over the animation. The opening song changes several times and each was quite good, hence the 2 instead of a 1. The problem with the opening songs are that none of them even remotely suit the anime. On top of that, the animation part of the openings is the most boring and basic stuff I've ever seen in an anime opening.Character: 1/10Complete dogshit. I will be excluding this anime from future 'most hated anime characters' lists that I may write on forums because they would all be from this anime. The characters here are basically unrecognisable compared to their manga counterparts. The terrible animation makes them not even look vaguely similar to the manga and look more like a live action adaptation instead of anime characters. Due to the appalling animation and pacing, the characters have lost all appeal and characterisation that they originally had.Enjoyment: 1/10This was the longest 13 episodes I have ever watched. It was incredibly boring and even a little bit insulting. I failed to find even a shred of enjoyment while watching this. The only reason I didn't drop this dumpster fire of an anime was so I could give it a fair chance before I reviewed it.Overall: 2/10I'm sure you have a good idea by now of why I hated this anime so in short, if you haven't read the manga, read that instead. If you have, just pretend this anime doesn't exist. to watch in the anime. It is horribly drawn out to the point where I audibly told the anime to get a bloody move on.

If you have, just pretend this anime doesn't exist."", ""Aku no Hana is unique and very well executed. Now the uniqueness in style and topic is what puts off some people. This is why we get a score that looks like middle of the road, which is actually a result of the viewers being really split about it in ones who really hate it and others who absolutely love it. While, ironically, the one thing that everyone probably could agree on would be that Aku no Hana is anything but average. This is why it also makes sense to tag this as 'mixed feelings', because even though it's one of my all time favorites,...it's just fair to accept that not everyone will enjoy this show.If you're ready to explore a lesser trodden path and see things that are oddly ugly and beautiful at the same time, go ahead. The experience you'll get is definitely one that you can't get from your next isekai of the season kind of show.The anime is firmly anchored in realism and all dreamy elements are clearly in the characters' imagination or poetic enhancement of the atmosphere. This is why rotoscoping, sitting between traditional animation and real life acting is a fitting choice. Sadly it's an instant hard pass for some viewers. Don't forget though that this means we're also looking at actors and acting skill and boy do they do a good job! Especially Mariya Ise (Nakamura) is incredible and not holding back a bit. Her presence dominates every scene she is in. As it should be.Our main character (Kasuge) is undecided, wallowing in self-pity and arrogant with his feeling of intellectual superiority, so a type that makes it difficult to side with and feel compassion for. However his inner turmoil is so well explained and explored with the right amount of sympathy, that the viewer can relate.Due to this anime having been planned as a two season run, the ending comes sudden and not very conclusive. But good thinking of the producers to actually at least include a kind of ending, because it's not looking as we'll be getting a second season any time soon.To round up the review, the music needs to be mentioned. It's just as unique and beautifully weird as the rest of the show and therefore and amazingly good fit, but not playlist material. it's just fair to accept that not everyone will enjoy this show.If you're ready to explore a lesser trodden path and see things that are oddly ugly and beautiful at the same time, go ahead.

It was a great watch but ends without a boom. a silent killerthis main character is something else. its really something i struggle putting into words he seems dumb and stupid (because season 2 and i reapeat will never come out) but that made the show for me....mistakes after mistakes becomes an unstoppable snowball of madness. mistakes after mistakes becomes an unstoppable snowball of madness.', ""When I first saw Aku no Hana i didn't get him the credit it deserves.I know some people hate it because of the rotoscopy technique and others due to changes in scenes from the original manga. I'm making this review only having read the parts of the manga that aren't adaptedBut i strongly feel like this anime adaptation is one of the vest ever made with an incredible artistic vision and direction most close to independent cinema than standard Tv Anime.The characters acting, the amazing sound and music work and the long atmospheric introspective sequences (like chapter 7 amazing climax) truly elevates what otherwise would...be a edgy emo story more.It is important to claim the merits of this kind of animes, specially when in this case it become a comrecial failure when it whas first relese, if we whant more mature and risky projects get done, we must stand for the one that alreday exists and aren't doing that great be a edgy emo story more.It is important to claim the merits of this kind of animes, specially when in this case it become a comrecial failure when it whas first relese, if we whant more mature and risky projects get done, we must stand for the one that alreday exists and aren't doing that great"", ""Never heard of this anime before but after reading the synopsis, its look kind of a dark anime so i watched it and i must have it very dark and its kind of good actually despite seeing some hate towards this anime.Story: 7/10 Kasuga Takao is a quiet boy who loves reading books till one day he went to his classroom as he lost his book at his classroom then he saw Saeki Nanako's gym clothes and steal it cause he heard sound coming outside of his classroom and went home.

The story is incredibly disturbing. It will make you feel unsecure, embarrassed and stressed. So, why watch it? Why torture yourself?Emotinal impact of the story (9/10):After each peak in the anime, I expected some sort of resolution, some positivity. I was waiting for something good to happen. But each time, the story gradually gets darker, the problems get bigger and the tension gets stronger. I realized that I actually love this feeling. I know it sound weird but the reason is similar to why there are people love dramatic or...tragedic stories with sad endings.Characters (8/10):Well, we have three high school students with psychological problems. Their behaviors and personalities are inconsistent and annoying, but it fits to the context. I didn't like any of them, but they are not designed to be liked in the first place.

He is probably one of the most annoying characters in an anime.Animation (10/10):I haven't read the manga, and manga readers seem to hate the rotoscope technique used in the anime.

It just uses reverse psychology and makes most to react in the exact opposite way than they usually do but it shares the same problem most shows do when it comes to evaluation. As it usually goes, most judge if a show is good solely on how it looks or feels instead of how good its material is or if its themes are presented properly. This is why we get embarrassing situations such as most anime fans yelling how shows like Code Geass are the most amazing things ever made and...completely disregard how terrible their plots and presentation were. Aku no Hana is sharing the same problem but from the opposite side of the same coin.IT IS UGLY!Really, that is what 99% of everybody speaks of when they refer to it. Screw context, just look at the exterior. As far as this issue goes you can easily divide said impressions into two major groups. There are those who call it lazily made, low budget, completely different to the manga artwork, or simply not good fap material. Then there is the other side which calls it unorthodox, experimental, different, and fitting to its disturbed themes. From where I am standing, I say they are both right. The animation is done with the old technique of rotoscoping; that is to first film live actors doing the motions and then drawing over them to produce the final animation. This method was used for several decades since it was making the motions of the characters to feel very natural. Disney’s Snow White is the oldest good example of that. Eventually, this method was dropped by most after computers came along to do most of the work. Plus, it was a very complicating and time consuming process, so many didn’t bother to use it after awhile and preferred to have cartoony characters that didn’t require realistic motions.From what I wrote someone would assume that since the show is made with rotoscoping it must have very detailed and fluent motions. Yet here is the nasty part; it doesn’t. You see, the technique requires a high amount of frames per second, as well as detailed consistency between them; without that it looks weird. Aku no Hana has very jerky motions and the characters lack very basic details, such as having no faces or lightening when they are a few meters away from the camera. This makes them look bizarre, especially next to the backgrounds which retain a detailed and full of textures look. I wouldn’t say that makes them unappealing to the eye but it sure makes them un-anime-like. It is hard for most fans to like a different style and even harder if they were accustomed to the pretty typical style of the manga version.At the same time it is true what others say about it; it stands out. If you are fed up with all those overused anime-style characters and their copy-pasted into infinity school grounds, then chances are you are going to embrace this artwork as a breath of fresh air. I sure didn’t mind it much since not only I am fed up with Kyoani’s and Shonen Jump styles, but also because I grew up watching animations from various countries. I am much more tolerant to bizarre styles and most of the times I even like them just for being bizarre. But that doesn’t mean I liked it much either. The problems of low frame rate and minimalism make it indeed hard to get into even for me. And for Pete’s sakes; it still is yet another school-themed show, a typical artwork fits it just fine. This is not some bizarre setting like in the cases of Kaiba where it would be excused. I still like how the director is using camera angles and cinematics but that is all; visual effects aside it is indeed low budget and not very appealing. Which is sort of like the trademark of all studio Zexcs works; those guys never made an above average show in their whole lives.Ok, enough with the animation; let’s try to say a few things about the stuff almost nobody wants to talk about. You know, the plot? And perhaps the characters? Because there are more things in a show besides how pretty or ugly it is. You didn’t know that; did you?Anyways, as far as plot and characters goes, the anime belongs to after-Bakemonogatari era of ecchiness. Meaning, it is about deviant fetishes and very little about anything else. Ok, they try to make it seem more than that by having the character reading books and using poems but in practice that offers absolutely nothing in terms of depth. It is about a bunch of teenagers with problems doing deviant stuff out of sexual frustration; the end. There is literally nothing else to talk about them; they are pretty bland and the show craves on them remaining deviant and not on trying to slowly mature or at least make them normal. Meaning, this is no Onani Master Kurosawa or Welcome to the NHK. It is beneath them but still a step above a mediocre ecchi comedy.BUT WAIT! The show also tries to be some sort of psychological thriller at points by having the main characters losing themselves to some bizarre hallucinations that are sex-related and are fuelled by the poems this show is named after. Doesn’t that make it far better than a typical ecchi school comedy or something? Doesn’t the fact that the girls don’t look like overused fap material like in the manga but rather something bizarre or ugly make them more memorable? Well... it would if the show wasn’t a low budget Zexcs production. It feels ugly to the aesthetic part of your brain and not so much because the animation is weird. And it doesn’t have anything past the one-trick pony of deviance in it, such as giant robots ala Neon Genesis or weird VR worlds like Ressentiment. Do you know how easy it is to be bored of it because of that? Especially if it’s meant to be depressing and not some escapism BS.Anyways, despite whatever good ideas it has, Aku no Hana will be remembered as an infamous anime of the likes of School Days. Which is still far more than being simply forgotten like most shows do; a thing that would definitely had happened if it was made with the overused style of the manga.

After some series of events, the actions he has taken during his Life led him to become a messed up personality eventually.....I personally can\'t find anything scary or ""interesting"" rather the unsettling feeling that i get when i put myself in the protagonists place. The unsettling feeling i get is only because i see the protagonist taking actions and making choices I would\'ve never done and managing situations the way that doesn\'t even make sense to me, most of the time getting on my nerves. I wanna relate but I can\'t. I wanna feel but i can\'t.I just can\'t stand seeing a deaydreaming wimpy little teenager get manipulated, laughed at, despised, getting depression by his own thoughts.It almost feels like the protagonist has no choice in life and is being put to the trials just for the sake of it (kinda unrealistic if you ask me) without being able to change a thing, while in reality it\'s the other way around, you make your choices in life and you stand for yourself in times of need.My recommendation for this anime to my friends will be ""watch it if you want to see a miserable life of a guy-gone-mad""Soundtracks are amazing nonetheless, especially the creepy ending. The only creepy thing about this series if you ask me. The soundtracks work Great with the anime and plays a huge role giving character to the series fitting great in many scenes.The animation feels Whacky but it actually is the chosen art style they went with, so it feels natural in a way once you get used to it. The surroundings were the best part for me with much more detail and a great world building giving you the complete feeling of getting to know the town they live in ,with great sense of direction.Overall it definately feels like a weird trip through someone else\'s life.It sure feels different from your usual anime used to be. it definately isn\'t for everyone,but it\'s sure worth checking out and figuring it out by ourself.

Very few times in this show does anyone ever succeed in anything, and you soon realize its pointless to root for anyone as they all play by their own rules. This show can be disgusting and depressing at times but you really cannot take your eyes off of it. The whole thing is really just a sick twisted example of something that can happen to anyone. It does a good job of reminding the watcher that even if we don't see our selves as deviants, deep down we all...have a much darker part of ourselves that we rarely ever let out. Maybe if we repress those emotions too much, they might just explode out one day making our former self the new prisoner in our body. The negative feelings you experience while watching this just make it feel that more authentic. Sometimes we need a break of the samurais fighting goblins anime to remind ourselves that there are stories out there that draw more inspiration from real life. I also really really loved the creepy and chilling ending song that plays at the end of every episode. It complements the show perfectly. My biggest problems with this anime are the art style and the ending. I like that it looks more realistic but they really made some of the characters look ugly in comparison to their manga counter parts.

I feel like that's what Aku no Hana suffered the most from.Art and animation: Polarizing to say the least. Do you think anime should be constricted to cartoony, big eyed aliens with bizarre hairdos? No? Then you might enjoy this art style. Aku no Hana uses stylized rotoscoped actors and in my opinion uses it well. Sure not everybody looks like a pop idol but the style fits the story. What...rotoscope brought to the table is a degree of realism, variety and subtlety in facial expressions and gestures as well as smoother animation. Even if outside of that Aku no Hana rather rarely uses benefits of animation I think everything mentioned above is enough. There are some surreal special effects sprinkled throughout and some really cool camera work but it's too few and far between to become anything really special.When it comes to backgrounds it's more or less standard affair. It's mostly just painted over photos but they are painted over really well, I'd even say it looks superior to a lot of digitally drawn backgrounds in recent anime.Sound: music in this show is rare and mostly consists of ambient tracks used during some contemplative scenes. There's also the really interesting ED song with weird, chopped up and digitized vocals and off-tune but strangely melodic wind instruments that create the feeling of someone losing a grip on reality. It appropriately plays during important moments when something genuinely messed up happens.Not sure if OP reaches the same amount of harmony with the show but upbeat jazzy tracks reminded me a bit of Shiina Ringo and Mayumi Kojima which is never a bad thing.Story and characters: these two are inseparable for AnH as it is very much a story about characters. AnH seemingly sets out to explore what it's like to be a misfit in a society that rejects any deviation from normalcy by colliding a small main cast of atypical and eccentric characters against their more ordinary peers and family members. It was almost painful at times to see just how hopelessly absolute the disconnect between a child and parent can be which I think is a testament to how believable the characters were though unfortunately few of them are even close to being as fleshed out as Kasuga who still could have some blank spaces filled.It also seems to delve into what matters more in a relationship or what makes us love since Kasuga is torn between kind and beautiful Saeki and rough, unhinged Nakamura who however might be the only person to understand him on a personal level.I'm not and won't say any of this with certainty though, because as of now the story is not even close to being finished, and with how much time has passed since release I'd doubt that sequel is coming any time soon. Manga might offer a more complete story but I'm not reviewing the manga here.Directing: Aku no Hana is brimming with shots that are just nice to look at when not straight up impressive. Everything is tied together together nicely into easy to follow, coherent narrative and it makes sure to throw in a short flashback or two to make sure the viewer is following along. However pacing is atrocious and AnH loves a bit too much to throw in long, silent, contemplative scenes when it's not warranted. One example is particularly bad, in episode 8 I think there's about 5 minutes of just walking silently. There are ways to depict characters silently walking around town for a  long period of time without boring the viewer with overly long, boring scenes.Fun factor: despite everything I mentioned, AnH is still a very unique experience and in my tiny onion it's worth giving a try if you're a fan of the media.

The characters and sceneries are realistic and beautiful, the sound of ambience are perfectly mixed with the images adding up to its realism. The result is an animated series that feels like a film.The show is filled with nonstop psychological horror that will put you on edge...on every single episode, making it one of the best in the genre and a easy recommendation to those who are able to enjoy this kind of series. on every single episode, making it one of the best in the genre and a easy recommendation to those who are able to enjoy this kind of series."", 'Here\'s the thing - this show was incredible to me, and then...it stalled out in the next to last ep.

It is rich with thought-provoking subjects.• I read some of Shuuzou Oshimi\'s other works, such as Avant-Garde Yumeko, Devil Ecstasy, Drifting Net Café, Sweet Poolside, Shino Can\'t Say Her Own Name, Inside Mari, Happiness, and A Trail of Blood.• And let\'s just say that most of Oshimi\'s works are usually just plain smut.○ Happiness is the only work of his that can even come close to Flowers of Evil in maturity, and I couldn\'t value it on its own merit...based on the glaring similarities to the Swedish novel, Let The Right One In. Inside Mari is touted as one of his best works, but the twist was predictable and the ending was unsatisfying and left the 2deep4you factor too wide open.○ Flowers of Evil itself is commentary on adolescence, perversion, anarchy, and the true meaning of evil that mirrors the type of sadistic themes of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch\'s grand opus Venus in Furs. Though many thought of it as an unnecessarily edgy and sick take on the coming-of-age story genre, the perspective of the main character seemed realistic and relatable to me.○ The manga and anime series take as the voyeuristic approach as mentally unstable, mysterious, and ever fascinating, Sawa Nakamura, that leads the protagonist into the depths of madness. As you consume the spiraling narrative, you are taken captive by Sawa, wondering, is she good or is she evil, or is she just a human being?○ She definitely partakes in socially unacceptable behavior and is menacing, but is seen through a sympathetic lens when Kasuga gradually begins to fall in love with her and sees that those who wear the pretty masks are actually the evil ones. There is something definitely pure about Sawa, in her hatred of falsity and childish desire to escape from their town that\'s ""(quote/unquote) drowning in shitheads.""○ I may have more of a bias towards this series, because I was in a similar relationship and felt for Kasuga. I guess, this story just happened to find me at the right time. I\'ve heard other anime fans call this show ""the next School Days"" and say that it\'s easily forgettable, or by 4chan\'s standards, it\'s ""Linkin Park: The Manga."" Despite all of the cutting remarks, Flowers of Evil strongly resonated with me.○ Flowers of Evil, the manga and anime, have nothing to do with the original Le Fleurs du Mal, which is Kasuga\'s favorite book in the series. I read Charles Bauldlaire\'s poetry tome shortly after obsessing over Aku no Hana, and much to my dismay, the poetry had little to nothing to do with the themes of the Japanese comic version. The poems were very avant-garde and perverse with strong necrophiliac undertones.○ Reading the book didn\'t do much for me, but it did give me more clarity on Kasuga. A teenager who loves a book and pretentiously pretends to know the meaning, while looking down at his classmates, all the while, hiding his own perversions. As I mentioned earlier, the characters are very well-written. I won\'t spoil what happens later, but all of the main cast are unraveled in beautiful and disgusting ways. Much like the title of this series suggests: Flowers of Evil○ I recommend the manga over the anime, but I experienced the show while it was airing and was simultaneously reading the manga that was publishing, side-by-side. In my opinion, engaging in both forms of the medium was the best way to take in Aku no Hana. Many people are not fond of the rotoscoping in the anime, which I don\'t blame them for. It looks weird, but there are some really well-directed scenes in the TV show and I loved the soundtrack, especially the ending theme.○ Overall, Flowers of Evil is very psychological and wrought with the angst of a teenager unable to have true liberation in the constraints of society, as well as sexually. If you\'re a fan of deeply psychological and surreal experiences, this is exactly the series you\'ve been anticipating, but warning: it is very divisive and will push ones’ buttons. It’s up to youーwhether they are buttons you want to be pressed.

Sawa Nakamura sees him in the act and threatens to tell all his peers if he doesn\'t abide by her beck and call.Although the premise doesn\'t sound too interesting, the story takes off quite quickly, escalating into emotionally harrowing territory. The relationship between Kasuga and Nakamura is as complicated as the relationship between the audience and the characters. No one is a ""good guy."" In fact, they\'re almost deplorable, yet I couldn\'t help feeling invested in them.Also, I appreciate the fact...that pretty much the whole thing is rotoscoped because I\'m tired of seeing the same animation. It\'s not for everyone, but I thought it complimented the show. It seemed like most every director\'s choice had a reason. The use of camera angles to instill uneasiness or extreme long shots -- don\'t get me wrong sometimes it killed the pacing-- or even the color pallete.Some might find the show too ""edgy,"" boring, or unrealistic, but I truly believe it\'s just about how you choose to take it all in.Actual rating: 85/100 that pretty much the whole thing is rotoscoped because I\'m tired of seeing the same animation.

This is an interesting story about the corrupted mind of an individual.Full of perverted thoughts and actions.And the breakdowns that lead to his ultimate despair.I’d be lying if I said i didn’t like it. The show is put in three tiers,tier one MC guy,Kasuga has a normal life as a highschool boy, until that moment, tier two- he meets this psychotic...girl named Nakamura and she pretty much screwed up this guy, and finally tier three where all hell breaks loose and i feel super dirty on the inside. After watching this show, I kinda look back on myself and realize that yeah, i have the ability to do something in the future out of human urges and impulse and so can anyone really. The story definitely does a nice job of showing a downfall of a used-to-be normal high school boy who by the end of the series becomes completely shut down to the points where clinical help is needed,and don’t forget about the people who were already like that before, cuz they are there too.This show has a lot of crazy moments and I found myself thoroughly engaged , but sadly, the entire show didn’t have that pace.Mainly the first bit, which was pretty slow paced, also episodes 7 and 10 where (Im not frickin kidding) half of the entire episodes where people walking and some eerie music and nothing ELSE. Albiet it did happen after some serious sh!t went down.I can see the reason why these moments were here, it’s nice to have a slow moment for the audience to take in what the heck just happened after a critical moment, but they went a bit toooooo far with those moments.But there are parts of the show I do appreciate. The actual dynamic to Kasuga,Nakamura,Saeki were so bold and it took a seriously large step around episode three.It turns less into quirky rom-com and more into a psychological show,which was their intent and by joe they really pulled it off well.Except the ending. OH BOY it was bad. Not because of the concluded(but not really) story,-actually that part was amazing,i remember being genuinely freaked out about a majority into the final episode- but the fact that they tried to tease what chapters from the manga have yet to be adapted -like they animated them too- but surprise,surprise the anime didn’t do well in Japan, so now we will never get a season two.SADThe animation was done by Zexcs who did Omamori Himari, and that anime about dictionaries and that’s all I remember watching from them.This show does stick out in their repertoire because not only is it the most colorless looking show they have produced, but it sticks out by having rotoscope animation used in the entire show. They actually did a nice job with it.Even in the art department. My fear would be that the actors visually would not express the same emotion that an anime character has-i mean that’s hard enough to do already-but the actors in show did a great job not only in movement but in expressions as well, I can tell what they are feeling in each scene and that’s great. Also they really put a lot of detail into certain foreground objects and slow motion bits and it looks amazing on Blu-ray tbh.there are also some down sides,.There are times where the characters would freeze and i have to make sure i didn’t hit pause on accident. A human standing still and an anime boy stand still are two different things. Also ,there are some “interesting” designs, like the guys who are actually girls design wise and the background which is just so dirty looking and unappealing.But that’s about it.The soundtrack is kinda forgettable for me because it never really reveals itself.It’s more like audio drugs if anything. When it comes to those mindf*ck soundtracks, nothing hits home to me more than the monogatari osts because it varied depending on situations and the music sounded different and organic.This show’s ost is organic, but not different,or at least it doesn’t stand out.The openings(which there are three of) are actually good;not only are they sung by the three main characters in this show, but you can tell a lot about them by the lyrics they sing.The ending song is the best,holy crap it is the creepiest song I have heard in forever. It gives me so much anxiety.I don’t see myself listening to it constantly though,but that’s not a bad thing. Not every single thing is made to be seen/heard constantly, but it can be made to tell a message.This ending song is one of those songs.There are three characters I will talk about:Kasuga, Nakamura,and Saeki.Kasuga is one of those people who can easily be manipulated, he’s like a turkey on a tv stand.If you even put a toe towards him, he will crumple down.It’s kinda sad actually for him to become this way. He has no backbone and he loves literature.The best parts about him is when just has enough and takes his anger out on the world. I love how the show handles how his changing behavior affects not only him, but his parents as well.Also, Saeki. Sorry to spoil, but the two end up getting together, but the reason it shows is that this is Saeki’s first time dealing with love, so it’s kinda messed up how her first love gets turned on its head.Nakamura is the real case in this show.At first I wasn’t down for all of her hijinks but in the end(since this review was long enough already) it takes some time to see why the heck she is so demented.All of these characters start of on basic ground but then descend as the story goes on and it is very glorious for sure.I had a nice time with this show, it’s always nice to try new things and after a 30 episode marathon of BLACK CLOVER, i really needed a psychological show to satisfy that stupid elitist part of my personality.I did have to sacrifice some patience and even more patience after episode 7.but in the end, don’t go into this show expecting it to be ‘Serial Experiments Lain”but go into it expecting it to be a rom-com, because it will shock you.Overall-7UPDATE- I looked up the lyrics to the english song and apparently it’s about how there are always people who try give their attention to you in order to help you, but you are so corrupt that you deny your attention to them. In other words, you are too far from saving.Also, that person trying to help you might be similar to you but try to hide it.(i’m not smart so this may not be right, but that’s my theory) girl named Nakamura and she pretty much screwed up this guy, and finally tier three where all hell breaks loose and i feel super dirty on the inside.

It has a lot of cliffhangers. Some people may find the anime disturbing.First, I would like to say that this anime was great, but I was disappointed at the end because there was no season 2 (yet!!!). At the end of the anime, they say there will be a part 2, but this anime was released in 2013, so if you are willing to wait for the season 2 (You can) but who knows when it will be released!!!But that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch the anime because you...can always read the manga (like I did) and then continue the story. The manga has even more thrilling and psychological details and a lot of cliffhangers. The story becomes even more existing and thrilling in the manga that I had to finish it in one day. It made me love the anime even more.1) The story is amazing because it shows how the main character (Kasuga) changes because of a simple mistake he has done, and how that mistake will ruin his life. He acts like any young boy would do when he falls in love, but one thing that he does (take Saeki's uniform with him to his home) makes him regret everything!!!!!!!This mistake will be the key to a world of chaos and mayhem.His life will be turned upside down, he will face a lot of things that will make him discover his true nature (not a boy who just love reading books).I was really impressed by this anime because it shows how some sick people like (Nakamura) can manipulate other peoples rather than help them. She saw him steal Saeki's uniform and starts to manipulate and control his life by threatening him when she says that she will tell everyone about his perverted mind if he doesn't do as she asks of him.(story 10/10)2) I didn't really like the main character (Kasuga), I thought he lacked in personality, but I was really impressed by the other characters (Saeki and Nakamura). Those two are the ones who made me like this anime, they are the ones who will turn this anime into a psychological anime.(Nakamura) is a creepy girl, weird and hated by everyone.(Saeki) is a girl who has always the highest grades and is loved by everyone.This anime starts slow, and let you think of those girls the same way everyone else thinks about them, but you will discover many things about those girls when watching this anime that will make you see that we live in a world that is filled with insanity.Characters (10/10)3) The art is a bit weird (8/10) can always read the manga (like I did) and then continue the story.

Most people at this age do crazy things anyway.Art [4/ 10] - The art is suffering for those who like the  animes normally done, however, I bizarrely enjoyed some form of rotoscopy (but could be live action)Sound [6/ 10] - I do not remember having good moments on the soundtrack, but the ending is really disturbing, and I...think that was the intention. So I thought it was great.Character [8/ 10] - Explore few characters, I think it would be better to get more involved with Saeki, Nanako in more scenes. But Nakamura is a great character, extremely crazy.The kasuga is that typical male character fully submissive, sometimes it's stressful to see him, but it turns out it's nice to see him go crazy in the end.Enjoyment [8/10] - Whether you like it or not, even finding various art defects, among others, it's impossible not to want to finish it. So it's worth itOverall [8/10] - I think if you did reboot with normal art would be a good one, because most people totally reject art. think that was the intention. So I thought it was great.Character [8/ 10] - Explore few characters, I think it would be better to get more involved with Saeki, Nanako in more scenes.

Probably one of the only animes where I can sense massive internal emotional/feeling changes with extremely minimal movement on-screen. (standard anime art style goes for dramatic facial expressions)- Moments of stillness which some may really hate. I think of this as the 'awkward silences' that you may have when talking to someone, or those slow days / hours when it's just the usual in your day. It's refreshing to have an anime that straight on confronts that instead of having to make sure that there is always something happening, and it also feels more realistic that way.Sound:- Enjoyed the soundtrack, much of the music really sticks and is haunting- Lots of ambiance / tone-focused- Great ending theme- Soundtrack also goes for that creepy / minimalist feeling. Also lots of orchestral which I personally enjoy.- The way they mute / muffle some of the background sounds in accordance with the characters' POV is amazing and really draws you in.Character:- At first the characters can be hard to understand- After getting used to the show you can really start to see the world through each of the characters' POV- Characters seem very real and I can definitely see these archetypes existing in your average high school- Very good dynamic between the kids and the parents shown. Parents' reactions fit certain stereotypes of parenting types but the reactions are realistic in a way that it feels frustrating because it feels like wouldn't be too far from IRL.Enjoyment:- Highly enjoyed since it makes you think about many real topics that many people don't think about after getting caught up in their day-to-day.- Heightened enjoyment if you watch this alone at night. Gives a sense of feeling lonely in the world even though there are people everywhere outside.Overall:- Themes I enjoyed while watching this:* Concept of society / group, and the associated 'normie' traits if you want to 'fit in' into society.* Outsiders attract each other even if they aren't the same, but just because you are both outsiders. Two people can be very different but still bond together over how both are 'not included' into the mainstream group / society. For example, a stereotypical bullied kid in high school hangs out with someone who is a combination of mildly delinquent + edgy. The bond of 'not belonging in society' is somehow a very strong bond when compared with 'sharing similar interests' etc., and you can also see IRL how that bonds create very emotionally close groups between people who don't fit into standard societal expectations (e.g. ESP believers, incel groups, 'weebs')* Liking someone due to idolizing them / putting them up on a pedestal. Many real crushes don't go well and/or end when they progress into a relationship due to this. When you find out about their human / dark / other side and the person isn't the same as the picture you painted in your head then everything goes to shit, even though you may have been obsessed with them before.* Society is repressed and fake. This theme comes up a lot in the anime, as well as the notion of wanting to go against / reject the fakeness / cordiality that is required to be seen as a normal human in society.- Anime that speaks to your psyche is very rare, pacing was slow so would be weird if you're watching this with people in the room but if you're able to watch it when everything is quiet / peaceful then the true immersion sinks in.- All the elements cohere very well together and really draw you into the atmosphere of living in a small town with a strict traditional asian culture and generation gap. enough time to really fully pay attention to all the details in a screen / scene)- Subtle facial movements show extensive emotion behind it.

When you find out about their human / dark / other side and the person isn't the same as the picture you painted in your head then everything goes to shit, even though you may have been obsessed with them before.* Society is repressed and fake. This theme comes up a lot in the anime, as well as the notion of wanting to go against / reject the fakeness / cordiality that is required to be seen as a normal human in society.- Anime that speaks to your psyche is very rare, pacing was slow so would be weird if you're watching this with people in the room but if you're able to watch it when everything is quiet / peaceful then the true immersion sinks in.- All the elements cohere very well together and really draw you into the atmosphere of living in a small town with a strict traditional asian culture and generation gap."", ""I'm almost at a loss for words. This anime, which I'm still in the process of watching, has hit me with such an impact that I had to stop watching and start writing this. Done with a different style than most anime, the art seems to have been trying to be more real, in the sense that it feels like you are just watching a television show rather than an anime. It is not a world where fantastical things happen, but our world, where the main character is thrown into a situation that he does not know how to handle. The presence of the show,...and the foreboding things to come is just astounding as I find myself sitting up straight in my chair just to catch more of a spectrum of what is happening. You will not see any mystical powers, any silver haired girls, or even a quirky character, this show seems like it had something to say about the anime that is out there now and that they were not comfortable in portraying Japan as such a fantastical world and wanted to make it as realistic as possible. Please watch this anime, it is by far, one of the best I've ever watched. and the foreboding things to come is just astounding as I find myself sitting up straight in my chair just to catch more of a spectrum of what is happening.

The sound design is among the best in anime, really putting you into each environment and connecting you inside the subjects perspective and subjectivity. Going further into economical presentation the repeated elements, shots...and sounds are not offensively conservative or obtusely reused. You really get the sense that it's building the grammar of the show, with each repeat using itself as a piece of vocabulary instead of existing because they needed a shot to fill that time.Its key failures is in its script. Key character moments come off as an act of whimsy instead of built up towards, and the overall pace of the narrative arc seems to lend itself far more towards an omnibus presentation than an episodic show. You get the sense that with a larger time window, both in a per-episode sense and in an overall runtime, it would have had the time to get you to understand the head of the character enough so that the snaps felt earned. Instead you're left with the impression that you're not given all the information you needed to have.I almost feel that the show felt it could get away with some of its omissions because the culture it was made of comes with an understanding of stresses and perspectives that are just not communicated through the show. Perhaps if I came from the same environment as the creators I would have been able to infer those struggles or emotions and superimposed them onto the story during the viewing, but I just lacked that background or desire to insert those anxieties into the character. I wanted to feel the characters anxieties, but instead felt that they were more capsules than personalities.Overall, it's a very interesting watch. Every presentation decision was clearly thought about lending itself to repeat viewings to really soak in all that they're giving you. However, it doesn't earn the message it presents and betrays some of the more interesting character moments by not properly building towards their decisions, blunting the climaxes. and sounds are not offensively conservative or obtusely reused.

It may not be dangerous, but that is not enough to make living there worthwhile. Suburbia is a world without values, where nothing is allowed to be good and worth devoting to. Some things are considered bad and off-limits – like drugs. Anything else though is ‘just a hobby’. No wonder this safe lifestyle doesn’t stop people from killing themselves – why live such a life, anyway?No wonder, then, that suburbia has its share of ‘rebels’ who take symbols that seem to contradict suburbia. Then again, any person who finds...something valueable is rebelling against suburbia – that’s why both the happy-go-lucky raver and the skull-laden metalhead are considered rebels of this landscape. Even the truly religious and the intellectual can be rebels in this world. Such passionate people will challenge the status quo since they will value something other than the suburban lifestyle.Notice the problem, though. Notice what’s the requirements for a true rebellion against suburbia – having values. Aku no Hana is the pseudo-rebel, the person who hates suburbia so much with all its emptiness yet cannot find anything of value to replace it with. It wrecks destruction, says naughty words and perhaps will pay lip-service to sexuality but in the end it has nothing to say. In the end, it is too weak to admit it’s exactly like the suburbia it hates and this lack of self-awareness is its destruction.The anime fails in the same way the main character, Nakamura, fails. Nakamura hates the boring life she leads. I hate that way of life, too. Yet just because she claims she’s going ‘beyond the hill’, that she will tear down Kasuga’s walls to find something there doesn’t mean she actually will. It doesn’t mean her actions are directed at this venture. Actually, her actions are more like that of a sexual abuser rather than a tough life coachImagine if a man stripped a female of clothing, forced her to wear something and said this will somehow psychologically heal her and make her stronger, bring out the ‘real her’ or something equally fancy. Few of us would take it seriously. The moment the man will use force is the moment we will find him villainous, no matter how many rebellious slogans come out of his mouth. So why is it okay when a female does it?It’s an anime so engrossed in being different, so immersed in wanting to be unique that it doesn’t even try. It goes beyond the art style, which is ugly but not too hard to get used to. The backgrounds are fantastic. They go beyond the emptiness of suburbia, giving everything a rusty look of falling down and crumbling. We see something else besides boredom, that suburbia equals malaise and its lack of values is actually that depressing. As for the character design, it’s merely failed realism. None of them actually look like real people but more like distorted photographs. For a while it’s amusing, but not too much.At first it starts off interesting with a view into the darkness and weirdness of random people. Quickly, though, it is obvious we’re supposed to side with Nakamura, view her as a tragic person lost in a world of dull people who just cannot realize how special she is. Too bad the creators missed that if anyone actually paid attention to her, they’d realize she should be in jail. No one cares how special you are when you abuse people. Look what happened to Watkins.True horror is realizing that something that’s horrible is also real, and perhaps more common than we think. Don’t be a pig and act like your mud is special. Show the viewers that what they consider deviant is actually normal. Horrify them with that. Instead, we see a small act of stupidity and teenage horniness being shoved in our faces like the creators just discovered the true darkness that lays at humanity’s heart.If only they had enough empathy to realize that the true horror is realizing that all our rebelliousness is worth nothing if we’re cruel, that we’re excellent at swallowing our own Kool-Aid as we hide from how we hurt others. From the middle onwards, the series becomes nothing but a carnival of vomit. We see people being mean to each other, some preaching about the nastiness of suburbia and pushing someone to do things they don’t want because you and your rebellious self know what’s best for them. Hating suburbia is a good thing, but it’s the first step.

Its protagonist is the perfect portrayal of a terrible person and, with a unique visual approach, heightened that feeling even more. The use of rotoscoping for the expressions made everything more eerie and repulsive. The dark and realistic atmosphere can be welcoming at times, such as in the scenes where Katao slowly walks through the city.The story, revolving around extremely sensitive themes like sexual relationships and psychological/sexual harassment, is treated in a raw and distorted manner from reality, yet it further intensifies...the desire to see how the situation will be resolved. The slow narrative manages to keep the viewer focused and immersed in the characters' psychological complexities, accompanied by a soundtrack integrated with classical and ambient music, which contributes to the anime's unique atmosphere.Its complex and disturbing narrative are strong points; however, the way it develops its characters is, at the very least, disappointing.

Didn’t love it, probably never going to use it again. Also, there will be minor spoilers. Anyways, on to the review…Story: Aku no Hana is about teens in puberty trying to navigate sexual desire. Specifically, it\'s about a boy named Kasuga who steals his crush\'s gym clothes in a fit of lust and immediately regrets it, and the main conflict of the story blossoms from there. The story is pretty significantly flawed I think, but it does still manage to be effective. I should mention up front, as others have, that this...show only depicts the first half of its source material, and it was unfortunately never renewed for a second season. I don\'t really consider this a flaw, however, since I partially feel like the story could have ended where the show does and it would be fine; I often like open-ended conclusions that leave the question of ""where do they go from here?"" to the imagination. But I\'m getting ahead of myself.While the dilemma that Kasuga panics his way into is a solid basis for a story, the ridiculousness of many of the actual plot points becomes a bit too much. There\'re a number of events that occur that seem entirely too convenient, such as Nakamura just so happening to catch Kasuga and Saeki\'s interaction at the stairwell; the show is at no loss for low-probability, coincidental encounters that serve to expedite the plot at the cost of believability. A well-placed deus-ex-machina or two are usually fine, but this show just seemed to not want to do the legwork of moving from one important plot point to another in a more organic way. It would\'ve been possible to write the story in a way where Saeki figures out the nature of Kasuga and Nakamura\'s relationship without her stumbling upon the two of them as if summoned.I also felt the idea that Nakamura had no friends was unrealistic considering her personality. She\'s basically unapproachable, sure, but she\'s also pretty fearless; there would absolutely be other kids at the school at least, if not in her class, who would have respected her. I didn\'t like how the class was frequently portrayed as a hive-mind; the entire classroom\'s attention was focused on Kasuga/Nakamura too many times. This felt way too exaggerated, as did Kasuga\'s incessant stammering and sweating. Sure, it may have felt to Kasuga that no one understands him and everyone is watching him, but the fact that the show\'s reality reflects this so dramatically feels more than a little dishonest. The show is very guilty of making secondary and background characters behave in ways that are just too one-dimensional, which ends up diminishing the tension and immersion. I guess what I’m getting at is I’d have liked to see the class as a whole be fleshed out more, which is something many an anime has done well.But I think I\'ve criticized the plot long enough; it does succeed in a few significant ways. This might sound like a backhanded compliment after all I just said, but the show uses silence very effectively. The scene where Kasuga\'s mother weeps at the table after a completely dissociated Kasuga goes upstairs to his room felt so heavy and real, and the main reason why is because of the amount of time the camera lingers on her and Kasuga\'s father with the TV comedy droning on in the background, as if to mock what just happened. And of course that iconic long walk home... talk about using silence to say a lot. Also, the usage of lines from Les Fleurs du Mal was good; clearly Kasuga at least partially understood what Baudellaire was talking about, even though he was mainly into it just to posture as a more interesting person, which in itself is a good plot point.Overall, I would say this story was genuinely intriguing, but I found myself wanting to imagine a better version of it the more it went on.Characters: The three main characters sort of end up creating a strange version of the archetypal love triangle. Out of the three, I feel like Saeki is the one who gets the short straw when it comes to characterization. It\'s already a bit of a leap to convincingly make her the brilliant, top-of-the-class student who agrees to date the guy who stole her gym clothes. Even harder to make it make sense that she would go so far as to blame herself, which she ends up doing. The only way this makes any sense is if Saeki is just exceedingly patient, compassionate, and insecure. I don\'t think we see her in enough context outside of Kasuga to really sell this point, so it ends up feeling like her characterization bends to the service of Kasuga’s. We do learn that she has a very regimented home life, and she is very sheltered, so her curiosity and naivety make some amount of sense, but her total self-blaming when Kasuga is clearly the problem is as puzzling to the viewer as it is to Kasuga himself.Kasuga is developed well enough. He\'d better be, considering almost the whole show is from his internal point-of-view. He\'s a walking oxymoron that is not too hard to understand, although for some he might be hard to sympathize with. Something primal, seemingly beyond his conscious control possesses him to finger his way into Saeki\'s bag, and he probably wouldn\'t have taken her uniform if he hadn\'t panicked over being potentially seen. He\'s a very ethically-conscious kid, so he ends up being consumed by guilt at having done the thing, where other boys wouldn\'t necessarily feel so bad. But the way he fetishizes Saeki as his muse is beyond a mere crush, and he’s not mature enough to know what that means. He can\'t commit to total debauchery for Nakamura\'s sake, but he\'s incapable of living up to his own ideals for his own sake, and he\'s so paranoid that he can\'t perceive a compromise. He does grow quite a bit from struggling with this inner conflict; having the self-awareness to realize you\'re only into esoteric literature because you want to appear special is rare at the age of 14-ish. I feel like that age is typically when kids just start getting into weird stuff to appear edgy, not when they start to grow out of it. In that sense, he actually is at least beginning to be the wizened person he had been so convinced that he was at the show\'s opening.That being said, his flight responses and constant stuttering often felt melodramatic, and they become tiresome after a while. I\'d have appreciated seeing him learn to handle himself and at least be able to feign confidence a bit better as the story progressed. He\'s an uninteresting character who slowly learns just how uninteresting he is, but because we get to see his progression, his first real choice to assert himself and be something feels genuine when it finally happens. He wants to be something in Nakamura\'s eyes, not just for his own sake but for her\'s too, because they both know what it is to be truly isolated and alone. I don\'t think he\'ll go down as very many people\'s favorite character, but I do think he\'s a well fleshed-out one.Nakamura, on the other hand, just might be people\'s favorite. Or they\'ll hate her, she\'s very polarizing. Again, I repeat, the notion that no one would befriend her after watching her have the balls to call her sensei a piece of s*** in front of the whole class is absurd. Clearly the writer never hung out with the punks in school.Nakamura, unlike Kasuga, has embraced the identity of the deviant; she derives glee from watching people squirm and fume, she is the very embodiment of a misanthrope. But, of course, even she desperately does not want to be alone, and since she’s a child, it’s obvious that there’s something else eating at her that she doesn’t have a handle on, but we don’t really get to see what that thing is. Near the show\'s conclusion you can tell the focus was starting to shift in her direction, mainly because up until that point everything had been from Kasuga\'s perspective and he was only just starting to consider Nakamura as an individual and not just as a threat to his own social survival. There are some exchanges between Kasuga and Nakamura that feel so contrived that you could start to write Nakamura off as just a dominatrix fantasy whose actions are dictated by what gets off a male with a submission fetish. But it goes beyond this. She so desperately wants to be inspired by someone willing to burn every convention to the ground. She herself wants to do this, but she can\'t make herself do it alone; she needs the confirmation that someone else out there feels like she does, and her rage is immense when Kasuga reveals himself to be too cowardly, from her perspective, to embrace the taboo and come with her to the place where prudishness, rules, and even basic regard for the feelings of others does not exist. Nakamura\'s boldness (and sometimes just straight-up cruelty) is what makes the push-pull between her and Kasuga so strong, as the story becomes about whether Nakamura will break down Kasuga\'s walls or if Kasuga will break down her\'s. She creates most of the energy that makes the plot go, and she’s the reason why I’m compelled to read the manga, even though the manga lacks the number-one thing that makes me like this anime…Art: Now HERE\'S where this show really shines. The rotoscopic animation seems to have polarized the MAL community, but I for one absolutely LOVED it. I found the character models in this show to be FAR and away more expressive than the vast majority of other anime out there. You can detect the subtle facial expressions of the real-live actors even after they\'ve been animated over. The characters feel so real compared to other anime, yet it still feels like an anime. And the scenery is so good. The rusty, overgrown town is depicted absolutely beautifully throughout. While some anime clearly recycle frames for budgetary reasons, I actually loved the repetition in Aku no Hana; not only did it serve to intensify Kasuga\'s feelings towards the town (mundane, predictable), but I also just straight-up did not get tired of looking at them over and over because of how expressive they are. The bent street-crossing sign, the faded weight-loss ad plastered to a dumpster... this show trounces most anime when it comes to imagery. And of course all the luscious vegetation bursting out around the town was very much appreciated, although I\'m admittedly heavily biased towards natural imagery.I also just wanted to say I love how flawed the characters look. It\'s so refreshing to see an anime -- especially one that is specifically about sexual perversion -- not contain big-eyed, over-sexualized character designs. One of the best advantages of using rotoscope was capturing the uneven, unpolished nature of what people really look like. Even Saeki, who is meant to be the model girl both in terms of behavior and appearance, doesn\'t look ""flawless"" like your typical 2-D ""waifus"" usually do.Sound: The OST is pretty great overall, although maybe a bit too repetitive. Whereas the visual repetitiveness felt intentional and impactful, the background music would repeat itself in contrasting scenes where I felt a change in tone would have been better. But this is a small complaint, because overall it\'s definitely above average. The ambient, somber piano chords were just what most of the scenes needed, and it worked. The show has 4 different OPs, all in a catchy punk style, reflecting the angst that these pubescent main characters display. I liked 3 out of 4 of them, but this is purely personal preference. It\'s very cool that such a short series got 4 songs that change to fit the progression of the plot.The ED gets its own paragraph. I ADORE the ED of this show. I love the steady, slow pulsing beat, I love how foreboding its melody is, I love the rhythm the spoken words are said at over the beat, I love how the filter on the voices sounds, and I absolutely FANBOY over how each time it comes in before the episode ends, almost as if whatever dramatic cliffhanger that just happened triggered the song to play.Enjoyment: This category is awkward. I don\'t even like that MAL separates Enjoyment from Overall as a concept, but I digress. I can\'t really say the experience of watching this show is enjoyable, it makes you feel pretty awful for most of its runtime. But it\'s not without its comedy (some of the comedy being probably unintentional, but that\'s what happens when you make a serious story about panty-stealing). Most of the joy I got out of watching this was in the usage of rotoscope and the show\'s above-average ability to create a distinct mood with just its imagery. Not my favorite story by a longshot, but it genuinely is a beautiful show in its presentation.Overall: 7.8/10. LORD QUAZ HAS SPOKEN. show only depicts the first half of its source material, and it was unfortunately never renewed for a second season. I don\'t really consider this a flaw, however, since I partially feel like the story could have ended where the show does and it would be fine; I often like open-ended conclusions that leave the question of ""where do they go from here?"" to the imagination. But I\'m getting ahead of myself.While the dilemma that Kasuga panics his way into is a solid basis for a story, the ridiculousness of many of the actual plot points becomes a bit too much. There\'re a number of events that occur that seem entirely too convenient, such as Nakamura just so happening to catch Kasuga and Saeki\'s interaction at the stairwell; the show is at no loss for low-probability, coincidental encounters that serve to expedite the plot at the cost of believability. A well-placed deus-ex-machina or two are usually fine, but this show just seemed to not want to do the legwork of moving from one important plot point to another in a more organic way. It would\'ve been possible to write the story in a way where Saeki figures out the nature of Kasuga and Nakamura\'s relationship without her stumbling upon the two of them as if summoned.I also felt the idea that Nakamura had no friends was unrealistic considering her personality. She\'s basically unapproachable, sure, but she\'s also pretty fearless; there would absolutely be other kids at the school at least, if not in her class, who would have respected her. I didn\'t like how the class was frequently portrayed as a hive-mind; the entire classroom\'s attention was focused on Kasuga/Nakamura too many times. This felt way too exaggerated, as did Kasuga\'s incessant stammering and sweating. Sure, it may have felt to Kasuga that no one understands him and everyone is watching him, but the fact that the show\'s reality reflects this so dramatically feels more than a little dishonest. The show is very guilty of making secondary and background characters behave in ways that are just too one-dimensional, which ends up diminishing the tension and immersion. I guess what I’m getting at is I’d have liked to see the class as a whole be fleshed out more, which is something many an anime has done well.But I think I\'ve criticized the plot long enough; it does succeed in a few significant ways. This might sound like a backhanded compliment after all I just said, but the show uses silence very effectively. The scene where Kasuga\'s mother weeps at the table after a completely dissociated Kasuga goes upstairs to his room felt so heavy and real, and the main reason why is because of the amount of time the camera lingers on her and Kasuga\'s father with the TV comedy droning on in the background, as if to mock what just happened. And of course that iconic long walk home... talk about using silence to say a lot. Also, the usage of lines from Les Fleurs du Mal was good; clearly Kasuga at least partially understood what Baudellaire was talking about, even though he was mainly into it just to posture as a more interesting person, which in itself is a good plot point.Overall, I would say this story was genuinely intriguing, but I found myself wanting to imagine a better version of it the more it went on.Characters: The three main characters sort of end up creating a strange version of the archetypal love triangle. Out of the three, I feel like Saeki is the one who gets the short straw when it comes to characterization. It\'s already a bit of a leap to convincingly make her the brilliant, top-of-the-class student who agrees to date the guy who stole her gym clothes. Even harder to make it make sense that she would go so far as to blame herself, which she ends up doing. The only way this makes any sense is if Saeki is just exceedingly patient, compassionate, and insecure. I don\'t think we see her in enough context outside of Kasuga to really sell this point, so it ends up feeling like her characterization bends to the service of Kasuga’s. We do learn that she has a very regimented home life, and she is very sheltered, so her curiosity and naivety make some amount of sense, but her total self-blaming when Kasuga is clearly the problem is as puzzling to the viewer as it is to Kasuga himself.Kasuga is developed well enough. He\'d better be, considering almost the whole show is from his internal point-of-view. He\'s a walking oxymoron that is not too hard to understand, although for some he might be hard to sympathize with. Something primal, seemingly beyond his conscious control possesses him to finger his way into Saeki\'s bag, and he probably wouldn\'t have taken her uniform if he hadn\'t panicked over being potentially seen. He\'s a very ethically-conscious kid, so he ends up being consumed by guilt at having done the thing, where other boys wouldn\'t necessarily feel so bad. But the way he fetishizes Saeki as his muse is beyond a mere crush, and he’s not mature enough to know what that means. He can\'t commit to total debauchery for Nakamura\'s sake, but he\'s incapable of living up to his own ideals for his own sake, and he\'s so paranoid that he can\'t perceive a compromise. He does grow quite a bit from struggling with this inner conflict; having the self-awareness to realize you\'re only into esoteric literature because you want to appear special is rare at the age of 14-ish. I feel like that age is typically when kids just start getting into weird stuff to appear edgy, not when they start to grow out of it. In that sense, he actually is at least beginning to be the wizened person he had been so convinced that he was at the show\'s opening.That being said, his flight responses and constant stuttering often felt melodramatic, and they become tiresome after a while. I\'d have appreciated seeing him learn to handle himself and at least be able to feign confidence a bit better as the story progressed. He\'s an uninteresting character who slowly learns just how uninteresting he is, but because we get to see his progression, his first real choice to assert himself and be something feels genuine when it finally happens. He wants to be something in Nakamura\'s eyes, not just for his own sake but for her\'s too, because they both know what it is to be truly isolated and alone. I don\'t think he\'ll go down as very many people\'s favorite character, but I do think he\'s a well fleshed-out one.Nakamura, on the other hand, just might be people\'s favorite. Or they\'ll hate her, she\'s very polarizing. Again, I repeat, the notion that no one would befriend her after watching her have the balls to call her sensei a piece of s*** in front of the whole class is absurd. Clearly the writer never hung out with the punks in school.Nakamura, unlike Kasuga, has embraced the identity of the deviant; she derives glee from watching people squirm and fume, she is the very embodiment of a misanthrope. But, of course, even she desperately does not want to be alone, and since she’s a child, it’s obvious that there’s something else eating at her that she doesn’t have a handle on, but we don’t really get to see what that thing is. Near the show\'s conclusion you can tell the focus was starting to shift in her direction, mainly because up until that point everything had been from Kasuga\'s perspective and he was only just starting to consider Nakamura as an individual and not just as a threat to his own social survival. There are some exchanges between Kasuga and Nakamura that feel so contrived that you could start to write Nakamura off as just a dominatrix fantasy whose actions are dictated by what gets off a male with a submission fetish. But it goes beyond this. She so desperately wants to be inspired by someone willing to burn every convention to the ground. She herself wants to do this, but she can\'t make herself do it alone; she needs the confirmation that someone else out there feels like she does, and her rage is immense when Kasuga reveals himself to be too cowardly, from her perspective, to embrace the taboo and come with her to the place where prudishness, rules, and even basic regard for the feelings of others does not exist. Nakamura\'s boldness (and sometimes just straight-up cruelty) is what makes the push-pull between her and Kasuga so strong, as the story becomes about whether Nakamura will break down Kasuga\'s walls or if Kasuga will break down her\'s. She creates most of the energy that makes the plot go, and she’s the reason why I’m compelled to read the manga, even though the manga lacks the number-one thing that makes me like this anime…Art: Now HERE\'S where this show really shines. The rotoscopic animation seems to have polarized the MAL community, but I for one absolutely LOVED it. I found the character models in this show to be FAR and away more expressive than the vast majority of other anime out there. You can detect the subtle facial expressions of the real-live actors even after they\'ve been animated over. The characters feel so real compared to other anime, yet it still feels like an anime.

LORD QUAZ HAS SPOKEN.', 'From episode 1, to the first half of episode 10, it\'s absolutely fantastic. Tense, messed up and subtly disturbing thanks to its purposefully jagged artstyle and eerie sound design. It must also be said that it just might be one of the most well paced and well directed slowburn thrillers out there.Too bad then that, towards the end, it starts to fall apart dead on its face. The previously effective artstyle is now made innefective by the bigger focus on sadness over minute horror; The phenomenal characterwork, that took perfect advantage of puberty and how it\'d affect one\'s self, becomes an aimless mess; And with...the fantastic narrative, the same thing. They wanted us to believe a certain character would change and act a certain way but the seeds needed for that flower to grow were poorly cared for. No, it didn\'t feel natural, worse, it felt out of place--and somewhat misguided. That, of course, without mentioning the obvious need for a second season that will never come due to NPCs being unaccepting of anything remotely different. (Like, ffs, there IS the problem of when the characters stop moving the image turning static all of a sudden but every other element is obviously done that way on purpose. Come on).Still, it\'s atmospheric as all hell, the directing and cinematography is great and the ""Night Class"" scene is some ten out of ten shiz. A failure, it most certainly is not. It\'s just a VERY flawed product that deserved far better than what it originally got.A little aside here but, the detail of each opening being sung by one of the three main characters is effin\' amazing. the fantastic narrative, the same thing.

I know that the anime’s art style is very different from the manga but the anime’s art style actually suits the environment of the story better than the manga. Every single movement by the characters are so natural and nonchalant and even background characters are shown to be doing something instead of standing still or just walking back and forth. I think fear stems from the feeling we feel when we realize something is happening that shouldn’t be happening. The characters faces are extremely similar to real Japanese faces...that it’s creepy because you know that this is just an anime and anime people must have huge eyes and pencil like body structure. And I’m sure that was intended.The BGM is used mostly for conveying the character’s state of mind and it does that quite well. The environment is designed to represent a cage or a small space. You can feel Kasuga trying to escape this cage. You can sense the oldness that hangs in the environment. You feel as though you’ve been living there you whole life. You can relate to how the people born in that town express nostalgia for that town even though you’ve never lived there. This is mostly due to the scenic shots in anime that don’t glorify the scene it portrays and just shows the old building and walls and neighbourhoods as something normal... something lived in. The sky is almost always cloudy and gloomy further enforcing this idea that Kasuga is like a rat put in a dark maze with a very low ceiling. He does nothing but run into the maze, randomly choosing paths hoping that he will escape.CharactersKasuga is someone we’ve all seen and maybe interacted with in life. You know that one guy who always trash talks about book adaptations? Says that the novel was better, and thinks that reading books makes him a superior human being. Kasuga is that guy. He wants everyone to know that he reads books and therefore is someone who deserves attention. He in fact believes that if Saeki knows that he reads books she will fall for him. He also unironically shouts to his classmate “Shut up, you don’t know anything. You can’t even understand a line of the kind of literature that I consume”. He even goes into monologues in his mind reciting the lines of the book The Flowers of Evil. He is so narcissistic. He is so obsessed with The Flowers of Evil that he believes the book portrays his mind and his way of being. He even has a picture of the author in his room. If an anime fan turned pathetic is a weeaboo a bibliophile turned pathetic would be this guy. But this unkind and brutally honest portrayal of him helps us keep our objectivity and not feel anything for him when something happens. You just see characters acting out of various emotions and don’t sympathize with them.The anime will be very relateable to those who have done something in school that you hope no one finds out. You know that feeling when something you’ve done in school is being talked about but no one knows that it was you who did it. That rush of adrenaline you feel. Your heart beats so much that you feel as though it touches your rib cage each time it beats. That feeling – that fight or flight feeling – has been conveyed very accurately.Themes And Character MotivesThe entire anime can be said to portray the relationship between Kasuga and Nakamura. Both of these characters have motives that stem from the same feeling. They both think that the town that they live in is dull and boring and have an innate feeling that they we’re born to do something great and therefore don’t belong in this town. Kasuga feels as though since he has been reading books that are considered to be from a very high level of literature he is superior and the people of the town are therefore dull compared to him. He feels caged by the mountains around the town, and feels as though he can achieve his ‘superior destiny’ if he crosses the hill and gets out of the town into the ‘interesting’ outer world where people will recognize and appreciate his true value.Nakamura on the other hand doesn’t consider herself as superior or different from the other people of the town. In fact she believes she is just the same as those around her but she just doesn’t act like others. She believes everyone is a hentai (deviant) at heart but just act so that they can fit in with society. This is why she develops an interest in Kasuga when she sees him stealing Saeki’s gym clothes. She thinks she has now witnessed a true hentai and someone who acts out of their true will. She fetishes about Kasuga being an hentai and derives pleasure from the fact that she can make someone do all the things that they actually want to do but don’t want to do because of societal constructs like morality which she believes just prevents people from being their own self and promotes false behaviour. She sees Kasuga as someone who further cements her views of the world and therefore pushes him further to be an hentai. Because in Nakamura’s mind Kasuga being more of an hentai means her worldview is more justified. So Nakamura can be seen as someone having an ideological crisis who grasps and propagates anything that reinforces their view on life and society.This relationship is so intense and affects everyone in their life in some way or another. They are both trying to break free from society so that they can be their true selves even though in the process they both lose their sanity and peace of mind.This anime is the most underrated anime that I have watched. I was constantly reminded of Oyasumi Punpun watching this because both share a central theme – The Loss Of Innocence. Kasuga realizes that he is not someone who he believed he was, that reading books is not something that makes you any different from other ‘dull’ people and all humans are just – in Nakamura’s words – ‘pieces of shit hentais’. that it’s creepy because you know that this is just an anime and anime people must have huge eyes and pencil like body structure.

It\'s something I watch when I feel like it unlike my usual routine of binging episodes till the day ends.The art is good enough, sounds, dialogues, everything is made for this. And it\'s done with justice.I don\'t quite understand the feelings. But it\'s there, like needles prickling my heart. Ep 1-6 is torture. 7-8 is when it stopped draining me. And 9-12 is like any other anime, the familiar average feeling. The final episode is the one that made me feel relief. After all those, the ending...is just right.I\'ve done embarrassing things that others don\'t mind but it really fucked me up. So I relate to him... but I\'m glad I didn\'t found another one like me in real life, or else I\'d be taking a different path. It would only take 1 person to pursuade me to embrace whatever darkness I may have. That\'s what happened to him.At first I hated Nakamura, I hated that it had to be someone like her who saw his deviance. Because I know it would be no good. As a negative person who\'s surrounded with positives, I am lucky to have this conscience of ""doing good"" and literal living reminders that pulls me back whenever I gone too deep. That\'s what he lacked.It\'s well done and the soundtracks fits the anime perfectly. I kept getting jumpscared when it\'s near the end so that\'s another point for taking me off guard internally. The opening changed 3 times. I see that as: lies, truth, acceptance. Very basic but if you\'re in the spotlight, it drains you the hell out.I don\'t know how many months did I take to finish this. I\'m painfully emphatic and it cuts through. But I binged through eps 6-13 now it just feels so heavy. Something similar to the snacks you hid only to see it empty later on.Like a pent up grudge.............In the back of my mind the whole time as I was watching: ""I shouldn\'t let my friend know about this... but I wanna see how this will affect someone who hasn\'t been in-depth with ""darkness"""" I... wanna let someone know but that someone might break.That\'s basically what Saeki meant to him.Some might say this is a ""bad"" thing- relating to Kasuga, that is. But. I dunno. It\'s nothing to glorify about.At least when it strikes me to be sincere, I can just make them watch this. Do take it as a compliment for the anime.It made me feel something though it\'s nothing new. It\'s like looking at the mirror. But it is something special as I never experienced this before- something I\'m sure about. Like I said, a mirror. A stained one. But it\'s still a mirror.An anime like a mirror? yes. is just right.I\'ve done embarrassing things that others don\'t mind but it really fucked me up.

But it\'s still a mirror.An anime like a mirror? yes.', ""(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)i gave it a 5 because i don't think its a bad show, i just didn't enjoy it because i didn't understand it. quite a lot of people have highly praised this show for being dark and for having some sort of deep meaning so but i've also seen others complain that it wasn't that great. so i can't tell if it IS a good show or if its shit.but from my limited understanding, nothing much really happened. nakamura caught kasuga stealing his crush's gym clothes and it was just a weird clusterfuck from there. but i have so many questions! why...did saeki keep pursuing kasuga despite them hardly knowing each other or even spending much time together?? she can't have liked him THAT much. and why towards the end was kasuga seeking nakamura's validation?my interpretation of the characters (specifically nakamura) is that they all feel alienated in some way and due to their desperation, they either became weirdly obsessive with someone or their insecurity peaked. if this was supposed to be the dark meaning that everyone is praising, that, and kasuga's anxiety leading him to act out, then kudos i guess? not as dark as i thought but again, my interpretation could be extremely wrong.i would recommend this show just in case somebody else could actually grasp what is going on in this show and fully enjoy it but i doubt its getting a season 2 and the ending was sort of a cliffhanger. idk if the manga continues the story but the manga is usually always better anyway so i would recommend the manga rather than the anime. did saeki keep pursuing kasuga despite them hardly knowing each other or even spending much time together?? she can't have liked him THAT much. and why towards the end was kasuga seeking nakamura's validation?my interpretation of the characters (specifically nakamura) is that they all feel alienated in some way and due to their desperation, they either became weirdly obsessive with someone or their insecurity peaked. if this was supposed to be the dark meaning that everyone is praising, that, and kasuga's anxiety leading him to act out, then kudos i guess? not as dark as i thought but again, my interpretation could be extremely wrong.i would recommend this show just in case somebody else could actually grasp what is going on in this show and fully enjoy it but i doubt its getting a season 2 and the ending was sort of a cliffhanger. idk if the manga continues the story but the manga is usually always better anyway so i would recommend the manga rather than the anime."", ""This series is a very strange one.

But I thought this series took a chance and it didn't pay off. I'll honestly say it was unique but the animation wasn't worth it because...it does put off more people than it gets.Music: I'll say that I loved the changing opening songs, the opening songs were always weird yet sounded fun (read the subtitles) and the music played in the very creepy or weird parts were nice. I will say honestly that I didn't really enjoy the ending song, it was weird but I found it a bit too strange.Characters: The characters were actually decently done. I enjoyed how Kasuga and his others were done. The only character that I really didn't like all that well was Nakamura, she didn't sound the way I really imagined during the manga and at some parts during the anime I thought she wasn't was well portrayed as in the.Plot: Absolutely loved this story.

Now, it's one of my favorite Anime, maybe THE favorite with (I hope so) a 2nd saison that'll be soon upcoming ^^ 10/10 !!! "", ""I absolutely love this anime. I first decided to watch it because of its different animation, they used a technique called rotocosping, it's a very time consuming process but can achieve amazing results.It gives the anime a more realistic approach, which I honestly agree, there are no super powers, no isekai, no nothing that is not real, and making it more realistic makes us feel more connected to the characters.Never have I itenditify myself in a piece of media ever than this one. I was hooked from the first episode.The actors( don't forget, this was rotos coped) made an amazing job, the confused protagonist,...the manipulative girl, the sweet girl, all made a perfect acting which will lead to amazing results down the line.Please, please, please give it a shot. the manipulative girl, the sweet girl, all made a perfect acting which will lead to amazing results down the line.Please, please, please give it a shot."", ""This is beyond an ordinary psychological anime I have ever watched. Aside from the animation being rotoscoped and is described ugly for some viewers, it actually tackles lots of sensitive issues such as bullying, manipulation, and so forth. The anime has a slow pace when unfolding the story, unfortunately, as many people would say, it is very painful to watch all throughout each episode but it is because of that reason that I got hooked into watching it, wanting to see how deeper the MC would spiral into madness.Although the animation wasn't that great, it actually fits well with what the story was all...about. And you'd actually think that it is likely to happen in the real world. It truly is an underrated anime that unfortunately doesn't have a 2nd season due to the lack of sales, hopefully, 2nd season would make a comeback in the future to come.So, if you like long walks with depressing music, intense ear-rape yelling, pieces of shits, and a weak ass MC.

Besides from that the story was alright, I originally had it marked as a 9 on my list.. but I really needed to humble it. (It’s a 7/10 now) the story was confusing, and not in a good way towards the end.

It works for the style of story and it gives it a more realistic feel. The story feels realistic in that there is no fairytale ending to this dark tale. At first I was kinda annoyed that Kasuga kept choosing Nakamura over Saeki but in all honesty, it just conveyed more about how fucked up the main cast is. The cast are the shinning part of the anime where all the characters just feel authentic. They...feel static but not in a bad way as it feels more realistic compared to most high school based stories.Kasuga is fairly normal, abeit reserved and more interested in books compared to his peers but falls down a rabbit hole when classmate Nakamura sees him stealing his classmate and crushes gym clothes. Nakamura was the most interesting character out of all of them and while her motives and backstory are shrouded in mystery, she shines as an example of interesting characterisation with show don't tell.The art style suits the show and I will honestly die on this hill.

it.Durring the whole run of the anime i had no ideea what to expect from it and it always kept me on the edge of my seat,wishing to see more and more of what this anime has to offer.What you should expect from it?intriguing writting of the plot,love:both in the erotic sense of it and pure,heart warming love,maybe some annoying parts with the main focus of the story:kasuga and his actions,but most of all a story written in an unique way.Story:9/10The...story revolves around 3 characters:kasuga,nakamura and saeki and how easily the life of a simple man,kasuga,can be turned upside down by one mistake that leads to many more.I\'ll talk way more about the characters and him especially when i get to that category,but until then i want to say that what really kept me watching episode after episode is how the story was driven from one point to another,together with the kind of strange events that surround our main protagonist,kasuga.It all starts with the fact that kasuga has a crush on a girl,saeki,and she forgets her school uniform at school so he wanted to be the good guy and  keep them home until the next day when he would have given her the clothes back,but pressured by the people around him,as well as the girl who saw him,nakamura,he has doubts about giving saeki\'s clothes back to her due to the fear of being judged.Art:7/10This is probably where you will have plenty of problems with the anime,and it\'s probably also what drives you back from watching it.Personally i really tried getting into the strange way the characters are animated and drawn, but at the end of the day i\'d still probably both read the manga and watch the anime since they both have their strong points even though i\'m not a fan of how the studio handled the characters,but i still appreciate something new and different from what i\'m used to.Sound:8/10This is what i meant by advantages of the anime:i really loved the voice acting of each and every one of the characters.Especially since it has his share of dramatic moments,i really loved the passion in the characters voices.What\'s more,there are a few occasion where the story is depicted with no sound,except the background music that shows the moment in a brilliant way.One thing i can\'t touch upon are the op and ed.While the op has some musicality to it and it\'s quite interesting,the first reaction you will have when hearing the ed will be:""WHAT THE ACTUAL F***"".Now that is one thing i don\'t think i\'ll be able to ever understand,but to each their own i guess.Characters:9/10I\'ll start with the 2 less important characters, although they\'re still the mains one,nakamura and saeki in order to try and help you understand and accept a little bit of kasuga and his actions.Nakamura:You can see even from her first interaction-with a teacher-that she doesn\'t care a little by what the people around her think of her.Later on we start to see how nakamura actually puts pressure on an easy target:kasuga on how she sees the world around her as perverts,that everyone deep down has that erotic part in himself which she tries to wake up in kasuga.Saeki:She is pictured by the people around her,especially by kasuga,as a perfect example of a perfect person:smart,beautiful and humble.Slowly she starts to develop feeling for kasuga because while she thinks that she has to put up a facade and and like the girl everyone expects her to be,she sees in kasuga an honest person that is not afraid to show who he is.Kasuga:Probably the most hated character in this anime is kasuga due to the fact that the viewer can\'t understand yet the person he is.Personally,i don\'t think that all the actions that we deem ""stupid"" done by kasuga were necesarelly bad things since everyone in different points of life made some action that they regret and think they\'re ""mistakes"",but beyond all of them they are still events that bring shape to us as persons,including kasuga\'s start of puberty and development stage when he\'s confused with who he actually is.Furthermore,what i started to like more and more as the story went on is that there are many characters out there that start like him:loner type,likes books,is shy,but the path he takes and the traits he finds in himself are something new to anyone like him i\'ve seen so far.Enjoyment:8/10I know that the themes of the anime are quite dark and gloomy,but like i mentioned earlier,this anime destroyed all expectations i had about it and totally made me get invested in these strange turns and the development of the characters that i really enjoyed getting to know them more and more.Overall:8/10If you have an interest in complex characters,that really make you question the actions and true motives of the characters,this story will surely not disappoint you in any way.P.S.:if you enjoyed the anime i really recommend you go and read the manga since it gives you an actual ending that won\'t disappoint you. story

the fact that they constantly show spoiled scenarios.  It's a crooked pole, a broken sign, a dirty street, old signs and not-so-fertile plantations.It seems like every anime is always sponsored by the Japanese Ministry of Tourism, but that's not the case here.  The scenes always show the same scenarios, from the exact same angle, which shows the viewer that there is an imaginary prison there.  Of course, everything is still within what the work proposes and what we want to see.I personally found the first part of...the anime better than the second, as it had more unique issues from the anime itself, such as a greater surprise factor.  In episode 2 for example, there is a scene where the protagonist receives a note, while Sawa appears distracted in the background.  Suspenseful music plays in the background, Takao looks back and Nakamura is staring at him, and not just staring at the protagonist, but also at the viewer. the anime better than the second, as it had more unique issues from the anime itself, such as a greater surprise factor.

Watching it felt refreshing. A breath of fresh air in the smothering space of generic booby loli over the top superhero from another world painted on the shield of a public justice warrior overpowered detective harem nerd. Aku no Hana (Flowers of Evil) wasn\'t perfect, but it felt real and I loved every second of it.Lets get into it and start with the most hot topic in the room right away. (Spoilers ahead)Animation... was actually not as bad as first...few episodes might make you think? Don\'t get me wrong, character animation was bad. It wasn\'t smooth, it was out of place compared to the beautiful background and let\'s not even talk about their mouths.Hear me out here though. How many anime have you watched where characters in them are in Japan and actually look Japanese? How many anime have you watched where their physique resembled how we actually look? To me it was a beautiful refresher from what I\'m used to watching and I really appreciate them doing it that way and I believe it made the show better overall.Background art and feel was great with moody rusty forgotten town behind the hills. It connects really well into the story being told.That being said, the story was in fact really simple portrait of youngsters growing up and feeling like they don\'t belong. Nakamura Sawa being a divorcee child, growing without her mother and with a father that doesn\'t really understand her and Takao Kasuga, a silent scared boy that lives what he reads. Both of them being detached from the life of a ""normie"".That is the surface of it, yet it goes much deeper with the questions it raises and the answers watchers must find for themselves.I won\'t go into all the details of what happened as everyone can interpret in their own way, so I\'ll sum it up in few questions and leave it that:Have you ever done a simple inappropriate thing and were afraid that someone might find out?Did it every spiral out of control once someone found out?Were you ever bullied or been afraid of being bullied?Have you felt the weight of your ""crime""?Have you done something stupid, because of it?Have you felt unworthy?Have you felt empty?Have you felt out of place?Have you felt alone?Answer those questions to yourself truthfully and if there are a lot of ""yeses"" in there. This might just be the story you would like to check out. Certainly not to make you feel better, because of some feel good ending, but because it might open your eyes and understanding that we human beings are fragile and weak (yes most if not all of us).With that in mind let\'s touch on one particular character alongside Nakamura and Kasuga. Nanako Saeki and why did a pretty girl decide to date an antisocial book worm, why did she fight to stay with him, why was she so disappointed at the end of episode 10?Heck I won\'t tell you, but I\'ll give you a hint. I often hear boys/men asking ""How the hell did that loser get such a pretty girl?"" and I also hear girls/women say, ""Why the hell did she pick up that ugly ass idiot?"" Clearly there is something wrong with their head? Right? Right?Some other stuff to talk shortly about before I finish: Music was great, pace was great, overall feel was great. I understand that this is only part one of actual anime, but honestly I would be fine with it staying just as it is. Sadly I have a strong feeling they might ruin it with additions.So in conclusion... I\'m extremely pleased with this show and most of all I\'m happy that I watched it now, more than 10 years from it\'s release. I believe that going well into my 30s I can appreciate such works way more than I would have back in the day. There is a high possibility that I would just brushed it off as ""another of those trouble with adolescence shows with terrible animation"" and I\'m glad I didn\'t. For now I give it a rating of 8,5/10, but who knows... Maybe with time I\'ll cherish it even more. few episodes might make you think? Don\'t get me wrong, character animation was bad.

If they know how to carry the argument to the end, it will be one of the funniest and best.Don't expect anything epic from this series.This is not designed to save the world or give you an unforgettable action experience.This is made for you to have fun and to make you doubt.I hope this...is enough for you to give an anime that will be underrated and unnoticed a try.Good luck and enjoy this indecisive adventure is enough for you to give an anime that will be underrated and unnoticed a try.Good luck and enjoy this indecisive adventure"", ""Fabiniku is a comedy and parody anime first and foremost. also don't be one of them who treats the isekai label as a derogatory symbol, you d be missing out.Gives strong Konosuba vibes from start to finish, the comedy tone is more about isekai and games tropes rather than character-based and welp it is downright hilarious if you know the context.Cringe comedy is also huge here, the guy is a girl and gets tonnes of attention. there is also an overpowered kirito Clone who acts like an edgelord (Who would have guessed XD). the only character who isn't very strong is probably Jinguji , who...is kinda always playing the straight man.The comedy hits, almost always, it'll make you cringe laugh, or just laugh or at least smirk at the tropes being torn down then and there XD a long-time RPG and isekai fan is sure to love it.Plot (7/10)Well, standard adventure from point A to B or/and defeat demon lord, but the fact that is so self-aware and is able to reinvent its jokes without over-reliance on it is really good, but it isn't a plot based comedy it's mostly a trope killer or sometimes a character-based one, so it is understandable the plot isn't too deep.Characters(9/10)Has real good character development for a comedy anime too! jinguji seems strong but is just a worry-wort, Tachibana has a big inferiority complex yet his goodness is able to outshine it. The comedy is also character-based and it certainly does come pretty close in terms of chemistry to konosuba.Sound and VA (9/10)The jokes hit perfectly due to the really talented cast, Tachibana, jinguji,  Swartz, and especially the elf girl have really good delivery of their lines xD that goes way beyond just good. this is certainly some quality dialogue delivered. The ed is pretty good and my favorite between the two .ART and animation(8/10 )good enough for comedy anime, a lot of fight scenes are done quite competently but are one sided so end quickly. the character art really hits when it comes to comedic timing it certainly is a well-made production by the new OLM team!A great watch! is also not very disrespectful to gay people so don't be worried, give ita shot and it'll cam certainly be as good a laugh as was konosuba is kinda always playing the straight man.The comedy hits, almost always, it'll make you cringe laugh, or just laugh or at least smirk at the tropes being torn down then and there XD a long-time RPG and isekai fan is sure to love it.Plot (7/10)Well, standard adventure from point A to B or/and defeat demon lord, but the fact that is so self-aware and is able to reinvent its jokes without over-reliance on it is really good, but it isn't a plot based comedy it's mostly a trope killer or sometimes a character-based one, so it is understandable the plot isn't too deep.Characters(9/10)Has real good character development for a comedy anime too! jinguji seems strong but is just a worry-wort, Tachibana has a big inferiority complex yet his goodness is able to outshine it.

However, to point this out is to miss out on things that a comedy like this unexpectedly offers the viewer.Created by a married couple made up of wife Yuu...Tsurusaki and husband Chibimaru, this romantic comedy tells us about a man and a man who used to be a man: Both are teleported to a fantasy world thanks to the ""blessing"" of the Goddess of Love ; Jinguuji, a handsome but proud man is given a power buff while his normal friend, Tachibana, is turned into… a young blonde girl. To make matters worse, this half-naked goddess places a curse on them that the two of them will be romantically attracted to until they defeat the Demon King.Fantasy Bishoujo is not the first existing anime where a character is transferred to another world with a change in their sex. - and that has been adapted - As isekai we can talk about cases like Kenja no Deshi wo Nanoru Kenja and Youjo Senki. Everything that makes up this anime is nothing more or less than the familiar tropes and gags of a normal isekai: mmorpg system, magic, experience, superpowers, etc., which, however, goes in a different direction than one normally assumes in this genre. This is also added with a story element that not even the writers themselves took the seriousness of doing since here and there the entire program is made up of a world, let\'s say, strange and chaotic; from the way in which the Gods and Legendary Creatures of this world are portrayed to the attitude of the secondary characters and villagers (Especially those who venerate the Goddess of Love and Beauty).With animation by OLM, this program cannot be visually compared to one like Odd Taxi or Komi-san Can\'t Communicate (Both studio productions), but it maintains the graphic quality per se despite how \'generic\' it may look. Character designs remain similar to those of the manga and although there are some modifications (such as Tilolilo Lilili\'s clothing) in general this adaptation doesn\'t affect the most important elements of Fabiniku. There are some narrative omissions compared to what is presented, but these omissions are nothing more than a few more or not so important scenes for the context they want to present. Writers manage to efficiently “cut” and “paste” the show\'s dialogue and keep the jokes intact without altering everything that is intended to be presented.We have an OP “Akatsuki no Salaryaman” by Yoshiki, a decent pop-rock song that isn\'t bad it\'s not that brilliant due to its low audio quality. However, the video sequence perfectly describes what the program came to do with the viewer. If you found some screaming faces, explosions, Tachibana\'s cute face, and Kirito hanging around funny, then you can already get an idea of what happens in the rest of the show. On the other hand, his ED “FA""NTASY to!” is more of a very catchy J-Pop song whose video introduces us to Tachibana as the protagonist of this sequence, dancing, thinking and questioning herself about her relationship with Jinguuji.As a manga reader something I didn\'t expect from Fantasy Bishoujo is that it was as funny as I could remember! And even less did I expect that this comedy manga would also be entrusted with a decent budget than one expects in these types of adaptations; starting with the casting of well-known actors and others that have been taking shape for years: starting with Mao (Pecorina from Princess Connect! and Iris from Fire Force) and Satoshi (Ainz from Overlord and Saito from Zero no Tsukaima) in the voices of Tachibana and Jinguuji respectively. The chemistry between these two works and makes the jokes come naturally. We can also talk about Junichi Suwabe as Shen who I admit I didn\'t expect him to play the role of this mysterious villager, as well as Rie Kugimya in the voice of the Goddess of Love and Beauty and Eri Kitamura as Lucious, etc. Overall, everyone manages to do a decent and confident job of the character assigned to them.However, not everything is jokes and laughter because the program also at a certain point adds specific flashbacks from the past of the two heroes, presenting a preview of how their friendship has been before so that the viewer has an indication of how deep the friendship is. Is likely that many expected more background to this or feel concern that this could ""kill the character"", but since the intention of the program is to make us laugh, this remains as a secondary element without any problem.But, the most remarkable point is its characters: with the pair of best friends as the center of the plot, they will be accompanied by other secondary characters that the series doesn\'t throw away and discard when it feels like it. As a consequence, much of the potential of each of them is taken advantage of and they complement the chemistry of the program very well; Better yet, it\'s that it\'s not satisfied with appearing in a mini-arc either and it\'s common for them to have a series of cameos or return to prominence at certain points in the program after their first appearance. An example of these is Schwartz, the Kirito archetype, whose dialogues and actions are a clear satire to all the typical protagonists who look ""cold"" and can use swords; or Tilolilo Lilili, an elf proud of her beauty who is jealous of Tachibana...On the other hand, as I said at the beginning, many may have some guesses with a program that sells you the premise of a ""man turned woman"" and it\'s understandable how uncomfortable it can be for a fan who has little adapted to this type of contents. However, Fantasy Bishoujo is a seriously funny series that offers its audience a lot of smiles everywhere and a 180-degree turn to what we normally understand of a conventional isekai, similar to what another comedy like Konosuba does.If you liked the show, I recommend you continue on the manga.

First of all, with a synopsis like this, i really don\'t know why people didn\'t hype this one, over the other isekais of the season.If you look at distance, it seems like a generic power fantasy parody isekai ""with a twist"". But honestly, it felt quite unique for me, as the most important thing here is the relationship between Tachibana and Jinguji. And, for my surprise, it is an Isekai that actually makes the ""past life"", or ""life before being isekai\'d"" important.If Jinguji was a solo protagonist for an isekai, he would probably be...as boring as the ""Cautious Hero"". And if it was Tachibana, she would probably be the side annoying character. The anime works because their chemestry is amazing. The side characters are okay-ish, with exception of ""Discount Kirito"", AKA Schwartz von Liechtenstein Lohengramm, AKA best character of the show.Now for drawbacks. It touches the ""queer"" topic in a somewhat irresponsible/ignorant way. I mean, it is the case for almost all anime that tackle trans/gays related topics, but i find it weird how the show seems to make you think it is more ""unacceptable"" for them to be a couple because they are both guys, than because Tachibana\'s body is of a child/teenager. In other words, it is okay for 30 year olds to have a relationship with a loli, but it is not okay for two men have a deep (i didn\'t even say romantic) relationship.What i like, tho, is how Tachibana develops to accept he is now a woman. And how, sometimes, the show is aware of its own prejudice, as there will be a whole arc touching on how it is normal for guys to feel jealous, or compliment each other, AS IT WORKS IN REAL LIFE.Another drawback for me was how the show sometimes forget it is a comedy, and focus too much on a plot that isn\'t the main focus.Overall, best isekai/fantasy show of the season, definetly a surprise for me.

The MC gets summoned to another world by a goddess and they must defeat the demon lord in order to return to normalcy. The motivator here is that the MC has turned into a loli and to compensate, (s)he gets some op power and weapon.Ok, that's enough of that; while the MC's main power certainly is interesting and so is the whole premise of her companion, the whole 'problem solving using that unique particular quirk of this isekai' happens in every isekai. There...is an attempt at some sort of mystery element, but so far it feels more like plot convenience than something intriguing. Also, if you're looking for romance... just don't.Art: The art in this manga is consistently pleasant to the eyeballs. It has a unique sort of flavor that works perfectly with the premise; sort of bittersweet. When the mangaka draws those cute panels, in the back of your mind you can't help but realize that that's actually some random Japanese businessman in his 30s. However, it's still cute. This mangaka is also particularly good at drawing reaction faces for when something especially ridiculous happens. I find myself staring at (admiring) those panels for longer than pages at times. Also, if you're a fan of chibi panels then this is the anime for you.Main Character(s): The two main characters have nice chemistry together (although that is to be expected of a romance story). What I particularly enjoy is that both can be useful or cause trouble in their own way. Neither is actually truly overpowered due to their own flaws and each actually recognizes (or are beginning to recognize) the other's flaws. This works perfectly because due to this forced romantic environment, they are put in situations where they have to develop together, learn more about each other, and work as a team in order to reach an ultimate goal. That said, so far the characters haven't really changed much. What has changed is that one of them is a loli with an op charm ability and that is what takes priority in this story. So, while these characters have a lot of potential within them, so far they are simply enjoyable, comedic characters. However, with how the story is going so far, there is plenty of hope for much more development.Regarding design, while they do seem like mish-mashes of other characters, the designs still feel unique and are a perfect fit for the characters. good art also helps.Overall: (Currently) The focus of this particular anime is comedy and to put it simply, it accomplishes its job. So if you are looking for a comedic 'romance' isekai where the humor comes from how ridiculous the situations are, then this is for ya is an attempt at some sort of mystery element, but so far it feels more like plot convenience than something intriguing.

And that is that I\'ve experienced this before, but way better. Of course, I\'m talking about Tsukimichi: Moonlit Fantasy.This Winter season on Tuesdays, we are presented with 2 gender-bender Isekai: mangaka Yuu Tsurusaki\'s...Fantasy Bishoujo a.k.a FabiNiku, and novelist Hirotsugu Ryuusen\'s Kenja no Deshi. Obivously with the tipping Scales of Justice, there will be one good and one bad show, and this is the good one that can be easily recommended. The reason for mine however, is that Tsukimichi (aside from KonoSuba) tops Isekai parody comedy in the finest of ways that set a bar too high to ever see other series work the way they did. But, of course, there\'s merits and flaws to be seen in every work, and let\'s see what makes Fantasy Bishoujo a lil\' different.This is the case of the classic ""I\'m popular, you\'re not popular"" sorta childish argument that existed during the youth of our days, and both MCs Tsukasa Jinguuji and Hinata Tachibana stem their relationship in this way. Both guys are childhood friends, and while Jinguuji has always been the popular boy growing up, being fawned by classmates, girls/women and co-workers alike due to his good looks, he has a quirk: he never shows any interest in the opposite sex. As you would expect, Tachibana\'s the total polar opposite of Jinguuji, all he ever wanted in life was to get a girlfriend. And boom, therein sets the plot that this Goddess of Love and Beauty ""heard"" his wish, decimates both Jinguuji and Tachibana while in their drunk capacity to reincarnate them into another world. And if you think the problem is settled there, oh no. This blatant mischief of a Goddess, on top of the ""be heroes, defeat Demon Lord/King, save the world and what-have-you"" generic treatment, curses Hinata to gender-swap him into a pretty girl that literally forces Jinguuji to be tempted to Tachibana\'s Unparalleled Beauty until the world is saved, or will the infatuation take over forever. Yeah, literally taking the ""bros before hoes"" phrase into context.From there, it\'s nothing but absolute hilarity as wherever Hinata goes, she (from a he) becomes the fragrance marker of every men in the vicinity, good or bad, all in the viable attempt to be as popular as Jinguuji, and she got all the publicity that she wanted. The problem is, now that Tachibana is in a girl\'s body, she sees Jinguuji as a girl too, and those aren\'t just mere friendship hijinks anymore, but relationship woes as well. And given the power system in the fantasy world, since Jinguuji\'s the popular kid, he is made OP while Tachibana has to start from scratch, and that sets as the journey forward as both male and female wander the distant lands to come across kingdoms and people...with a bit of eccentricities that add to that hilarity.The first they encountered is this weird, boorish, extravagantly ""beautiful"" lady of an elf chieftess, Telolilo Lilili Lu, and their guardian who\'s been killed just for food since it harassed them in the first place. She acts like a Tsundere when praised, and acts the total opposite of being a nuisance when she isn\'t given her ""rightful"" treatment. And honestly, she is kinda of a throwaway character meant to clash with the male and female since it\'s their first time in another world. But the next character is easily the most parody-worth hilariousness, and that\'s the dark swordsman Kirito...er, I mean, Schwartz von Liechtenstein Lohengramm, even with the sword to match and his boisterous claim that he too like Jinguuji and Tachibana was summoned to be a hero worthy to fight the Demon Lord. He is easily the reason why I continue to stick to Fantasy Bishoujo, because he has all the hallmarks of being a joker: a knock-off, discount, German version of the SAO lookalike, one that\'s very heavy on the Chuunibyou that never ceases to make me laugh like mad. Really though, I\'ve never seen a Kirito parody THIS GOOD, and props to Yuu Tsurusaki for inputting this balls-off-the-wall character to add immense,yet enjoyable hilarity. Alas, all the other side characters feel like side cheddar that only added a pinch of salt into the mix, and honestly I could let go of one or two of them.It\'s a surprise that OLM\'s Team Yoshioka is producing this, but take note that it\'s not the same staff team from Odd Taxi, aside from in-house director Sayaka Yamai whom\'s once the episode director, return as director of Fantasy Bishoujo. And I have to say that they did a good job retaining Yuu Tsurusaki\'s quality that\'s a 1-to-1 replication of the manga. And yes, the pacing of the episodes may feel rushed because of the short length of the manga chapters, though I can assure you that this adaptation is very faithful to the source material. A few things changed here and there, but it isn\'t enough to break the enjoyment of the anime.Sadly, I find that the music here is quite on the average side. No offense to renouned music artist Yoshiki Fukuyama of JAM Project who\'s been composing theme songs for the Macross 7 series, but from this OP to the last work he\'s ever worked on, it\'s been a full decade ever since. Though he was once a legendary singer, his best days are probably behind him, but, I\'d like to at least give props for Yoshiki Fukuyama, inching a single after being MIA for so long. Luce Twinkle Wink☆\'s ED on the other hand...it\'s not so good, and sounds quite repetitive. It\'s definitely a noticeable drop from their last ED song for last Winter\'s Tatoeba Last Dungeon (which I really love to bits). Just...really kinda meh for this.When you see a comedy show like this, it\'s easy not to take this seriously, because it\'s meant to poke fun in the most mild of things, and indeed Fantasy Bishoujo has done all that. Is it a watch though...that\'s up for debate, because while the comedy here can become stale somewhat, it switches tactics so that it doesn\'t disguise the viewer to expect what\'s to come. That\'s the literacy of a comedy work, and for all the right reasons, Fantasy Bishoujo is a good show to watch and just have a fun time for the Average Joe. I could\'ve enjoyed this as much as Tsukimichi, but the gags of the latter were more fluent than this, and so, gets a good pass from me. And as I always say, if it looks good to you, why not try it out, you just might have some fun with it. Fantasy Bishoujo a.k.a FabiNiku, and novelist Hirotsugu Ryuusen\'s Kenja no Deshi. Obivously with the tipping Scales of Justice, there will be one good and one bad show, and this is the good one that can be easily recommended. The reason for mine however, is that Tsukimichi (aside from KonoSuba) tops Isekai parody comedy in the finest of ways that set a bar too high to ever see other series work the way they did. But, of course, there\'s merits and flaws to be seen in every work, and let\'s see what makes Fantasy Bishoujo a lil\' different.This is the case of the classic ""I\'m popular, you\'re not popular"" sorta childish argument that existed during the youth of our days, and both MCs Tsukasa Jinguuji and Hinata Tachibana stem their relationship in this way. Both guys are childhood friends, and while Jinguuji has always been the popular boy growing up, being fawned by classmates, girls/women and co-workers alike due to his good looks, he has a quirk: he never shows any interest in the opposite sex. As you would expect, Tachibana\'s the total polar opposite of Jinguuji, all he ever wanted in life was to get a girlfriend. And boom, therein sets the plot that this Goddess of Love and Beauty ""heard"" his wish, decimates both Jinguuji and Tachibana while in their drunk capacity to reincarnate them into another world. And if you think the problem is settled there, oh no. This blatant mischief of a Goddess, on top of the ""be heroes, defeat Demon Lord/King, save the world and what-have-you"" generic treatment, curses Hinata to gender-swap him into a pretty girl that literally forces Jinguuji to be tempted to Tachibana\'s Unparalleled Beauty until the world is saved, or will the infatuation take over forever. Yeah, literally taking the ""bros before hoes"" phrase into context.From there, it\'s nothing but absolute hilarity as wherever Hinata goes, she (from a he) becomes the fragrance marker of every men in the vicinity, good or bad, all in the viable attempt to be as popular as Jinguuji, and she got all the publicity that she wanted. The problem is, now that Tachibana is in a girl\'s body, she sees Jinguuji as a girl too, and those aren\'t just mere friendship hijinks anymore, but relationship woes as well. And given the power system in the fantasy world, since Jinguuji\'s the popular kid, he is made OP while Tachibana has to start from scratch, and that sets as the journey forward as both male and female wander the distant lands to come across kingdoms and people...with a bit of eccentricities that add to that hilarity.The first they encountered is this weird, boorish, extravagantly ""beautiful"" lady of an elf chieftess, Telolilo Lilili Lu, and their guardian who\'s been killed just for food since it harassed them in the first place. She acts like a Tsundere when praised, and acts the total opposite of being a nuisance when she isn\'t given her ""rightful"" treatment. And honestly, she is kinda of a throwaway character meant to clash with the male and female since it\'s their first time in another world. But the next character is easily the most parody-worth hilariousness, and that\'s the dark swordsman Kirito...er, I mean, Schwartz von Liechtenstein Lohengramm, even with the sword to match and his boisterous claim that he too like Jinguuji and Tachibana was summoned to be a hero worthy to fight the Demon Lord.

Boy was I wrong.  This anime has far exceeded  my expectations, and is my current favorite isekai with its lovable characters, world, and comedy that resonated with me very well.The story is pretty simple.  A dude reincarnates into a hot cute waifu.  I love the character design for both Jinguuji and Tachibana!  The teeth on female Tachibana make him cuter.  His previous self looked like a hentai protag which is gold.  I love how they were close bros in...the past.  The backstory of the mcs are very realistic which made me laugh even more especially with Jinguuji`s story.  I am normally not one for yaoi, but the genderbent version makes me love this romance pairing a lot.The animation is pretty solid.  The opening and endings are very cute.  I enjoyed this isekai far more than any other so far.  The romance is the best I ever seen in a isekai.  I believe this anime a must watch for any fan of comedy anime or romance genre.  It lacks the artificial drama I dislike generally, and is very sweet.  You are sure to love the story, humor, and wacky characters too. the past.

You are sure to love the story, humor, and wacky characters too.', 'Fantasy Bishoujo Juniku Ojisan (Fabiniku) made me give the first 10 for an anime, and it sure deserved a higher score and popularity than it has! Being a show that delivers exactly what it proposes, the characters guide the plot in a natural and funny way with engaging interactions without taking themselves too seriously. It\'s perfect for those who like the ""characters carry the show"" style, because everything — and then some! — which you will receive has almost no plot/objective development initially set (in a comically generic way, but still), so be warned!Story: 7/10Fabiniku\'s setting is the most generic thing you can...think of and expect from an Isekai: Random teleport to another world, body swapping, extremely generic and unattractive locations that every low-budget Isekai would surely offer you, and of course, a demon lord. This one who is described throughout the entire anime as the worst enemy, extremely powerful and frightening and doesn\'t even appear in any way, because the way to him is long. So how does this get a 7? Can such a generic plot bring something good or minimally innovative to an Isekai? The answer is yes and no. The story itself is weak (on purpose), but the situations that surround this plot and the characters that carry it make the adventure so fun! You almost feel like participating in this world, just because everything looks so amazing. The idea of \u200b\u200bturning a man into a beautiful girl is not new, but the execution here makes you enjoy it as if it were the first time.Of course, the MCs\' backstories and flashbacks are very well constructed and the show knows well how to manage this development as well as the emotional moments without killing the comedy. The plot flows naturally and consistently, and fulfills its role, bringing fun characters that take the story forward with absurd situations as they advance on their long journey. Not to mention the additional romance, which develops little by little and still doesn\'t take itself completely seriously so as not to get lost in the story.Art: 8/10The art isn\'t overly special or in any flashy and different style, but like most things on this show, it\'s consistent and flows well throughout the episodes. They use the right angles, the right expressions for the right moments and abuse the most simplistic and generic scenarios possible, which contrasts with the flashy design of the characters that make up the place. They all have their own characteristics and expressions, along with the colorful art style makes the comedy look richer, putting a lot of emphasis on the beauty of our MCs. It works well for the anime style, especially in body language. I felt like I could fall under Tachibana\'s charms that way too!The animation by OP and ED is also worth mentioning and lots of kudos. It\'s just hilarious and captures every character\'s personality without you even starting to watch.Some creative choices like censoring the more daring clothes from the manga, replacing them with a friendly version made me really curious, but it\'s not like it\'s something important to the plot at these times.Sound: 10/10The sounds are magnificent. The VAs really put effort into their roles and seemed to be having a great time. From the comically exaggerated reactions to the emotional lines, all the characters managed to sound genuine and still sound great! There were great choices of VAs here, fitting their characters well and their polished lines.OP and ED are contagious and got me hooked for weeks! Both bring a similar vibe and rhythm to the songs used in older anime/vocaloid era, which instantly brings a sense of nostalgia. A very smart choice! Well, in addition to fitting very well into the show, it still sticks in our heads with that false nostalgia that\'s fun to navigate. Simply fantastic. OP\'s singer is amazing and both OP and ED are super fun to watch alongside the visuals as well as listen separately. Quite striking and characteristic. It brought an extra touch of identity, without being a forgettable and/or generic seasonal anime OP and ED.Damn, I usually skip EDs and avoid them like hell, so if this is one of those animes that makes me watch it and get a taste of “I want more”, it already deserves a lot more of my attention.About the OST, we had good solid and weather use during the episodes. Nothing to complain about, and some are really good to listen to in isolation. Highlight for the use of the OST in episode 12! Very good and that also contains the identity of the program, without sounding generic or overused.Characters: 10/10It is in this topic that Fabiniku hits even harder! Instead of tailoring the characters to the plot and just putting a set of standard features and jokes, this show makes the characters guide everything that happens, as well as innovate in the distribution of jokes and new things shown on screen. All the characters, even though they don\'t take themselves seriously either, feel so real — I mean, I\'d like to go on an adventure with them. The main development of the MCs, from the first moment of reluctance, to the discovery of motivations and the hints of the past left here and there make you really care about them! Even though you know nothing will happen you feel a pang in your stomach because the show made you care, the show showed how important they are to each other.Not only does it hit the nail on the head in development, it makes them full of personalities. I was surprised to realize that the characters aren\'t pieces of cardboard with just basic features like in half of the Isekais. Even the secondary characters or those who only appear once manage to make you laugh and be present with their diverse personalities. My girlfriend just watched the last two episodes of Fabiniku and was able to sympathize and understand the characters\' personalities, as well as relate to an emotional ending that you normally wouldn\'t get if you hadn\'t seen all the episodes, or at least a good portion of them. They are consistent characters, who can win you over even if you watch just one of the 12 episodes.Enjoyment: 10/10I enjoyed every moment and looked forward to the next episode. I hardly ever catch myself laughing out loud in comedy anime (my favorite genre, by the way!), but this one I didn\'t just laugh once or twice in specific episodes — for me the fun was continuous, with no breaks. Watching two elderly MCs trying to get used to the fact that one of them is an extremely beautiful blonde girl while trying not to fall in love is the last thing I thought I needed, but I am so grateful for existing.It\'s a light comedy that made me laugh, get emotional and have fun with even the smallest characters. Every episode was a highlight, with the exception of episode 9, which left me with the slight impression that they cut out the best parts in order to speed things up, but still had its funny moments. The ending was left open for a sequel and I would love to have one in the future. The characters and the good music are worth the journey! And I confess I\'m curious to know where else they will end up on this journey and what other fun characters they will find. Well, manga time!(Small highlight for the messages of support for the LGBTQ+ community and the fact that it is a married couple behind this story, which made my heart warm. It\'s hard to find these things in anime.)I don\'t know if it\'s accurate to point this out, but if you like anime like KonoSuba (although the comedy isn\'t so over-the-top in Fabiniku) or the romance between the MCs of Kaguya sama: Love is war, I think you should check this one out! It\'s definitely very funny and at the end of it all, a story about friendship.Overall, it\'s a great comedy with a genderbend element and bonus romance. I think you should try it if it resonates with your taste! Honestly, even if it doesn\'t resonate because I watched episode 1 uncompromisingly, not expecting anything from an Isekai (definitely a genre I don\'t really like) and left laughing out loud, curious about the next happenings and in love with the characters. Really try if it catches your interest!

You see some that are complex, you see some that are plain, you see one like Konosuba, and think this is an amazing parody. There are many forms to an Isekai, so it might be hard in a sense for you to get into this. You may think 'Oh, this is just annoy Isekai, blah, blah.' But no. This is an Isekai that works, and works well enough to keep your attention week by week, let me explain.Story and characters: 8For a show in general to be good, you need catching characters that will push the show forward, and not...make it a bore. For an Isekai, this is extra important, as if the MCs are super bland, then it's hard to get into their journeys. This one however, plays with a concept, and just runs with it. It's as if this is a perfect mix of a parody in itself, but also delivering a fun and serious project all together. As there is an end goal with this. As Tachibana and Jinguuji are Isekai'd into a new fantasy world, only to annoying the one who did such, whom turns Tachibana into his drunken wishes to be a girl, but places a curse on them, if they don't beat the main foe, then they'll fall madly in love with one another. It's a race against time sort.But what makes it truly stand out? The whole chemistry and comedic timing between it's cast of characters. Something that if a show nails, then you know you are in for a entertaining watch. I've found myself, giving out a few chuckles here or there when watcing. The jokes don't stop with that either, there are other jokes here or there, that are just plain laughable. Really great stuff. From a good concept with an interesting hook, and a great casting of characters that really work super well together with their antics, and how they go about the story. Great stuff.Art and sound: 7There isn't a lot to say about either of these. The OP is super nice, and the timing of the sound is not only fitting for purpose, but also really goes well with the stella animation and art style, that really goes well with certain scenes, but also flows all together so nicely. Can't say anything wrong about it in fairness. It does it's job, and it does it's job well. With pretty art, fitting reactions, and above all else.

The OP is super nice, and the timing of the sound is not only fitting for purpose, but also really goes well with the stella animation and art style, that really goes well with certain scenes, but also flows all together so nicely. Can't say anything wrong about it in fairness. It does it's job, and it does it's job well. With pretty art, fitting reactions, and above all else. Very pleasing on both the eyes and ears.This is a very fun Isekai that doesn't but does take itself seriously. One to watch of the Winter 22 season for sure."", 'This series is essentially what it says it is at the start. A romantic comedy between an old guy and someone who used to be. Tachibana and Jinguuji are two best friends who aren\'t very honest with each other despite them being decent models in human society. They suddenly get placed in an absurd situation where they get sent to a different world by a troublesome goddess. Tachibana gets turned into a woman and a curse gets placed on them as well. As a result, they are forced to critically look at their friendship and resist trying to fall in love with each other by...trying to defeat the demon lord and break the curse. As they go on they struggle with the dangers of this new world. Maybe they think it\'s a curse, and maybe they are both acting out on natural urges because Tachibana is a ""fantasy knockout"" now, but it\'s clear what they really appreciate are each other\'s personalities and journey of being together since they met. Slowly, they start opening up to each other due to these strange circumstances.This ""boys love"" type series was made and drawn by an actual married couple. That explains the sincerity behind it. It wouldn\'t surprise me at all if this is a sort of autobiographical representation of their own feeling for each other placed into an anime. What surprised me is that this has become my favorite isekai. And honestly, that\'s not saying much about that genre. It doesn\'t take itself seriously at all, and it comes out funny as a result. Still, the comedy in this series is great. Lots of jokes are thrown everywhere, and it\'s easy to miss many of them. Despite it\'s full of generic looking characters, their personalities more than make up for it. Most notably is Schwartz von Liechtenstein Lohengramm: A bland Isekai main character looking man who despite that, is so funny and sincere with himself it more than makes up for the way he looks. From the start, I really enjoyed the opening sequence song and it has stuck with me since.What can be expected here is a lot of teasing and tension in that regard. Jinguuji is ridiculously overpowered, though it isn\'t as easy as it looks. Tachibana seems useless but has a nearly unbeatable ability to charm. In this fantasy world, They run into what you\'d typically see. There\'s a cast of elves, bizarre monsters, a joke of a kingdom, and religious cults among other things.The tension in this series goes over the top. Tachibana and Jinguuji try their best to fight their urges for each other in often comical ways, or try to take advantage of it to have the edge over the other. Maybe the animation isn\'t the best, but it does excel in telling an entertaining story with memorable characters. Satoshi Hino\'s voice makes Jinguuji\'s character several folds better. It\'s an amazing performance. The ending of this series is notable as one of the most honest moments I\'ve ever seen between two people.I was worried about this series halfway thru, but it kept me laughing and on board it\'s rollercoaster of emotions between the two main lead characters.

In many ways this anime reminded me of Konosuba, from the type of enemies (or rather their relation to the main antagonist) they faced to the fact most of the problems originate between characters rather than between protagonists and antagonists. My only issue with the anime is that I wish it explained certain things more in detail, like how many gods are in this world and why a specific one is so popular as a deity. However, this...anime more focuses on comedy than fantasy. The story, characters, and problems blended together so well and I only have fond memories of this season. I hope it gets a sequel. anime more focuses on comedy than fantasy. The story, characters, and problems blended together so well and I only have fond memories of this season. I hope it gets a sequel."", 'I was so upset by how this anime progressed; and to be honest, my main issue was with Tachibana.Initially, Tachibana as a character felt like he had potential, with ideas of having years of experience as a 32 year old adult man dealing with issues that a young, attractive woman might face in a fantasy world. But instead what I got was is a clingy (manageable, can make it work), whiny (not fine), inept (*really* not fine) screaming child who could not stop and think at all throughout this series. No sense of strategy, no sense of responsibility, blamed his problems on Jinguuji, and cried...like he was some kind of innocent victim when his situation was a result of his own choices and didn\'t takes responsibility for the impact his actions have on others. He, quite frankly, never thought about Jinguuji\'s welfare when he gets on with his antics and what is set up as a comedic slice-of-life ended up becoming a ""what is he going to f- up this episode"" show - and not in a good way. I hated how he had no sense of self-preservation and especially no concern over preserving what seemed to be his best and only friend, and seemed to go to great lengths to harm said friend at times (I literally don\'t care if he\'s possessed or whatever, I hate plot devices like that). We did not see him grow throughout this series. Also, the theme of him loving alcohol and complaining when he couldn\'t get some and acting like a total idiot when he did get some *might* be funny with a different character (in a different universe), but came off absolutely repulsive with him IMO. I guess there might be some sort of subtext of him being a dysfunctional alcoholic somewhere, but I was just so appalled by his character that I need to stop thinking about this series to preserve what little sanity I have left. I cannot believe, even as a caricature of a 32 year old man\'s personality, that this is how they decided to write his character.To be fair, they did try to have some sort of last-minute redemption, but by that point I was just so angry that seeing Jinguuji praise Tachibana at that point just pissed me off more. There was something that felt so empty about having *Jinguuji* be the one learning ""life lessons"" on how to be a better person at that point, never mind the catastrophic build up of events to that point (i.e. is this *really* the time to be laughing and learning life lessons?). I\'m sure there were some other moments that other viewers found meaningful in the main characters\' relationship, but none that were notable enough for me to remember.I think some people found some ideas/quotes regarding gender and identity insightful, but I simply did not find any arguments/ideas presented/defended well enough for me to take seriously from this series (not that the presented ideas or out-of-context quotes are *wrong* per say or that I necessarily disagreed, but rather the ideas felt left so weakly defended and used for jokes that it just felt empty).Anyways, as someone into low-stakes comedy and slice-of-life, this anime was (perhaps deceptively) really not for me. like he was some kind of innocent victim when his situation was a result of his own choices and didn\'t takes responsibility for the impact his actions have on others.

The way the studio presents the world, characters, story, and twists, it is predictable, but still hilarious, enjoyable and cute all at the same time.

Jinguuji laughs it off and just wants to see Tachibana home safe while also giving him the bedroom eyes. Then they go home and nothing happens. The end!Yeah right.

A buddy comedy would be more accurate to call it than a romantic comedy. A road trip in another world with a lot of baggage.This is a satirical isekai fantasy and does not try to pretend or delude the audience by pretending to be anything but that. Between mocking romantic tropes one would find in a traditional rom-com to obvious cracks at more popular isekai stories, the...show is full of jokes designed to make the most harden isekai fan laugh. And it does a good job. The characters are where the show shines with its straight-laced lead of Jinguuji and its wacky gender-bent ""heroine"" Tachibana, the two are a classic comedy duo trying desperately to avoid catching feelings for one another until they get their real feelings sorted out. While the show lacks a deep or meaningful plot, it makes up for that by showing the audience a pretty deep look into the complicated relationship between childhood friends. Like I said this is a buddy comedy. If you\'ve been friends for someone for long enough there will be hidden resentments and envy on both sides. This show does a good job consistently hinting and flashing those resentments throughout the season until finally the curtain is pulled back and the two leads are forced to face each other and come to terms with the fact that, like a romantic relationship, even a platonic friendship is complicated. Jealousy, envy, how one is raised, how one grows up, and of course gender dysphoria form a labyrinth for the characters to navigate which at times can be more daunting than any demon lord.There isn\'t much of a plot beyond traveling to the demon lord and the shenanigans that ensue due to Tachibana\'s beauty so I\'m not going to say much beyond that is the shows weakest point. If you want a deep fantasy tale with original ideas and concepts, look elsewhere. If you want to laugh at two 30-something year olds acting like teenagers in another world then this is the show for you.Lastly I want to give a few shout-outs to Schwartz and Lucius who came through in the end. At first you look at them both and think they\'re just one-off jokes. HAHA look at the Kirito character,  laugh at his foolishness. Yes he is foolish but he is far for a one-off joke character. He actually grows and matures more than even many main isekai protagonists you see in other shows. He had a more than significant place in the story and that is in no small part thanks to Lucius who serves as a much needed buffer, teacher, and support for Schwartz which allows him to grow from a painfully obvious joke character to a real character.I want to give a nod to the door to Tachibana\'s apartment. You see something that silly and think okay that\'s cute but whatever. But it actually was used as a real tool than just a cheat skill which deserves praise.This is a satirical isekai comedy but the characters make it so much more. Tachibana gives the audience a look at the complexity of gender identity which is never an easy subject to examine. Jinguuji is a refreshingly intelligent and sturdy no nonsense character that is nice to see in this genre. Schwartz is an example of how even the most obvious of gags can be so much more if effort is put into development them. The elf queen was fun to watch as well. So this is a story that  while disgusted as a rom-com about two dudes trying to avoid falling in love with each other and more about two dudes who are trying to work together to achieve a common goal while preserving and unraveling 20 years of complicated friendship. That to me is worth watching. show is full of jokes designed to make the most harden isekai fan laugh. And it does a good job. The characters are where the show shines with its straight-laced lead of Jinguuji and its wacky gender-bent ""heroine"" Tachibana, the two are a classic comedy duo trying desperately to avoid catching feelings for one another until they get their real feelings sorted out. While the show lacks a deep or meaningful plot, it makes up for that by showing the audience a pretty deep look into the complicated relationship between childhood friends. Like I said this is a buddy comedy. If you\'ve been friends for someone for long enough there will be hidden resentments and envy on both sides.

Especially weird since the show makes an effort to tell they are both adults in their 30's. (which could be a fresh take since it's often very young MC's in anime, but this is never touched upon for anything)Show also pulls out the super tired trope of a sudden superweapon that the kingdom has for some reason, seemingly powerful...enough to be unstoppable (If not for MC's) enough to be unstoppable (If not for MC's)"", 'This show is isekai junk-food comedy. What do I mean by that? Isekai as a genre is so pronounced in anime and manga that coincidentally, comedies that poke fun about them naturally will also pop up. The most notable one that I can think of is Konosuba, and honestly, this show doesn\'t quite match up to Konosuba in terms of premise and comedic timing. The show, I\'ll be honest, was something that passed time, but not particularly that great.Most side characters are actually pretty entertaining to watch, whether that be the elf, Lucius and definitely Schwarz, which is basically a parody of Kirito from SAO....Even the so-called villians in the show add to the comedy and that\'s pretty on par for course for a comedy.However, the main characters are kind of a let down in terms of how the show is set up and also, how seriously they treat their relationship sometimes in contrast to the premise that they\'re dealing with. Genderbending into a beautiful girl as a guy is not particularly a new idea, but the duo that is Tachibana and Jinguuji definitely is. I honestly like their relationship, but a lot of moments get ruined because of the curse that forces them to find each other attractive.First off, Jinguuji and Tachibana had a pretty #nohomo relationship even before Tachibana turned into a girl, so I just find it strange that there had to be a curse for them to fall in love to begin with. This rom-com setup would have worked anyways regardless of the curse anyway. What about if Jinguuji was actually in love with Tachibana to begin with, and then he turned into a girl? Plus, the main problem I have with the curse that it doesn\'t actually function unless comedic moments are required. It\'s like the curse is only active for one party at a time. Most of the time, you have Jinguuji getting flustered over Tachibana, but stop and think for yourself: was that funny? Do you find something like that being repeated over and over again to be that funny? I actually found most of the funny things to be other things of the show.  On the other hand, you have Tachibana seldom getting the same flustered treatment with Junguuji, but it happens at a much, much lower rate despite supposedly having the same curse with each other. That basically seems like a regular rom-com scenario. Was the curse thing really necessary?Of course, the curse does facilitate most plot, character interaction, and story progression, and it would mean that the show would actually have to think about creating new scenarios, but honestly, a lot of the episodes in the show would have worked with a little bit of tweaking, but would have been executed a lot better if not for the curse.And again, the last arc is all about both main characters empathizing with each other, and recognizing their flaws, which kind of ties back to the fact that they probably could have been slowly falling in love with each other anyways without the curse, which only cheapens the relationship. Even Junguuji\'s turmoil about being jealous about a guy friend is ""not normal"" but eventually coming to terms with himself signifies that.The show\'s just a bit lazy about the whole ""curse"" thing, and if it really wanted to go that route, it shouldn\'t have made the relationship between Jinguuji and Tachibana so serious. They show flashbacks, talk about their feelings about each other, and in general, that kind of drives the entire story forward, so I just find it weird that the curse is present in a show that tries to paint their relationship with each other in weirdly detailed and realistic light. Even the so-called villians in the show add to the comedy and that\'s pretty on par for course for a comedy.However, the main characters are kind of a let down in terms of how the show is set up and also, how seriously they treat their relationship sometimes in contrast to the premise that they\'re dealing with.

I was worried at first, as a non-BL fan, that this might make me feel uncomfortable with its BL theme. Fortunately, they handled it well that it didn\'t bother me that much (... still did a bit, tbh). The plot was an after-thought for this season. Instead, they used this season to set up the characters for the 2nd one. And, just looking at that short teaser montage by the end of the last episode shows they did well on that.For me, It\'s not a high-priority level Anime. But definitely worth adding to your chill Anime list. I\'m...looking forward to S2.STORY (5/10):As I mentioned, the plot about having to defeat the Demon Lord has been an after-thought for this season. This mostly focused on the rom-com aspect of the story and setting up the side characters for the next season. And instead of dealing with evil threats, the protags had to deal with their relationship issues and internal personal conflicts. There\'s not really much to talk about yet when it comes to the story other than it\'s mostly been about Tachibana and Jinguji\'s relationship.They did get to fight two minions of the Demon Lord but, it was a very cartoon villain situation ala Team Rocket.CHARACTERS (7/10):On the Protags corner: A childish middle-aged man that got turned into the woman of her dreams and got sent into a fantasy world along with his best friend by an ""exhibitionist"" goddess during a drunken slumber in public. His successful, reliable, responsible, perfect best friend with a secret special affection for him. An Elven princess whose life turned total 180 ever since crossing paths with them. Another Isekai\'d guy with a very complicated unofficial fancy name who\'s embracing his Hero status in the Isekai world, and his dommie master. An... empire spy?... who\'s taken a liking to the very manly Jinguji. An obnoxious spoiled princess, and her spy servant who seems like gonna be dragged into trouble by her highness next season.On the villain corner: The noisy kid, Vizzd, and the dominatrix-looking, Kalm. (Not really much substance. Vizzd was fun though.)There\'s not much to see from these characters this season yet. But I\'m expecting so much for the next season otherwise, this ""set up"" season will be for naught.ART (6/10) and SOUND (6/10):Character designs are good. Every character has its own distinguishable look. The simple movement animations look detailed but, character movements during battles left me wanting. Backgrounds don\'t look enticing as well.VAs are very good. It rarely felt flat to me. OP theme felt really like a classic OP for this kind of Anime back in the day. ED was a fine cutesy Anime pop music. Didn\'t notice any outstanding BGMs and sound effects though.OVERALL:It\'s a fun chill Anime that relies on character-specific gags and their back and forths. I also recommend this to fellow non-BL viewers like me who wants to see where they\'re at in this genre but feel too uncomfortable with straight-up BL Anime.Liked it. Recommend checking this out.

If what you're looking for is a romantic comedy and gender bender then this is one for you! It is binge-worthy, and let me tell you why. Throughout each anime episode, there will always be *fresh* comedy. Every ending of an episode also makes you want to watch the next episode. It's not cliffhangers, but this anime makes you addicted to itself, making you want more of that fresh comedy. The two main protagonists have very unique interactions as well. Are you looking for something similar to the average interactions in the Monogatari series? This is close to it, it...is almost equivalent to it!

Giant Gorg,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3327/Giant_Gorg,"[""I just wanted to draw some attention to Kyoshin Gorg (Giant Gorg). An anime that (at time of making this review) has only been viewed by 205 MAL users. Despite being as good as it is.If you like adventure anime you will love Giant Gorg, It dives straight into the plot from episode 1, it does a very good job of introducing the initial main characters as well as giving you a nice overview of what's going on. It really doesn't waste any time at all with each episode bringing a new turn to the adventure.This anime was made in 1984 however the quality of...the animation was superb for the time, obviously if you're someone who can't handle old styled animation then this isn't for you. However like I said the anīmation was actually very good and flowed perfectly from start to finish. If you hadn't known when it was made going into it you definitely wouldn't have been able to guess how early it was made.Kyoshin Gorg has a fantastic range of characters, it's definitely the most racially diverse selection of characters I've seen in any anime, it even has aliens.Main character Yuu is a refreshing protagonist, he has just lost his father and is going to visit his dads companion Dr. Wave in America to find out about Austral Island (the place his dad had spent his life researching). He has a positive adventurous spirit and cares deeply about his friends (he's voiced by the same Seiyuu as Luffy from One Piece).Dr. Wave is the scientist of the group, he's not much use when it comes to fighting but he has his moments. Dorris is Dr. Waves little sister and the love interest of Yuu (kind of) honestly I found her a little annoying at times and she doesn't do much more than just tag along, but she wasn't a bad character. Argos the dog, he's just a normal dog but he's very clever and helps out in several ways.Captain, by far my favorite character, he's Dr. Waves best friend but he is also a cold mercenary who has most of the action centred around him. His accuracy with tanks and bazookas is incredible and even his hand to hand combat strength is amazing. This is an anime which is set in the real world so the weapons are guns, tanks, knives, attack helicopters etc. (with the exception of the mecha obviously) and Captain looks badass no matter what he uses.There are 2 initial antagonists who I wont go into details with. Lady Lynx, a hot gang leader who is very skilled in combat and has many loyal followers and Rod Balboa, the successor to a humongous corporation with an interest in Austral Island and all the money and weapons in the world at his disposal.Giant Gorg is very enjoyable, in fact the enjoyment you get whilst watching it might even be it's best quality. It's a fun one although it has some really violent scenes and dark moments. It might not be something you watch in one go, it might even be an anime you watch over the course of a few weeks. They just don't make anime like this anymore and I'm sure many of you will find an anime that has no characters with special powers, no half naked girls with ginormous tits and no unrealistic characters refreshing. the animation was superb for the time, obviously if you're someone who can't handle old styled animation then this isn't for you.

Being made in the early eighties, it gives off the kind of charm you\'d expect in a Steven Spielberg sci-fi film from those times - a hair-raisingly perilous journey undertaken in search of something unknown, something wondrous, all the while being chased by nefarious baddies with vested interests. While the setup itself may not sound especially original, what the show really has going for it is its consistent degree of physical realism and attention to detail. Its taut and...sure-handed pacing also lends it the feel of an extended movie rather than a multi-episode anime, imparting it with a certain wide-eyed immersion that you don\'t often come across in the medium these days.After Dr. Tagami, a researcher studying mysterious relics in the Austral Islands, somewhere in the remote South Pacific, dies under suspicious circumstances, his son Yuu travels to New York City to meet with Dr. Wave, a colleague of his father\'s, as per his last wishes as expressed in a letter to Yuu. Almost immediately, they run into hired goons who want to do them all in (Yuu, Dr. Wave, his sister Doris and Argos, their ferocious and trusty Great Dane) and cover it all up as a construction-related accident. These men are hired by GAIL, a seemingly all-powerful megalocorporation which holds most world leaders in its pocket, including the US and the (then-existing) USSR. Its power is such that it is able to secure the cooperation of pretty much all the major world powers in keeping the very existence of the Austral Islands a complete secret from the general public. Fearing for their lives, Dr. Wave contacts a man known only as the ""Captain"" - a former military veteran and mercenary-for-hire - who agrees to bodyguard them and smuggle them into the Austral islands under GAIL\'s nose. GAIL, as it so happens, have interests there that are deemed important enough that its chief executive Rick Balboa entrusts no one except his own grandson, Rod, to take over operations on the islands, to which of course he travels in a supersonic private plane.Now the thing you need to know about this anime is that it kicks off into high gear right from the get-go: the setup I described above takes barely 2 or 3 episodes to get established, and before you even know it you\'re pushed right into the heart of the adventure. And it\'s here that the show absolutely excels: it involves you in the nitty-gritty of the action, engaging you in the team\'s logistical hurdles of getting past a powerful and well-connected cartel, only to head straight into the perilous unknown where they have an even more overwhelming presence. Even in the Austral Islands, where GAIL\'s scale of operations is quite simply staggering, the show manages to pull off a convincing job of creating realistic odds and plausible circumstances for a small group of unlikely adventurers to survive and elude a group of ludicrously well-armed and professionally well-co-ordinated adversaries. It is not simply the case that they are able to do so by a string of favourable coincidences - in fact, there are times where even small mistakes set them back significantly. Rather, they are shown to survive through the use of seasoned tactics, as well as extensive inside knowledge of the island\'s geography to their advantage.Which now brings me to the characters. Some of them might feel pretty ""stock"": the pure-hearted and intrepid young lead, the obligatory female lead of similar age to the male lead, the nerve-wracked scatterbrained scientist constantly complaining about his lot, the sprightly sidekick ever in rivalry with the lead, and of course the level-headed and street-wise veteran without whose sure-handed competence our heroes wouldn\'t stand a snowball\'s chance in hell of surviving. Once again, they distinguish themselves not in their originality but in their consistency and realism: none of them act unrealistically for the circumstances they\'re put into, or veer off-character for sake of plot convenience, and that applies right down to the minor lackeys. That being said, some are fleshed out in noticeably greater detail than others, sometimes having hidden sides to them. The Captain in particular stands out - this captain be no Haddock, rest you assured. A weather-beaten hulk of a man, he is shown to be unflappable and calculating even in a pinch, and cannily wily in his tactics. What really stood out for me was how believable it felt even when he single-handedly took down multiple enemies, including in hand-to-hand combat - he looks and feels like someone who could actually pull off something like that in the real world.The antagonists on the other hand, are surprisingly refreshing in their originality, and the way they play off each other feels believable and engaging. The standout among them is Rod Balboa - especially as voiced by Ikeda Shuuichi, the iconic voice of Char Aznable from the Gundam franchise. I can\'t imagine another voice actor who could have pulled off the role in his place, honestly. Yet another millionaire playboy at first glance - impetuous, hot-tempered and reckless at times - he displays unexpected sides to himself over the course of the show. His brattish exterior belies a keen intelligence - a quick grasp of and adaptability to any situation he\'s put into - which is one of the reasons his grandfather personally entrusted the project to him. He also has his pride as an individual, as opposed to an heir - when Yuu angrily calls him a murderer, he menacingly growls back at him, ""I had nothing to do with your father\'s death - peg me together with those corporate pawn-pushers again and the kid gloves are off, you understand..?"" This pride comes into play later on in the show, when key developments alter the stakes dramatically against his favour. Another notable mention is one Lady Lynx, a mob boss with her own hidden past, and an axe to grind against GAIL.And finally, there\'s Gorg itself - more Giant than Robot, more Godzilla than Gundam. It doesn\'t appear until well into a third of the show, by which time you have all but forgotten about it - which makes for great effect when it finally does make its entrance. In fact, part of me didn\'t even want to remind you of its existence even at this point so I wouldn\'t ruin the experience for you. It\'s a truly awe-inspiring presence, with its imposing size and overwhelming power - something ironically rare to find in a medium littered with giant fighting robots. There\'s more to Gorg than brute strength, though - it has some wicked physical talent, as well as sound tactical intelligence and situational awareness to complement the Captain\'s manoeuvres aboard the military vehicle they commandeered earlier on. It also has an agenda of its own - where it ultimately leads them makes for the show\'s turning point.There is a reason I bring this up, because it is at this point that things do turn a tad bit cheesy - and here too, not unlike in a classic Spielberg mold. I must note however, that it\'s nevertheless a fairly restrained affair by the standards of similar fare, and despite feeling a little overwrought at times it never at any point feels out of place in the context of the plot developments. Another thing to note here is that despite the screaming voice of unabashed idealism literally ringing through your ears at this point, the show doesn\'t descend into cliched tropes even from this point on: even as the plot reaches its climax, the stakes feel as uncertain as ever, which is precisely what gives it a level of tension you wouldn\'t usually expect to find in a show like this.Final words: I honestly didn\'t expect to enjoy a show like Giant Gorg quite as much as I did, jaded as I\'ve grown over the years. While not the most original in its premise, it does stand out as a modest but solidly put-together work moreso than anything else. Aspiring to be no more than a low-key adventure story at the end of the day with a bit of sci-fi thrown in for good measure, its appeal is fairly understated. sure-handed pacing also lends it the feel of an extended movie rather than a multi-episode anime, imparting it with a certain wide-eyed immersion that you don\'t often come across in the medium these days.After Dr. Tagami, a researcher studying mysterious relics in the Austral Islands, somewhere in the remote South Pacific, dies under suspicious circumstances, his son Yuu travels to New York City to meet with Dr. Wave, a colleague of his father\'s, as per his last wishes as expressed in a letter to Yuu.

This is a kids show, but a Japanese one, meaning there is blood, there is death, and there is no ""political correctness"". I myself was surprised at how stunned I was to see these, so ingrained is the notion of the harmless inoffensive kids show in western society. Not that these are of such importance to the show, they are not, it simply is something the previous reviews didn\'t address. In the end, all you need to know is that...this is a really good 80s real robot show with a versatile cast of well rounded characters who are on a dynamic adventure from start to finish. You might find it interesting to view the show as a commentary on power politics and corporate power in the late Cold War era, but you can just watch the show for the mecha adventure, it won\'t get you bogged down in highbrow politicking. And simply I must stress the overall quality of the show, the writing, the animation, the characters - chances are you will enjoy this show. this is a really good 80s real robot show with a versatile cast of well rounded characters who are on a dynamic adventure from start to finish.

Gundam Build Fighters: GM no Gyakushuu,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35982/Gundam_Build_Fighters__GM_no_Gyakushuu,"['*THIS\'LL BE A SHORT ONE; AND ALSO SPOILERS*Let\'s be honest here. If you enjoyed Gundam Build Fighters and checked out any of the other installments (or knew of their existence), you were probably wondering when there\'d be another story involving Sei and even Reiji. I know at least a few people were. So, GM Counterattack (get it?) is here to deliver, and it does so in a way that truly feels like an extension of the series and everything it ever stood for. Heck, for my money, I found it even better, on par with the absolute best episodes of that show. Why, you may...ask? Well, let\'s find out, shall we?STORY: 8/10Basically, the Gundam Mafia (that thankfully used GMs) has been tracked by Sei\'s dad and the Gunpla organization, so, in order to get off their tail, they flee to a brand new tournament that Nills built, while trapping the returning fighters (who came because they wanna fight in tomorrow\'s opening ceremony) because the mafia is a bunch of assholes, with some putting themselves in theoretically perfect matchups to screw over our heroes. Hell, they even stole Sei\'s Gunpla because they\'re the fucking mafia, what are you gonna do, stop them? No, you get riddled by GMs, which are basically their equivalent of fucking tommy guns. Did no one learn from the 1920\'s? I\'d love to imagine Al Capone and his goonies firing a million GMs at that poor Real Grade Exia you just built, you\'d feel dead inside. Moving on!Of course, since this is a kids battle anime, there has to be a deus ex machine somewhere, and there are a few, but the most notable one is Reiji\'s return just in the nick of time as Sei and everyone are trapped by a devious manipulation of particles. At least they explain why he came back, though I\'d imagine that reasoning might make Aila pissed \'cuz knowing him, ""borrowed"" probably means ""took while she was sleeping"". Also, the true final battle between Sei as Reiji is pretty cool, as an added extension of just how far Sei has grown, kinda like a souped up version of their battle in episode 23, except they reach galaxies. Still, part of why this work so well, particularly for a kids show, is more attention to detail with the references and the fact that we have actually competent villains, not to mention that every fighter in the good guy team is here for their own reasons (excluding Iori, she just wanted to tag along with Sei). Hey, would you look at that, it\'s a cool segue.CHARACTERS: 7/10Basically, all of the characters are the same, just with more experience and barring Sei, Iori, and Mao (and maybe Kirara and Misaki, who are barely in this), they\'re also taller or in some way look older. Given that this is just a side-story extra episode product, you\'d think they\'d all just be here for a reason that amounts to ""the plot told them to go here because it\'s in line with their only motivation to go"" and well, they\'re all going to battle, but for their own personal reasons rather than just ""this looks fun and it\'s where the plot starts; let\'s go make our studio some money"". I\'ve said enough spoilers so I won\'t reveal those reasons (plus, that requires more effort and I got 13 or so of these seasonal things to review this month so...), nor will I reveal the identities of any names character in the mafia (though one of them had really fallen from ""grace"" since his minor appearance in the series). For as one-dimensional as these mafia hooligans are, they\'re at least competent villains for this kind of show that you\'re supposed to take seriously as an antagonist (unlike the chairman from last time), so they\'re already an improvement. Oh, and speaking of improvement...ART: 9/10The art is pretty much on point here, even more so than with the series. The digital effects somehow look even better here and the animation is never ever choppy, unlike a few moments I the show. The Gunpla detail and designs are also on point too, with my favorite new design (that isn\'t a modified version of the original like the new Wing Feniche that can transform into a goddamn motorcycle because fuck you, Fellini is cool as shit) is the Ninpulse Gundam. The fights look better choreographed as well and I never thought I\'d see the day that there was a golden diamond encrusted Buand Doc (why give such a piece of junk such luxury?). There is also very minimal CGI here and that\'s good. Now for the only minor downgrade from the series to this...SOUND: 7/10Not gonna lie, I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of new tracks for this one, and the few new ones that were there (one track towards the end and the ED) weren\'t really up to par with the music of the original show, though there. Of bad. Just eh when you compare it to some of the better tracks of the show and the 2nd ED. The music that they used from the original was also rather eh, not even bringing back any of the cooler tracks such as Star Build Strike theme and PowerResonance. It\'s still decent overall, I just wish they lifted some of the best tracks from the original and made more interesting new ones.ENJOYMENT: 8/10Akin to Build Fighters fashion, I found a lot of fun to be had here from both the references and the actual battles themselves. Seeing the ways the expanded on the original series was also a delight, especially the ending to this special, which I won\'t spoil. It\'s raw mecha fun for kids and adults and anyone in between or beyond, and that\'s always a plus (unless you here mecha...*cough* loser *cough*), and obviously, this is best saved for after you finish Build Fighters. So yeah.OVERALL: 8/10    RAW SCORE: 76/100If you enjoyed Build Fighters, there\'s no reason not to end up liking this one as well. In many cases, I\'d argue it\'s better than that one overall as it\'s like watching one of the show\'s best episodes without dealing with any of the weaker ones, and for a kids battle anime, that\'s still a proud achievement, so, like it\'s Gunpla builders/fighters, GM Counterattack should lift its head high. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu. ask? Well, let\'s find out, shall we?STORY: 8/10Basically, the Gundam Mafia (that thankfully used GMs) has been tracked by Sei\'s dad and the Gunpla organization, so, in order to get off their tail, they flee to a brand new tournament that Nills built, while trapping the returning fighters (who came because they wanna fight in tomorrow\'s opening ceremony) because the mafia is a bunch of assholes, with some putting themselves in theoretically perfect matchups to screw over our heroes. Hell, they even stole Sei\'s Gunpla because they\'re the fucking mafia, what are you gonna do, stop them? No, you get riddled by GMs, which are basically their equivalent of fucking tommy guns. Did no one learn from the 1920\'s? I\'d love to imagine Al Capone and his goonies firing a million GMs at that poor Real Grade Exia you just built, you\'d feel dead inside. Moving on!Of course, since this is a kids battle anime, there has to be a deus ex machine somewhere, and there are a few, but the most notable one is Reiji\'s return just in the nick of time as Sei and everyone are trapped by a devious manipulation of particles. At least they explain why he came back, though I\'d imagine that reasoning might make Aila pissed \'cuz knowing him, ""borrowed"" probably means ""took while she was sleeping"". Also, the true final battle between Sei as Reiji is pretty cool, as an added extension of just how far Sei has grown, kinda like a souped up version of their battle in episode 23, except they reach galaxies. Still, part of why this work so well, particularly for a kids show, is more attention to detail with the references and the fact that we have actually competent villains, not to mention that every fighter in the good guy team is here for their own reasons (excluding Iori, she just wanted to tag along with Sei). Hey, would you look at that, it\'s a cool segue.CHARACTERS: 7/10Basically, all of the characters are the same, just with more experience and barring Sei, Iori, and Mao (and maybe Kirara and Misaki, who are barely in this), they\'re also taller or in some way look older. Given that this is just a side-story extra episode product, you\'d think they\'d all just be here for a reason that amounts to ""the plot told them to go here because it\'s in line with their only motivation to go"" and well, they\'re all going to battle, but for their own personal reasons rather than just ""this looks fun and it\'s where the plot starts; let\'s go make our studio some money"". I\'ve said enough spoilers so I won\'t reveal those reasons (plus, that requires more effort and I got 13 or so of these seasonal things to review this month so...), nor will I reveal the identities of any names character in the mafia (though one of them had really fallen from ""grace"" since his minor appearance in the series). For as one-dimensional as these mafia hooligans are, they\'re at least competent villains for this kind of show that you\'re supposed to take seriously as an antagonist (unlike the chairman from last time), so they\'re already an improvement. Oh, and speaking of improvement...ART: 9/10The art is pretty much on point here, even more so than with the series. The digital effects somehow look even better here and the animation is never ever choppy, unlike a few moments I the show. The Gunpla detail and designs are also on point too, with my favorite new design (that isn\'t a modified version of the original like the new Wing Feniche that can transform into a goddamn motorcycle because fuck you, Fellini is cool as shit) is the Ninpulse Gundam. The fights look better choreographed as well and I never thought I\'d see the day that there was a golden diamond encrusted Buand Doc (why give such a piece of junk such luxury?). There is also very minimal CGI here and that\'s good. Now for the only minor downgrade from the series to this...SOUND: 7/10Not gonna lie, I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of new tracks for this one, and the few new ones that were there (one track towards the end and the ED) weren\'t really up to par with the music of the original show, though there. Of bad. Just eh when you compare it to some of the better tracks of the show and the 2nd ED. The music that they used from the original was also rather eh, not even bringing back any of the cooler tracks such as Star Build Strike theme and PowerResonance. It\'s still decent overall, I just wish they lifted some of the best tracks from the original and made more interesting new ones.ENJOYMENT: 8/10Akin to Build Fighters fashion, I found a lot of fun to be had here from both the references and the actual battles themselves.

Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.', ""The first Gundam Build Fighters anime was a big success for the franchise because not it brought back many fans back to the series after the disasters that were Gundam AGE and Gundam 00 movie but it managed to introduced people to the franchise. Gundam Build Fighters Season 1 was my re-introduction to the franchise after over a decade ago with me watching Gundam Wing on Cartoon Network and I loved it to the core. Yes, it had its flaws but honestly, they didn’t bother me because of how much I loved it.After that success that was Gundam Build Fighters Season 1, it would have...been 3 years of time until getting an actual squeal to the first season of Gundam Build Fighters. Am not including the Gundam Build Fighters Try Stuff because they were just awful and in my opinion shouldn’t exist. When the squeal for the first Gundam Build Fighters series came out in OVA format I was really excited the characters that I loved again in this finale/epilogue of the first series.After watching the OVA did it really live up to the hype or did it fell flat in its face?Let's find out, shall we?Story.The day before the ceremony marking the completion of the Yajima Stadium, Nils Nielsen invites Sei Iori, Meijin Kawaguchi, and others to an exhibition battle using the new large-scale battle system he has designed. Now that they are all reunited, Sei attempts to show off the Build Strike Cosmos that he has upgraded for the exhibition, but then he notices something missing. Meanwhile, an origination called the GM Mafia takes control of the stadium’s systems that seals Sei and his friends inside. Now Sei and his friends must defeat the GM mafia in order to stop their evil schemes as well free themselves and get Sei’s Star Build Strike Cosmos back.Honestly, there is not much story here really. It’s mostly a 30-minute finale/epilogue for the original series. It’s just typical villain organization plot where villains steal stuff as well trapping the heroes in a room where the only way you get out is by beating the villains. Typical kids plot. However, while the story was basic it makes it up with character interactions and Gundam references.Like the Bikini Babe showoff from Victory Gundam where female characters were that suit to distract the male with the sexy beauty.Lastly, we have the ending which was a great send-off for the original build fighters cast which honestly made me tear up knowing that we won’t be seeing half of these characters again in Build Fighters Try unless you count Battlelog OVAs.Characters.The characters haven’t changed at all since the TV series but lucky they still have that charm in them. Yes, they are a bit taller this time around but personally wise they are the same group of character that we loved from season 1. Am glad they didn’t devolve as characters to a point they became almost as bad from the characters from Build Fighters Try which is a squeal to this show mind you.As for villains being the Gundam Mafia they were fun decent villains overall.Overall the characters in Gundam Build Fighters GM Counterattack are still great as ever.9/10Visuals.Visually Gundam Build Fighters GM Counterattack is mostly the same as the series but there were a few things different about it. For starters, the Gunpla battles here are smoother and consistent compared to the series making the fights more appealing to watch.The show has generally better lighting compare to the TV series which was a plus.Also, the mecha designs are still as great as ever.Sound.The soundtrack is still great that features a lot old and new tracks.Unlike the first series, this hasn’t got an English Dub but I hope it does get one at some point as being actually one of few people who didn’t mind the English dub of the original Build Fighters series.Final Thoughts.Overall this was a great Gundam OVA overall.The story while being cliched was still good and entertaining to watch, the characters were still charming as used to, the visuals were amazing and the soundtrack is still great as ever.This was such a great finale/epilogue to an already great show and I highly recommend this ova to any Gundam fan.Final Score 8/10 been 3 years of time until getting an actual squeal to the first season of Gundam Build Fighters.

If you\'ve ever heard of Build Fighters, you\'ve probably heard the criticism that it\'s ""just mech fights,"" and, although there are copious mech fights, that\'s not exactly true. The first series was also a loving sendup of Gunplay culture and Gundam itself, often taking time to make fairly esoteric jokes just because it could.Try downplayed that element of the show quite a bit, and this ONA discarded it entirely. It\'s a very mechanical...story that serves to get our old heroes together, gives them a villain, and then puts them in a gauntlet of mech battles, after which it ends.Good thing I personally like mech battles, because this will be very disappointing for you if you\'re looking for something more. story that serves to get our old heroes together, gives them a villain, and then puts them in a gauntlet of mech battles, after which it ends.Good thing I personally like mech battles, because this will be very disappointing for you if you\'re looking for something more.']"
Hayate no Gotoku! Heaven Is a Place on Earth,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9958/Hayate_no_Gotoku_Heaven_Is_a_Place_on_Earth,"['With 2 anime seasons before it, the popular Hayate manga series gets its 3rd animated project in the form of this movie titled ""Heaven is a Place on Earth"". This time around studio manglobe is in charge of production where JC Staff had handled season 2, and Synergy SP handled season 1. How will manglobe\'s shot at this franchise fare in comparison with its previous entries?To start with this is NOT an adaptation of any chapters from the manga, the story for this movie is completely anime original and it is supposed to be set a couple of months AFTER the point the manga is...currently on when I wrote this. This means that in terms of timeline, the movie\'s plot is pretty far away from where the anime ended on season 2. However the story introduced for this movie is one that does not heavily rely on knowledge of the currently non animated parts of the manga so any fans of the series who has already watched the first 2 seasons of the anime can sit back and enjoy this movie fully. For those that do read the manga however, you will definitely find a couple of extra surprises along the way.I am not going to spoil the plot of the movie here, but as far as the story goes it is nothing extraodinary yet it does not deviate from what you could expect from the Hayate series either. If it aint broke, dont fix it applies very well here. There is some good comedy and references to other anime in true Hayate fashion, there are some supernatural occurences, and of course you have Hayate protecting Nagi from whatever tries to harm her. And it works.The art manglobe uses for this movie is also very simple but at the same time very clean and consistent. It lacks detail and shadows, however the character designs and animations fit the mood of the series very well. The opening sequence in particular looked really good. Its a matter of personal taste between which artstyle you favour more throughout the 3 different hayate anime, but personally I am content with manglobe\'s style and I wouldnt mind seeing more of the series like this. Oh and the colours were very nice too.The opening song is very catchy and it fits the series well but for me, it is the ED song by fripside that really takes the cake. Anyone familiar with fripside would enjoy this song as its their usual style. The voice acting continues being a strong point in the series with a high tier list of names on it. I found  Kugimiya Rie\'s performance as Nagi this time around to be a bit better than in the TV series as well.Of course the strongest point of the entire Hayate series is the characters and this movie is no different. The characters are the same as always, Nagi being spoiled, Maria being a maid, Hinagiku being tsundere, the idiotic trio being idiotic, its all there. Although I did mention that you dont need to read the manga to fully enjoy the movie, non manga readers might be puzzled as to where this mysterious new girl named ""Kayura"" came from and why she is close to Nagi. Fortunately she does not really play an important role in the movie apart from comedy moments so there is not much to lose. With such a large cast it is hard to give everyone some screentime but I felt that the movie was pretty good at distributing that around. By the time I finished watching I felt like no one was truly left behind and was able to enjoy it greatly.For anyone  that enjoys this series there is no reason why you should not watch this movie, everything that makes Hayate enjoyable is present here and I believe manglobe did the series justice here. Whenever a 3rd TV season of the series comes, if they announce manglobe as the studio in charge, I will not worry because I now know that the franchise is in good hands. currently on when I wrote this.

Coming right after the 2nd season. Wouldn\'t really call it a ""sequel"" as it has no relation to the main story other than a opportunity for Hayate to gain enough money to pay off his debt and balk his career as a combat butler. Actually there is no relation to enjoyment what so ever. Care to what I have to say? Then read on.STORY: 1Story? What story? If you count me making myself a guacamole taco with beans, chicken, red tomato salsa, and some queso fresco cheese sprinkled on top; then me eating it while...watching this disgraceful ""movie"", that dares to have Hayate in its title a ""story"", then I guess we are all writing geniuses who should be more famous then Mary Shelley and H.G Wells. After watching this I\'m actually doubting what a movie actually is? I\'d call this an over-lengthened OVA if anything! What? Your going to call the majority of the cast going to the countryside out of boredom; then meeting what I presume to be Hayate\'s mother who starts causing small confusions a ""story"". Then I guess now we\'re all the next William Shakespeare! As this is very poorly executed. I mean all she does is create a space where she traps part of the main cast and give Hayate a a gem that can pay off his debt for life. But guess what he does? Oh wait you don\'t have to what else would he do if he didn\'t earn it? And the next 30min of the movie is half of the cast in the closed space and the other half outside of it. Just trying to figure out how to get out.Art: 6Given that this is neatly done by a different studio but not by the original JC Staff, I\'d say its pretty decent. I still prefer the original art over this one but it wasn\'t unbearable or anything. Just not as detailed. Still, I\'d rather have season 3 and up always done by the JC Staff. As their art, is near perfection.Sound: 5I\'m going to be blunt about this. The songs sucked ass and the only thing that  actually sounded good was the same sounds that we hear all the time in anime in general. And Rie Kugimiya\'s voice. Which I love. In fact, when does sound in anime ever feel like crap? Unless it is unsynchronized and you start hearing the sounds and conversations before you actually see the characters talking.Character: 2I just could not enjoy the characters or the movie in general because the characters themselves didn\'t feel like the characters! Other than seeing them again and actually talking and conversating that was the only thing positive about this movie. What happened to my beloved Hina?! Other than about 2-3 minutes of screen time she didn\'t even get to show her personality as a tsundere! Is one moment where she blushes, becomes exposed, and yells ""baka!"" to Hayate going to satisfy ME?! No...just no. I\'m better off watching Shakugan no Shana and seeing Shana do the same but a million times better.Enjoyment: 1NONE WHAT SO EVER. \'Nuff said.Overall: 2The only thing that kept me watching was being able to actually hear Rie Kugimiya and see Hina talking again. Trust me, your better off seeing ""Spirited Away"" (which is one of 2 references in here) or watching ""The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya"". (which is the 2nd reference) Unless you just can\'t wait to see the 3rd season and see the characters again.

Then again, what ""characters""?', ""When I first heard of this anime, it got me interested. I did like Kuroshitsuji so I wanted to try something light for a change.Main characters: Hayate, Nagi, Maria and Hinagiku (+ a bunch of Nagi's classmates)I'll score everything a 7.I was not really expecting a lot from this anime. I've seen the 1st season and it had a pretty much the same plot.Background: Hayate is acting as Nagi's butler to pay off his debt. Nagi is a rich and spoiled 13 yr old who oftentimes gets into trouble then Hayate will be there to save her. Cute, yes but it is not really...saying much.This movie is not any different. We have the main cast spending their remaining summer break on a countryside. Being as spoiled as she is, Nagi is constantly whining about everything and Hayate is always there to pacify her. A spirit then shows up - makes Hayate forget about Nagi and tries to make his life better and easier - or so she thinks... they get separated - Nagi gets stuck in a some kind of carnival while Hayate is still serving as a butler but this time, Maria (Nagi's personal maid) is his 'milady'.With some confused flashbacks, Hayate remembers Nagi and saves the day.What I liked about this is Hayate and Nagi's relationship. Though they might not have the same feelings towards each other. Nagi seem to like Hayate romantically while Hayate is just acting as his loyal self (I think). Hayate is sincere enough that anyone would definitely fall for him, especially a 13yr old. But I still can't help thinking: I know that he sort of likes Maria and Hinagiku, but if Nagi was a little older, would he feel any different?To sum it all up for me, it's a very simple anime - with a simple story and a simple art. Good enough movie for Hayate no Gotoku fans. Other people can skip it since I don't think it offers something new and different. Pick up the 2nd season instead - it might just be better than this... saying much.This movie is not any different. We have the main cast spending their remaining summer break on a countryside.

Good enough movie for Hayate no Gotoku fans. Other people can skip it since I don't think it offers something new and different. Pick up the 2nd season instead - it might just be better than this..."", 'This Hayate movie can be viewed as an OVA as it doesn\'t really have anything to do with the main story line. Basically Nagi\'s group decides to end their summer vacation by visiting the Japanese countryside (apparently Ayumu has a summer villa). There, some extraordinary circumstances take place resulting in kidnappings, randomly appearing theme parks, and cameo appearances by lots of characters (some that are apparently manga specific).This is not Hayate at it\'s best. The comedy is significantly below what was in either of the two TV adaptions and some of the personalities even seem a bit off. The plot doesn\'t help either with a...predictable progression combined with unnatural elements (like the ability to erase specific memories). If you really want more Hayate, petition for another TV adaption so we can get more Hinagiku, and spare yourself an hour of disappointment.Animation:Hayate keeps getting face lifts, and this movie is no exception. Unlike the second TV adaption, this face lift is for the worse. Hayate\'s hair gets longer and his face makes him look even younger/less responsible. A lot of the other characters also get some changes including Izumi who suddenly gets much longer hair. I got royally confused at times trying to decipher whether the person on screen was either a modified TV character or a new addition.For a movie, the quality is also abysmal. My latest movies at the time being Kara no Kyoukai and Eve No Jikan, this is so many levels below that it\'s somewhat pathetic. The colors are average (minus character shading differences from TV) but backgrounds are lacking in detail at times. Pretty much this entire section is sub par to the second Hayate TV adaption.Sound:The Movie has a nice paced OP (and does a decent job of recapping the entire TV series so far while at it) and a nice, upbeat electronic based ED with a pretty good melody. The BGM is somewhat comparable to the anime series though isn\'t used very often in this hour-long production.The VA cast is identical to the TV series, and you can expect their performance to be on par with that version. If anything is disappointing, it\'s the limited exposure that Hinagiku gets.Story:This movie takes Hayate on a very ""magical"" tangent where many mysterious elements take place. He finds himself in the Japanese countryside where his master is dying of lack of iPhone reception (yes they actually refer to the device by name) and heat. After following a mysterious person, Hayate loses track of Nagi who, as usual, ends up ""kidnapped"". From that point onwards, it\'s very linear in progression and the climax/conclusion are all very predictable.While the mystery is decent at the beginning, I soon grew tired of repeated elements and farfetched explanation of what was happening. The only worthwhile part of the movie was a tiny bit of new background information on Hayate. But it isn\'t worth sitting through Nagi\'s unusually high amount of complaining and whining.Character:Character relations are very very weak in this movie. The Hayate TV adaptions were great for balancing good comedy with light romance. Here, Nagi seemed overly ready to abuse Hayate, more so than is characteristic of her. It made it really hard to figure out whether the movie was between the two TV adaptions or at some other point in time.As for the other characters, expect lots of brief cameos and a bit of Hinagiku. Unfortunately, you only get a brief glimpse of her tsundere feelings for Hayate. Ultimately, the movie is about Hayate\'s deep commitment to Nagi, though the execution doesn\'t make it very convincing.Value:This is a solid skip. Unless you absolutely are dying for some more Hayate, this isn\'t worth your time. predictable progression combined with unnatural elements (like the ability to erase specific memories). If you really want more Hayate, petition for another TV adaption so we can get more Hinagiku, and spare yourself an hour of disappointment.Animation:Hayate keeps getting face lifts, and this movie is no exception. Unlike the second TV adaption, this face lift is for the worse. Hayate\'s hair gets longer and his face makes him look even younger/less responsible. A lot of the other characters also get some changes including Izumi who suddenly gets much longer hair. I got royally confused at times trying to decipher whether the person on screen was either a modified TV character or a new addition.For a movie, the quality is also abysmal. My latest movies at the time being Kara no Kyoukai and Eve No Jikan, this is so many levels below that it\'s somewhat pathetic. The colors are average (minus character shading differences from TV) but backgrounds are lacking in detail at times. Pretty much this entire section is sub par to the second Hayate TV adaption.Sound:The Movie has a nice paced OP (and does a decent job of recapping the entire TV series so far while at it) and a nice, upbeat electronic based ED with a pretty good melody. The BGM is somewhat comparable to the anime series though isn\'t used very often in this hour-long production.The VA cast is identical to the TV series, and you can expect their performance to be on par with that version. If anything is disappointing, it\'s the limited exposure that Hinagiku gets.Story:This movie takes Hayate on a very ""magical"" tangent where many mysterious elements take place. He finds himself in the Japanese countryside where his master is dying of lack of iPhone reception (yes they actually refer to the device by name) and heat. After following a mysterious person, Hayate loses track of Nagi who, as usual, ends up ""kidnapped"". From that point onwards, it\'s very linear in progression and the climax/conclusion are all very predictable.While the mystery is decent at the beginning, I soon grew tired of repeated elements and farfetched explanation of what was happening. The only worthwhile part of the movie was a tiny bit of new background information on Hayate. But it isn\'t worth sitting through Nagi\'s unusually high amount of complaining and whining.Character:Character relations are very very weak in this movie.

Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Special: Nekogoroshi-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2899/Higurashi_no_Naku_Koro_ni_Special__Nekogoroshi-hen,"[""Okay this is my first review :)Being a big fan of the Higurashi series I was excited to find out that a new adaptation of the story was being released. Needless to say i didn't have any hopes or expectations as most of the questions were answered (Watch Higurashi no Naku Koroni Kai to find out) other than wanting to see my favourite cast of characters set off onto a new adventure.......also just in caseWARNING THIS SPECIAL MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS AND MAY/MAY NOT AFFECT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE MAIN SERIESStory: 6/10This special gives a sort of side story to the main series and contains some mystery...behind it. Whilst there is no actual involvement of the main characters other than the shenanigans at the start of the show the story does suffice to bring the characters back in for another adventure.Art: 9/10Same style as Kai and 1st season but still beautiful.Sound: 8/10The opening and closing songs are the same as season 1, but to my knowledge I believe it uses some background music from the 1st season so they are nice on the ear.Character: 10/10No new development just the same wonderful cast :) ~ Ni pah!Enjoyment: 8/10To see the cast of Higurashi doing something new is the main reason why i wanted to watch it and i did enjoy watching it but i want more!Overall: 8/10If you’re a fan of the series you should definitely watch it and even if you are new to the franchise it can give you a taste of who the characters are and half of what their like. BUT, just in case, be warned that it MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS as it does contain flashbacks of the main series but which aren't that harmful BUT parts of the special could affect how you interpret the first series of Higurashi.So watch it to find out why it is called the cat killing chapter :)~Abyssal behind it.

This time they\'re playing poker and betting large amounts of money. Unfortunately for our hero, halfway through the game he loses all of his money. But of course it\'s Keiichi we\'re talking about so instead of money he bets himself. If a loser, he promises the...girls to do anything and everything they want (don\'t drool yet I\'m not finished). Rika\'s imagination starts working as she sees Keiichi in a maid outfit and Satoko\'s only interested in making him suffer so she pictures him on all fours calling her ""master"". Rena wants to take everyone home (no suprise here) and Mion gets all red while imagining herself lying on Keiichi\'s laps while letting him softly carees her ear. Woah.The gamble pays off though and Keiichi wins all of the girls\' money. But the game goes on... and you can probably imagine what happens next. I\'ll tell you one thing though, I haven\'t seen that much fanservice in any other Higurashi series/OVA. You\'ll be having a nosebleed after a nosebleed after a nosebleed and you will be in danger of passing out halfway through this episode. For some of us it may be fun, for others it may not - you decide. I for one, enjoyed it.To quickly sum up and avoid putting more spoilers in, the next half of the episode focus on the ""scary"" part where our heroes go off to an abandoned near-by village and learn of the terrible killings at the stone quarry. The story does get you interested though, with Rika and Mion both taking turns in explaining to the rest of the characters what (they think) really happened.Now to review everything individually:Story - The most important aspect in any anime in my humble opinion. Nekogoroshi hen however doesn\'t follow the Higurashi grid, and in turn we\'re presented with Higurashi that doesn\'t actually feel like Higurashi (for the first half anyway). As I said, lots of fanservice and comedy with a slight bit of horror or shall I say, mystery. But it\'s not the murderous, psychological, depressive and completely messed up kind of mystery. Compared with the bewildering mysteries in the first season of Higurashi no naku koro ni, Nekogoroshi-hen is pretty tame. There are 1 or 2 instances where you might go ""wtf"" but not much more than that I\'m afraid. So I felt slightly disapointed by that, and had to lower my overal score for this special.Art - I never write much about art because A.) I\'m not an artist and B.) I hate lying to people about stuff I have no idea about. However I\'ll tell you this - never have Mion\'s boobs been so perfectly designed and animated. NO KIDDING!! You can actually see her giant melons gently bouncing up and down as she walks with our characters. That coupled with the fact that in this episode her cleavege is fully exposed will surely cause your brain to temporarily switch off, regardless of your gender. Just be sure that when you do lose your consciousness you fall on a soft surface. You have been warned.Sound - Well there\'s really not much to write about here. The sound in this special, like nearly all sounds in Higurashi is taken from the Higurashi OST. So you get a decent mix of well composed music. When I say well composed I mean it. One second a comedic tune makes you wanna jump up and down till the end of time, the other a sad piano/violin combination makes you depressed and you feel like digging your own grave and lying there until you die of old age hoping someone comes along and shuffles all that earth you just dug up on you.Characters - As always, funny and innovative. However in this episode, they\'re not scary and they\'re not trying to kill each other. On the other hand we see their funny and caring side. Rika is Rika, always concerned about the safety of her friends. Satoko wants Keiichi to acknowledge that she is better than him ( in... everything). Rena wants to take everyone home and molest them and Mion is fantasising about Keiichi.Enjoyment - Well, this crazy special episode will make you nosebleed so many times you\'ll be begging for a blood transfusion as soon as you finish watching it. However there were no hospitals near by so for me that was actually not a good thing. 9/10Overall - Seriously though all sarcasm and euphemism aside, this special IS worth watching. I\'m a Higurashi nut, I\'ve seen the anime, played the sound novels and probaly have everything that has something to do with higurashi. However even if you\'re not a Higurashi fan but you have come across it before then you should also see it because it is a genuinely entertaining episode. Hell, even if you haven\'t watched Higurashi at all and you think I\'m just some sort of a crazy guy with too much time on my hands, then you should still see it! girls to do anything and everything they want (don\'t drool yet I\'m not finished).

There isn't much to the story. In true Higurashi style, the first section of the episode is happy and amusing and slowly...deteriorates to something creepier with Rika being her usual mysterious self.

This episode is essentially a filler, but a good filler.Story (7):The cast of our usual lovable characters sit around and try to figure out another local mystery. The mystery has nothing to do with the overall plot. But if you watch this before Kai (which most of us didn't), it does provide good foreshadowing. That said, it doesn't really advance the plot at all besides that.Art (7): It has the same art style as Rei, which can be distracting (since Rei is after both the first season and Kai). Regardless,...it still looks good, so nothing to complain about.Sound (8): The sound is what makes the Higurashi franchise stand out. But sadly, nothing intense enough happens in the story to make use of the best tracks. They stick with what they know works. But this episode wasn't the time or place to use it's stand out tracks.Enjoyment (7 - 8): This depends on when you saw this episode. If you saw it before Kai, 8. If you're like most of us who saw it after watching the whole series, then a 7. Again, it's filler.Overall (7): It's nice to see the characters acting like their usual selves.

The characters literally don't do anything, they just talk about the legend. The story isn't even particularly interesting and, while there are some implications that very loosely tie it to the plot of Higurashi, it doesn't fit in, anyway.The art, sound and other technical aspects are all on the level of Higurashi Kai, which is fine.I...wouldn't really recommend this to anyone other than the most hardcore Higurashi fans who have watched literally everything else and want to see the characters again. I'm one of those hardcore fans and I did get some enjoyment from seeing the squad again, but I really can't find anything actually interesting about this special.

And we never really find out the mystery of the episode, but it was pretty good, I mean it is pretty hard to fit an entire compelling mystery into a single episode, so I'm not gonna rant on...it.Overall, if you like Higurashi, you will like this, so just watch it already. it.Overall, if you like Higurashi, you will like this, so just watch it already."", ""Well, this is sort of just a one-episode little story thing that they did, mostly containing exposition (or 'world-building' for a location in Hinamizawa). Looks also exactly the same as the rest of season 1, which isn't bad, it still looks nice though.The story itself is fine, it fits the Higurashi theme of 'mysterious deaths and supernatural things happening' well enough. But the way its told from Rika sort of just makes it feel like exposition.The characters all are dressed up in costumes, which leads into some admittedly good fan-service (better than the stuff found in 'Rei' and 'Kira', that's for sure.) They all have...their own reactions and thoughts on the story, which actually makes them feel more like investigators rather than listeners of the story.The music in this episode are just some of the atmospheric songs from the soundtrack (which makes sense because this a special of the first season and not 'Kai', I believe.)Overall, a good story with some cute fan-service and comedic moments sprinkled in.

I have no clue on why this arc is particularly called the 'Cat Killing Chapter' as there wasn't anything related to cats of sort.Enjoyed this one, as the mysteries relating to Hinamizawa village just get more mysterious.What actually is the 'maze' that Rika Furude talked about in the last episode...of Season 1 and why Keichi suddenly gets a flashback as nothing major really happens to trigger such memories.Will have to continue on to the Kai series. of Season 1 and why Keichi suddenly gets a flashback as nothing major really happens to trigger such memories.Will have to continue on to the Kai series."", 'Nekogoroshi-hen is fine.

It follows the general trend of Higurashi\'s chapters to start relaxed and lighthearted to then turn mysterious and spooky. Some people were a bit confused about the name ""Cat Killing Chapter"" which I\'m pretty sure is a reference to the saying: ""curiosity killed the cat."" Whether you watch it is completely up to you, I don\'t feel too strongly about it, watch it if you want to.

Kaze no Youjinbou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1145/Kaze_no_Youjinbou,"[""Well, let me first say this is my first review so bear with me!I found this anime i this site and after looking all over the Internet and not finding it I spent 20 bucks and bought it.I found it to be a great buy! I really enjoyed the story and the main character.Story:10It kept me wondering what really happened in the small town 15 years ago.  Then just when I thought I figured it out something new would show up and keep me guessing.It had several &quot;small pieces&quot; you could pick up along the way and fit together.Art:7Sadly its art was a great...disappointment.There were a few &quot;still scenes&quot;.The characters did not blink as often as they should have. Dont get me wrong the fight scenes were very good and realistic.It was just when they were sitting and talking.So overall even though I hate to I can only give it a 7 for art.Sound:8I enjoyed the op song and watched it every time instead of skipping it.The dramatic music they would play when someone was killed or a new &quot;piece&quot; was found I thought fit in well with the anime.Character:9Almost of of the characters are great. Just one character did I want to kill.The fact I can't remember her names shows how much I hate her. She has a crush on George and I guess you could say is the average &quot;stupid teenage woman&quot; you see in anime.Other than her I enjoyed the steady development of the characters and each ones secrets and personality.Enjoyment:10If you can get past the animation which is not hard to do for such a great anime and the &quot;stupid teenage woman&quot; you can really enjoys putting the pieces together and all the twists that come with this anime.I truly recommend this anime to all lovers of mystery anime. Trust me and spent 20 bucks on it! disappointment.There were a few &quot;still scenes&quot;.The characters did not blink as often as they should have.

Trust me and spent 20 bucks on it!"", ""I came into this honestly not expecting much. Its clear that its a lower budget anime as most is simply drawn and the action scenes themselves are mostly still frames through out the series, so don't go in expecting crazy action. What really did it for me was the story of this series. It feels like a older 80's or early 90's crime investigation movie. The pacing itself is fairly slow but it always gives you enough to keep you interested (at least me anyways) and doesn't give away so much your disappointed. However by the end it builds up really well and had a...satisfying ending. If your willing to look past the budget and sit back and enjoy a nice story you'll like Kaze no Yojimbo.overall: 8/10 satisfying ending. If your willing to look past the budget and sit back and enjoy a nice story you'll like Kaze no Yojimbo.overall: 8/10"", ""BORING !!! Story gets dragged out after only a few episodes and there is very little action. The action consists of mainly still pictures with sound. Opening song is annoying as hell.  Animation was good and sound was fine. I just lost interest because it was like watching Columbo, but instead of Peter Falk, it's David Schwimmer as Columbo. 26 ep collection can be found for less than $10.00. What does that tell you? "", 'Kaze no Yojimbo is a re-imagined tale based on Akira Kurosawa’s movie Yojimbo, the story of a ronin that enters a village only to find it controlled by two opposing gangs, which he decides to play against each other. I have yet to see the movie so this review will not make any direct comparisons. One thing that is clear however is the atmosphere, which despite taking place in a modern setting, could easily fit a samurai or western story. The strong protagonist with no name that wanders in to stir up the community, the rivalling families that strive for power, the thirst for revenge,...and to top it off a lost train filled with bricks of gold. It all captures a certain air of je-ne-sais-quoi that makes it charming.With a strong base to build upon, Kaze no Yojimbo starts off as an intriguing series, with a cast of characters that feel human and fleshed out. The show has an over-arching plot that connects nearly all episodes, doing so with sensible pacing, where the stakes slowly get higher in a natural way. There are a few filler episodes, yet smaller things that are established in these episodes are brought up again later, making the series strong as a whole despite some weak individual moments.The soundtrack consists of guitars and harmonicas that would fit any western, creating a mood of being stuck out in a desolate town in the middle of nowhere. Add in some melancholic trumpets for down-time, along with some icy violins to signal danger, and you have a solid soundtrack. The series does well in that it knows when to let the sounds of the environment set the tone, from windy snowfields, to cramped up bars and wild marshes.There is a list of things that hold the show back, the most striking thing being its animation. From the start it is apparent that it suffers from a low budget. Combine this with some strange visual quirks and bad editing, and you will end up with a lackluster presentation, making it hard to get fully immersed. Examples include scenes that lack timing or drag things out to fill the running-time, plus a bunch of distracting pixelated static in the background. This is a weakness that makes it hard to recommend Kaze no Yojimbo as an action-series, considering the low number of action-scenes that actually look good.The main thing that will either make or break the series however is the mystery. The town and its characters hold many secrets, which the main character wishes to dig up. Even the main character’s motivation for doing this is hidden for a majority of the show.

If you can look beyond some sloppy art, this series will serve you a perfectly alright adventure. and to top it off a lost train filled with bricks of gold. It all captures a certain air of je-ne-sais-quoi that makes it charming.With a strong base to build upon, Kaze no Yojimbo starts off as an intriguing series, with a cast of characters that feel human and fleshed out. The show has an over-arching plot that connects nearly all episodes, doing so with sensible pacing, where the stakes slowly get higher in a natural way. There are a few filler episodes, yet smaller things that are established in these episodes are brought up again later, making the series strong as a whole despite some weak individual moments.The soundtrack consists of guitars and harmonicas that would fit any western, creating a mood of being stuck out in a desolate town in the middle of nowhere. Add in some melancholic trumpets for down-time, along with some icy violins to signal danger, and you have a solid soundtrack. The series does well in that it knows when to let the sounds of the environment set the tone, from windy snowfields, to cramped up bars and wild marshes.There is a list of things that hold the show back, the most striking thing being its animation. From the start it is apparent that it suffers from a low budget. Combine this with some strange visual quirks and bad editing, and you will end up with a lackluster presentation, making it hard to get fully immersed. Examples include scenes that lack timing or drag things out to fill the running-time, plus a bunch of distracting pixelated static in the background. This is a weakness that makes it hard to recommend Kaze no Yojimbo as an action-series, considering the low number of action-scenes that actually look good.The main thing that will either make or break the series however is the mystery. The town and its characters hold many secrets, which the main character wishes to dig up. Even the main character’s motivation for doing this is hidden for a majority of the show.

And the Secret Organization needed to keep things very hush hush to avoid any unwanted attention (because the treasure would be worthless to them if they could not get it unnoticed), so in the latter part of the series the Ginzame gang kept low profile by threatening the police, multiple shooting incidents, collecting dozens of criminals from other areas into the tiny town, arsoning the Tanokura mansion, and kidnapping people, one with a helicopter.

The economy has turned bad since the end of an off-world war reduced demand for water, the planet's main export, making work hard to get for Gram and his friends, and governmental corruption only worsens the situation. The environment makes a perfect setting for pirates using futuristic submarines, who regularly raid the city-ships for supplies. The most renowned and feared of the pirate vessels is the Ship of Aurora, which makes a habit of reselling its booty cheap so that it can be redistributed to less fortunate folk. Such...a problem do the pirates pose that the Earth government, which still controls Mars, has dispatched an elite team of fresh military recruits to help deal with their threat. The story follows Gram River who joins the pirate ship Aurora and his ex girl friend Vestemona Lauren who is part of the military out to get Gram and the crew of the Aurora.I really enjoyed this anime.  Though the overall story wasn't original it did bring a few new ideas.  For example, Mars covered in water, and  the design of the Mecha used in the anime.  The story also did a great job mixing the elements of drama, action, romance, and a little comedy.  The characters were also great, Gram River, Chrysalis Milch, Enora Taft and all the rest.  They brought the anime to life.  The animation was done by BONES.  I was disappointed with them, after all their the ones who did RahXephon, Wolf's Rain, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Eureka Seven.  Though it was still good, it just didn't live up to their standards.  Another small problem I had was the music, which lacked emotion to add to the series.Overall a very good anime, that's worth checking out. a problem do the pirates pose that the Earth government, which still controls Mars, has dispatched an elite team of fresh military recruits to help deal with their threat.

Mars is covered by water, and the economy is really lousy. Gram tries his best to live a good life, but everything changes for him when he is accidentally brought onto the pirate ship &quot;Aurora&quot;, and being a pirate on &quot;Aurora&quot; becomes his new profession. The story follows this merry group of pirates on their travels, as they reveal secrets that could change Mars forever, and a team sent from Earth to catch the pirates. It starts of very nice and entertaining,...but as the series progresses, the plot gets weaker, and starts to rely on filler-ish episodes, abandoning the initial story.AnimationSeeing as this was made by Bones (also did Fullmetal Alchemist and Darker than Black), i was expecting awesome animation. I was disappointed. The character designs are bland and the animation looks awkward sometimes.SoundDecent. Most of the voice actors were pretty bad, actually (the only really good one being Tomokazu Seki), the BGM was nothing special and the OP/ED were so-so.CharacterBest thing about this series. The characters are great: there's the over-the-top Captain, the nonchalant &quot;pilot ace&quot;, the little brat, a talking cat, a childhood friend. The clich&eacute; stuff(pretty much the greatest clich&eacute; characters since I watched Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann). Oh wait, there's also a talking dolphin in a weird suit(yeah, you guessed it, he can talk). The two characters that stand out (apart from the talking dolphin) are Gram, your shounen hero, cool to the max, making the ladies fall for him(really enjoyed him though) and Enora, the spoiled girl that tags along the ragtag pirate crew.EnjoymentAs I said earlier, Mars Daybreak starts off greatly. It's fun, exiting and interesting. You actually get mecha-fighting under water. It's awesome. You want more. Then it goes all Eureka Seven on you, and apart from E7's emo awesomeness, Mars Daybreak fails miserably when it comes to the drama, just making it pathetic. I talked about the transition to fillers earlier, and after these so called fillers end, the story just spirals towards it's doom, becoming predictable, boring, and even screwing up the comedy.Overall: 7/10Not a series i would really recommend, but those who liked Eureka Seven might like this, seing as it's like E7, except underwater, with a lighter take on life than it's rawer cousin. but as the series progresses, the plot gets weaker, and starts to rely on filler-ish episodes, abandoning the initial story.AnimationSeeing as this was made by Bones (also did Fullmetal Alchemist and Darker than Black), i was expecting awesome animation.

Mars Daybreak features our carefree and free-spirited male lead Gram finding his own mecha that gets attracted to him for whatever reason and he tags along with the pirate crew aboard the Ship of Aurora in the hunt for ancient treasure on the planet of Mars. Basically, the series mixes around adventure and comedy in its focus on Gram and the Ship of Aurora crew as they usually run into combat situations against rival pirate Kubernes and Earth Forces, as well as having episodes focused around a different member of the crew. It's a decent...storytelling approach, but the series doesn't really bother going into great detail on the backgrounds of each character and how they became part of the pirate crew, especially when you have a talking cat and dolphin among the crew who never get any fleshing out. Pretty much, the majority of characters in the series are archetypes you would see in one form or another in different adventure titles similar in premise to Mars Daybreak and they never really grow out of them, with only one major character in the series getting any significant character development.The lack of depth also rings true for many elements of the show's storyline and the title's world-building. The series seemed to be dropping hints that Gram might have a past connection to the earliest humans who colonized Mars in the first half of the show, yet this builds up to nothing. There are hostilities between Mars and Earth for the latter's occupancy and influence being felt on Mars and contributing to large amounts of poverty and crime to occur, yet this is mostly a backdrop to the adventures of Gram and the Ship of Aurora. No explanation is given as to why all of Mars is covered in water. Ester makes mention of being part of a race of beings called the Nautical Witches, yet the show never bothers telling us what they are. Nothing is revealed over how an RB is able to come under Gram's control. I could go on and on pointing out the lack of depth and explanation that Mars Daybreak has for many elements to its plot and world.I suppose the best way you could enjoy this series is if you don't ask questions and just enjoy the comedy and adventure. But many comedic moments in Mars Daybreak fell flat for me and the adventure element has its setbacks thanks to the character-focused episodes feeling like padding that add nothing to the show since we don't learn much about the characters anyway and even then, most of the developments of the adventure are cliched and quite predictable if you've seen enough titles like this. You know that the Ship of Aurora crew will prevail in many of their missions unless the plot demands for a twist in developments, which occur in the final episodes of the show. Even then, said twist is very predictable considering you could see it coming from a mile away since the Ship of Aurora crew knew how fishy things were with this development. It's not that I find this series to be bad at all. It's just there's nothing unique in it that sticks out for me compared to similar offerings I've seen in the past.Overall, this series may be worth a look if you're showing it to a younger audience (since the show was made for young boys in Japan) or if this is one of your first anime titles you are checking out.

I know it gets formulaic and sketchy sometimes throughout, as many TV anime did at that time, but the core and most importantly the emotions are of such great pull, you just can't pass by it. Also, it has that Japanese signature mood of gentle sadness, if that makes any kind of sense. But the way this is structured is worthy of praise, even if it was wholly done on intuitive level.So many elements and details I like are present here, it's just so innately Yamato-damashii. I can understand if many don't see much of what I'm referring to though, but...try to watch it the same way I did. The whole thing as an episodic Kabuki performance, which we suddenly find ourselves in, only to be revealed around the final three episodes, and within the acts are what could've been logographic or symbolic representations of evil (mannequins, dolls, flowers, etc), that is the Shinma themselves. And you can see how the traditional calligraphy is constantly emphasized, but the weakness here is in the animation of the demons and fight sequences, so much could've been done, at least partly resembling the way they were made in the intro, like ink shadows.It's rewarding nonetheless, the character engineering and development, the psychological darkness not being all over the place, with superb voice acting in the original Japanese. Then there's the role and effect of side characters on driving the main plot (Chisato, Larva, Reiha), something I've come to appreciate and notice more often recently, just plain good writing. try to watch it the same way I did.

I read it as more Twilight Zone than Twilight, embracing its nature as an anthology series. All the shows I mentioned are episodic and yet are held in high regard, so even though every review of this show bashes it for being too episodic, being episodic in itself is not the problem. The question is, how well does it play to its type by using its episodic nature and supernatural elements to explore the darker parts of...human nature?Very well.Having seen many shows of a similar nature, I think it\'s one of the most successful examples of its type in large part due to its ambiguity. In many shows of this type the theme and moral the episodes are propagating are relatively clear-cut and straightforward. Beyond the high production values and initial twists, there isn\'t a lot to digest. Any moral dilemmas are also presented front and center so that you know that now\'s the time to start philosophizing. By contrast, the themes in Vampire Princess Miyu\'s episodes are usually half buried; there will usually be a surface level moral, usually one that contextualizes the episode as a tragedy, but there will also be another way of viewing the events that reframes the themes or adds more depth to them, and it\'s not one that the show makes obvious. The episodes are ambiguous not because the plot is confusing, for what happens is apparent, but because they can be viewed from different angles. Perhaps the person you felt bad for because he suffered the tragedy wasn\'t as innocent as you thought.And that\'s why I didn\'t find the series as depressing as most other viewers. Overdone tragedy that\'s sad just for the sake of being sad doesn\'t actually make me sad. If that was the show\'s intention, I wouldn\'t like it very much. I think the core of each episode wasn\'t the tragic aspect of it, but the psychology of the victims of tragedy as well as how the supernatural elements mirrored their internal conflicts--- there are some aspects of Dante\'s Inferno going on here. Every tragic element added onto the end of each episode added to the psychological or thematic depth of the episode in a way that would not have been possible with a happy ending.Unless I\'m reading too much into it and the creators were really that simple minded. Fortunately, you don\'t have to take my word for it. I\'ve posted my thoughts on most of the episodes in the forums for this show so you can see for yourself if it\'s a case of the emperor\'s new clothes.But to give you a general idea of what this series is about for now, the pervading themes are loneliness, the burdens of adulthood, work culture, societal pressure, and the possessive nature of love, even though plot-wise most of the episodes have nothing to do with each other. It also talks a lot about destiny, which is almost always complete nonsense unless a story uses destiny to represent some overbearing force in life. My hypothesis is that it\'s using destiny to represent the inescapability of societal conformity, whether it be social status or work culture.My biggest problem with the series is actually what everyone else likes about the series; the overarching plot. It was too rushed and abrupt to accomplish much in the way of emotional or thematic resonance, which greatly hurt its character depth as well as my opinion of the series as a whole. It\'s as if all the pieces have been put into place, waiting for a bow to tie it all together, but instead the series crumbles along with its potential. Without a solid ending to contextualize them, the individual episodes feel much weaker. It feels like the themes are just there--- the human condition is observed but not commented on and not taken advantage of to develop the individual condition of Miyu. This weakness is especially glaring because unlike other shows like Mushishi, where the atmosphere is an experience in itself, Vampire Princess Miyu\'s modest art and animation as well as underwhelming fight sequences lower the value of the standalone episodes where the plot or themes might be lacking. What they should\'ve done was devote a little bit of time each episode to relate the cases back to something personal for Miyu so that she could develop slowly and build up to her momentous decision at the end of the series. Even Darker Than Black, a series also defined by great individual episodes but a poor ending, managed to do that.On the other hand, would this show have worked as a pure anthology series? I think that\'d be hard to pull off, because usually series like that have a more flavorful mix of tones and emotions along with strong visual presentation. With Mushishi, there is a mix of happy, sad, and bittersweet endings along with a neutral, relaxing atmosphere that\'s less emotionally taxing. Doing 26 episodes of dark psychological stuff means that the show would lack the variety necessary to keep viewers interested, even if the episodes have nice twists and psychological insights. It can still be a good show, but will strain to be a great one unless it executes itself with more panache.I haven\'t even talked about the characters yet (you can read the plot synopsis in the description), and that\'s because I view the recurring characters as mostly being facilitators for the episodic stories until the final slate of episodes when the overarching plot kicks in. Miyu\'s general archetype is the stoic, reserved girl with an angsty background in the same vein as Lain, but she adds nuance to this role with her dry, dark sense of humor and willingness to make friends. She\'s not shy or immune to the occasional smile. Her companion Shiina is the more lively complement to her reserved persona, forming a pair similar to Kino and Hermes. There\'s not much to Laava, her equally reserved, faithful bishounen servant. Miyu\'s trio of school girl friends are ostensibly there to fill the space, but their banter is natural and makes for some good exchanges. Most importantly, they\'re not high-pitched cutesy moeblobs, so they end up pretty likable. Unfortunately, the episodic plots end up overshadowing Miyu, whose detached demeanor makes for a weak presence. Seeing as how the show is called Vampire Princess Miyu, this is a bit of a problem--- one that is not successfully rectified by the last few episodes pertaining to the main story.The English dub for the main cast is fine. Miyu and her friends can come across as too monotone, which is fine most of the time but becomes a problem in scenes that call for more emotion, even if Miyu\'s personality is supposed to be demure. The Japanese dub maintains that lowkey quality but can also channel emotion without it being too stark of a contrast with the series\' usual tone.Speaking of the tone, what stood out to me was that though the content of the series readily makes for melodrama, the series consistently plays it cool, avoiding closeups of large tear drops, overly cutesified characters to evoke sympathy, and sentimental music. It\'s as if each tragedy is muted; it doesn\'t feel like a single, incredibly sad moment, but rather one that is woven into a deeper, permanent sadness pervading the entire series.This is reflected in the themes as well as the music by Kenji Kawai, unmistakably the best part of the series and what drew me into watching it in the first place. Despite having to accompany such depressing moments, it doesn\'t come off as edgy or maudlin. Having listened to most of his major works, I can say for certain that this OST is one of, if not the best, soundtracks Kawai has ever done, right up there with Moribito. It is the quintessential example of his style at its best, made possible by a shade of sadness rarely seen in anime.In summary, if you watch this show in a straightforward way, it\'s not going to be very impressive despite having some nice twists, because you\'d either hunger for a main storyline or get tired of repeated tragedy. But if you give it the benefit of the doubt and are willing to overthink a bit, most of the episodes are ambiguous enough to reward you with more subtle insights. As the series wore on I found myself having to rewatch episodes, not because I didn\'t know what happened, but because I didn\'t know what each episode was trying to say. It\'s not going to be anything ""deep"" but rather the act of interpreting each episode is interesting, even if I\'m reading things that might not be there. One thing I\'m definitely not overthinking is the last episode, which rivals the last episode of Eva in terms of being a puzzle box, and I\'d greatly appreciate it if anyone has any idea what it\'s saying in the end. Everyone says this show\'s outlook is stark black because it presents a dichotomy between death or living a life chained by destiny, but I seriously doubt anyone would actually propagate such a worldview in their story, or at least, not without some nuance to it.Ultimately, despite my high rating, I\'m still conflicted about whether or not it works as a whole, especially since the low production values and a lack of shine from Miyu herself put the burden on the story and themes to deliver the goods. human nature?Very well.Having seen many shows of a similar nature, I think it\'s one of the most successful examples of its type in large part due to its ambiguity.

I originally watched this show when I was in middle school towards the beginning of my anime obsession. This was back when I was unfamiliar with the medium, when the internet was still a baby, and I harbored an unhealthy obsession with vampires (pre-Twilight, of course). I was finding less-than-awesome shows such as Helsing, Trinity Blood, and Nightwalker to feed my lust for bloodsucking sexiness. This is when I watched the first few episodes of Vampire Princess Miyu. I rented the first two volumes from Blockbuster (already dating this story) and watched...them several times. Why write this review now? I just bought the newly rereleased box set of the show from Maiden Japan. Watching this show with my now matured view of anime and knowledge of the medium, I can now conclude that this show struggles to hold up through the times and has aged less than gracefully.First off, I feel it is necessary to address my issues with this new rerelease. The price is fair…I paid about 36 dollars for the full set which consists of 26 episodes. The cover art is nice…if not a little bland in colorization but fairly sell the show to the uninitiated. The way the discs are contained in the box is where the deal falls short. All five discs are pressed together onto one spindle which not only harbors the risk for scratches but makes it nearly impossible to remove the discs without forcible prying them apart to the point of snapping them in half. I have only encountered packaging this bad once before in my anime collection when I bought an old copy of Princess Tutu.Now that that is out of the way, let’s describe the show itself.Vampire Princess Miyu is about a vampire named Miyu who fights monsters called Shinma to protect the human race with the help of her companions Larva, a reformed shinma, and a cute rabbit-like creature named Kyubeast. If you missed anything in that description, it is repeated over each opening in dramatic narration. The show is largely episodic with a slight overarching plot regarding the less than interesting high school life of Miyu and her friends. There are few reappearing characters. Miyu and her fighting posse are in every episode and an ice spirit named Reiha is in a good handful of episodes.A first impression of this series when viewed by a veteran anime fan (and an observant new comer) is that the animation is…economic. It is apparent that the studio needed to make this show on the cheap as the viewer will lose count of how many times a character goes off model, Miyu speed lines into an enemy, and the characters don’t so much as walk but hover awkwardly while each of their legs appear in front of the other. Animation-wise, the show is a mess. Its old which may excuse a few aesthetic choices but few anime have aged so poorly. For example, Cowboy Bebop, a show which has aged extremely well, was aired a year after Vampire Princess Miyu. The art is a step above the animation. The character designs are distinct enough to stand out making each main character extremely recognizable. The scenery is colored to give the mood of foreboding and despair which is very fitting. The Shinma are each unique and distinct and it is always the highlight of each episode to see them transform into their monstrous forms.The worst aspect of the show I noticed as I watched, as someone who has viewed well over a hundred other anime series, is the dub. I chose to watch the entire show dubbed since I default to this option if it is available. With the exception of a few strong cameos, the voice cast seems to be suffering from a case of severe apathy. Miyu’s high school friends vocally express the emotional range of Velcro. There are some obviously bad moments such as when the tall friend and the friend with glasses come across a snake and are meant to scream which comes out as more of a quiet “ahh.” The worst offender is, perhaps, Miyu who is so prevalent in each episode. It seems, in my opinion, that the actress, Kimberly J. Brown (episodes 1-7) and Dorothy Elias-Fahn, understood her character as emotionless and cold which, in a way, is accurate. I have seen this character type portrayed before more effectively in Hell Girl. In this show, Brina Palencia plays the role of Ai Enma, a character very similar to Miyu in personality and in being a supernatural, immortal young girl. While Brina finds a way to make a whispery emotionless voice sound complex and threatening, Miyu’s actress makes her sound bored and seems to lack commitment. In each episode, for example, Miyu makes a speech to the Shinma she is about to vanquish where she shouts “into the darkness, Shinma!” Her victory speech ends with an awkward whisper of “shinma” which falls flat. Her speaking voice is even more unbearable as her monotone hearkens back to the voice of Daria without the sarcastic charm. The other characters are less than notable with the exception of Steve Blum who pops up once and a while and a few other actors well known for their older voice work. When the credits run after an episode, dub fans will note the lack of recognizable vocal talent which can be very telling. One may also notice that Miyu’s voice actress changed after the first 7 episodes, a fact which I didn’t realize until I check the show’s wiki page; another bad sign.After that rant, one may expect me to write this show off as a waste of time and not even salvageable through the lenses of nostalgia, however, there is an aspect of the show that may save it. The soundtrack. While many anime fans may not put so much stock in a soundtrack, that may be because, with some exception, anime is accompanied by instrumentation meant to support the action on the screen rather than stand on its own as a musical piece. The soundtrack from Vampire Princess Miyu is amazing. Each track is beautiful and fitting. The opening is unskippable and the ending gives the viewer a somber yet satisfying conclusion to their episodic adventure. In middle school my friend and I passed a copy of the soundtrack between us and each track is gorgeous. The orchestration is dramatic and lush and the vocals range from a slow pop ballad to a children’s choir. If anything, an anime fan should experience the soundtrack for themselves.In conclusion, avid fans of the vampire genre or nostalgic otaku looking for old fashioned animation and a dated dub track may want to look up Vampire Princess Miyu. The box set is on sale now for a fair price (with dreadful packaging). New anime fans should steer clear until they develop their genre preferences and decide they want to experience this bit of early anime. Hardcore otaku looking to experience all types of anime and wish to experience the evolution of anime to the present day would benefit if only to hear its fantastic soundtrack and yearn for the old days of full orchestration. them several times.

Many episodes of this TV take on Miyu are ""Shinma of the day"" setups where a random Shinma is manipulating a different human, Miyu senses its activity, she and Larva confront it and in many instances, tragic developments befall the Shinma\'s human victim. The Shinma cases for the TV anime are more on the dramatic side compared to the suspenseful horror of the 80s OVA adaptation. The setting and characters here also have their noticeable differences with Miyu being more reserved in personality and taking the guise of a middle school student, Larva being...able to talk and remove his mask and the two having a cuddly new companion named Shiina. I didn\'t have much problem with the changes to Miyu and Larva for the TV anime, though Shiina was more an annoyance than an interesting character as he didn\'t get any fleshing out and seemed to be around in the show\'s attempt to have some kind of cuddly mascot.For the most part, the ""Shinma of the day"" episodes don\'t do anything to advance the show\'s plot as many episodes were self-contained with their plots. The introduction of Reiha\'s character and a number of arcs seen in the show\'s second half help save the series from complete mediocrity as they help add more depth and dimension to aspects of Miyu\'s character and her conflicts. The mentioned ""Light of the Sea"" two-parter explores Larva\'s character with the life he led before meeting and becoming Miyu\'s partner. Reiha\'s character serves as a foil and rival to Miyu with their differing beliefs about hunting Shinma and the treatment of humans where their hostility towards one another increases greatly as the show progresses. The final six episodes are the high point of the series where events come to a head in Reiha and Miyu\'s rivalry, Miyu\'s past gets explored and some shocking events unfold involving one of the schoolgirls Miyu befriended from earlier in the series. Still for as much as these elements are engaging, the first half of the series is somewhat of a struggle to go through thanks to the ""Shinma of the day"" episodes and the series lacks a conclusion as Miyu is still fulfilling her duties as the Guardian by the end of the show.Visually, the Miyu TV anime sports nicely drawn scenery and character designs that have a great amount of detail to them and have subdued color tones to go along with the show\'s dramatic mood. However, the animation for the series is rather subpar with reused animation frames, still shots and speed stripes. The soundtrack did its part to enhance the drama of key scenes in the series, mixing dramatic and traditional musical pieces.Overall, the ""Shinma of the day"" really put a dent in the quality of this TV anime take on Vampire Princess Miyu. While the show does gradually improve in its second half when we start learning more about Larva and Miyu, the mentioned ""Shinma of the Day"" episodes seemed to drag the series out too much as Miyu TV would have been better either as a shorter series at 13 episodes or had more linear plot developments. While still engaging to watch, I\'d still find the 80s OVA to be better to watch in terms of length and story setup. able to talk and remove his mask and the two having a cuddly new companion named Shiina. I didn\'t have much problem with the changes to Miyu and Larva for the TV anime, though Shiina was more an annoyance than an interesting character as he didn\'t get any fleshing out and seemed to be around in the show\'s attempt to have some kind of cuddly mascot.For the most part, the ""Shinma of the day"" episodes don\'t do anything to advance the show\'s plot as many episodes were self-contained with their plots. The introduction of Reiha\'s character and a number of arcs seen in the show\'s second half help save the series from complete mediocrity as they help add more depth and dimension to aspects of Miyu\'s character and her conflicts.

While still engaging to watch, I\'d still find the 80s OVA to be better to watch in terms of length and story setup.', 'I\'ve talked about the vampiric Princess, Miyu, once before. About seven years ago. Like the OVA, this is from AIC. The same studio that brought us Blue Gender, Night Walker, & Bubblegum Crash to name a few. This series came out almost a decade after the OVA since that was late 80s and this was late 90s. But the important question is, does it maintain the same level of quality?Story:The narrative follows the same basic premise as the OVA. There are supernatural beasts called Shinma that feed off of humans. Fighting against these monsters is the Guardian, Miyu who uses her flames to send stray...Shinma back to the darkness. Each episode presents a different encounter with the Shinma.Honestly, that\'s the big weakness of the series. It was fine for the OVA to be somewhat ""monster of the week"" since it based its dramatic tension on the mysteries behind the scenarios and they were building up to something. This tries to do the same thing, but it doesn\'t work nearly as well when everything is stretched out over twenty six episodes and the bulk of them have little or nothing to do with the big finale. It also doesn\'t help that the only episodes strongly hinting at the turn for the finale come at the very end, shortly before the event itself.The mysteries also aren\'t as well handled. Yes, they can be interesting and the scenarios can be quite engaging. However, a big part of what made the OVA\'s mysteries work was having the outsider\'s perspective. This doesn\'t provide that. There is no equivalent for Himiko. The closest we get is a single episode that focuses on a young woman trying to hunt down a Shinma that killed her family. Which generally means the episodes that want to push the mystery aspect more will focus on an ordinary human who finds themselves targeted by some kind of Shinma and Miyu will appear largely in the background until the end where she confronts the Shinma.I will credit the series with being engaging. Even though the episodes are fairly formulaic, there\'s enough variation to keep the scenarios interesting. It\'s not one of those monster of the week series where nothing interesting happens. Or one of those ones that\'s full of pretentious nonsense juxtaposed against stupid shit like mecha pilots using DDR to sync their movements. It does help that there is a strong mystery element to some of the episodes. It also helps that the people being targeted are neither faceless parts of a crowd nor are they guaranteed safety.Characters:This is actually a bit improved over the OVA. The OVA gave us largely nothing characters with a few main characters who were worth mentioning. In this one, the side characters being targeted do tend to come across as complex and very human. Which makes the changes they undergo more disturbing and adds some investment to their fate. The major characters are still the most compelling. We even get some strong back stories for Miyu, Larva & the ice-powered Reiha in this one. It is also interesting to see Miyu & Reiha clash ideologically. There are some very strong interactions in this series in general. Which is a big factor in how it remains compelling in spite of following a monster of the week formula.The weak point is that some of the Shinma are just kind of dull. Some are well developed and have a strong sense of personality, but others are just kind of generic villains.One odd thing is that Miyu comes across as much more sullen and duty-driven in this one. In the OVA, she came across as more of a trickster figure. I kind of preferred the OVA version, but I can see why AIC considered this more suitable for a main character.Art:The art style does, generally, look pretty good. The Shinma have interesting designs. The backgrounds are nicely detailed. The action sequences are where the series falters a bit. One issue is that Miyu doesn\'t come across as all that capable. In a lot of her battles, she\'ll summon Larva to block attacks and weaken the enemy so she can deal the final blow with her flames. Which kind of creates the impression that she can\'t handle things on her own. The battles themselves aren\'t all that interesting to watch. There\'s strong build up to them, a well done reveal of the Shinma\'s true form and then the fights themselves are kind of short and one-sided.Sound:The acting is well done. They didn\'t get the same cast, but this did come nearly a decade later and the people they get do do a good job in their roles. Nagasawa Miki, Miki Shinichiro, Ogata Megumi & Shirakura Asa are all fine actors and their performances are definitely a strong point for the series. The music is very good. Kawai Kenji did a great job.Ho-yay:There\'s a bit in this one. There\'s an episode that deals with a doll maker that explicitly involves two women getting into each other. Larva also meets a man from his past who seems interested in him in more than a friendly way. Some of Miyu\'s interactions with women also come across as a little gay.Areas of Improvement:A stronger over-arcing plot. Yes, episodic anime are fine. But monster of the week series generally only work when they\'re made for children. Which, this isn\'t. I think it would really benefit from a more complete narrative.Start hinting at the twist early on. Not obvious things that you\'ll easily pick up on, but subtle hints that take on a new meaning in retrospect would work a treat.More effort in the action sequences. More physical clashing and varied use of powers would go a long way.Final Thoughts:I can\'t say I enjoyed this as much as I did the OVA. While the episodes are interesting and the characters are well constructed, the weak over-arcing narrative does hurt the series. It\'s still decent. If you liked the OVA and can look past the formulaic nature of the series you\'ll enjoy it. I\'m giving it a 6/10. Shinma back to the darkness.

It is more like a new story in each episode and some plot in it at some places. The art are good enough and sound not too bad. It focuses on this 2 main characters who is hunting down shiinma (some...kind of deamons let loose in the world) But the focus is on Japan. The enjoyment is for me not that i feel i would see it over again. But for some people may like it, couse if you like a bit horror style anime and demons and don't get bothered by the bit too long drag out it's an ok anime to watch. In my oppinion if i look back on the way the episodes are it would have been a realy cool game. And that is becouse in each episode it is like a boss in the ending. And when that is said one of the best things in this series for me was the boss like ending battles couse the demons in the series are creative designed and very cool done. All of them are different from eachother and at last for those who might want to test this anime out. Just to let you get a bit interested it is a very nice twist at the end, and that one i liked pretty much. kind of deamons let loose in the world) But the focus is on Japan.

I'd prefer it if it have more room to develop a bit more about Miyu's struggle throughout the series just like in the OVA rather than the episodic monster-of-the-day routine. It feels like a mixture between the popular series of that time: pokemon, the way the monster is presented, magical girl, the addition of a cute bunny-like magical creature and the big bow at the end of her attire.It gets boring at some point. Something that the OVA never does since the chore structure is on the character's arc. I believe the series is more oriented to be a horror...action anime whereas the OVA is more a drama horror anime. You should choose according to your preferences.

Deadman Wonderland,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6880/Deadman_Wonderland,"['Strange things can happen to a person when they\'re in prison so the general rules of thumb are to keep a low profile, stay out of the way of other people, and avoid dropping the soap in the shower. For the inmates of Japan\'s only privately owned prison (which for some reason is run as a theme park and is built on Ground Zero of the Great Tokyo Earthquake), the ablutive antics of their fellow ""guests"" are the least of their worries, especially when the warden takes the term ""punishment game"" to a whole new level. The stage is set. The ""Running Man"" style collars...are on. The next event is a lethal variation of Takeshi\'s Castle.Welcome to Deadman Wonderland.Based on the manga by Kataoka Jinsei (story), and Kondou Kazuma (art), the story begins with middle school student Igarashi Ganta, a fairly normal teenager with a reasonably mundane life - going to school, hanging out with friends, etc. All of that changes when his entire class are slaughtered while still in school, and as the only survivor he is found guilty of mass murder and sentenced to death. He is sent to Deadman Wonderland to wait out the time before his execution, but the powers that be in the prison have their eyes on Ganta so he must now navigate a labyrinth of conspiracies, greed, betrayal, murder, revolution, gladiatorial combat, and enough blood to make a clan of vampires drool.Which immediately brings up the first problem with this series.At its heart Deadman Wonderland is nothing more than a bloodier version of the common or garden shounen tale, but bolted onto the framework concept is a plot that has been worked over far too many times, so much so that it\'s highly predictable and almost barren of any original thought. Far too much importance has been placed on making the content ""cool"" in an effort to appeal to viewers who just want violence, blood and explosions, and with the added yet pointless melodramatic scenes designed to elicit audience sympathy, the storyline never really picks up enough narrative pace to maintain the viewer\'s interest. There are also a few critical errors that anyone with a basic understanding of investigative techniques would immediately spot and question, but we\'ll get to that in a bit.Now this may confuse some people because Deadman Wonderland does have a lot going on in each episode, so an explanation is probably in order. This anime uses an event driven plot rather than a character driven one, and because of that the protagonist and his fellow inmates are simply along for the ride. They become nothing more than reactionary elements in the storyline, and in an effort to compensate for that the author and his adaptation colleagues have thrown as many different ideas at the series as they could. In truth, the only thing holding the entire narrative together so that it could be considered a story instead of a collection of random events, is Ganta, which gives an idea of the scale of the problem.That said, Ganta isn\'t really terrible, but the nature of the plot ensures that his characterisation remains linear and one dimensional, and while it may appear to some that he matures as an individual, this is actually a forced measure that serves only one purpose - to make his win against the next big bad opponent a bit more believable. Unfortunately, Deadman Wonderland isn\'t really about developing the characters in any meaningful way, and this is borne out by the fact that the supporting cast only get a few paltry flashbacks even though some of them have a lasting effect on the storyline. The oddity is that probably the most intriguing character is Ganta\'s childhood friend Shiro, a resident of Deadman Wonderland who isn\'t a prisoner. She is an anomaly who appears to have a childlike personality, but her very presence in the storyline, together with her looks, is enough to set alarm bells ringing for anyone who knows the trope about mysterious white haired characters.Given that this is an adaptation of a manga there\'s automatically a severe limitation placed on design, but Manglobe have done their best with what has been given to them, and the results are actually pretty good. The animation is smooth and there are some nice visual effects scattered throughout the series, the character movements are fluid and have a natural feel, and the action set pieces have a visceral edge to them that the manga lacks. There are a few issues though, but these lie in the smaller details as there are some design influences from other works (Ganta\'s likeness to Renton Thurston from Eureka 7, which is also a work by the Kataoka and Kondou). In addition to this, there\'s a tendency to fall back on certain stereotypes (the rather obvious musclebound oaf who likes nothing more than fighting strong opponents), which isn\'t necessarily a bad thing, but it can get tedious to see certain character archetypes all the time. Thankfully these niggles aren\'t really enough to prevent viewers from enjoying the series, especially if one is able to move past the rather slapdash storyline.Seriously, would it kill anyone to use some real world stereotypes, maybe something like the bad tempered little guy who doesn\'t know how to fight properly but makes up for it in sheer ferocity?Deadman Wonderland has a rather eclectic variety of background music on offer that ranges from dramatic heavy metal blended with techno, to a few simple notes played on a piano. The quality of the audio, both the music and the effects, is surprisingly good, and the choreography shows that some thought has gone into the implementation and timing of each track. The opening theme is a heavy metal piece called One Reason by DWB (featuring Fade), that has been set to a well designed sequence that utilises a three colour base, in this case red, white and black. The end credits feature a slow moving ferris wheel accompanied by images of many of the characters from their lives before they became inmates of Deadman Wonderland, all set to the tune of Shiny Shiny by NIRGILIS.To be perfectly honest, this anime doesn\'t really test the abilities of Paku Romi (Ganta), Hanazawa Kana (Shiro), or any of the other cast members to any great degree, but part of that is due to a relatively lackadaisical script. The dialogue lacks a degree of intuitiveness that can make conversations seem forced, and while the cast are capable seiyuu in their own right, they seem to struggle with several scenes in an effort to get the emotion across to the viewer. It\'s never a good thing when an actor or actress tries too hard, and this fact is borne out during a number of conversations in the series.But then, that\'s pretty much the story of Deadman Wonderland - it tries too hard.On the surface this appears to be a rather slick production with some high quality audio and visuals, but no amount of beautification can hide a plot that is more focused on currying favour with audiences than it is with actually telling a story. The narrative can often seem like a train wreck (i.e. bits flying off everywhere, people screaming and running for cover, etc), as many of the plot elements have simply been attached without any real thought given to integrating them into the story proper, and this is why many events can feel like they\'re nothing more than fillers. In addition to this, the idea of weaponizing blood isn\'t actually new as Wei Zhijun from Darker Than Black can blow things up using his blood, while Saya from Blood + must use hers to kill Chiropterans.That said, one has to remember that the story itself is incomplete as this is only an adaptation of the manga up to a point, and this is one of the reasons why there are inherent issues that have yet to be resolved. Unfortunately that excuse cannot cover certain flaws that really do stand out, the chief among them being Ganta\'s conviction. The series makes a point of showing a confession by him and this is given as proof of his guilt, but what happened to all the witness statements? What about the forensic evidence like the direction in which the windows exploded, or the angle of the attacks on the classroom? While the viewer clearly knows that Ganta is innocent, the apparent ease of his conviction is dependent on his confession, but nothing is mentioned about the physical evidence from the scene of the crime.Deadman Wonderland looks and sounds great, and if all you\'re after is a series that has lots of violence, blood, weird characters and a storyline that requires you disengage your brain, then this may be for you. The series may have it\'s problems, but the concept is interesting even if the implementation leaves a lot to be desired, and it does retain a degree of entertainment value for its action set pieces.In essence though, Deadman Wonderland is nothing more than a potato that has been painted by Michaelangelo - it looks stunning, but it\'s still just a potato. are on.

While the viewer clearly knows that Ganta is innocent, the apparent ease of his conviction is dependent on his confession, but nothing is mentioned about the physical evidence from the scene of the crime.Deadman Wonderland looks and sounds great, and if all you\'re after is a series that has lots of violence, blood, weird characters and a storyline that requires you disengage your brain, then this may be for you. The series may have it\'s problems, but the concept is interesting even if the implementation leaves a lot to be desired, and it does retain a degree of entertainment value for its action set pieces.In essence though, Deadman Wonderland is nothing more than a potato that has been painted by Michaelangelo - it looks stunning, but it\'s still just a potato.', ""There was a trend back in the Good Old Days of anime (as in you only thought they were Good because you weren't Old enough to know any better) of hyper violent OVAs. Deadman Wonderland feels like a tread back to those days. It has the over-exaggerated violence, the ridiculous amounts of blood, the awkwardly crowbarred in sexiness and, most noticeably of all, it’s utterly shit.Time has changed a few little aspects though. The OVA market of old has turned into the late night 12 episode anime series of today. This means it has more space to tell a coherent and fulfilling story, a capability...which Deadman Wonderland approaches by totally ignoring it. 12 episodes are enough to tell a neat story with a beginning, middle and end. It gets the beginning right, tossing our protagonist into a scenario in which society have become so totally ignorant of the prison sector, so that even when hell is being created right in front of their eyes, they think it’s an elaborate piece of CGI.However, upon reaching the 'middle' segment, Deadman Wonderland tosses that whole story aside and becomes about super powers. Instead of developing the characters introduced in the beginning, it decides to quadruple the size of the cast, each and every single one having a hastily constructed backstory introduced right in the middle of a fight to the death that ends up having either little or no relevance to the actual battle happening in the present day. Neither does Deadman Wonderland get the 'end' part right either. This is partly due to the fact this is an ongoing manga, but plenty of other adaptations of ongoing manga have managed to construct some sort of conclusion in their respective stories. Usually this is in the form of the main character growing and learning something (see Arakawa, Spice and Wolf or Genshiken), which Deadman Wonderland tries to do, but royally cocks up because the main character has fuck all personality.Yes, this is something else that comes with modernity. Instead of the macho men that spout 'witty' quips like they're in an American first person shooter game (that is, when they ever talk at all), Deadman Wonderland sports a bland spineless teenage boy as its main character. To be fair to Ganta, he does actually do something other than make reaction noises while other characters monologue exposition at him, as is the trend in certain other modern day anime. He reacts to situations by either whining, crying or sobbing. It really isn't much of a personality, as any bland male would react to the cartoonish level of hell that exists in that prison in a similar fashion, and he really has nothing beyond that. There is chance for him to grow into a hero, and Deadman Wonderland tried to do that. Other characters would spout lines as to how much he's grown a spine and standing up for himself, but I failed to see that myself. He started off as a crybaby who could shoot off magical blood bullets when he felt threatened. By the end, he was a crybaby who shot off magical blood bullets when he felt threatened, except this time he could shoot off his magical blood bullets even faster than before. That's not character development! That's like saying a character has developed because he is now slightly better at picking his nose.Another thing the late night 12 episode anime has changed from the hyper violent OVAs of old is, now that they're on TV, they need to be censored. I can't really criticise Deadman Wonderland for this though, which is a shame because it's a really easy target. The gun that shot black balls of censorship through people’s chests was one of the most unintentionally hilarious things I've seen all year. But if you were to watch the dvd release, the censorship would (presumably) be removed. It would be like criticising it for the screen being upside down because you watched it while standing on your head. It's not the anime's fault you watched it that way. But the fact that it needed the level of censorship it has tells us how much blood and gore there is. Often the gore has no point other than to show how sadistic the anime is. It's really just repulsive and juvenile, like a child who tries to show everyone what a big man he is by killing the class rabbit.Deadman Wonderland is like a modern day MD Geist. It's aggressively stupid and only appeals to those teenagers and manchildren who think sheer bloody mindedness is what is required to make something cool. People might defend this by saying a hyper violent anime is preferable to the insipid harem moe nonsense of the modern era, which is a load of cowpat. They are both as brainless as each other, just appealing to different sorts of immature mindsets. If you gave me a choice between Deadman Wonderland or, say, Fortune Arterial, I'd instead choose repeatedly slamming my fingers in a car door. which Deadman Wonderland approaches by totally ignoring it. 12 episodes are enough to tell a neat story with a beginning, middle and end.

Obviously, not everything is going to be resolved at the end of the anime because the manga has 45 chapters and the anime is only 12 episodes. That being said, I think the anime did a pretty good job in adapting the manga and you should read the manga after (or before) watching the anime.Story - (8)As you know, Deadman Wonderland is about Ganta, a boy who is framed for the murder of his friends and sent...to a privately owned prison. Shortly after arriving in Deadman Wonderland, Ganta discovers he can use his blood as a weapon. He is then sent to G-Block (where all the other Deadmen are) and the story begins.Since the anime is only 12 episodes, we only get to see the first arc, which is fine. In terms of plot, we don't get to see the start of the main storyline. The first half of the anime is getting introduced to Deadman Wonderland and the second half Ganta teams up with Owl. Most of the questions that are introduced such as the Mother Goose System, the Red Man, and Makina (lady in charge of the prison guard) trying to discover what's going on, while explored, aren't resolved. This leaves people with the sense that the plot was cheap and incomplete, but there are 45 manga chapters and the anime only got to chapter 20.note: if you want to read the manga, don't start on chapter 20 because the anime left out a chunk of main characters and some events happen in a different order.Characters - (7)Character wise, Deadman Wonderland was just okay. 12 epiosdes wasn't enough time to introduce everyone, so they left out some pretty important characters. I don't really mind that because we are already introduced to a lot of characters and more would just give less screen time all around (and they were irrelevant to the Owl arc). Even though they left out some characters, the only two characters to receive a decent amount of screen time are Ganta and Shiro. If you want more info on Crow, Hummingbird, etc. read the manga, they get a lot more development. The other problem people have with the characters is that a lot of them are introduced, then die in an episode or two, which leaves no impact on the audience. While this is somewhat true, it shouldn't stop you from enjoying the main cast.Ganta → after 12 episodes, he showed a little bit of growth. He starts off as shy and wimpy. He needs Shiro to protect him in the prison. He's just average intelligence, overall a pretty normal character. He does notice how weak he is and tries to get stronger, so he's not useless the entire time. He cares for Shiro and hates the Red Man.Shiro → She's lived at Deadman Wonderland Prison her whole life and she's shrouded in mystery as to why.  She is pretty dumb, but saves Ganta a lot. We get to know more about her past and why she's in DW and can basically do whatever she wants, but I'll let you watch that.Art / Animation - (8)It's pretty dark in the depths of the prison and the scenes that are mysterious. The prison itself is very bright and shiny, which fits the show because Deadman Wonderland Prison needs to give the appearance of being a nice prison. The character designs were faithful to the manga and looked good, with the exception of Crow, I thought Crow looked better in the manga, might just be me though. Animation wise, everything seemed pretty fluid, I didn't notice any poor animation.Sound - (8)The opening and ending were pretty good, but I don't really listen to them (sorry). Background music was also fitting. Acting wise, I thought Ganta and Shiro's voices were perfect and really fit them. Everyone else didn't really have a whole lot of lines, but they did a good job. The only voice I didn't like was Toto Sakigami's voice...he sounded kinda like a woman, but he's really only introduced so I don't really care.Overall - (8)It's does a good job of introducing us to the manga, even though some characters were ignored and events were re-ordered. The door is still open for a second season, which  I hope it gets because the real story was just beginning. If you want a gory show with plenty of death, Deadman Wonderland is for you.

He is forced to fight, and discovers he has a mysterious, hidden power. Over the course of the show, he learns to control that power.You can put your hand down now.While the story to Deadman Wonderland is, of course, not going to be winning any awards, it still does make an attempt at telling it. The entirety of the plot revolves around the many characters in the infamous Deadman Wonderland prison, a place where...you can trust no-one, where death roams around every corner and ironically, where the people are very boring. If I had a dollar for every character in this show with a tacked-on, forced, and extremely underdeveloped back-story, I would have enough cash to supply the pen and paper to write better ones. Even Senji Kiyomasa (The Crow), a character that got an entire OVA post-season, feels underdeveloped. I do not care for any of these people, and most importantly, don't like these people. It's amazing that a series like this with such a long list of characters manages to fail to capture my interest. I recommend that you tune in for the fights and the plot developments, and tune out during the back-story segments.The first episode starts off like an episode of the 1990's American television show, Goosebumps. A generic high school boy named Ganta is thrown into an absurd, nightmare-esque situation where every person in his class is killed violently in a mass murder by a figure affectionately nicknamed by him as ''The Red Man''. Being the only survivor, the police officers and detectives put their brilliant minds together to come to the conclusion that Ganta killed everyone, based on the evidence of being the only person found alive. Terrific. The only apparent evidence suggesting he did it is a 30 second recording of him laughing off the murders as nothing. This hardly believable work of CGI is the only piece linking him to the murderer, and suddenly, it's off to prison, on a death sentence. Super.Once there, he learns of the dark secret behind the prison. Morals go out the window as Ganta is forced to participate in childish games to survive. Apparently this is still an episode of Goosebumps. He forms a close friendship with a creepy, pale girl named Rei, uh, I mean Shiro. Stuff happens. People die. Shinji, no... Ganta does a complete 180° in character development, and by the finale of the season, he is back to a snivelling, pathetic mess. We are introduced to characters who get killed off episodes later, with no back-story. At all. The show is an under-cooked mess, and as for the ending, disappointing.The art was handled by Manglobe, the animators for The World God Only Knows, and Samurai Champloo. The art style is very reminiscent of their work on Ergo Proxy. Nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done. The animation in the opening, especially some of Shiro's segments, is pretty neat. The art is uncomfortably inconsistent, often very lazy during the dialogue and slower scenes, and well done during the action scenes. At least it's not the other way around.The sound is nothing special. Overused, cliché blood splatters and other shock-value sound effects are rife throughout the season. The opening song is a very cheesy and teenage hard rock number, which ultimately got on my nerves on the mere second viewing. The closing however, is something else. A gorgeous song that invokes some powerful and melancholy emotions about life before Ganta was forced into the prison. The background music throughout the series is fairly forgettable, excepting a bittersweet piano melody that I heard often during the slower scenes. Regardless of that, nothing outstanding.Overall, if you desire to watch it, watch it. It's an incredibly average story, with many flat, bland characters (excluding Shiro, the only character in the entire season who I was genuinely infatuated with. She is very reminiscent of Lucy from Elfen Lied).  Don't take this show seriously. It's zany, heavily-stylised, nonsensical and very gory. It relies on basic shock-value and gross-out moments to capture the audience's attention, but ultimately, comes across as childish and edgy. They are a few moments that made me smile, though. Just know, if you're not planning to watch it, you're not missing out on anything special. If you did enjoy it, hope you like waiting for season two.

While the series has an interesting concept, and a great deal of shock value, it falls flat on execution.Our story involves around Ganta, a typically middle school kid who is framed for the murder of his classmates, who were really killed by what he refers to as ""The Red Man"". He gets sent to a private prison known as ""Deadman Wonderland"", which is more like a gladiator holding place than a prison. His goal is to find the...Red Man and kill him. Oh, he also gets this weird blood power which allows him to use his own blood as a weapon.The main issue with the show are the characters. Ganta is a kid in a brutal world, but he does not show any real growth at all. Shiro on the other hand is more like a flaw to Deadman Wonderland itself. Her upbeat and rather innocent personality almost represents hope in the show.Besides Ganta and Shiro there are not many characters worth mentioning. Crow, is probably the coolest character in the show, but only gets a side character spot.Another problem is that the pacing seems off. There are a few pick me up moments near the start of the show where the viewer can latch onto and think there\'s hope, but those are totally gone as the show progresses and it basically turns into a suffering with the main character ordeal. On top of this, the closing episodes reveal several things that are never resolved (but does leave room for a second season)The art and sound are good. Maybe not the greatest ever, but not distracting at all. Voice acting is fine too, I can\'t really think of a character whose voice annoyed me. There is one character, Mockingbird, whose voice is questionable, but you only see him a few times.This is a series that will probably hook you after the first couple of episodes and drag you into it and then you\'ll be more or less obliged to complete it. Deadman wonderland is not a terrible show, but offers little in the way of substance. It\'s just lifeless. Red Man and kill him.

It\'s just lifeless.', ""I really want to like this show, i've made every effort to enjoy this show, but i can't quite bring myself to recommend it.Deadman Wonderland is the story of Ganta, a young man sharing a staggering resemblance to Eureka Seven's Renton (same mangaka) who is wrongly imprisoned in the futuristic Deadman Wonderland, a theme park were the convicts serve as the attractions.The first thing that became apparent is that 12 episodes was never going to be enough screen time to do this show justice. The first few episodes drive us through the series of event's that lead us to Ganta's imprisonment, now i personally...had wrongly assumed the wonderland would be a dark and dreary affair, initially this is not the case, the prison is futuristic in appearance, lots of shiny scientific looking facility's and park itself looks like an amusement park all bright and cheery. We're introduced to the idea that the convicts are given a battle royal style neckband which will deal them a lethal dose of poison should they not take the antidote candy every 3 days, these candy's can be earned via participation is the wonderlands various death themed activity's, i would have assumed this to be the basis of the show, as we're introduced and grow to know and appreciate the cast and the environment.Sadly not to be, Ganta (far to) quickly discovers he had some strange new powers and is declared a Deadman and moved to G block, the dark drab place i was expecting from the beginning, and all the stuff about antidote candy and the rest of the park is forgotten, now i've not seen Ganta consume any more candy, i''ve lost track as to if only 3 days are supposed to have past over the course of the entire show, or if it's a highlight real of months, and they just got bored with the idea? Never really touched on again, so thanks for that.The show then drives us head long into the Deadman universe, as quickly as possible attempting to introduce us to the Deadmen (those with similar powers to Ginta) through altercations with Ganta and then the Undertakers, a Bleach Captain styled band of throw away Nemesis's for the Deadmen.The whole thing never really has a chance to catch it's breath and never really shows us enough interaction or actual screen time for the various characters to give them any depth or real significance in the show. By the 10th episode we've still got the major character's such as Crow refusing to assist poor Ganta, and rightly so, they've met exactly 3 times ever.I'm at a loss of what to say about the characters, Ganta's kinda pathetic throughout and plenty whiny, and just doesn't get the time to grow, Shiro's random switches between psychotic and adorable are fun and all, and the various Deadmen we've seen so far have all been pretty cool, in the 10 minutes or so screen time they've had to share with god knows how many throw away characters, all of the under takers seem pretty cliched, but what can you do. I'd honestly say the cast has allot of potential, but your certainly not going to see any of it realised, if this is the first and last season.The art and sound, are really good, i love the opening, and this was most of the reason i started the show, i was intrigued by the opening sequence, and it perfectly sets the tone. No complaints on the voice acting, i thought Kana Hanazawa did a stand out job as Shiro, nailed the character for me. Art although not setting any new ground, is all high end, and i suppose is the up side to such a short show, i'm not going to go crazy over it though, i've no doubt it's the main reason this show still average's an 8+ rating while genuinely good shows like Fairy Tail sat below the 8.0 mark for months and months.Enjoyment wise, i just expect more from a modern show, the bar has been set really high, by the popular shounen crop of recent years, and this hasn't got there. I really wanted to like this show, my intrigue lasted a good few episodes, before i finally realised no significant ground was ever going to be covered. It's by no means a bad show, but it's one that needed to spend longer setting up the atmosphere and building up some suspense.In conclusion the manga folks really should have held out for a better adaptation offer, this has by no means done justice to what i'm sure was good material. had wrongly assumed the wonderland would be a dark and dreary affair, initially this is not the case, the prison is futuristic in appearance, lots of shiny scientific looking facility's and park itself looks like an amusement park all bright and cheery. We're introduced to the idea that the convicts are given a battle royal style neckband which will deal them a lethal dose of poison should they not take the antidote candy every 3 days, these candy's can be earned via participation is the wonderlands various death themed activity's, i would have assumed this to be the basis of the show, as we're introduced and grow to know and appreciate the cast and the environment.Sadly not to be, Ganta (far to) quickly discovers he had some strange new powers and is declared a Deadman and moved to G block, the dark drab place i was expecting from the beginning, and all the stuff about antidote candy and the rest of the park is forgotten, now i've not seen Ganta consume any more candy, i''ve lost track as to if only 3 days are supposed to have past over the course of the entire show, or if it's a highlight real of months, and they just got bored with the idea? Never really touched on again, so thanks for that.The show then drives us head long into the Deadman universe, as quickly as possible attempting to introduce us to the Deadmen (those with similar powers to Ginta) through altercations with Ganta and then the Undertakers, a Bleach Captain styled band of throw away Nemesis's for the Deadmen.The whole thing never really has a chance to catch it's breath and never really shows us enough interaction or actual screen time for the various characters to give them any depth or real significance in the show. By the 10th episode we've still got the major character's such as Crow refusing to assist poor Ganta, and rightly so, they've met exactly 3 times ever.I'm at a loss of what to say about the characters, Ganta's kinda pathetic throughout and plenty whiny, and just doesn't get the time to grow, Shiro's random switches between psychotic and adorable are fun and all, and the various Deadmen we've seen so far have all been pretty cool, in the 10 minutes or so screen time they've had to share with god knows how many throw away characters, all of the under takers seem pretty cliched, but what can you do. I'd honestly say the cast has allot of potential, but your certainly not going to see any of it realised, if this is the first and last season.The art and sound, are really good, i love the opening, and this was most of the reason i started the show, i was intrigued by the opening sequence, and it perfectly sets the tone. No complaints on the voice acting, i thought Kana Hanazawa did a stand out job as Shiro, nailed the character for me. Art although not setting any new ground, is all high end, and i suppose is the up side to such a short show, i'm not going to go crazy over it though, i've no doubt it's the main reason this show still average's an 8+ rating while genuinely good shows like Fairy Tail sat below the 8.0 mark for months and months.Enjoyment wise, i just expect more from a modern show, the bar has been set really high, by the popular shounen crop of recent years, and this hasn't got there. I really wanted to like this show, my intrigue lasted a good few episodes, before i finally realised no significant ground was ever going to be covered.

Typically when I find something that I think that I will dislike I will drop it after giving it a shot once I\'m sure there\'s nothing I\'ll enjoy. However, when something is so bad that I am stupified at how many flaws I find in the writing of the show and how poor the characters are in terms of consistency, I somehow enjoy how much I can hate the show in question while watching it. This is somewhat of a disclaimer to say, that unlike most people, I didn\'t watch the series to enjoy any of its positives, but enjoy ragging on...its negatives. Which might kill some of my credibility since I don\'t find credibility in a wholly negative or positive review for anything, and might\'ve made me oblivious to the strong points of the series. I will attempt to find some positives in the series, regardless, but I could simply be oblivious to some of them due to how much of a bad experience the show was.Deadman Wonderland is a good choice for you if you\'re looking for edgy fun and if you\'re the kind of person, like me, that enjoys observing the peak of how atrocious the writing of a show can be. However, it\'s a bad choice if you can\'t ignore the flaws and inconsistencies in the writing of a show, because there\'s just so many of them.As an action series, Deadman Wonderland looks good because of its good production values. As a matter of fact, the good production is what did not make the series a complete botch, since I kinda enjoyed its soundtrack. However, as far what happens in the action bits, there\'s not a lot of meat to go around, with the battles being very one sided towards a certain group unless the character gets a powerup. They are either meant to express gore, or they\'re meant to express certain shounen-isms. I know the show doesn\'t have the shounen tag, but the manga is tagged with all the tags this was supposed to be. I\'ll list them all as I review the series, so no need to check the manga. The shounen-isms I talk about are ""I GOTTA USE ALL MY POWER TO PROTECT MUH FRENS"" and ""I CAN BE STRONG TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!"". However they are not implemented well and they\'re often nonsensical to happen and they feel like a writing asspull, often seeming just like the writing got pushed into a corner and then ""wait this needs to happen ugh this character can bleed at supersonic speed now hahaha"". There\'s just a lot of things that adapt to the convenience of the plot as the series goes on, and as a result of such, random power-ups, or specific characters get depowered, with often not as much as an explanation. The supersonic thing ain\'t a joke, characters need to use their power at that speed so they will not be deactivated by certain weapons. Powers which could\'ve been used at previous points in the series to obtain a different result. And characters that are clearly stronger throwing the fight because... yeah, I guess, right?As far as the gore goes, well... silly you would ask, eh... hmm, uh heh... it\'s censored. And it\'s censored because there was never a release of Deadman Wonderland that would be uncensored outside of Japan. For what it\'s worth, the censorship doesn\'t really make things unable to be misinterpreted, but...You might wonder why would a series that is considered horror be shipped as horror and be censored, since that is a clearly bad choice for anything in the horror genre. I mean shock value is important in a horror series, as you need to be unnerved to be scared. That\'s because this series isn\'t actually a horror series. Its writing doesn\'t really present anything that should be horror outside of the gore. The characters don\'t act any bit more terrified than characters from other shounens, there isn\'t really any torment inflicted on the main character other than that required for him to get into the circumstances of the plot. Any emotional damage he should\'ve received is just dulled away to the point where he has a stronger reaction and impact to a person losing his eye than his entire class and his two best friends being killed in front of him. Honestly, the only thing I can see this series is as edgy, rather than horror, because it presents a lot of gore and none of the tension to back it up, where you are constantly in danger, simply because the writing is just awful and the main character doesn\'t suffer any real consequence, emotional or physical. He\'s as much a shounen protagonist as a protagonist can be.One of the genres that the tags are missing on the anime release is the shounen tag. The series has generic shounen tropes such as ""the power of friendship and its value"", ""I can do it if I try, and that gives me a power-up."", ""A weak boy who powers up as the series goes on because of his friends"" and other such shounen things. I doubt anyone would argue it\'s a shounen and there isn\'t really anything to criticize in a show because it\'s a shounen, other than it being genericly shounen. However, why would you be a horror shounen? Why would the power of friendship and being determined matter when you\'re supposed to be in a situation where you\'re supposed to be horrified. Why wouldn\'t you use his friends being fucked over, since they\'re there, to torture Ganta, to express fear and terror through him in the series? Again, because this is a shounen, and this limits your capability to do the same things a horror series would normally do, which are the opposite of determination in the face of adversity, that being desperation. Thanks for airing in Shounen Ace, Deadman Wonderland. What a scary thought. Ganta has friends and people he isn\'t close to, die. As long as he gets over his bests friends dying at the start of the series.The Sci-fi tag on the series is right, however, but not every element of the series is science fiction. In order to not mislead you, the cause of the powers is not explained by science and while the technology such as robots and lasers are present in Deadman Wonderland, the characters have the power manipulate blood due to ""blood holes"" which are basically red black holes. There might be a scientific explanation for the powers, however, it does behave very much like a supernatural series. Science fiction series tend to have some sort of pseudo science explanation that kinda limits the amount of bullshit they can use since they have rules. But Deadman Wonderland has no rules, so it can bullshit whenever. So note that the series is not only sci-fi, but supernatural.  The sci-fi plays very little into it, and for the most part the powers are strictly supernatural, with some pseudo science applied around it.The most important and last tag of Deadman Wonderland is drama, which is a missing tag for the anime. The drama is undoubtfully the thing is the most atrocious about the series. In order to give you an example of how bad the drama is built into the show, I\'ll give you the series premise as an example. Ganta is a character who is falsely accused and brought into a prison on ""death"" row. Ganta has witnessed the death of his entire class and his two best friends. Now after such a traumatic event, you would expect the character would have some form of emotional distress but Ganta almost vomits once from shock and like, is a little sad for a while, then he shounens it up and decides ""I WANT TO LIVE BECAUSE...???"" and afterwards once more characters are introduced he is like ""MUH FRENS ARE IMPORTANT"". Now you need to understand, that Ganta, moves on from one of the most traumatic events a person can experience, then after he is falsely accused he is moved in a place where he is treat like utter dogshit and death is often an option. And then he moves on. Like it\'s nothing. He gets a little beat up and then he gets a power and suddenly, even though it hardly mattered even before moved on, now he acts almost constantly fine. The biggest consequence on Ganta after experiencing this tragedy is that he wants to kill the person that commited the act. After witnessing a tragedy, he is placed in a place where he is constant danger... and then he moves on without any reason than he wants to live... Even before this, he seems to be more pissed off at the idea he was flasely accused than his friends dying, since he barely shows any emotion in regards to what happened to them.Why would he just suddenly want to live? I mean, your friends are dead, you saw them murdered, everyone thinks you did it, you\'re likely gonna be killed and tortured. Wouldn\'t you at least be depressed? Wouldn\'t you at least be angry and constantly showing a lot of emotion or simply just shut yourself off? Or would you act like a teenager of who\'s dog died? Be a little sad and then be like, yeah okay. His portrayal is so horrible that his personality and behaviour is almost a joke. There is no way anyone would act the way he does after experiencing the events he had. And Ganta is just one example out of many. For the sake of not spoiling any plot threads from the series I won\'t go into detail about anyone else, however, in order to dramatize the series, the show often does flashbacks to show us why x character is fucked up and behaves that way. Which is pointless when the character barely has plot relevance and you\'re not really gonna bring up again. I mean, the series seems to have ended in a way that pretty would guarantee a second season... but none was made. So a lot of characters that got focus could\'ve been intended to have had an actual role in the future of the series. But the role they had so far, they almost felt like throwaways, that once they ever done with, they were just to be discarded and never to be looked at again. For a series that aspires to be a drama, that\'s really bad.The story is pretty much an excuse to bring edginess at every point. The characters are either forced to compete in death games in the amusement park so they can survive or they are forced to fight each other and the loser will lose an organ. It tries to make us understand why the people went insane and behaved that way, but really, they\'re that way just to be edgy. The series doesn\'t have any other point a shounen wouldn\'t have, mostly bringing up that kindness and friendship is important. It isn\'t unique in term of message and theme, and just tries to feature people that went insane because of trauma, with a protagonist that was oblivious to all of it. The characters more often than not experience a form of insanity that makes them want to kill stuff and be edgy and then all of a sudden, they\'re sane enough to have their behaviour change. These violent mood swings were ridiculous to see as the characters are poorly executed, the story had a really generic point in a setting that shouldn\'t even make it with a lot of inconsistencies in the mix to be added and logic gaps.For instance, how would a teenager who was injured enough to be hospitalized, be capable of hiding a weapon that was strong enough to cause an explosion in a classroom. Even with his confession, that shouldn\'t be enough to jail him as he was physically incapable of executing the course of the action described. Also why would the warden of a jail be allowed, the jail he was sent to, be able to act out as his lawyer? Why would a prison have to undergo a people\'s rights inspection, when people come out for entertainment there and prisoners definitely don\'t seem to have their rights respected there, as they are used for the entertainment of others at the price of their safety? Now their safety matters? And there\'s more and more and more that I could just list but I think I made my point.As I\'ve said at the start of the review, it\'s got good production values. Except for the censorship that filthy westerners deserve, the series has solid animation. What I especially in Deadman Wonderland was the soundtrack. despite the E D G E lyrics of the OP, it\'s got some really good sounding rock pieces.The only factors I can recommend this series on are the E D G E factor. And the fact that you might be capable of consuming it in the same way as me, and that is enjoying the series for its abundance in flaws. There\'s no other factor I can recommend it on. Steer clear if anything I described is below your standards. I mean look, edgy stuff can be entertaining, I watched series  because I considered edgy but, I liked them in the context where they either didn\'t try to explain themselves, or at least they were plausible to some extent. But in Deadman Wonderland\'s case it even seems unaware of what it\'s doing. So yeah. Have fun. its negatives. Which might kill some of my credibility since I don\'t find credibility in a wholly negative or positive review for anything, and might\'ve made me oblivious to the strong points of the series. I will attempt to find some positives in the series, regardless, but I could simply be oblivious to some of them due to how much of a bad experience the show was.Deadman Wonderland is a good choice for you if you\'re looking for edgy fun and if you\'re the kind of person, like me, that enjoys observing the peak of how atrocious the writing of a show can be.

Have fun.', ""Have you ever been framed for something that you believed you wouldn't have the capacity to do, and were punished for it? That unlucky scenario is shared by Ganta, the protagonist of the 2011 anime Deadman Wonderland. Deadman Wonderland revolves around the horrifying trials Ganta has to go through after he is sent to a prison camp sharing the title of the anime. The themes used in this anime include finding hope in a hopeless situation, and moving on from your past.Story: 5 – The story of Deadman Wonderland primarily revolves around the main protagonist Ganta, and the many horrible things that occur in...Deadman Wonderland. The story relies on blood, insanity, and intense moments to keep itself going, leaving proper story-telling at a bare minimum. As you can tell by the synopsis, the story concept (deathmatches) isn’t very original either, and often comes off as cliche. The anime switches its focus around 3/5ths into the series, but the speedy pacing and lack of originality leave the audience unable to properly settle into the show. As with other shounen anime, dues ex machina and plot armor take full effect in Deadman Wonderland, rendering life/death situations trite and unnecessary. Due to the show’s cancellation, the show remains unfinished and so the ending suffers as a result. Deadman Wonderland doesn't appear to run on story, instead running on finding different ways of torturing the characters involved in it.Art: 7 – The production studio responsible for this series, Manglobe, are also responsible for shows such as Ergo Proxy, and Samurai Champloo. The character designs are slightly bland, excluding Shiro’s design which symbolizes her strange appearances on the show. The art used in this show is somewhat dull and colorless, clearly emphasizing the color red. The animation is somewhat above average, and is especially evident during the battle sequences. Overall, despite the good animation, the art department takes a hit for its general blandness.Sound: 7 – The opening song used for the anime , “One Reason”, is a medium-paced hard rocking piece, easily exuding the dark and gloomy feel of the show. The ending song, “SHINY SHINY”, on the other hand represents Ganta’s life before the events of the show and is a lot more cheery as a result. The insert songs used are usually metal-themed, matching the dark tone of the show, but are easily forgettable. The music in the show generally does a good job of being in the background. The dub, done by Funimation, did a pleasant job in the voice-acting department matching their characters effectively with well-acted vocals.Character: 6.5 – Like the story, the characters of Deadman Wonderland are hit or miss. The protagonist Ganta is your typical (sym)pathetic, spineless, yet good intentioned kid who just happened to be put in a horrible situation, however, I will give him credit for developing a backbone by the end of the series. Shiro’s role in the story is the mysterious inmate who provides comic relief to an otherwise dark and cruel show and because of that, she easily became my favorite character. A lot of the supporting characters each have their own backstories told through flashbacks given during certain parts of the anime. Some of these characters end up being fairly well-developed while others are shafted for the more important characters. Due to the general cruelty of the show, there is a possibility that you will end up not caring much for the characters, as a lot of their time on the anime is limited.Enjoyment: 7-7.5 – Deadman Wonderland is a pretty entertaining anime. The sheer amount of craziness inside the Wonderland keeps the audience on its toes and interested in watching the story unfold. If you enjoy blood and gore, then you will definitely enjoy watching Deadman Wonderland.Overall 6: Deadman Wonderland is a flawed anime with a clear focus, to shock and titillate. Due to the clichés, unfinished ending, and done to death concepts, the show may come off as underwhelming and hard to take seriously. However, I recommend Deadman Wonderland to those who like their anime, short, zany, and not too serious. Just don’t go into the show expecting a complex storyline and really interesting characters.Overall 6: Deadman Wonderland is a flawed anime with a clear focus, to shock and titillate.

Some of these characters end up being fairly well-developed while others are shafted for the more important characters. Due to the general cruelty of the show, there is a possibility that you will end up not caring much for the characters, as a lot of their time on the anime is limited.Enjoyment: 7-7.5 – Deadman Wonderland is a pretty entertaining anime. The sheer amount of craziness inside the Wonderland keeps the audience on its toes and interested in watching the story unfold. If you enjoy blood and gore, then you will definitely enjoy watching Deadman Wonderland.Overall 6: Deadman Wonderland is a flawed anime with a clear focus, to shock and titillate. Due to the clichés, unfinished ending, and done to death concepts, the show may come off as underwhelming and hard to take seriously. However, I recommend Deadman Wonderland to those who like their anime, short, zany, and not too serious. Just don’t go into the show expecting a complex storyline and really interesting characters.Overall 6: Deadman Wonderland is a flawed anime with a clear focus, to shock and titillate.

Overall, it's a very good anime, and has the potential to stand out from the others.Story: The story starts out with the Red Man, as Ganta calls him, massacring his middle school class. Before he disappears, the Red Man embeds a red crystal-like object into Ganta's chest, which promptly disappears. He wakes up in a hospital and is placed on trial, where he is sentenced to death. He tries to flee, but maddened parents of some of the killed students attack him, and a fake video of...Ganta admitting to the killing to Tamaki, his lawyer, and telling him that if Tamaki cleared him, he would tell Tamaki where he hid the weapon. Ganta soon finds himself in the twisted amusment-style prison called Deadman Wonderland, hence the title. All very original, and I look forward to the rest of the episodes, but the anime has the risk of being a 'getting framed for a crime I didn't commit and trying to find the real killer' type.Art: Truly different from most other animes I have seen. The anime has relatively simple characters, with wonderfully detailed settings, contrasting nicely.Sound: Nothing special. The opening and ending aren't really noteworthy, and sound almost familiar. One good thing about the music is how nicely it keeps the suspense and liveliness of the anime going (During the opening scene of the first episode, Ganta and his two friends are discussing their class trip, but the piano music in the background left me feeling like something was going to happen.)Character: Very original, especially Shiro and Ganta. All of the characters have their quirks, and exploit them excellently. I'd love to see the back story on many of them, but I'm sure that will happen eventually.Enjoyment: Very good. Kept me on my toes the entire first episode, not knowing what would happen. Keeps the blood done to a bearable level, and doesn't get into the gore. Looks like it will be a very good anime to watch!

Each new twist draws you in deeper and deeper to the point where you crave for closure.Audio and visuals for Deadman Wonderland are extremely effective in setting the right theme and environment for this anime. It gives off a eerie and dark aura easily putting you into the right mood for watching this type of anime. The characters are lacking a bit in development and hard to empathize with but with the series the way it is, there wouldn\'t be enough time even though it would be nice if there was more depth to each of the other characters.Although short, Deadman Wonderland is more then enough to satisfy viewers including those who aren\'t too fond of the genre and is most definitely one of the more enticing series of spring 2011 do so myself.

Now, this isn\'t the type of misfortune where you go ""Barnacles, I procrastinated and didn\'t do my boating essay,"" or ""Such misfortune! A certain Sister bites me all the time!"" The misfortune I\'m talking about is when Heaven itself seems to abandon you, when it seems all the forces in the world are trying to guarantee no salvation for you.The subject of this particular tragic treatment is Ganta Igarashi, who starts as a completely normal middle school boy with all of the nice, usual things....Family, friends, and a sense of security. Sadly for him, this was not going to last. On the very first episode of Deadman Wonderland, a mysterious figure, which Ganta dubs the ""Red Man,"" appears and butchers Ganta\'s entire class, leaving him the sole survivor. Framed for the massacre of his class, Ganta is incarcerated in the social experiment prison, Deadman Wonderland.Deadman Wonderland isn\'t your everyday kind of prison. For starters, there is an amusement park built right on top of the prison, with the usual cute and fuzzy mascots roaming around. Here, the prisoners are used to operate the attractions and entertain the audience, with sadistic attractions such as the Dog Race and most importantly, the Carnival of Corpses.Since Ganta is housed on death row, there isn\'t much hope for him in this place. Tagging along with him and constantly saving his life though, is a mysterious girl named Shiro, who claims to be Ganta\'s childhood friend, and possesses near super human feats of strength and agility. Her presence is a mixed blessing for Ganta; she\'s rather clueless and childish, but doesn\'t hesitate to save Ganta. Deadman Wonderland follows Ganta\'s experiences in this bizarre world.Deadman Wonderland certainly has an interesting concept. Modern day gladiators, supernatural powers, and plenty of violence. What\'s not to love?The problem with Deadman Wonderland is that it\'s trying to fit too many things into a very short 12 episode anime. Halfway, an important concept and fighting ability called ""The Branches of Sin"" is introduced. It essentially gives a mastery over using one\'s own blood in a variety of offensive and defensive ways. Somewhere along the way, a rebel group is introduced, an old geezer who never really gets an explanation, a very feminine looking boy, and Undertakers are also introduced. There simply isn\'t enough time in 12 episodes to flesh out these things to make it flow with its other concepts, resulting in little character interaction and development. Even at the end of the series, there are lots of unanswered questions.Let me elaborate. There is a staggering revelation near the middle of the series, a revelation that could very well shatter what little logic is present in Ganta\'s situation. What would happen if Ganta found out about this certain secret? Would he go insane? Would he crawl up and die? Or would he take vengeance?I don\'t have a clue, and you\'re guess is as good as mine. The series introduces this extremely interesting revelation and yet does nothing with it. Given time, this could help make Deadman Wonderland a much better show. And yet, this won\'t happen, because of Deadman Wonderland\'s lack of time to flesh out events. It\'s disappointing, but something in the future could elaborate on this and give a new dimension to the show.As for characters, I\'ve read a lot of complaints about Ganta\'s weak attitude. I really can\'t blame him though, since he\'s just a middle school student  who suddenly finds himself on death row. I think it\'s be unrealistic to think that he\'d suddenly toughen himself and willingly face the dangers of Deadman Wonderland so quickly. The entire story takes place in less than 2 weeks I believe, after all. There are a few interesting characters that appear, such as the Crow, Kiyomasa Senji, who is my personal favorite character of this show. He becomes somewhat of a friend to Ganta, though he is unwilling to share the former\'s optimism of escape.While on characters, I have to applaud this show for introducing some truly hate worthy characters. I\'m looking at you, Promoter Tamaki, man who plays with life like a toy. You too, Genkaku Azuma, you sacrilegious mediocre guitar player. And you too, Hibana Daida, unladylike gorilla who wields Zabimaru. Enough ranting though.Aside from characters, the art in this show is pretty decent. Plenty of dark colors and tones in the prison, while bright colors are usually in the form of sadistic, cute mascots with a gun hidden in them or something of the sort. There isn\'t much diversity in setting, since it takes place in a somewhat futuristic prison after all. That means lots of corridors, cells, stone, steel and things of that sort. Fight scenes were pretty interesting, though animation quality takes a dip sometimes.Moving onto sound, the background music was just that, background music. I didn\'t notice any real noteworthy melodies and such, but the music was appreciated where it was. The opening is ""One Reason"" by Fade. It\'s a typical rock song with, surprise, English lyrics. It\'s very appropriate for the dark tones of the show, and it\'s a pretty decent song.However, the ending song is a completely different story. It\'s an interesting song called ""Shiny Shiny"" by Nirgilis. It has a pretty upbeat pop style to it, an interesting contrast to the heavy rock and violence of the show. There are also some melancholic sounds in the song, another contrast to the happy. However, hearing this after the blood has been spilled in a particular episode, gives an interesting feel close to pity. The ending basically shows pictures of the lives of many of the characters before they experienced the hell of Deadman Wonderland. Innocent things like being with friends, embracing loved ones, and appreciating childhood.Deadman Wonderland isn\'t for everyone. There\'s tons of blood, gore, and some rather disturbing scenes (ahem, Penalty Game). The first episode is remarkably similar in levels of gore to Elfen Lied, so if you can handle things like that, be my guest and enjoy the attractions at Deadman Wonderland. This show should be viewed with enjoying the interesting atmosphere and action as much as possible. It\'s about a boy with all of the misfortune in the world, living in a twisted environment, trying his best to understand what it truly means to be a ""Deadman.""In Deadman Wonderland, we do our very best to kick the loser while they\'re down. So sit back, and enjoy watching our prisoners suffer, minds shatter, and play the part of fool, all while I watch. Family, friends, and a sense of security. Sadly for him, this was not going to last.

Ok, so the muchacho (Ganta, the male lead) is a pussy, but hey! It’s the blood, gore and the raw violence that are the stars in this anime. To recommend any other anime for this one...would be an understatement, co’z this anime is only at par with other shows like “Death Race” and “Prison break” to were it features life in an hellish prison were everyday it is a fight for survival long enough that someday you’ll be able to get outta there either by parole or by escaping.Art: Mediocre 5Geezzz, I don’t know which illustrator I should compare this to, but I really hate the way the muchacho (Ganta) and the chiquita (Shiro) were drawn.Sound: Good 7.Well, I’d say that for a pussy Ganta’s voice is a match for his role, for a retard (hey! I like called her that) Shiro’s voice played up to it. As for the treacherous prison warden, Tamaki, I’d prefer that he should have had a more gayish tone, and as for the head of the prison security Makina, oh, oh, oh, her masculine voice played well.Character: Fair 6.Hummm, I think it’s ""FAIR"" enough that I describe each main charcter in this anime as to why I gave such rating, here goes:Ganta Igarashi- At one point I sympathized him, co’z shit like that does happen to some unlucky fellow in real life, but then again it pisses me off as to how slow is it for him to accept the fact that he’s in that situation and he has to do anything to keep his sanity intact, I also hated that he’s oblivious that the very one who got him in that mess was standing near him all along.Shiro- Ok so it seem that she’s some kind of  lab experiment, a very deadly lab experiment, I like her cuteness and the way she’s friends with Ganta, but, I really hate that she’s the one who send him in hell (I’m talking about the prison). If there will be a season 2 it is possible that she and the muchacho (Ganta of course) will have to face off.Tsunenaga Tamaki – I can’t say if he’s a retard or has some fetish with children’s toys, but man, he is one evil SON OF A B**** of a antagonist .Chief Guard Makina – Aside from having boobs, her character exhibits a typical “S & M” dominatrix kind of thing, however it is difficult to say whether or not she’s one of the good guys or not.So, what’s up with the “FAIR” rating in this portion? Well such rating only applied to these characters, and since this anime has a hanged ending there is still a lot to getting to know the other characters in this anime……..and that’s that.Enjoyment: Good 7.Thought, the blood, gore and raw violence were the stars of this anime, there it is the mystery that surrounds the characters that makes it enjoyable in a sense that one would be curious to find out as whether or not if the mucahcho will be able to escape to freedom, though, what happen is not what one would expect still there is a mystery of whether there will be a season 2 of this anime.Overall: Poor 3.Why? Ok, since this anime left us hanging, I think that it is “POOR” enough that we were also left to wonder if there will be a season 2, and if there will be one, can we expect that the muchacho will break out or will something else would happen to him and the others. But you know this anime has a bit of slice of life in it, which in reality it does happen which involves inmates in correctional facilities all over the world. would be an understatement, co’z this anime is only at par with other shows like “Death Race” and “Prison break” to were it features life in an hellish prison were everyday it is a fight for survival long enough that someday you’ll be able to get outta there either by parole or by escaping.Art: Mediocre 5Geezzz, I don’t know which illustrator I should compare this to, but I really hate the way the muchacho (Ganta) and the chiquita (Shiro) were drawn.Sound: Good 7.Well, I’d say that for a pussy Ganta’s voice is a match for his role, for a retard (hey!

The title of this anime seduced me into watching it with the element of confusion channelling me forward.STORY 7/10Deadman Wonderland is a theme park that not only serves as entertainment to the public but also doubles as a prison for criminals in society. It is the only privately owned prison in Japan. It is here that the fourteen (14) year old Igarashi Ganta is placed after he is charged with the crime of murdering everyone in...his class brutally. At first, the prison appears to be an ordinary one but as Ganta begins to learn more about the prison daily and continue his quest in finding the ‘Red Man’, he realises that there is more to this prison and himself that meets the eye.ART 9/10This anime was dark and gruesome and the artwork reflected such. The depiction of the amusement park was a stark contrast from the horror that was taking place inside. The prison itself gave off an ominous atmosphere which contributed to the intense mystery of the story.SOUND 9/10The opening score provided the key to the dismal atmosphere of the anime and the music included in the story played on one’s mental because even though kaleidoscope music was used it was the irony of the situation in which it was used. The ending piece was sad, reflecting Ganta’s major emotional state.CHARACTER 8/10The characters were pretty diverse with some of them surprising you completely! Each character added a different edge to the anime, contributing to the story and keeping the audience guessing as to the true nature or intentions of some of them.ENJOYMENT 8/10The mystery of the anime kept me intrigued because of the journey that is undertaken with the main character Ganta; empathising with him and also wanting to know more about why he was made to suffer for a crime that he did not commit. I was highly impressed with the amount of violence and gore in this series, so much so, that even some of it had to be censored! However, I was disappointed that the story shifted focus after episode six which annoyed me a little but realised that the ending was open thereby leaving the possibility that there would be another season in the future to tie up loose ends.OVERALL 8/10This anime is definitely worth the watch, that is, if you can stomach all the gore and violence that comes along with it. You can’t help but feel for the main character Ganta and hope that he gets vindicated. The only thing that ruined it for me was the change in the arc where the focus shifted from Ganta to another character Nagi, but nevertheless, a breath of fresh air in the anime universe. his class brutally.

But all that talk died out pretty quickly, and by the time we were a few weeks into the new season, those two shows seem all but forgotten. I\'ve not seen ""C"", but I can tell you that there\'s a good reason why ""Deadman Wonderland"" sunk so fast: bluntly put, it\'s a bit sh*t.The show is about the main protagonist Ganta\'s adventures in the world\'s only privately owned prison, Deadman Wonderland, a place where dark secrets resides and sadistic experiments and gladitorial style bloodsports takes place. Oh,...and the ""Deadman"" in ""Deadman Wonderland"" refers to the special prisoners who have gained special powers that allow them to use their blood to do weirdass stuff like turn into blades. And of course, the shady dudes entertain themselves by making these special prisoners duel one another.The premises of the show is utterly preposterous. I know almost all anime require the viewer to suspend their disbelief to some extent, but ""Deadman Wonderland"" asks for way too much. Considering the inhumane things that goes on in Deadman Wonderland (the prison not the anime), it\'s a miracle that it\'s allowed to exist at all, privately owned or not. As if to mock the stupidity of the general public that exist in the show, Deadman Wonderland even openly flaunts its cruel treatment of prisoners. It does this through its facade... as a fricking THEME PARK in addition to being a prison, a theme park where the audience gets to see gory spectacles such as convicts running through dangerous gauntlets, with the less fortunate ones getting decapacitated and that kind of stuff. Believe it or not, it even has kids visiting on school trips. Everything the audience sees is real, but they get away with it because they tell the audience that it\'s NOT real. Cunning, eh? Yeah. Those gullible public... they\'d believe anything you tell them, heh. Anyway, even ignoring the dubious practice of allowing school kids to see gory entertainment taking place in a prison (which would have real parents up in arms faster than you can say ""Deadman Wonderland""), it\'s a miracle that they manage to fool anyone with the lame facade. So it\'s a miracle of titanic proportions then, that only the odd human rights group smells something fishy about Deadman Wonderland and comes along to protest occasionally outside their gates when they\'re bored.Even after you look beyond the crappy premises, the problems never stop appearing. A lot of them stems from the fact that the characters mostly possess astounding observational skills comparable to the blind, and phenomenal thinking skills comparable to the retarded. The result is that the size of plot holes to size of plot ratio is similar to the size of eyes to size of faces ratio of the moe girls in ""Clannad"", as well as ""twists"" that are executed so badly that you can see them coming at least an episode or two in advance. I could go on and on and on about the catastrophic failings of the story, but then this might end up as the longest review ever. Plus, I need to pace myself and save some sarcasm for the remainder of the review, so I better move on now.""Deadman Wonderland"" (the anime not the prison) gives off quite a strong ""Elfen Lied"" vibe with its appetite for mindless violence. A lot of the time the story feels like it\'s being driven by the need for more violence. In fact it is so graphical that they frequently do things like blur out a serious wound or make the screen annoyingly dark (so dark in fact, that you can\'t actually tell what\'s going on a lot of the time), presumably so that they\'d be allowed to even broadcast it. This leads to some odd scenes such as rooms that were brightly lit only moments ago suddenly becoming very dark when the blood starts to fly. I was kind of expecting the ending to be like ""Elfen Lied"" too, but it\'s not ... because the show doesn\'t even HAVE an ending. It just kind of finished leaving about three quarters of the plot strands still hanging.Other similarities to ""Elfen Lied"" can also be found in the rather extreme, psychopathic characters, for whome we\'re apparently meant to feel sorry for after they show us a 5 minute ""tragic"" slideshow backstory that\'s complete horsesh*t. Given the characters in ""Deadman Wonderland"", you\'d think the competition for ""worst character"" would be fierce - the painfully generic never-give-up type hero Ganta? The oh-so-original sadistic cute girl? The typical evil tyrant assistant warden? But no, the competition was blown away by the presence of one character, one who doesn\'t even need a hacked together backstory (mainly because they failed to explain it before the series finished) to win the ""worst character"" crown hands down. I am of course, talking about Shiro. Her character design is actually really cool, and was one of the things that attracted me to this series... and then she spoke, and things quickly went downhill from there. Perhaps the makers of ""Deadman Wonderland"" were trying to create the most irritating character ever, but I have a feeling that they were actually going for an ""endearing little retard"" type character, but accidentally ended up with ""annoying little sh*t"" instead. And how is it that hardly anyone found her presence to be strange as she wanders around the prison almost unopposed?!The only the thing that stops ""Deadman Wonderland"" from sinking without a trace is the great production values. Some of the bloody action scenes are vaguely exciting to watch, though others are pretty generic. Its horror aspect can also be quite effective... or at least it would have been if the silliness of the plot did not constantly undermine it.Aside from that, there\'s not much to see here. With its unreasonably senselss violence, unreasonably extreme characters and unreasonably bullsh*t story, the only fascinating thing about ""Deadman Wonderland"" is how it gets exponentially more stupid the more you think about it - it seems to contain stupidity within stupidity within stupidity. It\'s not every day you get to see such intricately recursive stupidity, and ""Deadman Wonderland"" pulls it off effortlessly. and the ""Deadman"" in ""Deadman Wonderland"" refers to the special prisoners who have gained special powers that allow them to use their blood to do weirdass stuff like turn into blades. And of course, the shady dudes entertain themselves by making these special prisoners duel one another.The premises of the show is utterly preposterous. I know almost all anime require the viewer to suspend their disbelief to some extent, but ""Deadman Wonderland"" asks for way too much. Considering the inhumane things that goes on in Deadman Wonderland (the prison not the anime), it\'s a miracle that it\'s allowed to exist at all, privately owned or not. As if to mock the stupidity of the general public that exist in the show, Deadman Wonderland even openly flaunts its cruel treatment of prisoners. It does this through its facade... as a fricking THEME PARK in addition to being a prison, a theme park where the audience gets to see gory spectacles such as convicts running through dangerous gauntlets, with the less fortunate ones getting decapacitated and that kind of stuff. Believe it or not, it even has kids visiting on school trips. Everything the audience sees is real, but they get away with it because they tell the audience that it\'s NOT real. Cunning, eh? Yeah. Those gullible public... they\'d believe anything you tell them, heh. Anyway, even ignoring the dubious practice of allowing school kids to see gory entertainment taking place in a prison (which would have real parents up in arms faster than you can say ""Deadman Wonderland""), it\'s a miracle that they manage to fool anyone with the lame facade. So it\'s a miracle of titanic proportions then, that only the odd human rights group smells something fishy about Deadman Wonderland and comes along to protest occasionally outside their gates when they\'re bored.Even after you look beyond the crappy premises, the problems never stop appearing. A lot of them stems from the fact that the characters mostly possess astounding observational skills comparable to the blind, and phenomenal thinking skills comparable to the retarded. The result is that the size of plot holes to size of plot ratio is similar to the size of eyes to size of faces ratio of the moe girls in ""Clannad"", as well as ""twists"" that are executed so badly that you can see them coming at least an episode or two in advance. I could go on and on and on about the catastrophic failings of the story, but then this might end up as the longest review ever. Plus, I need to pace myself and save some sarcasm for the remainder of the review, so I better move on now.""Deadman Wonderland"" (the anime not the prison) gives off quite a strong ""Elfen Lied"" vibe with its appetite for mindless violence. A lot of the time the story feels like it\'s being driven by the need for more violence. In fact it is so graphical that they frequently do things like blur out a serious wound or make the screen annoyingly dark (so dark in fact, that you can\'t actually tell what\'s going on a lot of the time), presumably so that they\'d be allowed to even broadcast it.

Some people are terming it ""The most gory anime of 2011""  , well I may have to agree. It\'s got gore, but is that what it\'s relying upon to be anything better than just an average Anime?Deadman Wonderland starts off with Ganta Igarashi, just a normal schoolboy...until his entire class is killed by a mysterious power wielded by the antagonist later known as the Red man. Ganta is pinned for the murder by ridiculous ""evidence"" and is thrown into Japan\'s first, privately owned prison, Deadman Wonderland.In prison, Ganta learns that he now wields the mysterious ""blood power"" (branches of sin) and...he will be forced to fight against other users, and compete in brutal, childish games to survive.The story isn\'t bad. For the most part it kept me interested and staying on to the next episode. The story does, however, try to be serious and fails because the world encompassing it is so silly. I do feel that it is pandering to a demographic that craves excessive gore, but it is not so amazing as to be what keeps viewers coming back. It\'s been done better in Hellsing, Elfen lied and even Highschool of the Dead.The character designs are probably the main point of what diversifies it, art-wise, from other Anime\'s. I, personally, don\'t care much for the look of the characters.As for sound. Deadman Wonderland does have some ominous backing tracks  which helps to bring out the full potential of various scenes in the series. The opening is rather interesting as well. The voice acting is your typical deal, nothing special. I do feel that Hanazawa Kana was a lot better in Angel Beats! as Kanade than Shiro in this series.Character development was where the series fell quite short for me. The protagonist Ganta is weak, pathetic and generally just a pain to listen to. He gets down on himself, he is a hindrance to the other characters. This is all well and good, but these are the cliché characteristics of a generic archetype and are suppose to be developed away from. The series loses touch and scenes where Ganta actually does something mildly heroic are too little, too late. I just couldn\'t relate to Ganta and that is the main reason Deadman Wonderland fell down for me.If you are looking for mindless gore this isn\'t a bad series for it and all in all, its okay.P.S: Telling from the ending this series had, this is definitely going to get another season. he will be forced to fight against other users, and compete in brutal, childish games to survive.The story isn\'t bad.

A privately owned prison where the prisoners perform for an audience, in hopes of winning the games and lengthening their life. Sounds like fun, right? Right. It makes an excellent anime anyways.This review is based off the first 3 episodes. Overall: 10/10Story: 10/10Ganta Igarashi witnesses his entire class slaughtered by a Red Figure. He is framed and convicted as guilty, sentenced to death and thus sent to Deadman Wonderland- and that's where the real 'fun' begins. To survive, he must compete in insane games and win, in order to keep himself alive.It is a unique storyline that really draws...in the watcher. You want everyone to believe that Ganta is non guilty just as much as he does. As you see Ganta face and overcome obstacles, try to keep some hope in his life and stay alive, you just want to smack the other characters that are making it harder for him.Art: 10/10The art is very beautiful, clear and neat. The gore scenes are not too bad; it was done in a very artistically well manner. The movements are clear and the transitions are nice. Very enjoyable.Sound: 8/10The sound is appropriate for the anime, but nothing special. The opening/ending are pretty good, and there typical sound effects.Character: 10/10The characters are well thought out and true to themselves. The personality matches all of the quirks that the characters have, and make for believable characters.Ganta is an adolescent boy who has to grow up fast in order to survive. The only thing keeping him going is to survive and prove he isn't guilty. He is incredibly disturbed by the event he witnessed and his conviction, and yet tries to persevere in an unthinkable situation. He cares about the people around him.Shiro is extremely light hearted and energetic. It seems that Deadman Wonderland doesn't bother her at all; that it is really just fun and games. She helps Ganta out, even if he doesn't realize it at first, and she gives Ganta a friendly comfort.Enjoyment: 10/10I can't wait for the next episodes to come out! It is extremely interesting and keeps you on edge. The story and characters match together well and is done beautifully, making the overall experience very enjoyable. I recommend! in the watcher.

I recommend!"", ""Deadman Wonderland, what can i say about this anime? Well for starters lets just get the story out of the way. Deadman Wonderland follows Ganta Igarashi and is set in modern day Japan one day his whole class is murdered by a mysterious red man and through actions against his control he is found guilty of murdering his 30 something classmates and sentenced to death. Now in this version of Japan about a decade before these events there's a great Tokyo earthquake that left not just the city but all of Japan devastated. After this a prison is built called you guested it Deadman Wonderland...the first prison to make money off the prisoners with rides and such and this is where Ganta is sent.Now that that's out of the way let's talk about the things this anime does right and the things it does wrong.First the story. For someone who read the manga up to it's current point I love the story it tells however with this anime you don't really feel that it picks what story it wants to tell. At one point Ganta's doing this another he's doing that and so on the way the story comes across isn't bad but it isn't that good either.Next the Art. The art for this anime is done very well its the art style the manga did and the manga and anime did it well. Almost everything is done very well except a few moments were there is censoring but i guess that can't be helped but still worth mentioning.Next is Sound. Sound overall is pretty good things make the sounds you would imagine for the most part. My main issue with the sound is the cussing i understand people cuss and swear but there's a lot of it and I know they did quite a bit in the manga some lines are even pulled right from the manga but some of it should have changed a little for context at certain points they don't do it right or it sounds weird which just ruins the moment it was going for. Something else is that they tried to stay real with the sound i guess you could say but at moments they really should have went up a notch or two. *Slight Spoiler Skip To next Paragraph* At two points i was kinda disappointed cause they were eh when they happened and whoa when i read them at one point a dude get sliced with a sword and barely anything another moment that was super eh was someone kicks the shit out of a giant robot and its doesn't come through the sound how much of a feat it was to do something like that.Characters. Characters in this anime are highs and lows. Some characters like Crow shine but not as much as he should have, others like Ganta fall short but only because the anime doesn't get up to his development which sucks since he's who you are following in the story. The characters after the 4th or 5th ep starts to rotate into characters that did or didn't shine in the manga but don't really get the chance to do either.And next we have enjoyment. At the end of the day did i enjoy Deadman Wonderland the answer is a yes, its fun its crazy and there's some nice twist but dialogue and some other issues just come out and bring it down time to time.Overall I give Deadman Wonderland a 7 its good but only barley it really messes up in ways i just couldn't ignore and if i had compared it to the manga it would have gotten almost a 5. If you like gore, fighting, action, and a story you won't fully get unless there is a season 2 or read the manga then check out Deadman Wonderland the first prison to make money off the prisoners with rides and such and this is where Ganta is sent.Now that that's out of the way let's talk about the things this anime does right and the things it does wrong.First the story.

His ""lawyer"" Tamaki says he feels bad but is the one who ends up making the video. Ganta proceeds to wonderland as a Death Row inmate, where he is first scared and...confused, and meets a WHITE girl named SHIRO.Now let me say this , the RE-developing friendship of the two is something of wonderment, SHIRO remembers Ganta from long ago as a child but Ganta cant seem to remember. The anime has a lot of blood and fighting action, as the DEADMEN in wonderland use their own blood as weapons to fight, the Director who also happens to be the dirty lawyer, sets up brutal fights between the blood users(DEADMEN) for the whole worlds enjoyment. This anime has a little bit of each character, the dyabolical, sinister Director, the poor kid Ganta. Love interests in some of the people who bring wonderland to its knees. Its a very interesting anime with a lot of thought left upon the watcher as the final episode ends, but if you watch it you must pay close attention to SHIRO, REDMAN, and ACE MAN. In this anime you must make connections to get it. Its only 12 episodes so its very worthy of taking time out of your day to watch alot of blood and violence, and to watch an old but new friendship rekindle.I give this 10/10 confused, and meets a WHITE girl named SHIRO.Now let me say this , the RE-developing friendship of the two is something of wonderment, SHIRO remembers Ganta from long ago as a child but Ganta cant seem to remember.

Ever wondered how to make one for the short-term? It is quite simple.Watch or stay inside Deadman Wonderland. Just as the title suggests, its abuse of Deus Ex Machina, unlikeable cast, unexplained details, unnecessary deaths, insane laughter, and butchered accelerated, not fast-paced, story will turn you into a crazy psychopath, laughing maniacally like Light Yagami from Death Note. Amusement parks could start appearing in your dreams to cope with your psychological disorders. The only way to avoid this is zero expectations, inexperience in the otaku world,...and ignorance. I am serious.Biased and crazy? Since I completed this recently, I am and still have some sanity left. Let us begin exploring this madness before I laugh like the main characters in the given links.Light Yagami: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDmb4YQqizQLelouch Lamperouge: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGJbYpeDMZgProduction values are medium at the very least. They are not outstanding but unquestionably (YMMV) fitting. The opening and ending themes brought me out of my misery whenever I watch this  so I never skipped them and watch the preview of preceding episodes. They both start and end the show well every time. Voice acting is fair as well. The style and quality of the art are normal like most of Shounen titles with extra focus on their supernatural abilities. I don’t have any negative issues with these factors at all.For the rest, this is where it all falls. The main character Ganta Igarashi survives a quick massacre done by the Red Man but is arrested in a very unreasonable manner with no public support at all, not even his own relatives, and receives a death sentence. He goes to Deadman Wonderland, a questionable private prison where prisoners are guinea pigs for the audience’s entertainment. Just as any teenager, he is in shock because his previous life is gone for good. His characterization is a mix of Shinij Ikari, Shiro Emiya, and Madoka Kaname. He runs away but never quits in certain lost situations. He is unskilled and charges without thinking. His behaviour and comments are foolish in important situations. Without others, he is completely screwed. As such, he should have died in the first week of his stay but the writers  played similar cards to Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica: audience sympathy and Deus Ex Machina. It is used in most, if not all, of the episodes. He even made something similar to Naruto’s Rasengan and fired it. It always amazes me how he escapes his situations because he has absolutely no chance of survival especially the first event he participated in. There are only a few things you could do whenever a Deus Ex Machina are invoked for Ganta’s survival: cover your eyes and ears in disappointment and fear of being stupefied, laugh hysterically, throw a tantrum, drop this anime.Shiro is the avatar for some of the Deus Ex Machina. She is extremely powerful, childlike, and faithful to Ganta. Appearing out of nowhere and instantly solving about half of his problems, she is god-like. Without her, the torture would have ended a lot earlier, saving us from psychotherapy. More details could spoil the story so I’ll stop here.For the supporting characters, they are all fine but lack the focus on characterization. Certain characters suddenly show up such as Mockingbird, introduced in the last quarter. The flashback about the major villain in the last episode (not sure if it was ep. 11 or 12) is arguably unnecessary since it does not majorly influence the story anymore. Senji is the only likeable character in this series. If he was the main character, then it is definitely a more interesting although still typical since it is Battle Royale. His match with Ganta is questionable though.The side stories with Tamki and Makina is the only interesting part as far as storytelling goes. Exploring the deeper secrets of the hidden section of the prison or political conflict regarding the confidentiality about the Deadmen, are far more interesting than Ganta’s retarded struggle. Besides that, there is no ending and the final arc is full of Deus Ex Machinas. No more unnecessary deaths, cheated unescapable situations, Plot and Character Induced Stupidity! Don’t waste good ideas and the success of the manga adaptation.12 episodes is simply not enough to cover all of their background and motives. Some lack detail and some are too late. If the staff wanted to make another season of this, it should be a faithful adaptation, not a butchered animal for leftovers. and ignorance. I am serious.Biased and crazy?

It is a great manga, it actually kept me religiously reading it until the release pacing got weird. When news of the DW anime came out, I was ecstatic. A Deadman Wonderland anime, finally!But when it finally came out, I was disappointed. The DW anime does not deliver an as powerful punch than its manga adaption.Story: 8/10Deadman Wonderland is about a boy named Ganta Igarashi who is accused of murdering his whole class and is sent to ""Deadman Wonderland,"" a prison of many secrets. Throughout his stay at this...prison, Ganta must survive in games of manslaughter and discovers a mysterious power called the ""Branch of Sin.""The anime adaption of DW stays true to the manga. The plot is unique, but it may remind  you of series such as Battle Royale. Seeing as the anime is set for 12 episode, I don\'t believe you will see as much content as you expect to see, and you will still probably be craving more.Art: 6/10The art in the anime adaption of DW is very much the same as the manga. Animation wise, the series is pretty bad. The animation is very boring and movements are not fluid and the colors are not that appealing.Sound: 7/10Opening song is not that great, although it very does relate to the anime. Don\'t know whether this is just me, but I enjoyed the ending song. It\'s been a while since I\'ve heard Nirgilis.

The plot is unique, but it may remind  you of series such as Battle Royale. Seeing as the anime is set for 12 episode, I don\'t believe you will see as much content as you expect to see, and you will still probably be craving more.Art: 6/10The art in the anime adaption of DW is very much the same as the manga. Animation wise, the series is pretty bad. The animation is very boring and movements are not fluid and the colors are not that appealing.Sound: 7/10Opening song is not that great, although it very does relate to the anime. Don\'t know whether this is just me, but I enjoyed the ending song. It\'s been a while since I\'ve heard Nirgilis.

Feedback is appreciated.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------“People fear death because they don’t ‘understand’ it, and we’re afraid of strangers because we don’t ‘know’ them. Not being able to understand the one you love… is the worst fear of all…”I’m actually a big fan of battle royals, and after watching Btooom! I felt like I wanted more of the “psychological killing games”. I soon found (and still do, by the way) lots of people recommending Deadman Wonderland to MAL users who liked Btooom, saying...they were both very similar in their concept, setup, and overall execution, and thus, I started watching Deadman Wonderland...Story: (6 / 10)Now, I’m unsure if it’s because I haven’t read the manga, or if the anime simply tries to make too many things happen at once, but the story could be really confusing at times, seemingly trying to focus on way too many elements of the story at once. At its core, Deadman Wonderland is about a boy who has everything taken away from him, receives a mysterious power and in imprisoned and forced to fight to survive, and eventually escape.These are all good elements of a story (in my opinion), as long as they’re done in a somewhat good way. To me it felt like the story was (probably because of the many different focuses) sort of “sloppy”, not really explaining anything as they go along, and just simply moving way too fast.The worst thing, however, is probably the fact that I’m either misunderstanding this completely, or there’s actually no real ending (no closure, not even a real showdown). So to me, the story just felt overall very meh, even if the concept was nice.(To avoid spoilers, I won’t go into too much detail, but early on in the show, there’s a scene where some prisoners have to run a sort of lethal crash course, in order to win an antidote for a poison that keeps the prisoners in check, and honestly I think the series overall could’ve benefited from simply revolving around something like this (even though I know this is obviously based on the manga)).Art: (7 / 10)Even though the story and execution might have been somewhat sub-par, the art really stood out. The art is beautiful, and the animation is smooth and very well done. Character is also pretty good, but something that bugged me was that the “branches of sin” felt somewhat... “underwhelming”, in terms of animation. Some of them actually looks a lot like each other, and overall it just feels like they could’ve been made in a much cooler, better looking way.Sound: (7 / 10)Deadman wonderland admittedly has a pretty good cast of voice actors, who all (mostly) do a good job in portraying their respective characters. One obvious (would-be) selling point for me is the fact that one of the main characters, Shiro, is actually voiced by Hanazawa Kana, and I believe she did a good job in portraying the “innocent” side of Shiro. Other than her, I thought the voices were good enough, but really nothing amazing, and there were a few ones that just felt “stale”, if you will.As for the music, an interesting thing that was pointed out to me is that Deadman Wonderland actually has the OST size of a 24 episode series. I’m not really known for paying very much attention to background music at all, unless it’s very prominent, and so I can’t really add much to this myself, as there wasn’t really any track that I felt stood out to me, or lingered with me afterwards. Granted, there were a couple of tracks which were made quite prominent, especially during some of the fighting scenes, but these all just kinda faded away as soon as that scene would finish. However, the way the OST sizes importance was explained to me, was that since this is only a 12 episode show, and it features so many songs, you never really hear the same song played more than maybe a couple of times, as each scene brings a new piece of music.Characters: (6 / 10)I’m on the fence about whether this deserves a 7 or not, but ultimately I’ve decided to rate it 6, because of the fact that no characters really feel as fleshed out as I would like to. There’s basically no character development at all, and even with the added backstory scenes of some (albeit secondary) characters, most of the characters just feel like they’re there for the sake of being there...A lot of characters feel very “mysterious”, as if they later wanted a big reveal of various twists and whatnot regarding said characters. Unfortunately, this never happens, and what we’re left with is an undeveloped, “mysterious” & unrelatable character.As an example of the character development, Ganta (the series main character) starts out as your typical “wimp”, who has just lost everything and thinks he’s worthless in every way. Now, in most shows with this type of character, he would usually develop into something more “badass” later on, overcoming his guilt/sorrow/angst or whatever’s holding him back, but this never happens in Deadman. Granted, there are individual scenes where he seemingly overcomes all this and moves on to becoming a new person, but then it ends and he’s still the same “wimp” as he was several episodes ago.The worst part is probably that they introduce a lot of these “mysterious” characters, some which even only show up a couple of times, but we don’t find out anything about these characters, and it all makes the show very hard to get into.Enjoyment: (5 / 10)Honestly, this show was a major letdown for me. It really does have a good concept, and very well done art, but all the things mentioned above (especially the story) makes it all fall apart, making for a not so pleasant viewing as you’d hope for. It had its cool moments, as well as some funny ones, (but even though it tries, it sort of lacks in the sadness department), and in the end it’s all just a mess.Conclusion:If you like me, found this show as a recommendation after watching Btooom, or something similar, I’d advise you to either stay away completely, or at least go in not expecting something like what you were promised, because that’s certainly not what you’re going to get.Pros:+ Nice concept+ Great soundtrack+ Very well done artwork & animation+ Hanazawa Kana-----------------------Cons:- Messy story- Undeveloped characters- “Stale” fighting scenes (most of it is just talking to each other, but they never actually get anywhere)- Not as much variation in the “branches of sin” as there could’ve been they were both very similar in their concept, setup, and overall execution, and thus, I started watching Deadman Wonderland...Story: (6 / 10)Now, I’m unsure if it’s because I haven’t read the manga, or if the anime simply tries to make too many things happen at once, but the story could be really confusing at times, seemingly trying to focus on way too many elements of the story at once.

This anime is well marketed in the states, considering I’ve seen it all over Netflix, Hulu and Crunchyroll but I never took the plunge until now.  What I found was well short of my expectations, and a series that had so much going for it but squandered it horribly.We’ve all seen this premise before.  Innocent kid from a Japanese Middle School is thrown into a ridiculous series of events, eventually finding out that he possesses magic powers which he somehow masters within...a few hours and blasts his way to victory.  Deadman Wonderland had an opportunity to divert from the stereotype in its carnival prison setting, but missed the marked several times.  Ganta, the main protagonist’s class is interrupted by the appearance of a demon of sorts, killing everyone in an explicitly violent manner.  Ganta is left speechless and is seemingly chosen by this demon when it places a red gem into his chest.  The scene transitions to him being instantly interrogated by police and then is transported to a court room where he receives a death sentence.  Seems a little over the top, even for anime standards.  Where were his parents?  Why’s his defense attorney the same guy who runs the prison?!   He seemed to be completely alone in his life, despite only being about 14.  I get it, it’s an anime… but with a realistic setting, at least throw me a morsel of believability.  I found myself almost laughing at the ludicrous chain of events.In any case, Ganta is transported to the same prison his class was slated to take a field trip to, “Deadman Wonderland”…. Doesn’t exactly sound like a place I’d take the kids to.  However, this is no normal prison; inmates wear collars that slowly inject a lethal poison into their bloodstream if they don’t take an antidote encapsulated in the form of candy every 72 hours.  Oh, and the only way to get said candy is to purchase it using cast points earned from completing events in the carnival.  Talk about annoying.  The story escalates as Ganta learns more about a mystery power his body contains and about the interesting inmates in Deadman Wonderland, all the while trying to figure out how to escape the madness before his Death Row takes its toll.  Not to mention the mysterious skin-tight-suited albino girl he meets along the way.There are so many beaming issues with this plot it’s ridiculous.  After the initial messed up event Ganta participates in, before a packed audience, the workers state how they have to be on their best behavior for the upcoming inspection team.  Did no one see the inmates being decimated not a day earlier?! And did no one think that was a tad too much to expose the general public to?  All the inmates seem to want to escape, but has anyone thought about how to remove the poison collar devices??  There are too many to list, I could go on and on for hours.  I understand 12 episodes was not nearly long enough for the writers to get their points across, but I think a high school creative writing student could’ve posed a better plot, or at least ways to tie up the loose ends.  Not to mention that the story neither ends on a cliffhanger nor a moment of closure.  Oh, plot holes, how I love thee.I can’t find very many redeeming characters from Deadman Wonderland.  Ganta is at least somewhat believable with his frightened demeanor, but that’s all he has going for him.  He doesn’t have very many likeable attributes, and other than his childhood memories of playing with a certain girl… nothing about his past is explained.  I had a better time understanding Owl as a character than Ganta, at least the writers made sense of his history with Deadman Wonderland.  Of course, it has to be said that Ganta does grow as a character throughout the show, but due to the small amount of episodes, it felt forced in a way… like someone was saying, ‘You’d better man up in hopes for a second season, or your story’s about to end!”And then there’s Shiro. Man, oh man am I getting tired of this character trope.  It’s the oblivious and innocent girl who can mysteriously unleash monstrous amounts of power on a whim, but is in love with the main protagonist, even though she probably wouldn’t realistically even remember him.  Not to mention the unnecessary fan service slipped in with the occasional cute pouty face or the skin tight outfit with a red spiral pointing to her nipple.  What the hell is that all about anyway?The supporting cast is slipped in decently at least.  Whether it’s the muscle bound Crow with a soft Senpai side or the clever and militant warden, desperate to uncover the dark secrets behind Deadman Wonderland’s true existence.  There’s also the seemingly innocent Yoh-kun and his sexually messed up sister.  None of the character’s plot lines are ever fully explored though, and a lot gets tossed to the side to focus entirely on the main arc.  Owl and Gengaku were pretty much the only characters that stood out to me, and their backgrounds for how they ended up in Deadman Wonderland are scary enough.The animation in Deadman Wonderland is actually pretty good.  The action sequences leave a lot for the eyes to ogle, and the characters look worn and terrifying in some instances.  I did notice some laziness during slow scenes, but nothing exceptionally bad.  The gore is taken to a whole new level, reminiscent of other violent series I’ve seen before, and the opening scene in the middle school sets the bar for shock value.  In the instance the anime is rewatched in the future, I can’t imagine it could look outdated in any way, due to the lack of CGI entirely.  What to say about the intro?  I initially despised it, but as I kept watching the show it grew on me and I actually ended up enjoying it.  It reminds me of the music style I was into in high school, being slightly nostalgic in that fact.  I also like the way the characters were edited into the intro without spoiling anything about the plot.  Sound effects were okay, decently strewn together, and some of the music seemed ominous and creepy as hell as it added to the overall feel of the show.Unfortunately there isn’t a higher score I can give this anime.  So many unanswered questions and unbelievable story progression make Deadman Wonderland fall into a trap that is hard to get out of.  If a second season was ever released, I would more than likely watch it, but I’d start off initially skeptical due to the unfulfilled feeling I was left with at the end of the first.  Too many stereotypes that could’ve been broken in this series, but it didn’t quite do it for me.  If you like shock and awe, and don’t have the attention span for too many episodes, Deadman Wonderland is at least worth a look.  That being said, I hope you enjoyed the review! a few hours and blasts his way to victory.

That being said, I hope you enjoyed the review!', ""Thought I'd see something really interesting, read synopsis, researched everything on it, and at the end was a total disappointment.Deadman Wonderland is an anime that no captive anything, the plot is slow, boring and without any appeal to make it interesting, and further accompanied by characters with no charisma and silly Intelligence, and no relevant moments that will make those demanding or those looking for a good squirm with rage when they are watching. At the end of it all is a very weak anime in every way and really does nothing to save this disappointment of falling into the abyss. "", 'Ah Deadman Wonderland (referred as ""DW"" from here on), the only 2011 Spring show i watched. Let\'s begin with this:Story: Ganta Igarashi is a 14 year old middle school student accused and later convicted of murdering his entire class, yet he proclaims his innocence and says he saw a ""Red Man"" actually do the killings. But his ""public defender"" Tamaki fails to help Ganta and gets sent to DW, a carnival where the inmates are subjected to humiliating and often life or death situations.The story is pretty generic for the most part. Ganta tries to prove his innocence while trying to maintain his sanity...in DW. He meets Shiro, a cheerful yet mysterious girl who quickly becomes Ganta\'s closest friend inside DW. He realizes that in order to survive he needs to take an antidote, called ""candy"" every two days or he\'ll die. To get candy, one must get credits, obtained from winning contests. Nothing exciting but nothing outlandish either.Art: The best part of DW is the animation/art. Even though the blood/violence is heavily censored in the TV version, i found the animation to be top-notch. Each episode really does its best to show us the facial expressions of Ganta (especially episode 6), the Deadmen, everyone else in the show. But the violence is stunning on DW. People getting chopped in half, impaled, electrocuted, eyeball removal, yeah its pretty bad. Yet, ironically those instances are when the Animation truly shows its strength.Sound: The OP/ED are nothing outstanding, but alright. The background music is just that, background music. Voice acting: Romi Paku is known for voicing every popular male character (see Elric, Edward) that\'s ever been seen and pulls off a strong performance as Ganta. Rising newcomer Kana Hanazawa (also Mayuri from Steins;Gate, Shiemi from Blue Exorcist) nails it as the aloof and cheerful Shiro.Characters: I already talked about Ganta, but i\'ll add something to this. He starts off as your typical whiny shounen lead which gets really annoying as the show is 75% Ganta, 15% Shiro, 10% everyone else, though there are some instances where Ganta really shines (see episode 6). Only near the very end of the very short series, he finally admits that he\'s weak and seeks the training of ""Crow"" (aka Senji Kiyomasa), one of the powerful Deadmen inside. Their friendship stems as a result of one of the many ""contests"", such as Carnival Corpse, inside DW in order to get credits. I won\'t spoil what happened, but all i\'ll say is that the loser has to partake in a slot machine game where anything can happen (""Lose your right arm, Lose your eyeball, Lose your hair (?)"").None of the other characters really standout. Ganta suffers the mistake of being too nice to people, especially inside DW. He befriends Takami Yoh, a kleptomaniac searching for his sister but Takami is also in cahoots with the mainman of DW, the Promoter Tamaki (Yes, that guy who was Ganta\'s public defender, pretty twisted huh?). Later Ganta meets Iron Chain, the group who\'s plotting to breakout of DW and their leader Nagi.Enjoyment: Having watched no new anime since last year, i can say with certainty that Deadman Wonderland is a refreshing yet lacking anime in some regards. Only 12 episodes, the ending is very much left wide-open yet very unlikely the show will get any real closure (such as a second season, or an OVA). But for the most part i loved DW. Ganta, while flawed, managed to keep his sanity for the most part. Shiro is loveable, funny and quick to defend Ganta from anyone at anytime. But there just wasn\'t enough episodes to explain the most important parts of the show, such as the Branches of Sin, Undertakers, and of course Shiro herself, but it\'s a good show especially given its only 12 episodes. I recommend this show.The good: Crisp, detailed animation. If you haven\'t read the manga, you\'ll love this more than those who read the manga.The bad: Unanswered questions, failed character improvement. in DW. He meets Shiro, a cheerful yet mysterious girl who quickly becomes Ganta\'s closest friend inside DW. He realizes that in order to survive he needs to take an antidote, called ""candy"" every two days or he\'ll die. To get candy, one must get credits, obtained from winning contests.

Later Ganta meets Iron Chain, the group who\'s plotting to breakout of DW and their leader Nagi.Enjoyment: Having watched no new anime since last year, i can say with certainty that Deadman Wonderland is a refreshing yet lacking anime in some regards. Only 12 episodes, the ending is very much left wide-open yet very unlikely the show will get any real closure (such as a second season, or an OVA). But for the most part i loved DW. Ganta, while flawed, managed to keep his sanity for the most part. Shiro is loveable, funny and quick to defend Ganta from anyone at anytime. But there just wasn\'t enough episodes to explain the most important parts of the show, such as the Branches of Sin, Undertakers, and of course Shiro herself, but it\'s a good show especially given its only 12 episodes. I recommend this show.The good: Crisp, detailed animation. If you haven\'t read the manga, you\'ll love this more than those who read the manga.The bad: Unanswered questions, failed character improvement.', 'So, you\'re telling me we\'ve got a prison that doubles as an amusement park? Sign me up—oh wait, maybe not actually sign me up, that place is nuts! ""Deadman Wonderland"" throws you into this wild ride, and just when you\'re buckled in, it goes off the rails... and not entirely in the way the manga did.Look, if you\'re a die-hard fan of the manga, brace yourself. The anime takes some, let\'s say, ""creative detours."" It\'s like ordering a pepperoni pizza and getting one with pineapple. Some of you might love the surprise, while others... not so much.That said, as its own beast, the anime is...a blast. Action-packed, intense, and with characters that\'ll make you go, ""Did he just...? Yep, he did."" But if you\'re hoping for all the answers by the end, you\'re in for a cliffhanger that makes those soap opera ones look like child\'s play. Want the full story? Dive into the manga—it\'s where the party continues and the real fun begins.In short, ""Deadman Wonderland"" the anime? A wild, unpredictable roller coaster. The manga? The track that completes the ride. Strap in, folks! a blast. Action-packed, intense, and with characters that\'ll make you go, ""Did he just...? Yep, he did.""

The track that completes the ride. Strap in, folks!', ""Deadman Wonderland, in my opinion, is a really great anime- but it's an anime for a very niche crowd. It's super violent, pretty crude, and only goes so far into the manga's story, which some people may not appreciate in an anime adaptation.To the anime's credit, the violence and crudeness never feels forced. It all feels very cohesive to the story's overall theme, and even when I cringed at some of the more brutal parts of the story, I never rolled my eyes and thought, 'Oh, this is all just for shock value.' Something about the way it was written made me believe that each...and every thing shown was needed and had a place in the anime, especially since we get to see the way that all these brutal events effect each character.I found most of the characters to be very likable or at least interesting, even though a huge handful of them are raving psychopaths- again, this is a trope that can often become eye-rollingly forced, but like I said, I liked a good chunk of the characters. There's only a few I didn't care for as far as writing or execution goes, and they were mostly characters who came in towards the end and got their time cut short since their stories continue on in the manga.If you like dubs, I highly recommend watching Deadman Wonderland dubbed, because it turned up my enjoyment of the series considerably. The adapative script is just plain great, and the dialogue all feels very natural- plus you get to hear some awesomely crafted cursing from a bunch of the characters.My only big qualm with Deadman Wonderland (aside from the unfortunate 12 episode cap, which I'll give a pass under the hopes that they'll do another season) is that the awesome carnival/amusement park theme gets dropped about halfway through as the characters interact less within the framework of Deadman Wonderland and more behind the scenes. It's hard to describe without spoiling anything, but I would have liked to see more 'playing by the rules' before the story really got going- but again I'm assuming this has a lot to do with the episode cap, and I think the anime was otherwise very well-paced for having so much to cover in such a short time.Overall, I quite enjoyed this anime, and if you like dubs, I highly recommend giving Deadmon Wonderland's dub a try. It takes a good show and makes it even more compelling. and every thing shown was needed and had a place in the anime, especially since we get to see the way that all these brutal events effect each character.I found most of the characters to be very likable or at least interesting, even though a huge handful of them are raving psychopaths- again, this is a trope that can often become eye-rollingly forced, but like I said, I liked a good chunk of the characters.

Last year it got a twelve episode anime adaptation. I haven\'t heard much about the series so I don\'t know what to expect. Let\'s take a look and find out.Fourteen year old Igarashi Ganta witnesses the murders of his peers at the hands of the mysterious ""Red Man."" The Red Man pushes a crystal into Ganta\'s chest and vanishes. He soon finds himself in a privatised prison where he\'ll have to fight to survive. The basic elements seem very cliche, but it\'s all presented in a very unique and...interesting way. The story does an excellent job of balancing between more light-hearted moments and really dark, twisted moments. This contributes to making it very interesting to watch. It also has excellent pacing. It sets up for another season while still having a satisfying climax and an interesting conflict. The one negative is that it is a short anime. The result is that a lot of plot points don\'t get resolved. However, it is clearly set up for a sequel so it\'s really not a major negative and I do hope that the series does get a second season because what\'s there is very interesting.This series has a massive cast. The major characters are, mostly, very well fleshed out, as are some of the side characters, but most of them get very little character development. However, that does work for the story and the setting. Given the length, they really couldn\'t have done much better. My only real issue with the characters is with Ganta himself. He feels like a stock everyman protagonist that we\'ve seen a lot. He does get a little development in the last couple episodes, but he still comes across as a pretty bland character. Especially when compared to the far more interesting group around him.The art is very good, overall. There\'s a good use of colours, the fight scenes are interesting and they even manage to make the backgrounds lively. Which is pretty impressive for an anime mostly set in a prison. Now, there are some really gruesome scenes that may be a bit difficult to watch, but they are excellently handled and plot relevant. This isn\'t mindless or something that\'s just done for shock value. There are a few art issues. The first is that there are some really dark scenes that are hard to see and there\'s really not a good reason for them to be. Another is that there are a few art errors, there aren\'t many but there are enough that it is a little distracting.The voice acting is excellent. Paku Romi and Hanazawa Kana both have very strong performances, but the entire cast is good. The music does a very good job of helping set the tone.The yuri factor is a 2/10. Kyoko seems to have a crush on Makina in a few scenes, but you don\'t get enough with them to be certain.My final rating for Deadman Wonderland is an 8/10. It has a few weak points, but it\'s a very good anime overall. It\'s well-paced, interesting, well acted and it has a lot of endearing characters, even if the main protagonist is rather dull. If you don\'t mind sitting through some gruesome scenes I would definitely suggest checking it out. interesting way.

Ganta is having a typical ordinary day but that is all about to change when a mysterious person known as the 'red man' appears suddenly and slaughters his entire class, leaving him as the soul survivor. Evidence displays a recording in which Ganta shows his amusement about murdering his entire class. This scenario makes it seems like Ganta is the culprit behind the massacre. During the mass killing he loses consciousness and wakes up in the hospital where he is apprehended. Ganta is then taken to court and later is presume guilty for the murder of...his classmates. As punishment he is sentence to death. Awaiting his execution, he wines up at a prison known as Deadman Wonderland. Now Deadman Wonderland isn't an ordinary prison. It's a place where prisoners fight for their lives in order to please the crowd that is rooting for bloodshed.Ganta starts off as terrified and confused, but that shifts quickly when he learns that he has to adapt and become strong in order to survive this hell he has been placed in. Ganta realize that he has been framed and that his being here in this prison is no coincidence. His objective now is to find the red man responsible for everything and to prove his innocence, but before he can do that he needs to escape and avoid the many possible threats that Deadman Wonderland holds.If there is any character as mysterious or even more so than the red man, it would have to be this girl named Shiro. Shiro, an pale girl covered in red markings seems to be Ganta's childhood friend who Ganta vaguely remembers. She appears to be unbound by the prison and goes unnoticed by the guards as if she was a spirit but her very existence is real.The story itself feels very fast paced which affects the fight scenes and results in less intriguing characters that are poorly introduced. Main two characters that got their fair share of screen time includes Ganta and Shiro. Ganta's impression is very mature for a middle schooler. His age doesn't quite fit how he's able to deal with the situation so effectively. Shiro does a great job at keeping the audience engaged and her childlike personality compliments her well. As for the other characters, they don't leave  a strong impact and the ones that dies off are hardly remembered due to lack of background stories.Art is neither eye-catching nor repellent. Plenty of gore and violence incorporated which is remarkable and keeps the viewers entertained. Biggest issue like I said is that it's very face paced and with only 12 episodes it leaves out significant details.

Well thats how Deadman Wonderland is. I was really hyped to actually watch this because a lot of my friends were like its way better than anything I\'ve seen yet. Sadly I was really let down. I won\'t touch base with the OVA as all that is a back story.Story 6/10The story is no way bad or anything it just feels like there area bunch of holes in it and even so it...wasn\'t paced that great either. The beginning was really rushed to the whole ""Deadman Wnderland amusement park prison"" aspect where the main character was forced into such a hell hole within like 5 minutes of the first episode which in that time he acquires such powers he has no clue of their acquisition. Based off that, the story really had no where to go in terms of contrast and most the events were really predictable. This really led to an okay but somehow happy ending. It  really isn\'t the best ending but it feels like it promotes a second season which I do not foresee ever happening. Even with this in play I was actually waiting to feel any sort of emotion while watching it but I can say it doesn\'t make me feel any different while watching it as I said it was pretty predictable.Art 8/10This was really good and usually fit the mood of most of this anime revolving around the worst prison system ever created so yeah it was usually dark. However I did not favor the immense amounts of gross out scenes and cringey amounts of gore. I realize there are other series I have seen with way more gore but this whole series focuses on the gore and bloodshed.Sound 9/10The music seems to be the most redeeming part of the entire series. No matter how you watched this anime dub or sub, the themes are the exact same but either way they got me pumped to watch this series. I really could listen to the Opening and Credits 100 times over and still love it but sadly that was really the only good thing the music department had going for me.Character 7/10Like the story the characters introduced really went no where. The anime tries to make you feel sympathy for the characters but these attempts happen way to early for you to feel anything for them so in a way there doesn\'t seem to be any real development. Also they added in way too many supporting characters who really didn\'t contribute any to the plot. Even with all the back stories nothing really changed about how I feel about the characters. Even with Ganta\'s and Shiro\'s childhood, its one of those ""They have good friendship then they depart then boy forgets"" childhood. However I really came to like Shiro.  She was really unique to the series as being one of those characters who didn\'t really bum me out every time I look at her. I also like the fact they didn\'t really push for any romance kind of actually caught me off guard in the end but other than them characters were really bland.Overall 7/10Like I said in the beginning this anime is sort of a let down to me but I have no business calling it bad anime it Was actually good. I just think that this anime doesn\'t really bring anything new to mind after watching it and it didn\'t make feel anything while watching it. If you really haven\'t seen a whole lot of anime or just haven\'t seen any for quite some time this is actually a great anime to watch. While it may not be the best story for its time it still is fairly decent and if you were wanting to watch it go ahead its not horrible but its not the greatest thing ever spawned and theres nothing really new about it. However if there is any real sequel this may or may not change but for now Deadman Wonderland will get a 7 from me also if you havew atched this series you might as well watch the OVA. It doesn\'t really fit with the rest of the series but hey it won\'t kill  you right? wasn\'t paced that great either.

It doesn\'t really fit with the rest of the series but hey it won\'t kill  you right?', 'before I start this review, I wanna say that deadman wonderland so under rated by soooo many people, and its just flat out ridiculous. in my opinion (please highlight I said MY opinion), a show like deadman wonderland has so much potential, because now a days, people don\'t know how good anime use to be when it was all about the compelling action. shows like DBZ and yu yu hakasho, gurren lagann, all these shows had more of a focus on action, rather than emotional bullshit. Where as now, an anime ain\'t nothing if ain\'t got a moe or a splice of life. not to...say no anime should not have that, but it\'s made action series like the classics almost non-existent. Deadman wonderland to me takes a try at the good old days.storyGanta is your average boy who is nothing special, and his life would have been that way if there was just that problem that his classmates weren\'t killed by the ""red man"", and implanted some red thing inside him. Being the only soul survivor, he is charged with the slaughter of all classmates, and is, in the end, sent to deadman wonderland, where he must fight for survival. Shortly after being there, he realizes through a certain event, that the red thing inside him has given him superpowers (like some of the other prisoners, or ""deadmen) and allows him to use blood as a weapon. now I don\'t wanna give too much away, because that\'s episode one in a nut shell, but the story is pretty well, but the reason I didn\'t give a ten out of ten is because the show does have some plot holes here and there, they are forgivable, but unfortunately, they do exist.the animationif you want to see where this show shines, this is it. granted its style is no guilty crown, but its got a very dark feel to it. Its kind of the same feeling that black lagoon gives you with the city roanipur or however you spell that. the gory aspect of the show is not too be exaggerated though, it is not meant for the squeamish. The animation however does compliment the show in every aspect. there\'s not much else to say other than the opening of the show, has phenomenal animation.the soundthe music in deadman wonderland like everything else in the show, is dark, but it also is freaking perfect. it\'s a mix of heavy tunes, and dark erry music that fits both the dark aspect of the show and the action scenes. and the opening is the best opening I have ever seen, heavy metal tune, and pumps you up for the psychotic stuff coming your way. needless to say, it is amazing, a 10/10the charactersthe characters in this show is about the problem I have with this show. Now for anyone who doesn\'t know, I love future diary/mirai nikki, and ganta is very much like yukki. ganta is, like yukki, a winy weakling and can\'t go through any problem without crying, and his dub voice actor got annoying as all hell. I will say he is not a total spineless coward as he does rise to the occasion more than I could have expected. next you have shiro, one of my favorites. shiro is a albino girl around gantas age who comes out of absolutely nowhere to help ganta and decides he is her best friend. however she is a complete mystery and definitely makes you wanna learn more about her. not much else to say about her other than she acts just about as silly as team rocket. next up ya got yo who starts to appear to be an aid to ganta, and teaches him things about the prison and how it works. I can\'t explain more without spoilers, so we now move on to the last one, crow. Crow is definitely the badass of the show, everything from his voice, how he acts, and how he goes about things. I will not go any further on him other than he is my favorite character.my personal enjoymentoverall deadman wonderland is a pretty kickass show, but unfortunately there is one thing that made me not give it a ten out of ten. being that it did real good in America, and not good where it needed to, japan, it never got a second season. this leaves with soo many things unanswered. however since that is not the shows fault, the show is still pretty damn good with plenty of action, all the gore ya want, and plenty of thriller and mystery. pray everyone, pray for a season 2, and we might not be disappointed. or buy the dvd and help them out if you liked it that much. say no anime should not have that, but it\'s made action series like the classics almost non-existent.

A teenage boy is sentenced to death, and sent to prison after being falsely accused of mass murder, and now has to participate in dangerous games hoping to postpone his death by obtaining antidote pieces of candy. It looked cool, and even though it didn’t make any sense that people actually believed a teenage boy could have been able to slaughter his entire classroom in this way, the story had something going for it.But soon the story goes in a whole different direction, and we find our protagonist Ganta running down some hallways...and fighting some guy in some arena, with some typical shonen power, the “branch of sin,” that is somehow reason for the board of the prison to throw him into some fights. Some people that somehow got online access to this fight are discussing some things that do not matter and the loser of the fight loses a body part for some reason. Why does the board of the prison use prisoners that have branch of sin for this and doesn’t the show expand on the other prisoners? Why is none of this information leaking out? Why does no visitor to the ever notice that people actually die in these games, while some of which are attractions for visitors to see? These questions are never expanded upon. There is no logic behind anything in this show, it’s mostly just mindless gore and violence.The story gets even worse down the road. One day, while roaming around the halls (because that is totally what prisoners on death row do), our protagonist suddenly finds this rebellion that is only thrown in the story for the sake of being “the rebellion,"" and for no reason at all they have their own lounging room, complete with furniture, electronic devices, and entertainment, in what is supposed to be a DEATH ROW PRISON. They screw around for a little, trying desperately to make us believe that they’re characters that have an actual purpose, and eventually, they get interrupted by an undertaker: an anti-branch of sin fighter. What is that? Why are they in the prison fighting against prisoners with the branch of sin? Not important at all. All that matters is that they fight the main characters and have weird huge weapons. Deadman Wonderland tries so hard to be edgy, it even throws in an acid-spewing spider robot to lead the characters into harm’s way.Everything that has any kind of potential in this show gets thrown out of the window. The moment of fail that takes the cake is when somebody brings up the candy pieces that the prisoners have to obtain to survive after those pieces having been absent for several episodes. In the meantime the viewer had actually forgotten that they even existed and goes like “Oh, right, those things were a key plot element at one point. Why were they never brought up again?” Turns out the main character has about eight of them now, despite no information being given to the viewer about how he got them.I’ll spare you the other plot holes, because I could be writing about them all day; simply know that the story of this show is ridiculously illogical and is best summarized with the words “missed potential.” The ending (if it can be called an ending) illustrates this too, by being the most anticlimactic ending I have seen in years, dissatisfying and pissing off its viewers as an extra slap in the face of everyone who coped with the show until its ending.Characters: 3/10Not much to say here. Ganta is a Shinji clone with no substance, Crow is a typical badass guy for shonen standards that would’ve done a better job as a main character than Ganta, Shiro (who I haven’t even mentioned because of her dullness and unimportance to the story) is the most clichéd character in the show, being the cheerful-but-vulnerable type girl, and most of the other characters are either there to slaughter or be slaughtered. The only depth we get is some background information on the two most insane people in the show, and the only point of this information is explaining how said characters got insane.Animation: 7/10The animation of Deadman Wonderland is the only good thing about it. The action scenes were brought alive quite beautifully, especially those with the Red Man in it, and the opening is pretty neat. Animation is fluid, use of color and light is good, and character designs are up to standards. Pretty great job from Manglobe.Sound: 5/10The soundtrack of Deadman Wonderland is not that bad. No tracks really stand out, but each track fulfills its purpose and the soundtrack generally gets the job done. The opening song is alright, the ending song is boring, and all the other songs from this score lie somewhere in between.Enjoyment: 1/10I absolutely hate Deadman Wonderland. It could have been decent, but its story started making less and less sense every episode to the point where it was not even slightly believable or interesting anymore, and its characters didn’t do anything to help. This show voids itself of logic for the sake of being gory and dark and it frustrated me in every sense of the word.Overall: 3/10Deadman Wonderland is a steaming pile of crap and should not be seen as anything else.

Spare yourself the pain of watching this if you have an IQ above 80.', 'Average anime with interesting settings and potential, but both of those are critically wasted. The only things which hold the score on 7 are two of many plain characters and the mystery surrounding the main female protagonist.Story:At the beginning the story seems like the main and most interesting part of the show. Private prison, death sentenced prisoners fightng for survival, high school boy with supernatural powers but lack of self-confidence.Main problem is that the anime has only 12 episodes. There is simply not enought time to tell all the important things in an interesting way, and so we dont know nothing about most of the...characters and events and then the writers try to explain everything in last episode - NOT working. Not to mention that there is vast majority of things which are not explained just because this anime does not covers the full manga.Conclusion: 6/10 for so much wasted potencial and too hasty ending*Spoilers ahead*Characters:About most of the characters we know nothing. They exist simply because story wants more pawns to kill. How I already wrote, there are only two characters which are interesting - Shiro and Crow. But just because of Shiro I gave this anime one or two points bigger score. This simple girl with her crazy second personality as main anime antagonist is just adorable. She always shows in critical moment has some easy but catchy phrase and then either saves everyone or gets ass kicked. Her appearance is also very untraditional, and the background surrounding her childhood has some really strong moments and is very touchy (unfortunately not mentioned in anime - you must read manga)Conclusion: 8/10 - Shiro rulezz, Crow is badass*End of Spoilers *Art and sound:Other thing which you will remember is good sound setting in thrilling parts, not to mention the great anime opening song. Art could be better in 2011 but its watchable and some details are pretty nice. The whole contrast of the prison which is presented as funny family land vs. gore and bloody things which are happening in the *basement*Conclusion: 7/10Summary and final word:If you like gore action animes with mystery element, this is for you. By far not so good as Mirai Nikky but enjoyable. The one thing which will hold you by the monitor will be Shiro and concern how the whole thing will end (unfortunately unfulfilled due to rushed end).Overall 7/10 characters and events and then the writers try to explain everything in last episode - NOT working.

The anime could’ve been the visual version of Nu Metal – loud, heavy, violent, stupid and a lot of fun. Too bad it’s closer to early Drowning Pool than Mushroomhead or Slipknot. A lot of stuff happens, but nothing is fun.The warning signs are in the first episode. Ganta (‘gangsta’ minus two letters) has no personality. Brief slice-of-life tell us nothing about him other than that his taste in women is generic, his best friend is more extroverted than him and that he’s nice.He’s a bland stand-in for the...viewer. He’s defined by the most vague attributes – he’s nice, he wishes good for everyone and he feels a little weak. It’s a nice suit the viewer can insert himself into and feel better at the end at overcoming the pain along with Ganta.A character defined by being normal and good-willing can work. The writers would have to be aware that this is his purpose, though. They will have to make sure his normality is constantly contrasted (because normality is in itself empty) and that his goodwill is active. This worked for Danganronpa.Ganta isn’t Naegi and there are no one here as mad as Daganronpa’s students. We never get an insight into how the events actually affect him. Then again, the events are meaningless acts of cruelty. All Ganta can do is be depressed for a while, inner-monologue about how weak he is and then stand up to protect his friends.Wasn’t this what Sakamoto did in BTOOOM!? The major difference between the two is that Sakamoto had less people to talk to, so he also inner-monologue’d during fights.Shiro isn’t much better. Her personality is amusing but runs out of steam before you notice it had any steam in the first place. Yuno is an obvious comparison, and Shiron is everything Yuno satirized. She exists to please Ganta and to help him. She doesn’t have anything beyond this.Yuno was defined by being a yandere. The fact she needs someone is the center, not the someone she needs. Without Ganta, what can you do with Shiro? She walks around, acts cutsy and solves problems for Ganta.It’s possible that the manga develops her differently. There’s a big twist thing that’s not revealed in the anime but is elaborated upon there. In this anime, she’s our hero cute female sidekick.The creators also can’t be imagnative with their cruelty. Buckets of blood are spilled and people get shot in the head. Many were abused in their past. It never builds towards anything. Everyone just suffers.In order for us to understand suffering, we need to see the difference between one kind and another. We need to see how different characters approach the situation. Many in Future Diary had a difficult past, but they took it differently. They weren’t just senseless psychos. It affected their desires and worldview in a way that’s connected to their personality. There is a difference between Yomotsu’s rough justice, Tsubaki’s hatred, John’s megalomania and Yuno’s obsession.Violence is just tossed here. It’s something to cheer for. How can you take a show seriously when everyone is so sadistic? The world is cruel, but it’s also strange. Stories from Holocaust survivors are more shocking not just because they’re real but because they’re going somewhere.Humans adapt. People who live in harsh circumstances adapt or die. In the most intense times in the army I didn’t have time to inner-monologue. In this anime they just monologue. The reason the pain of Danganronpa‘s cast was believable was because they had more than pain in their lives. The show made it clear each of these characters could stand on its own.None of the characters of Deadman Wonderland can exist outside the anime. They’re all tied to the emotional core of doom’n’gloom. Without senseless violence they don’t exist. Characters who need senseless violence are senseless.It’s ironic how the series tries to say something about brutal entertainment. The whole set-up is violent entertainment taken to reality. It’s an interesting concept, especially when we deal with prisoners. The rights of criminals and what to do with them is a controversial issue.It seems the anime’s answer is that we should massacre them in entertaining ways. If this was supposed to be a critique, it should’ve made the violence truly shocking. Violence is shocking not when it’s extreme, but when it has some sort of meaning. This is why Yukki killing a bunch of orphans is more jarring than any ‘difficult past’ story here.Yukki’s violent rampage was a result of a person who is sure he can bring everyone back to life. It’s an embodiement of ‘once people become easy to copy/resurrect their life lost value’. The Deadman Wonderland is brutal, but also cool. The people are using weapons made of blood. The race has them dying in all kinds of ways. The camera always lingers on the body so we will get a clear image of it. It’s pornography now.I could’ve forgiven this if the series wasn’t so pretentious. I love aesthecized violence, and you can use it to give commentary on it. Borderlands is both violent and comments on violence in video games. What exactly Deadman Wonderland is trying to say about our relationship with violence is unclear. People are cruel, so?If it was more stylish, if the focus was more on the violent games than the psycho-drama thing it would’ve been better. There are some cool visual ideas. The race scene could’ve been fun, but instead it’s a celebration of gloominess – brutal violence with no energy that’s still pornographic. It’s just unpleasant.It’s actually hypocritical. The series points to us how disgusting brutal entertainment is, but the show itself is nothing but brutal entertainment. Its violence only exists for our pleasure and the cruelty isn’t deep. It’s like how in the Saw films, Jigsaw talks about how we should appreciate life but forces others to kill.At least it’s better than BTOOOM!. The series does reach some kind of conclusion. The grand story doesn’t end but they create a central enough arc that does. The setting and characters are also wild enough to be entertaining occasionally. People are getting their heads split open, there’s a loli with a sword-whip-thing and weapons made of blood. It’s pretty fun.It does have a weird relationship with sexuality as expected. It’s not drowning in fanservice, but the female cast is hanging around with more nudity than practical. Shiro has a skin-tight custom that makes her look naked, another girl is half-naked and the camera literally pauses so we could stare at some G-cups. These type of anime generally fail at sexuality, but despite the occasional moment Future Diary was mainly concerned with the personalities. Danganronpa also never sank to these lows. Sexuality is fun but not when it’s off-topic. Why is the sexual features of every female character is emphasized? At least there’s a dude with killer abs here.At least the people in the sound design knew what they’re doing. There are some guitar riffs and industrial beats. It’s the perfect soundtrack. There are even Cannibal Corpse-like blast beats during the Carnival Corpse. If only they had a better anime to fit these cool beats to.Deadman Wonderland is occasionally fun, but it’s closer to BTOOOM! than to . If doom, gloom and sadism are impressive you then you find some enjoyment here. I wouldn’t even recommend it for people who are into violence. The brutality is never stylish, never cruel in a way that stays in the mind. It’s halfway there and the result is just unpleasant. It’s a bad Nu Metal song – full of angst, noise, ‘brutality’ but no fun or depth.2 killer lolis out of 5 viewer.

It's not necessarily the most original story out there, but it gets the job done. There are a couple plot twists thrown in in the first half of the season to keep you guessing as to the identity of...the Red Man (the person who killed Ganta's class), but these don't extend as long as I'd have liked. The story moves along at a reasonably fast pace but ends on a scene that makes me wish there had been another season, or at the very least another episode or two to wrap things up. I found the second half of the season more interesting than the first half of the season, mostly due to more plot development and better characters being introduced. There is more humor in the first half than the second half, but it's still present here or there. Overall, I'd give the story a 7/10The art in Deadman Wonderland was very good. The character designs were strong, the animation was of a high quality, and I found the show to be pretty pleasing to the eye, especially some of the fight scenes. Emotions were conveyed pretty well, and I liked the stark contrast of the happy amusement park above ground and the dark, bloody underground where prisoners are put in battles to the death to survive. I'd give the art a 9/10.The sound in Deadman Wonderland was also pretty strong. The OP was amazing, and some of the score that plays throughout the show is very strong (especially Track 5: DW28A (if you've seen the show you'll instantly recognize it)). The voice acting was pretty good - I watched it dubbed and found all of the character's voices to be pretty well done - Greg Ayres as Ganta was an interesting choice and worked well, and it was a treat to hear him as it was a very different character than that of Sunohara in Clannad, whom he also voiced. I watched a bit in Japanese audio as well for comparison purposes and also enjoyed that, so whether you prefer dubbed or subbed you should be happy. The sound gets an 8/10.The characters were a bit divisive for me. I really liked certain characters (like Senji, aka Crow, Nagi, and Karako), but others were lacking (such as Ganta, Yoh, and Toto Sakigami (Mockingbird)). Ganta felt like the stereotypical, weak teenage boy who has to discover what it means to be strong through fighting and standing up for others. This isn't necessarily bad, but it's been done before and been done better. Other than not being a huge fan of the main character, I also feel like Yoh had some interesting developments but was just completely removed for a few episodes despite still being around. I didn't really get why they wouldn't have one of the more important side characters not show up for the final few episodes, but oh well. Finally, Toto immediately struck me as very interesting, but was never really developed beyond the initial introduction and one or two other scenes. This left a bit to be desired. But it wasn't all bad, and as I previously mentioned there were some pretty good characters to invest in that kept me entertained. Overall, because of missed opportunities, yet still a few redeeming qualities, I'd give this a 6/10.And now we are nearing the end of the review. I found the series to be pretty enjoyable despite a few shortcomings, which include some lacking parts of the story and missed character opportunities. However, the fighting and gore was well done, as were the emotions portrayed by the main characters, and I was on the edge of my seat for a large part of certain episodes - I watched the entire show in just a few days, which displays that it kept me coming back for more. I really did want to know what happened in the next episode, what happened to the characters, and to see if their big plan would actually work. I caught myself jamming along to the OP and admiring the art direction and character design. For these reasons, I would give me overall enjoyment of the show a 8/10 (as I tend to put a greater emphasis on story and characters than art and sound).I would recommend the show to anyone looking for something with an entertaining premise with great animation and sound, but to not expect too much of the story or characters. In the end, for the reasons summarized in the last paragraph and previous sentence, I would give Deadman Wonderland an overall score of 7/10. the Red Man (the person who killed Ganta's class), but these don't extend as long as I'd have liked. The story moves along at a reasonably fast pace but ends on a scene that makes me wish there had been another season, or at the very least another episode or two to wrap things up. I found the second half of the season more interesting than the first half of the season, mostly due to more plot development and better characters being introduced. There is more humor in the first half than the second half, but it's still present here or there. Overall, I'd give the story a 7/10The art in Deadman Wonderland was very good. The character designs were strong, the animation was of a high quality, and I found the show to be pretty pleasing to the eye, especially some of the fight scenes. Emotions were conveyed pretty well, and I liked the stark contrast of the happy amusement park above ground and the dark, bloody underground where prisoners are put in battles to the death to survive. I'd give the art a 9/10.The sound in Deadman Wonderland was also pretty strong. The OP was amazing, and some of the score that plays throughout the show is very strong (especially Track 5: DW28A (if you've seen the show you'll instantly recognize it)). The voice acting was pretty good - I watched it dubbed and found all of the character's voices to be pretty well done - Greg Ayres as Ganta was an interesting choice and worked well, and it was a treat to hear him as it was a very different character than that of Sunohara in Clannad, whom he also voiced. I watched a bit in Japanese audio as well for comparison purposes and also enjoyed that, so whether you prefer dubbed or subbed you should be happy. The sound gets an 8/10.The characters were a bit divisive for me. I really liked certain characters (like Senji, aka Crow, Nagi, and Karako), but others were lacking (such as Ganta, Yoh, and Toto Sakigami (Mockingbird)). Ganta felt like the stereotypical, weak teenage boy who has to discover what it means to be strong through fighting and standing up for others. This isn't necessarily bad, but it's been done before and been done better. Other than not being a huge fan of the main character, I also feel like Yoh had some interesting developments but was just completely removed for a few episodes despite still being around. I didn't really get why they wouldn't have one of the more important side characters not show up for the final few episodes, but oh well. Finally, Toto immediately struck me as very interesting, but was never really developed beyond the initial introduction and one or two other scenes. This left a bit to be desired. But it wasn't all bad, and as I previously mentioned there were some pretty good characters to invest in that kept me entertained. Overall, because of missed opportunities, yet still a few redeeming qualities, I'd give this a 6/10.And now we are nearing the end of the review. I found the series to be pretty enjoyable despite a few shortcomings, which include some lacking parts of the story and missed character opportunities. However, the fighting and gore was well done, as were the emotions portrayed by the main characters, and I was on the edge of my seat for a large part of certain episodes - I watched the entire show in just a few days, which displays that it kept me coming back for more. I really did want to know what happened in the next episode, what happened to the characters, and to see if their big plan would actually work. I caught myself jamming along to the OP and admiring the art direction and character design.

Sorry in advance if it isn't the best or if any one disagrees. Don't worry there are no spoilers.Before beginning Deadman Wonderland, I had read several reviews and didn't have the highest expectations because many people had given it around 6 stars. So naturally, when I watched the first few episodes, and I couldn't disagree more. I was like: This anime is the shiz.It was so promising, left so many questions and had me on the edge of my seat. It couldn't be that bad, could it?It was when I hit around episode 6 onward, that...I completely understood what they meant.Talk about disappointment.It became super messy, adding the most uninspired characters I had ever watched. Like, don't get me wrong, I didn't hate them all, in fact I liked the protagonist (despite him crying half the time) and I liked Shiro and their other friend, but the others... not to sound heartless, but they could all die, and I wouldn't care less. They were so one dimensional and generic.I haven't read the manga, but from just watching the anime, I felt as though they were trying to squeeze in as much backstory as possible, trying to make things really emotional about how inhumane this 'Wonderland' is. It worked to some extent, mostly because it was kinda just sick, but seemed almost unnecessary when placing these backstories on such bland characters. For the main part, the direction they took was kinda just wrong. LIKE Y U FOCUS ON THIS AND NOT THE PROTAG'S STORY OR HIS BACKSTORY????At least every time the protagonist cried it reminded me of Edward Elric.Overall I give this anime a 6 because of it's fall from grace. Such potential was lost and now I think I should just read the manga because it's probably a lot better than this.If you like blood and gore and all that jazz, sure, why not watch it? But if you are looking for an anime that will hit you in the feels for the long term, not the best choice.

In 2011, Deadman Wonderland aired and it follows this formula to a great extent.The anime's premise sounds fairly intriguing: Shows in which the protagonist has to escape some sort of facility always have a great amount of routes it can take. In this case, it is combined with the popular Battle Royale trope due to which the potential viewer probably has high hopes towards the anime. Unfortunately, Deadman Wonderland is not able...to fulfil these expectations. There are many issues with the logic the show and its characters want to apply which make it easy to see many plot holes and conveniences. The reason why the protagonist, Ganta, is convicted is because he allegedly slaughtered his entire class. However, there is no evidence other than him being the sole survivor that point to him being the criminal. Of course, one could claim that the court has been bribed but this does not explain why the whole world seems to think that he is the murderer. While it might have been possible for this anime to be a good show the viewer can simply enjoy without having to think a lot, it tries to be edgy and tense and consequently results in nothing but pretentiousness.The anime tries to combine several characteristics other popular anime have, such as the aforementioned prison setting, a childhood friend, gore, super powers, contrived plot twists and tournaments. This, combined with a protagonist who is basically a toned down copy of Neon Genesis Evangelion's Shinji, is apparently what the writers think makes a good anime. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Everything the anime presents seems to be loosely tied together without having any impact apart from being nice to look at. What is more, a majority of the events occurring in the anime do not seem to be of any importance whatsoever. They do not contribute to the story's progress or the protagonist's development. In fact, the setting, which is built in the anime's first half, seems to become more and more irrelevant as it goes on.Not only the protagonist is a generic character but also the supporting cast has no remarkable traits and merely consists of annoying children and other bothersome characters. There are anime where you cannot decide who to root for because both sides have understandable reasons to win. In this case, it is similar with the unfortunate exception that you want both sides to lose because of how horribly written every character is. While it is interesting to see what varieties of abilities they have, you do not feel connected to them since they lack any form of characterisation and the viewer consequently does not sympathize with the characters when they die.That being said, thanks to decently entertaining battle scenes, the fights between the characters are somewhat enjoyable, but still very predictable. In most cases, they end due to someone developing super human strength for no apparent reason.As mentioned above, the soundtrack is remarkably good. Not only does the background music fit the anime very well but the opening theme has to be one of the catchiest songs there is. Since Romi Park and Hanazawa Kana voice the anime's main characters, there is nothing one could complain about in the cast either. The animation is also very fluid and the art style fits the setting without a doubt.In other words, if you want to watch an anime with cringe worthy, melodramatic moments that heavily relies on shock value and has hardly any positive characteristics other than its soundtrack, you might enjoy Deadman Wonderland. However, since this probably is not the case, I ultimately cannot recommend this anime and suggest that you watch something else instead. to fulfil these expectations.

Deadman Wonderland is Manglobe's contribution to the long line of series that specialize in hyper-violence. With a grim outlook on people and a sadistic tenancy to put its characters through the wringer mercilessly that matches its visceral violence, Deadman Wonderland is an unrelenting bloody nightmare. However, while it does succeed at shocking audiences, it sacrifices not only well structured narrative, but a sense of humanity. The end result is a satisfyingly lurid, but hugely uneven storm of blood and violence.Right from the beginning the setting and circumstances...of the story fill us with dread. Our protagonist Ganta Igarashi witnesses the mass murder of his middle school class by some super-powered being, and then sent to prison for the grizzly crime. The prison he is sent to, the carnival themed Deadman Wonderland, is hell on earth. The murderous inmates and ruthless guards seem to have it out for Ganta; the warden himself is responsible for fabricating evidence against him. On top of all that Ganta is developing a horrifying ability to weaponize his blood. Ganta's world has fallen apart, he is subjected to cruelty which exceeds torture, and this misery seems inescapable. The show exudes this hopelessness with every frame, and really this is the shows greatest strength. The world of Deadman Wonderland is as harsh and cruel as you will find.Backing up the grim atmosphere are the some strong technical merits. Deadman Wonderland is a dark and vividly gruesome nightmare; the things it depicts are as incredibly unpleasant: blood is spilled, limbs are ripped off, and eyes are gouged out. Yet it is impossible to turn away. Even when there is not any violence, however, it is clear a lot of effort was put into the visuals. The prison looks like a colorful, but ominous carnival, complete with creepy looking animal mascots. The inner halls of the prison are cold, dark, and oppressive. The character designs are just as good as the background work; the designs are good and the faces are especially fun to look at when characters are going crazy. Likewise the animation is good, it looks fluid when it needs to show off, and shortcuts in animation are taken where they are least noticeable. The soundtrack does its job well, although aside the heavy guitar used in the brutal action scenes, the music is not particular memorable.The gleeful sadism of the show comes at a heavy price. There are not many characters that come across as likeable. Most of them are either certifiably insane or cold and heartless; possessing the ugliest of traits, and as such they are hard to feel for. Ganta is neither insane or heartless, but he is also a pretty boring lead, spending most of his time lamenting over the hell his life has become or how weak he is. Granted, he is reacting to his current situation the way a sane person would, but his struggle is not all that engaging because of his constant whimpering and lack of personality outside the usual male lead tropes. Which is a real problem, because the show desperately wants his struggle to be compelling. The only exception is Shiro, the mysterious and cheery  albino girl that befriends Ganta, though she squarely falls into the hyperactive childish girl archetype. Her cheery disposition is the only ray of happiness in an otherwise very miserable world. This isn't to say she is a very well written character, she can get annoying and like all the other characters in the show lacks complex emotion. However, her bright demeanor does make her stand out, and her darker character traits add a little intrigue to her.The character are not the only problem here, however. There is also Deadman Wonderland's plot. A lot of what happens in the show is kind of preposterous, if not downright unbelievable. It is more than a bit of a stretch that a prison would be allowed to put collars on inmates which would kill the wearer if they do not consume a special candy in a certain amount of time. It is even more unbelievable that a prison would be able to publicly execute inmates on an obstacle course in front of an audience that include young teenagers stupid enough to believe it is all special effects. All of this is done for shock factor in Deadman Wonderland, and it brings into question if the show has any understanding of humanity at all. Sure, people do shocking and horrible things, but they are not the mindless, bloodthirsty, and voyeuristic herd that this show depicts; and it is insulting in more than one way to the viewer to present them as such. This mistake in depicting people is not exclusive to Deadman Wonderland, in fact it is pretty prevalent in gore-fests. On top of that, the story does not know where it is going; ultimately coming to a sudden stop that is guaranteed to satisfy almost no one.As exceedingly violent and bleak Deadman Wonderland is, it is also entertaining. There is a kind of sick enjoyment of seeing the nightmarish atrocities of the show that is just undeniable. There is a thrill in receiving a shock, and this show definitely delivers on shock value. Still, it doesn't excuse the lack of human understanding which is prevalent in both the characters and plot. And it definitely does not excuse the meandering story line which ultimately goes nowhere. While it can be a gory fun, in the end Deadman Wonderland doesn't provide anything exceptional in the world of gore-fests. of the story fill us with dread.

However feeling of the art kept me going. On the first seconds, when 3 of them talked together, there was this background music and it already gave this sad, yet good feeling about the outcome and during the lesson BAM! Well I can't spoil it for you.Overall it gives off a good feeling, story is great, music is awsome and art is amazing, it is a must watch anime. "", 'If you like bloody violence and white girl butt, Deadman Wonderland was made for you. I was hoping the season finale would redeem a rocky last couple episodes, but it’s pretty much a mess. Some thoughts and my “cool” list.Instead of the good and fair critique I’ve become known for, I’ll just take a note from Nichijou and list, “Things I Thought Were Cool!” and I’ll also add a, “Things I thought Were Terrible!”Things I Thought Were Cool!Shiro was cool and she’s easily my favorite insane character of the Spring 2011 season. I enjoyed her character, and I’m not above saying I greatly enjoyed looking...at her boobs and butt all season. Although on a serious note, albino people aren’t attractive in real life. It’s true, look it up. It’s like anime has moe-fied albinism. I can’t imagine this series without Shiro though, seriously.The entire opening sequence is excellent. The song, animation and design were all put together beautifully. I enjoyed all the animation overall. The characters and most importantly, the fights, all looked good. I enjoyed a lot of the grimy-ness of the characters and the dirtiness of the prison, especially in contrast with the pretty shows like Hanasaku or Denpa Onna.I thought the lack of rainbow hair was cool. Besides Shiro and Kanako with their white locks, the show had some good hairlism (hair+realism). I just made that up, but I could see that one taking off.Hummingbird was pretty cool. Crow was cool, but all his homoerotic scenes of girl-hating and being topless with Ganta were not so cool. His consistent slicing up of dudes was cool though.All the action in DW, in a slice of life and drama filled season, “seemed” cool. Although the action wasn’t always that great, it always looked cool. I’ll lump the violence and gore in with the action as well. While the censoring was surely “terrible”, all the amputations and bone-breakings were cool. The violence along with some rape and drug use made this show pretty shocking at times. Guitar Hero (featured in my terrible list) even drops the F-bomb quite a bit.There were some other cool things, but even more than things I thought were cool, there were…Things I Thought Were TerribleThe overall character design, and not just looks, but everything from origin stories to personalities through to their special abilities or “super powers’ if you will. I hated Guitar Hero. I hated Daida, the 3rd grader. I hated Owl. I hated the “super good with computers” guy.The show had some nice grown up themes and more mature plot style devices, so all the “super cool” character designs, for me, felt like an insult. I don’t need an evil priest who uses guitar guns or a little girl who uses a giant sword. They were terrible.Ganta I wasn’t thrilled with, but I understood the need for a weak-ass lead, but I thought Romi Park (Edward Elric, Toshiro from Bleach), was a terrible choice to perform his voice. I enjoy almost all of the seiyu’s former roles, but the whiny-bitchy tonal quality along with the whiny-bitchy character design, was just too much whiny-bitchy for me overall.While I thought the action was cool, I could use a little less shounen dialogue during the fights. More fight, less talk. Too much talk while trying to survive is terrible. Unless talking is your super power I guess.Does Cool kill Terrible? Or does Terrible kill Cool?Unlike the actual show, there’s no killing here. As evidenced by the scientific list above, Deadman Wonderland definitely has its merits. I’m not going to rail on the show, but I’ll just say that story isn’t told in a very tight, consistent way. It also feels very rushed. At first it just felt like a quick, fast moving show. Now that it’s over, it ended up just feeling rushed, as if they tried to squish 20 episodes worth of material into 12.I will be watching a second season however and waiting eagerly for Eating Cookies With Shiro, coming out on Blu-ray soon![Thoughts about final episode removed due to spoilerish tendencies: go to http://moemonster.com/2011/07/02/deadman-wonderland-episode-12-finale/ for full unedited review] at her boobs and butt all season.

It lacks most of the manga and it even hangs up on episode 12. The characters and the idea itself was really good and the setting of a prison can really bring in the watchers. BUT THE BIG PROBLEM, they tried to fit the anime within only 12 episodes while the manga is already up to 45+ chapters and its still ongoing. It only takes half the story of...the manga and they even took out some other characters. I\'d rather read the manga than watch the anime.

Read the manga too and you will see something horrific!I give it a 9 due to some of what I seen before this. I spent too much time on dark anime/manga over the recent years. And this made me realize similar art from recent anime.

This happen to our main character named Ganta, who is then is sent to Japan\'s first privately owned prison called ""Deadman Wonderland"" which was built in the year 2017 and is not only a prison but also an amusement park where people come to see prisoners compete in deadly games to earn prison currency just to eat... or they can save up for...other things too.Deadman Wonderland is not for the feint of heart (which should be pretty damn obvious because of the title) an I definitely wouldn\'t reccomend it to young \'uns because there is bad language, gore and all that jazz. Deadman Wonderland is set in the year 2023 and focusses on Ganta (the mc) and his life as a prisoner at this prison that will root out the weakling, chew them up and shit them out of a flaming asshole into a bucket of acid and to finish it off, get pissed on. Not many animes (or mangas) touch on the prison/prisoner topic, which is probably for a good reason like repetition but hey, Deadman Wonderland takes a prison and makes an amusement park where the death of prisoners is fun for the whole family! Now that\'s exciting!The characters in Deadman Wonderland are pretty interesting and a handful of them have supernatural powers called branches of sin which allows them to use their blood as a weapon, butnjust because they can us blood to kill doesn\'t mean they\'re safe from blood loss which is their price for such a power. Each branch of sin user has a different power that can be used with their blood. People who have the branches of sin are given nicknames after birds like Crow, Hummingbird, Woodpecker, etc.The soundtrack is amazing from the opening to ending and everything in between and the art style is really good and has a dark creepy tone when necessary.The OVA is a prequel to Deadman Wonderland and follows supporting character Kiyomasa Senji\xa0(千地清正) aka ""Crow"" who is an awesome character btw.Overall Deadman Wonderland is a really good anime but my only complaint is that 12 episodes really isn\'t enough to tell the story that was being told which was pretty obvious by the ending and there isn\'t a second season as of January 29, 2015. There needs to be a second season! *Sigh* I guess the only way to know what happens next is to read the manga, which I heard is really good and has 50+ chapters, I\'ll be sure to check that out at some point because Deadman Wonderland has one more fan as of now. If you like Mirai Nikki/Future Diary then I reccomend you check this out too because they\'re similar in many ways but also much different. Deadman Wonderland is less psychotic and more brutal than Mirai Nikki.If you have any questons, I\'ll be in Cell Block G of Deadman Wonderland other things too.Deadman Wonderland is not for the feint of heart (which should be pretty damn obvious because of the title) an I definitely wouldn\'t reccomend it to young \'uns because there is bad language, gore and all that jazz.

And by that I mean literally give it my hand because I\'m afraid they\'re going to cut it off like they did the rest of the characters in this show. All joking aside, let\'s talk about the Wonderland.I feel this anime could have had the potential to evolve into a burgeoning 48 episode Shounen or something, but it\'s unfortunately just the main 12 episodes and a single backstory episode on one of the characters. Even without reading the manga, I could tell that some severely important details were left out that really just leads to a...disassociation with the characters. While I won\'t deny some of the premises were really cool, the faults of this anime really lie with whatever sorry bastard decided they could fit a fictitious Japanese universe + character development + plot in a mere 12 episodes. These factors combined lead to a notoriously disappointing ""resolution."" Also, the main character\'s voice makes me want to shoot myself. disassociation with the characters.

In order to raise funds for rebuilding, Deadman Wonderland, the first privately owned prison, uses it’s prisoners as amusement park attractions. Igarashi Ganta is accused of the massacre of his classmates. Falsely accused, Ganta is tried and sent to Deadman Wonderland where he sees the horrors that lie beneath this amusement park.Story: 8/10The story and concept itself is very interesting. Though, I may be biased since I am fond of anime in the horror/gore genre. Anyway, Deadman Wonderland tackles the truth, no matter how gruesome it is. Between the blood and death,...you will not be able to turn your eyes away from the screen. The major factors in the story are revealed little by little, something I praise the mangaka for. While there are some plotholes and other things that may seem as a downside, I believe that it won’t matter that much, and if you find that the fact that this is overly violent or non realistic, then I say that you’re wrong. As I said before: It shows the truth as it is.Art: 9/10The art is attractive and surprisingly accurate. I have nothing more to elaborate on this subject.Characters: 9/10You will find yourself supporting the characters, feeling what they feel, crying when someone dies. The characters are introduced in such a way, that they will leave a big impression on you, regardless of their position in the story. All characters have their own unique pasts and traits, something you will come to enjoy.Overall: 8.5/10I think that anyone will enjoy this…if you are willing to sit through lots and lots of blood.

Deadman Wonderland is a masterpiece', ""DW is an anime about a boy, Ganta, unjustly accused of slaughtering his entire class and sent to an amusement park high-tech prison that would give Amnesty International a fit. Once there, he befriends a white-haired retarded-genki-girl creatively named Shiro as he fights for his life in a sort of private gladiator arena and proceeds to be exploited by everyone he meets. Wait, that came out wrong… let's just say he's fooled by everything and everyone.Story: This anime is only twelve episodes long, which helps to illustrate what happens when you try to park a bus in your garage. Adapted from a manga, there...is not enough time to explain everything or give side characters some depth. As a result, we have several animated paper bags running around with Tragic Story post-it notes stuck on them. Of course, the story is not really the main selling point for this anime. You are watching this for the gore fest and flying limbs and buckets of superpowered blood. So, by the time this ends and major plot points are left unresolved you don't really care.Characters: We start off with innocent Ganta who after a certain point it is in a state of perpetual shock and spends a lot of time crying. That is quite understandable: after all, he is surrounded by psychopaths and sadists, like a mouse in a room full of cats. He doesn't get very annoying, props to the seiyuu, and grows a bit of backbone by the end. Speaking of annoying, we soon meet retarded Shiro who is less intelligent than a dog but physically stronger than the Hulk. And runs around in a body suit so tight it must give her an awful wedgie. Shiro remains constantly annoying and occasionally frightening. The rest of the characters have their (twisted) charms but their backstories are too rushed for us to care. Musclehead inmate Senji is perhaps the most appealing character and wisely kept to a minimum or else he would have easily upstaged Ganta as the main. Finally, the villains are all sadistic , sociopathic cartoons but they are fun to watch as they try to grind poor Ganta to the ground.Animation: Stylishly done by famous Manglobe studio of Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy fame, now fallen on hard times and reduced to animating moe-tard shows to put food on their table. The opening sequence especially is beautifully done and the fight scenes follow with some nice details here and there. Visually, there are no complaints, it is a feast for the eyes (uh… maybe not quite the right expression in view of a certain episode).Music: Personally, I am fond of the opening song and I've only put it on repeat for about 2000 times. It's in English, by the way, and thankfully not in Engrish. The background music is also very good, with some haunting arrangements very well fitting the mood and splatteriness of it all. Some would say such a good music score is wasted on a mediocre anime like this. I think they may be right.Overview:After all the shock value is spent and the gore fest is over, this is actually a mediocre anime. It certainly isn't a keeper but if you like splatters and dismemberments and pretty, bloody pictures then give it a go. is not enough time to explain everything or give side characters some depth.

What is it that makes Deadman Wonderland attractive to viewers? Is it because the amount of gore and violence rivals that of just about any horror movie, or is there more to it? These are questions I found myself asking before watching Deadman Wonderland and found the answers rather quickly into the 12...episode series.Story: 8/10When I first started watching Deadman Wonderland, I thought that the only thing it had going for it was the massive amount of gore and profanity in the first episode. But the more that I watched the series, the more I saw a real plot begin to develop. The relationship between Ganta Igarashi and Shiro seemed very strange and unnatural at first but once the story started to delve deeper into Ganta's back story it really started to make sense. I could not even count how many times while watching this I was jaw dropped and confused by the vast amount of plot twists. While the story was very good it also progressed poorly and often left me wondering what was going on. Not only did the story progress poorly, but it also wasn't fully developed. The plot jumps all over the place and changes almost every three or four episodes. The worst part about the plot is where it left off, if this doesn't get a second season then this will be another anime that fell victim to not having a true ending. Even with all of the negative aspects to the story, I still give it an eight based on the true core of the plot.Art: 10/10The art quality in Deadman Wonderland was fantastic! The animation was very smooth and really helped set up the entire series. The dark colors gave it a very raw and gritty feeling that exposed the horrifying nature of the prison. The art played an integral part in the series and really set up the dark and somber tone throughout it.Sound: 10/10The music in Deadman Wonderland played just as big of a part in setting up the dark tone of the series as the art quality. The soundtrack really helped tell the story and was one of the best soundtracks I have heard in an anime. The music was really dark and creepy, it was almost as if the music was made for a horror movie. The music really made up for the parts that were lacking in the story.Characters: 7/10The main problem I had with the characters was that relationships were never really established and none of the characters truly developed besides Ganta. None of the relationships in the show were given time to develop which led to them feeling unbelievable and lacking a tight bond. Ganta's relationship with Shiro doesn't really makes sense until his childhood is explored and even then their relationship seems very confusing. His connection with Senji also seems very awkward and forced. I get that they share a bond based on respect, which isn't the first relationship that has been built on this, but it just doesn't feel right and is very rushed. Ganta's relationship with the resistance group also feels very rushed. He is only a part of the resistance for like a day or a couple of days and yet he has a great amount of faith and loyalty in the people that he has just met? It just doesn't feel natural. Moving on to character development which is very weak throughout the series. Ganta is the only character who I truly felt developed throughout his time spent in prison. The fact that he is just a frightened and cowardice child in the beginning who matures into a strong person who wants nothing more than to be able to protect his friends is great. I loved that, but because the anime is so short, none of the other characters get developed in the process.Enjoyment: 9/10I felt that this series was very enjoyable if you are either a fan of gore or aren't bothered by it. If you can't stand to watch very graphic and cringe worthy scenes than you most likely won't enjoy Deadman Wonderland. I thought that while the gore was overused, it also played a necessary part in displaying the terrifying nature of the prison. Not only was the gore necessary, but it also made the viewer sympathize with the protagonists of the series. The horrifying torment and abuse that the Branches of Sin users went through was very tragic and heartbreaking, especially for a character like Nagi. I highly enjoyed Deadman Wonderland for the disturbing portrayal of not only the life inside of the prison, but also for the corrupt people behind the whole thing. I felt that it sent a relatively real message about how people in charge often abuse their power.Overall: 9/10In the end, I felt that Deadman Wonderland was very much worth the watch and was very well done. As I have stated, I feel that the lack of character development, rushed plot, and the fact that the series felt unfinished at the end really are what kept this anime from being a must see classic. It would have been best if the creators had waited for the manga to finish in order to prevent the series from being left on a cliffhanger and gotten a fully developed plot. Instead we are left with an incomplete series that many people will view as “okay”. I gave Deadman Wonderland a nine because I found it to be highly enjoyable and one of the best core plots I have experienced in a shonen anime. Even though the plot did skip around a lot, it was a fundamentally great story that wasn't developed properly. In conclusion, I would highly recommend Deadman Wonderland to anyone who is looking for a more mature themed anime that is very unique and original. episode series.Story: 8/10When I first started watching Deadman Wonderland, I thought that the only thing it had going for it was the massive amount of gore and profanity in the first episode.

The art style was not appealing to me, and the plot was just empty to me.  Not a single episode excited me, and I didn't feel any attachment to the characters or the series itself.The character development is poor.  We didn't really get to know Ganta Igarashi's life and...character before his class was suddenly killed and he was blamed for it.  Not only did this damage his character, but it also damaged the plot because it seemed too rushed.  Even when he was placed within Deadman Wonderland, his character and life before imprisonment was poorly-written.Overall, I think that the anime is horrible.  Having heard such good things about the manga, I think that the anime had a lot of potential but the production staff didn't do a good job. character before his class was suddenly killed and he was blamed for it.

It started out extremely strong, but then soon started to go down hillRating List:Story 5/10: This is were Deadman Wonderland gets things a little wrong. The first episode drew me in with its interesting hook almost immediately, and I was extremely excited to watch the next episode afterwards. However after the first episode...everything started to go downhill. The story is quite honestly a bit of a mess, with enough plot holes to fit into a cruise liner. It's good when your watching it because there is action and awesome fight...scenes. But when you sit down and think about it, things don't always add up. Now one thing that the story does gain a few points in would be originality. It was the original presentation of the situation as a whole that was so riveting and interesting.Characters 8/10: The characters in Deadman Wonderland were actually rather impressive. Many of the characters were rather original and had interesting backgrounds and personalities. That is of course, with the exception of the main character Ganta Igarashi. Ganta is...well, a huge coward. There were many times during the series where he lacked any form of courage at all. Now, I will admit that the situation that Ganta is put into would probably terrify many people and drive many to the point of insanity. Perhaps I’m being a little harsh here, but there has to be some sort of limit to cowardice. Even though its understandable why Ganta turns out the way he does, it’s just not fun to watch a main lead that it always complains and crys. The other main character is Shiro, is rather peculiar. She really lightens up the mood when she is on screen because of her wacky personality, and she was quite fun to watch. She also has an air of mystery around her because of this. The side characters are the real stars of the show, and this is because many of them original and interesting.They all have their own motives and powers, many of the side characters are just completely insane, as well. One of the things that I really liked about the show were the interactions of a large group of the completely insane inmates trapped together in the completely insane prison. My main complaint about the shows side characters are that we really don't get enough of them. What I mean by that statement is that even though we are given many of the character’s backgrounds and many of the backstories and personalities are rather interesting; It feel as though my time with them is always cut too short. This is probably due to the fact that it's a 12 episode show, so it does not have enough time to flesh out all of its side characters. But it made is rather disappointed when the show introduces a new character with a really interesting personality and background, just to move on with the show.Art 7/10: This is another one of the areas were Deadman Wonderland did a good job. One of the things that Deadman Wonderland does right is atmosphere. The art style itself is very dark and creepy, it really fits the mood of the show well. There is also a good amount of detail put into the backgrounds, which really got a good feeling for the insanity of the prison itself.  Also the fight scenes are animated rather impressively. The animation flowed well, and there are some scenes that looked visually stunning. The show as a whole is very bloody and violent, and the art does not fail to represent the horrific things going on.Sound 7/10: As I stated before, probably the best thing about Deadman Wonderland is the atmosphere of the show as a whole. The music at some points really does help set that eerie mood. The soundtrack has a lot of creepy, bass heavy music that can really add to the feeling and aspects of the show. In almost all instances the music only enhanced the show, and really did a good job fitting the show’s mood. Add to that the openings and endings that are simply incredible, and the soundtrack is very impressive overall.Enjoyment 7/10: I have very mixed feelings when it comes to my enjoyment of the show. If you just turn off the inner critic within you and sit back and enjoy the show, then you will be pleased with the show. However, if you cannot simply sit back and experience the show, then the amount of plot holes will probably drive you insane. As for my personal enjoyment, I would have to say that it was decent. I could—for the most part—ignore the problems in the show.  This is due to the fact that I loved the feeling that I had while I was watching the show, and would probably watch it again if given the chance. scenes.

The music at some points really does help set that eerie mood. The soundtrack has a lot of creepy, bass heavy music that can really add to the feeling and aspects of the show. In almost all instances the music only enhanced the show, and really did a good job fitting the show’s mood. Add to that the openings and endings that are simply incredible, and the soundtrack is very impressive overall.Enjoyment 7/10: I have very mixed feelings when it comes to my enjoyment of the show. If you just turn off the inner critic within you and sit back and enjoy the show, then you will be pleased with the show. However, if you cannot simply sit back and experience the show, then the amount of plot holes will probably drive you insane. As for my personal enjoyment, I would have to say that it was decent. I could—for the most part—ignore the problems in the show.  This is due to the fact that I loved the feeling that I had while I was watching the show, and would probably watch it again if given the chance."", ""I'm one of those who haven't read the manga before watching the anime, so this review might not please you for this particular reason. I know most people who gave a negative feedback for this anime had read the manga before, so I'm just protecting myself here.Story : 8/10Deadman Wonderland has a very peculiar story, which is, as most people specified, very long, but due to the small amount of episode, very compressed. Fitting a story this big in only 12 episodes is a hard job and it wasn't entirely done well here.The story takes you to a prison which is also an...amusement park. The prisoners have to get points by entertaining people who visit the amusement park to get 'points' which are the prison's currency. Prisoners who are on the death row have huge necklace which slowly inject poison in their bodies, resulting in death after 72h. The antidote to this poison is found in special candies.A special place of the prison, the G block, is reserved for prisoners who have special powers, the sin branches, which allow them to control their blood in various ways (similar to Kyokai no kanata, in a way). Those prisoners are nicknamed with bird species names and fight for the pleasure of wealthy people in matches where the loser has to face a penalty game, resulting in the loss of one of his or her body parts.The story begins when the main character ends up in the prison after being falsely accused of killing all of his classmates. The person who killed his classmates is the source of all sin branches and infected him with it, giving him powers.You follow the main character in his journey in the prison, meeting people, adapting to the harsh prison and fighting, of course.Art: 8/10The art didn't impress me, nor did it disappoint me. It's a style that is very versatile and the special effects were well done, in my opinion.Sound : 9/10The anime being a thriller, you have to feel some anxiety when you watch it and personally, the sound was what did it for me. The very exciting music and the special effects surrounding the deaths and battles was very, very well done.Character : 7/10The lowest point of my review. The characters are very, very, very stereotyped. There wasn't an episode I couldn't compare one of the characters to another one from another anime. The main character is your typical weakling that becomes stronger, such as Naruto. His friend, Shiro, resemble the very naive girl you might find when watching animes like Kobato or Elfen Lied. Some side characters were very typical too, ranging from the muscle-head that ends up being kind as hell and the traitor who ends up being an ally. The characters didn't impress me and most of them didn't have much development. The main character doesn't have the time to develop much in so little episodes and this is a bit disappointing.Enjoyment : 9/10Deadman Wonderland is full of surprises. Surprises that do not always get explaining or conclusion. For my part, this didn't bother me. I had a very good time watching the 12 episodes and couldn't take my eyes of the screen.Overall : 8/10If you start watching Deadman Wonderland with the hopes of having all your questions answered, you will be disappointed. It is true and I will not be denying it, this anime is incomplete. Many questions arise when you start watching it. Who, how, why, what ? Most of them won't get answered. You will be left with an ending that isn't disappointing in itself, but it leaves you to believe that there will be more, but there won't. It's over.Some people get very angry with that and to be honest, I'm usually one of those people. For some reason however, maybe because the anime compensated in many other ways, I wasn't upset at all by the ending. I felt like the characters were left in a point where their story would continue and that I didn't have to know more, I didn't have to know if everyone would finally know the truth. I leave that behind and I leave it without regrets. I definitely recommend this anime for a boring evening, with a bowl of popcorn aside. Enjoy! amusement park.

Enjoy!"", 'Deadman Wonderland is about a boy who\'s framed for killing his entire class and is sent to an amusement park/ jail. Turns out, he is a ""Deadman"", meaning he has blood magic. Once his power is discovered, he fights other blood magicians and tries to clear his name. The premise is really cool, and the story progresses quite well for the most part. (the last arc goes off track for longer than I would\'ve liked.) The main character feels like an actual kid framed for murder. He gets upset often and really doesn\'t want to be there, but eventually he develops other opinions and outlooks,...it\'s quite nice. Besides him there is a large cast of characters, all of which are quite likable. However, don\'t expect any thing groundbreaking, this anime is just a really good time. In summary, Deadman Wonderland is a very solid anime that I\'d recommend to most. It looks pretty, sounds good, story is executed well, characters are likable, and I had a good time. it\'s quite nice. Besides him there is a large cast of characters, all of which are quite likable.

The guy who managed to cheat perhaps every single fucking organism on the planet? What I am going to present you is the anime version of him. If you don't know better, Deadman Wonderland will come to you as a pretty good anime. However it is perhaps the worst anime adaptation of all time.Now where do I start? I myself don't know seriously. But I guess that a brief introduction will do a whole lot of good for you guys who don't have a clue about it. Simply put it is a horror survival anime with some action. Now let me state...that this show requires you having well developed testicles since the blood, gore and the themes present are not for everyone.Ok lets begin. Simply put, this anime is a fucking piece of garbage. A colossal waste of time. Now I hear you say, 'The premise looks very good and and many people have said that it is good!' Unfortunately the people who recommended you this anime don't know anything about the source material which is perhaps one of the best manga I have ever read. It basically spits on the manga and shows it the biggest middle finger possible.Now I will focus on it's story. Incomplete anime in my opinion are equivalent to the offspring of Hitler and  Mussolini. But what gets my blood boiling is how much damage it does to the manga. The anime was used as a promotional thing. But how do you promote a fantastic work with the worst adaptation ever? Its fucking incomplete. It leaves you asking why you ever watched it since you could have spend the time changing your pathetic life and making yourself a better person.The art's pretty good. Animation is top notch and I have no complaints here.Battle scenes don't' cut any corners. Visuals complement the anime very well. Overall I think the animation is pretty solid stuff.Now give me a moment to tell you about the opening. Its the best fucking opening I have ever listened to. Its called One reason and there is no reason for you to not to listen to it. It's a rock song with excellent lyrics. Mother fucking excellent lyrics. Listen to the complete version of the song and you will appreciate how well it describes the feelings of the protagonists. Along with Lain's Duvet and Mirai Nikki's Kuusou Mesorogiwi, it is simply the best opening I have ever listened to.But before that let me tell you about the animation which accompanies the song. It's fantabulous. Sexy. Mesmerizing. Amazingly well made.Now you are probably thinking what a hypocrite I am. In the beginning I was bashing this anime and now I am praising it. But the previous paragraph was the last positive paragraph I have for this anime before I get back into my rage mode.Deadman Wonderland has decent characters. But no character development whatsoever. Whiny boy stays whiny. Before you attack me saying that it is only 12 eps long, a good anime can completely flesh out it's characters in 6 episodes. And then there are Mockingbird and Shiro. You want to know more about them. But the anime proceeds to give you the biggest cock block of all time.About the manga. I shouldn't do this on an anime review but I have to do so. The manga is all round excellent. Everything is superb. Read it. Like right fucking now. Then see the anime( please don't) and you will understand the disservice done by it.I apologize if this review came across as a rant. I sincerely tried my best not to make it look like one. Maybe it was on the border. But I had to say something about it. It's a mess. If it would have been longer with around 30-40 episodes and adapted faithfully, I would praised the living shit out of it. But I find myself criticizing it instead. My advice to you would be to read the manga and forget that this anime existed. that this show requires you having well developed testicles since the blood, gore and the themes present are not for everyone.Ok lets begin.

Chained to mediocrity not by its art, characters, or plot but by its lack of continuation. Leaving the viewer wanting so much more yet painfully asking ""that\'s it!?""Deadman wonderland is quite an interesting and entertaining anime. An anime with lots of promise for the road ahead. Its characters are portrayed very well, being dynamic with conflict and exciting yet with much mystery as to their full motivations and backstory. The story is captivating and entertaining to watch unfold, yet also holds an air of mystery as to how the story will end,...what conclusion we will find, and why the events of this story are taking place. (Not to mention the animation is quite good. However, admittedly I\'ve never been one to focus heavily on animation. To me, it\'s always more of a bonus if a great plot has good animation to go along with it, but it\'s not a requirement for a spectacular story.)  It draws the viewer in exceptionally well, getting you completely immersed in the story and world being built. As the final episodes come to a close, I along with many others imagined how the plot would continue, how our questions would be answered, and how this great spectacular start to a story would end, only to quickly find out it would never come to an end, another season would never be made, and that the 12 episode anime is a stand-alone. which is why this anime scored so nothing but slightly high-end mediocre in my eyes.Deadman wonderland was presented as a pilot, in other words as the first season of a series. It would have done this job extremely well, however, due to a second season never being greenlighted, this 12-episode anime acts ts as just a beginning of a story with no middle, conclusion or end. It almost feels unfair to judge the only season of deadman wonderland as a stand-alone title because it\'s clear that this was not the (honestly quite talented) writer\'s intention. It is clear the anime was supposed to continue on, the cliffhangers, unresolved mysteries, and questions at the end of the 12th episode prove this completely. However, there would never be a continuation of the story, and the series would come to an abrupt end after its short first season run time.In total, deadman wonderland is a story that could have been one of the greatest, maybe even a 10/10. As a first season, it was amazing, but due to it never receiving another season as intended it ended up being another abandoned project.A true shame for something that could have been so great.If on the odd chance that over a decade later they finally decide to make the second season I would gladly remove this review, but as it stands I would not recommend this anime unless you hold hope that the anime will someday continue. Hope sadly I do not have to make this anime, in total, just OK.

No court in the free world would sentence a child that harshly regardless of his crime. Above that, the evidence didn\'t add up in the slightest. The faked confession didn\'t even play part in the trial, this was released after the sentence. And in what world does a ""bomb"" cause cut wounds anyway.But lets say the trial never happened. Lets just say everything went like it should or that it was actually properly explained.The deadman wonderland attraction park is a farce. The...modern world wouldn\'t stand for it. There is a clear distinction between seeing special effects and somebody getting impaled on spears. There would be investigation upon investigation on such an show. Not to mention SEVERE censorship.Now once again, lets say somehow the world accepted this ""running man"" kind of entertainment. The anime still wouldn\'t make sense.How does a high school student make it through such a gauntlet without being the first to die? From what we see he isn\'t exactly the brightest, nor is he the captain of the track club.The way he summons his ""powers"" is a completely idiotic way of doing things. It would cause severe injury and permanent scaring. The physical pain alone would be a serious issue. There would have been better ways of doing this part.The main villain is never touched on in the first season. The entire first series can be shrugged off as simply ""setting the mood"".The characters in this anime lack any form of common sense, instead of going around the problem they go right through it.

And I see that one point of critique is the limited 12 episodes HOWEVER i do believe there's a very good chance for an extension of the anime for a second season and maybe even beyond that.Story: The story has a good premise, unlike most other anime's, when i watch deadman wonderland i'm not strongly reminded of any other anime series which serves as a testament to its originality. The series starts off very strongly in my opinion, however I did bring it down because a few times in...the latter episodes i did find myself doubting the plausibility of many scenarios, I know that almost everyone will rebut by saying its an anime its not supposed to be realistic, but suspension of disbelief is something writers have to strive hard to achieve as well. Final score for story is 8.Art and Sound are both outstanding in my opinion, the quality of animation is fantastic and the style and heavy use of red tones gives the series a very unique feeling. Sound is also pulled off extremely well, the music is always dark but ranges from a straight off heavy metal track to gloomy opera like style music, music choice is also usually spot on for the sequence.Characters are the one thing that lets down DW in my opinion, i started off feeling very sympathetic towards Ganta but as the show progressed i found myself caring about him less and less. Also the backstory to hummingbird i thought was a bit too weak and unrealistic, they went for shock but i find myself almost laughing at the stupidity of the sequence (i won't specify - spoilers). Shiro is probably the only character i find consistently interesting at this point in the series.Overall, i very much still enjoy Deadman Wonderland, and urge more people to watch it especially if you're a fan of darker stories such as elfen lied and higurashi no naku koro ni.9/10 final score the latter episodes i did find myself doubting the plausibility of many scenarios, I know that almost everyone will rebut by saying its an anime its not supposed to be realistic, but suspension of disbelief is something writers have to strive hard to achieve as well.

I feel it's along the lines of the Elfen Lied house of storytelling, using shock and violence not as filler, but as a driving force for narrative. Focusing on Ganta, aka Woodpecker, is just a normal boy, until his entire class is murdered. After being falsely accused, and then being beaten multiple times because of it, he finds himself in Deadman Wonderland, a sort of Jigsaw/Death Race/ Running Man hybrid of violent contests in the name of entertainment. That's all I'm going to say story wise, due to not wanting to...spoil anything, but it's definitely a series worth watching if you enjoy watching shock plot. spoil anything, but it's definitely a series worth watching if you enjoy watching shock plot."", ""Before I finished watching Deadman Wonderland, I took a look at the reviews. Frankly, I'm a little shocked. The entire series, I was bracing myself for the predictions of horrible characters getting worse...and never had to take the blow.I'm not going to go over each section, but something must be said for Ganta. He is a whiny, three-quarters-helpless little brat who seems to just be stuck in the ensuing chaos. And you know what? I consider that to be his saving grace as a character. He's realistic and believable in how his opponents normally mop the floor with him; to the contrary, the only thing...that irks me about him is how he eventually ends up on top. A traumatized schoolkid, his wimping out and bawling every five minutes both stick with him to the end of the series, which I appreciate deeply. I have had just about enough of starting out with a wimpy male lead and having the writers try to toughen him up. (Most of the time, they utterly fail.) They let Ganta be a brat and stay a brat. Huzzah for sanity. that irks me about him is how he eventually ends up on top.

Deadman Wonderland is an anime of, in my opinion, the horrible, the most terrifying, the most bloody.. When I finished this.. Eeeehhh!! It\'s.. you know... Scary..This anime is surely a dark one.. It has dark plot, dark character.. anything in this anime is dark.. It is surely for adults who are brave enough to watch this kind of stuff.. Maybe I am exaggerating a bit but this is what I felt..Well, where in the blue hell can you see a prison wherein a boy of I...think 15 years old will be imprisoned?

I meant it in a positive way and a negative way.. Let\'s discuss first with the positive side.. This is one hell of a story..

Might as well start with the premise, which is the best thing Deadman Wonderland has going for it.  Ten years ago, a massive explosion/earthquake engulfed and destroyed Tokyo.  Ganta Igarashi, a survivor with no memories of the tragedy, has led a normal life until one terrible day a sinister being dressed in red kills everyone in his class and shoves a red stone into his chest.  Summarily convicted of slaughtering his classmates on the basis of a confession he doesn\'t remember giving (due process for the win), Ganta is sent to Deadman Wonderland, a maximum security, privately-owned prison...that raises revenue by forcing its inmates to perform in lethal games for society\'s enjoyment.  As if this weren\'t twisted enough, Ganta soon begins to unravel Deadman Wonderland\'s dark secret.Sounds pretty good, or so I thought.  And really, for the first half or so, the show has a nice pace, quite a few layers, lots of refreshing profanity, and enough gore to make it 2011\'s Elfen Lied.  In episode 1 the wonderfully dark and ruthless Chief Guard Makina asks the new inmates if they have any questions, to which one responds, ""How big are those titties?"" and she says ""G.""  That pretty much sums up the mood of the show: over the top, profane, and often absurd.  This is by no means a bad thing if the story is good, but around episode 6 things start to fall apart.This was the first time I thought, alright, they\'re trying too hard.  Overkill on the language, too fast-paced, and too many characters and new events.  Maybe it\'s just the 12 episode curse, but it\'s hard to do drama when you\'ve barely finished building things up before you go in for the shocker climax.  And unfortunately, we see this time and time again in Deadman Wonderland, especially with the slew of characters that are thrown at us in the second half.  People start sacrificing themselves, or just acting insane.  The writers apparently realized this was an issue, but they chose the odd strategy of showing a character do something completely random, followed by a few minutes of their background to explain why that just happened.  About halfway through the show also decides to go from original thriller to typical Shounen, where the fights are 70% empty speeches about friendship and the value of life and 30% action.  No thanks.  I have to admit I sort of thought this might happen, because Ganta is one of the whiniest, annoying characters I\'ve witnessed in a long time.  Part of this is due to his voice - do not watch this in English!  I\'m sure I\'ve heard Greg Ayres\'s voice before and thought it was fine, but he really should never be cast as a main character again.  Romi Park, on the other hand, is a pretty good fit for Ganta, but regretfully Ganta\'s insufferableness runs much deeper than his voice.  I get that he is a teenage boy who has been thrown into this absurd situation, but he never really grows up or stops pouting, despite repeated promises that he will.  At least Shiro, Ganta\'s quirky, unnaturally powerful albino friend who seems to know him from the past, adds a bit of comic relief and quite a bit of mystery, but she\'s not complex enough to carry the show on her own and doesn\'t start to develop until the final couple episodes.It\'s obvious by the end that the writers were banking on the prospect of getting a second season: just get through these 12 episodes, and I promise we\'ll tell you a good story.  We\'ll tell you what actually happened ten years ago, why Deadman Wonderland really exists, why in the final episodes we\'ve introduced this new guy who is insane and also the strongest of all the deadmen but gets literally no development, etc., etc.  I didn\'t even need to look it up to know this was based upon an incomplete manga, because it was so painfully apparent.  It was also really unfortunate, because like I said in the beginning, this story has a good premise.  Alright, I\'m done whining.  Clearly I\'ve been watching Ganta too much.  I\'ll finish with a couple other nice things about the show: the OP is not a half-bad song, even for someone who isn\'t a fan of hard rock, and its animation is promising.  The animation overall is also very good; I especially liked how expressive the characters\' faces were, as it really brings out the pain and grief.  I guess that\'s it . . .  I\'m sure Deadman Wonderland is a great experience for some people, and at only 12 episodes, it\'s not as if I\'d argue against watching it.

Just realize that if you\'re looking for  plot and character development, you\'re in for a disappointment.', ""Seeing as deadman wonderland has brilliant reviews and is so commonly favored by blue exorcist lovers, this anime had plenty of promise for me. Sadly I was very disappointed.Story 2/10 although the story idea was brilliant, it was played out terribly. For an anime with a battle royale element, their into as much fighting as you would expect. Their where loads of gaps which where never rounded off and most of the characters that appear to have a big part of the story are ether not even mentioned again or dont have as big of an influence as you would think. The story doesn't really...amount to anything and you do not get a sense of satisfaction at the end.Art 10/10  1 of the only 2 things I liked about this series. Animation is fluid and consistent apart from at some occasional point but was very well done. ]I did not personally like the appearance of the main character partly because he reminds me of astro boy but that's a personal opinion.Sound 8/10 the only other thing I loved about this anime, the intro song is just fabulous and the sound in general is  great, one off putter would be the English vocals for the main guy, his voice is really irritating.Characters 1/10 despite their being some interesting characters in the series, they are bland and predictable. Character development? I don't think this even crossed the writers mind as their is little to no development. The characters at the end are more or less the characters you meet at the very beginning, just a tiny bit more bad ass.Enjoyment 2/10 idk, you just keep expecting something brilliant happen but what would have been the super exciting parts are played out in a very dull way. I did enjoy the battle scenes but they didn't even hit a 4 on my thrill-o-meter plus the pretty pathetic protagonist doesn't change so fight scenes get a little dull after 4 or 5 episodes.Overall 2/10 despite my personal distaste for this series, it would be unjust to give it a 1 as as I said, the art was fabulous and their where some epic battle scenes but apart from that, I can safely say that this is the first series that has under 200 episodes that I got bored of half way through I would behave dropped it but as mentioned earlier, I kept thinking something brilliant was going to happen but it never came. amount to anything and you do not get a sense of satisfaction at the end.Art 10/10  1 of the only 2 things I liked about this series.

It’s got its ups and downs. Is it overrated? Probably. Is it bad? I wouldn’t say so. I think most people will enjoy it to some extent and it's definitely great for people looking to watch a good violent thriller show.As for the story, it’s fairly descent but not flawless. So our main character Ganta is thrown into Deadman Wonderland. A prison where inmates fight each other to the death and endure deadly obstacle courses for the amusement of the public. I know. It’s sick. Especially when you see families with their...children in the crowd. Eventually Ganta discovers that he’s one of the “deadman” a person who can control their blood and use it as a weapon.I have to say that for me the best episodes were the first few of the show as they set up a great concept. The downfall is that the show takes a slightly different rout than we expect it to. Ganta gets involved in a few fights with other deadman convicts but eventually teams up with the other deadman of the prison in an attempt to escape and let the world know of all the horrors going on in the prison. (because apparently the citizens believe all the blood and deaths they are seeing are just special effects) I wouldn't say this story is bad by any means but I think it could have been much better if they had focused more on Ganta trying to prove his innocence and find out the identity of the “Redman” (the one who really killed all his classmates) while in the meantime, trying to survive the dangers of the prison. Now these things are not dropped. They are dealt with in the show, but I felt they treated them too much as minor subplots when they should have been the main focus of the story. The blood fights themselves are definitely cool and each deadman has different abilities and styles in which they use their blood which makes fights very fun to watch but I still would have rather seen them focus a little more on obstacle courses like the one in episode 2. The pacing is a little on the slow side but there are a lot of points in the show that should keep you interested nonetheless.Ganta is an alright protagonist. Out of nowhere he’s suddenly framed for the brutal murder of his entire class and is thrown into the worst prison in the world so he obviously starts off scared and confused thinking “What in the world just happened to me!?!” like anyone would but once he comes to terms with what happened, he has the drive to become stronger which makes him fairly admirable. His character develops slowly but it does develop.Shiro is pretty great. Fun, goofy, and loveable with a good amount of mystery to her to keep you interested and Kana Hanazawa does a fantastic acting job as always. Not to mention there's a jaw-dropping plot twist with her character around half way through the show that will more than double your interest in her.Minatsuki Takami aka “Hummingbird” is also a great character but there’s not much I can tell you about her without spoilers. I’ll just say that I though she was great and it’s a little disappointing that she got such a small amount of screen time. She got a lot of focus when she first showed up but then kind of faded away.As for the other characters in the show, they’re descent enough as they each have their own things about them that make them interesting. A lot of the deadman later on in the show seem to be fairly good people and it makes you wonder what they did that got them thrown into a prison like Deadman Wonderland and if maybe they were framed like Ganta.The art style is good and the blood fights especially are well animated. The soundtrack is also good and the opening fits the show well.As for the ending, the show is unfinished and requires a season 2 (which I’m guessing they won’t make) They did this with Claymore too, though Deadman Wonderland is a much more open ending than Claymore’s was. Basically if you want to finish the story you will need to read the manga, which is completed. I myself have not read it yet but I’m sure I will eventually because I do want to know how this show ends considering the ginormous amount of unanswered vital questions this show left us with. And who knows. It might change everything I’ve said in this review but for now these are my thoughts on this show.So if you haven’t seen Deadman Wonderland yet then this is a show I would recommend you see at some point in your anime life especially if your into this type of genre. I definitely enjoyed this show and I’d say watch it at your convenience but it’s not something I would really push anyone to watch.Thanks for reading. children in the crowd.

(because apparently the citizens believe all the blood and deaths they are seeing are just special effects) I wouldn't say this story is bad by any means but I think it could have been much better if they had focused more on Ganta trying to prove his innocence and find out the identity of the “Redman” (the one who really killed all his classmates) while in the meantime, trying to survive the dangers of the prison. Now these things are not dropped. They are dealt with in the show, but I felt they treated them too much as minor subplots when they should have been the main focus of the story. The blood fights themselves are definitely cool and each deadman has different abilities and styles in which they use their blood which makes fights very fun to watch but I still would have rather seen them focus a little more on obstacle courses like the one in episode 2. The pacing is a little on the slow side but there are a lot of points in the show that should keep you interested nonetheless.Ganta is an alright protagonist. Out of nowhere he’s suddenly framed for the brutal murder of his entire class and is thrown into the worst prison in the world so he obviously starts off scared and confused thinking “What in the world just happened to me!?!” like anyone would but once he comes to terms with what happened, he has the drive to become stronger which makes him fairly admirable. His character develops slowly but it does develop.Shiro is pretty great. Fun, goofy, and loveable with a good amount of mystery to her to keep you interested and Kana Hanazawa does a fantastic acting job as always. Not to mention there's a jaw-dropping plot twist with her character around half way through the show that will more than double your interest in her.Minatsuki Takami aka “Hummingbird” is also a great character but there’s not much I can tell you about her without spoilers. I’ll just say that I though she was great and it’s a little disappointing that she got such a small amount of screen time. She got a lot of focus when she first showed up but then kind of faded away.As for the other characters in the show, they’re descent enough as they each have their own things about them that make them interesting. A lot of the deadman later on in the show seem to be fairly good people and it makes you wonder what they did that got them thrown into a prison like Deadman Wonderland and if maybe they were framed like Ganta.The art style is good and the blood fights especially are well animated. The soundtrack is also good and the opening fits the show well.As for the ending, the show is unfinished and requires a season 2 (which I’m guessing they won’t make) They did this with Claymore too, though Deadman Wonderland is a much more open ending than Claymore’s was. Basically if you want to finish the story you will need to read the manga, which is completed. I myself have not read it yet but I’m sure I will eventually because I do want to know how this show ends considering the ginormous amount of unanswered vital questions this show left us with. And who knows. It might change everything I’ve said in this review but for now these are my thoughts on this show.So if you haven’t seen Deadman Wonderland yet then this is a show I would recommend you see at some point in your anime life especially if your into this type of genre. I definitely enjoyed this show and I’d say watch it at your convenience but it’s not something I would really push anyone to watch.Thanks for reading."", 'In the first episode, what appears to be an attempt to portray Ganta as ""in shock"" after the massacre of his class-mates seems a bit weak, and everything following that until the show\'s namesake feels rushed through.  As a result, the events of the beginning don\'t really deliver much impact.  Assuming what seems obvious, that this wasn\'t meant to be a major event so much as it was a necessary stepping stone into the actual story, I merely hoped that the show would come to deliver a little more.

Story 9/10The art in this anime is some of the best art style i have seen in a while. The art is slick, flashy and very very nice to look at especially when there is and intense part of the story but in some parts it may look a little bland with all the jail scenery and the black colors like black and grey. Art 9/10The sound in deadman wonderland is also top notch the sound effects of people being torn apart in the carnival corpse makes you cringe and ambient sounds throughout the world are very nice to listen to. And much like the art it suffers the same fate with the jail scenes and how it just becomes more bland and you feel like you have seen and heard this kinda stuff before. Sound 9/10One of the only and biggest downfalls (although not a really big one) is the fact that the protagonist is not one of the bravest characters you will ever see, but the character that picks up the slack for the main protagonist is the other main character names Shiro. She is one of the most weird funny and enjoyable characters of this anime even though you may be disappointed at first with the main protagonist there is no need to worry because there are many different characters that have an interesting back story. Characters 8/10My overall enjoyment was very very high while watching this anime all the episodes leave you with such feeling that you need to see what happens next in the story and it just has an addictive pull for you to want to watch the next episode and the one after that. Enjoyment 9/10Overall the anime has its good things and its bad things one of the things that disappointed me the most about it though was its length i believe it could have been much longer and they could have put more material in it. the story and great and compelling except for its few hiccups here and there, the art is top notch besides the bland parts in the prison, sound is the same thing with the art, very good but gets held back a bit in the prison scenes, the characters are enjoyable and interesting besides when you first meet the main character, he comes off as quite a wimp at first but that quickly changes, it has a very addictive feel to it where you want to see what happens next, overall i loves this anime and i think you will to. It is great and i could not recommend it more highly. Overall 9/10 manga that takes it further.   Story 9/10The art in this anime is some of the best art style i have seen in a while.

Unfortunately it got about half the episodes it needed, making it little more than a 12-episode trailer for the manga.The story deals with some very interesting themes and has many surprising twists that keep you asking questions. However, the ending cuts off about half of the ongoing plot threads, leaving many questions unanswered. They even start new arcs in the second-to-last episode that never get resolved. There was honestly huge opportunity for an epic ending that would put FMA to shame here, but it was pissed away.The animation and art is high-quality, the...music and voice acting are also top-notch thanks to the incredible folks at Manglobe.The characters are varied and interesting, but never get enough screen-time or development because of the rushed nature of the show. You have badass incarnate who's afraid of girls, a psycho monk who's trying to free people from the material world of suffering, and a sweet-loving albino girl in a bodysuit who hides a dark secret.If you're looking for a fast-paced action anime to pass the time, this is a solid choice, but it doesn't stand on its own as an anime, so you'll be forced to read the manga when it's over. music and voice acting are also top-notch thanks to the incredible folks at Manglobe.The characters are varied and interesting, but never get enough screen-time or development because of the rushed nature of the show.

It is gory and unsympathetic to it's characters. Usually.The first couple of episodes are very well done. These episodes got me hooked on the series and I immediately started to read the manga after viewing them. I am up-to-date on the manga, and because of this, I am more disappointed in the series finale than I would be if I hadn't read much of the manga. So many loose ends were not tied up at the end, though it would be impossible to tie them as this series is only 12 episodes long. The part that many...viewers were hoping to see was not included in the anime. Perhaps there will be a second season, though.Anyway, on with the flaws. Many people will say that the characters were the biggest flaw. I'm not sure about this. The characters were pretty one-dimensional, yes, but the anime wasn't focused on them. This anime focused on the story. The very twisted story. So yes, the characters were weak but I don't think that they break the series. Then again, you are either going to love or hate the main character, Ganta. He is a wuss. Though, he is easy to sympathize with, as he is a kid thrust into a horrendous world. His constant whining is annoying, though, and he does not develop very much through the anime. Hopefully, he wont grind your gears too much. I really enjoyed most of the other characters. They were stereotypical, yes, but they all had their dark secrets that made them a bit deeper and more twisted. Shiro, the main female character, is definitely the most interesting. Sadly, though, she doesn't really get to shine in the anime, as the series is so short.There are some absurd moments in this anime. Then again, many anime are outrageous. Just don't be expecting every detail to make sense.The worst thing for me, there is no sense of change in this story. Everything remains bleak. There are a few warm-hearted moments, but they are shattered quickly with more blood-splattering. This is enjoyable, in a twisted way, for many of us viewers, but it just gets predictable after so many times. If the series were longer, perhaps we could have seen some real progress.Onto the positives!This series is all about shock-factor. Is this actually a good thing? Well, it depends on the person. I loved watching every twisted moment in this series, and there are a lot of them. Even though it does get predictable, the producers pull off every gasp-inducing moment pretty well.The plot itself is actually pretty cool. It is perfect for all the madness that goes on. I realize that I'm making this anime sound absolutely horrific. Depending on who you are, it can be. But it does have some heart if you look hard enough, and it isn't nightmare-inducing. I suppose it is really just shock-factor.I enjoyed the art. The animation is smooth and the character-designs go perfectly with their stereotypes. Some very nice visual effects are used in many of the scenes, so that is nice.I loved the sound of Deadman Wonderland. Every voice was perfect for each character. Ganta's voice actor was especially great and is probably the saving grace for this character. Seriously, I think that Romi Paku was perfect for the role. The music used through-out the series wasn't overbearing and it usually worked. The themes are forgettable, though. The opening music, One Reason, is very pleasing to the ears. The lyrics are all in clearly-spoken English, and the song is really just perfect for the series. Even if you do not like the series, I can almost guarantee that you'll love the opening.I really enjoyed this series, but it is very lacking. The plotholes, the one-dimensional characters, the predictability... They are all very annoying. But I do recommend this series to anyone who is looking for a short little horror-story. viewers were hoping to see was not included in the anime.

There are far too many characters in this show for 12 episodes.  The dear friends Ganta spends the entire series grieving are ridiculously underdeveloped.  For this reason, every time he makes a big deal of their loss, I am disconnected from the emotional state of our protagonist.  The underdevelopment doesn't stop with Ganta's late friends.  In fact Shiro, the mysterious C2-esque character whom befriends our Ganta is the...most developed character other than Ganta himself.  Every time a character of interest in a particular episode is about to reach the climax of their involvement in the series, the anime gives a brief couple minute insight into their past, which does almost nothing to build a connection with these characters at that point.  Do you want to know more about the cause of the Deadman virus?  The director and promoter?  Shiro's alter-ego?  Other Deadmen?  THAT'S TOO DAMN BAD!!!!  Do you like Yoh?  Well that sucks because he disappears from the story for no reason.Needless to say, 12 episodes was far too short to develop the amount of story that they tried to do.  If the show fails to return for another season and really follow it to the end, it'll doubtless be because it's first season should have been twice as long for the same amount of story.I watched in English and always enjoy Greg Ayres's work.  The music was solid, though the ending wasn't very fitting.  And the artwork was simply sub-par for anything made since 2000, more so for 2011. most developed character other than Ganta himself.

People have said that this series has remind them of Elfen Lied with the same blood-and-gore factor added in but none of the existential creepiness you find after watching it (or reading it in case of the manga of that). I didn’t go in with high or low expectations. I just want to see if this series is turning out to be something to remember or to just past the time while you’re falling asleep.A massive...earthquake ravaged Japan\'s mainland and destroyed most of Tokyo, sinking three-quarters of the city into the ocean. Ten years later, the story shifts to Ganta Igarashi, a seemingly ordinary student attending Nagano Prefecture\'s middle school. As an escapee, a survivor of the great earthquake, Ganta has no memories of the tragedy and has lived a normal life and that all changes when a strange person covered in blood and crimson armor floats through his classroom windows. Grinning madly, the Red Man massacres Ganta\'s entire class but instead of killing him, embeds a red crystal shard in Ganta\'s chest. Within days of the massacre, Ganta is declared the sole suspect. Following a quick trial, Ganta is sentenced to death and is incarcerated in Deadman Wonderland, a massive theme park like prison.Okay, now the main character Ganta Igarashi is portrayed rightly as a character who knows he’s been wronged for what happened that day and like any teenager, he’ll be scared shitless of what’s coming to him as he goes into Deadman Wonderland (Speaking of that, is it me or does that sound like a rock band to you?) from the stuff he heard from his friends. Now, in the character development department, once Ganta enters the prison as a scared boy, as of now, he is still a scared boy. He does tried to defend himself against the prisoners but I don’t know if got anything to do with his whining, cracking voice or the fact you would be scared, too, if you see what he has seen in there.Shiro, or as I call her, my favorite character of the show. She is a mysterious albino girl who has the resemblance of one of Ganta’s deceased friends, who I assume he had a crush on before any of that happen.  She also possesses inhuman physical abilities and has an intimate knowledge of the prisonWhile the other prisoners are threatening, blood-thirsty, and/or murderous, Shiro’s mannerism is very playful like a child but she doesn’t go overly annoying about it. Matter of fact, if anything, it makes the show calmer than what it is now but the show is still tense on its subject.Other characters include Yō Takami, an ally of Ganta during his stay and his story was that he became a prisoner of buying his sister’s freedom with the Cast Points he received while playing these games of life and death, and speaking of his sister, Minatsuki Takami, also known as, Hummingbird, she may seem like the innocent, scared girl but when she show her true colors, damn, she can fight like hell out there and curse like a f***ing sailor while she’s at it. Oh yeah, one more thing, when hearing this version of TV, expect a lot of bleeps to happen on this show (think about that, people who wanted PSG on Toonami/Adult Swim).Halfway into the series, there is a rebellion group Scar Chain who’s determined to escape the prison and expose the illegal actions of the prison with themselves having their own struggles to deal with the prison, especially the leader of the group, Nagi.The animation is done by Manglobe, or as the previews quote, “From the studio that brought you Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy”, and the quality is shown to be not quite a visual feat but there was a great effort of amount thrown in, although the blood does like less bloody and more like fruit punch but that’s not a deal breaker, just a minor tidbit of the style. The opening music sequence used in the Toonami version was nothing more than a quick tease, only showing 20 seconds of the theme song. Why does Bleach airing in its umpteenth season has a full opening but Deadman doesn’t? The full opening theme sequence can be found on YouTube and that and the opening song ""One Reason"" by DWB feat. Fade completely fits the tone of the series and wow, it is glorious to listen in your ears but I can’t say the same thing to the ending song ""Shiny Shiny"" by Nirgilis. It’s a very calm and upbeat J-Pop song but hearing that after watching an episode feels like an emotion whiplash and for the voice acting for the English dub…..Greg Ayres as Ganta = mostly whiny but fits the character; Monica Rial = very decent as Shiro, one of the reasons why I like her in anime roles; Aaron Dismuke = last time I heard him was in Cat Planet Cuties, this is an upgrade from that; Jamie Marchi = somewhat okay but passable; Eric Vale = he tried.FINAL VERDICT: While it’s not a great series, I managed to enjoy the series regardless of that. Some of the characters are not very relatable but there is a good amount of character development even if it does go by fast with what little episode order they gotten.

A prison run not by the government but by a organization. Where people have to fight or survive in order to pleasure the visitors. It reminded me so much of films like gladiator but then in a new setting. I loved the storyline.Story:Well the story starts really awesome, people getting murdered and the main character getting accused of these murders. After that he is sent to a prison. This prison is not our everyday prison, this prison is for the people who are sentenced to death. There...are rules in this prison hard rules and those who do not obey them will get killed. These people know they are going to die one day, but they can live in luxury until they die if they play it right. These people can join the Karnaval and attend races in order to win tickets to buy food (witch they don't provide in this jail) and much more benefits. It is survival of the fittest.The problem I had with this story is; that this boy who is wrongly accused wants to take revenge. A nice start for a story but the way he is prosecuted is totally left out. The things he gets accused of are so unrealistic that it makes me wonder why everyone believes that he did it. Well that apart the story starts to kick of when we see people dieing and trying to survive in this hard prison. Were gangsters rule and guards take abuse of people.The story develops itself way better halfway the series, we get to see more blood and gore and more fan service. The story is pretty awesome. Although the big fights are lame, yes very lame we ought to see more and maybe this will happen if a season 2 comes out (witch I'm pretty sure of)Characters:The main character is a pain to watch, he is weak scared and not that clever he also looks a bit stupid (at least I did not like the way they drawn him). But that aside the main character did just enter a brutal prison so his reactions are most likely pretty normal. And I have to say that at some point he does grow balls and becomes a lot more relaxed than he was first.His companion is a girl, and something here seems odd, we see this girl is strange yes. But in this jail there are no girls allowed. It is the male section. But no one ever wonders why there is a girl 24/7 next to the main character, not even the guards. Well that aside this character is mostly weird and well I did not like her very much. You also don't get that much information about her, but she is a nice twist to the story and probably very important in the second season.The other characters are pretty awesome, but I cannot tell you anything about them since I will ruin your story experience.Verdict:The characters are decent in this anime, they are not memorable like Light or Lelouch were. But it is a decent short anime of 13 episodes with lots of blood and gore and lots of fan service if you like that. The anime is brutal (for example we see how they remove an eye) and it is something I never saw so that's nice. But the story isn't that strong it takes really long to get to the point they want to go. And then they stop with a huge cliffhanger witch could also provide as a real ending. But if it does then, well then they failed at ending the anime properly.The music is amazing tough so if you don't want to watch the anime just check out the OST. But overall it wasn't that much of a good experience. It is a anime you want to see if you have seen all the good ones already. I heard that the manga continues and that it is much better. I hope they make a season 2 and I think that after that season I can adjust my opinion, this anime for now leaves to many gaps open.Note:(This anime is censored on most anime sites so you won't see blood or fan service I had to see it without the blood and gore for most of the episodes. If you want to see it with blood and gore I advice you to buy the anime on DVD, since I cannot find a site were they show everything, and that sucks cause the blood and gore is mainly what the anime is about).Cheers Lucid are rules in this prison hard rules and those who do not obey them will get killed.

I like to think they producers left it open for anyone to speculate.Personally I found it...enjoying because of the strong emotions that are transmitted through the line of the story.Artwork is focused on drawing details with little support from lighting, as a result the few flashy scenes are not the cherry on the top. The animation is fluid throughout the episodes as well as some occasional scenes. I particularly enjoyed the female main character because of her refreshing simplicity both in behavior and in design.Cast consists mostly of prisoners which says almost everything about them. What raises interest is the reason each of them is here. Other characters seem plain but that plainness helps create an authentic story.I would like everyone that thinks of giving this anime a chance to abandon all doubt about it's enjoyability since it is an illustrious representation of its kind. enjoying because of the strong emotions that are transmitted through the line of the story.Artwork is focused on drawing details with little support from lighting, as a result the few flashy scenes are not the cherry on the top.

After I finished the anime I was angry and frustrated, it had so much potential. The story, art, sound and character immersed me right away and I think I\'ve binge watched it multiple times with different friends.The sad part is that the anime falls short compared to the manga. There is so much more to this story than what they ""stuffed"" into the given 12 episodes, which they in the last episode just ended without really a...good explanation. And as it still stands I don\'t know if there will be a 2nd season, and if it will be I am not sure how the anime will do it? I just feel like they left out some really important moments from the manga to really make the anime up to par with its manga. Which is a shame really. With that said I still can\'t with a happy heart give the story less than an 8, for the anime alone it probably would be a lower score, but my heart can\'t deny the potential it had, and that the manga have so.This is still one of my favs, but if you really want to know what this anime is good for please go pick up the manga.

A young boy Ganta get sent down for a crime he didn’t commit and ends up in a jail where nothing is normal. It’s certainly not original but Deadman Wonderland sets it stall out early on with graphic violence and strong language in abundance.  Deadman Wonderland is essentially a theme park with inmates taking park in various games to entertain the public.Ganta is a normal school boy but one day his whole class are brutally murdered by the mysterious ‘redman’. One thing you realise from the start is how deeply flawed this show is right from the...start. Ganta get sent down just because he was the sole survivor with virtually no other evidence. This greatly hinders the story going forward as to be honest it’s pretty ridiculous.Ganta himself reminds me a lot of Renton from Eureka 7. He’s a snivelling crybaby with few redeeming features. He learns soon that it’s everyman for himself and he can’t trust anyone. He later meets a fellow inmate Shiro a mysterious white hair girl with incredible strength who has a soft spot for him. Shiro is by far the most interesting character in Deadman Wonderland . She is the only person who seems to care about Ganta.One thing you soon realise is that characters are introduced and killed off with no real development but given this is only a short series it is understandable. As the series progresses Ganta learns he has a special power that allows him to manipulate his blood into a deadly weapon.  This is called a tree of sin, and we soon learn that there are other inmates who posses this power and they are soon pitted against each other in fights to the death.Action scenes such as fights are handled well but they seem to have set out to make this as gruesome as possible and at times it feels a little exploitive.  I have no issue with violence or strong language but there needs to be a point to it in Deadman Wonderland this isn’t always the case. In terms of animation the show is quite stylised and has some interesting character designs. It flows smoothly and has pretty high production values.Characters are mostly a dislikeable lot, and most are killed off pretty quickly. Ganta does show signs on manning up towards the end of the series and there are hints of what Shiro really is.  Once again the show is hampered by its short run as we only see character development right at the end.Sound is pretty decent on the whole and the show has a solid English dub. The title track is pretty horrific J Rock nonsense and I found the closing track much better.Deadman wonderland is quite enjoyable in places and throw up some interesting questions that are never really answered. The show has a very open ending and you don’t really feel much has been achieved other than a high body count. Deadman wonderland will probably not get a second series and you can’t help but feel the show would have benefitted from a longer run.  It’s certainly could and probably should have been better.

Unfortunately, this was not a shitty one I enjoyed.All the potential was quickly ruined by the borderline autistic pale bitch. I have no clue what her purpose was. Maybe there was a reasoning behind her character but unfortunately the series ended in the middle.Fuck Deadman Wonderland and all of you who enjoyed it. Thanks. ', 'Before I start off with this review, I will start by saying that I\'ve read the manga of Deadman Wonderland and loved it. When I heard that there was an anime series for it, I got excited, but I was a bit disappointed.Deadman Wonderland is a 1-cour series, meaning it only had 13-16 episodes. The manga itself has around 56 chapters, which could equal around to about a 2-cour series, 24 episodes or longer. But, I understand, that at the time when Deadman Wonderland was airing, that all chapters weren\'t released. That\'s fine.  But to this date, we still haven\'t got a second season....Trolls?Story: 7/10The story itself is actually pretty good. Igarashi Ganta is framed for murdering all of his classmates in a tragic accident, when in reality, it was some Red Man that murdered all of his classmates. I mean, we even saw him dragging someones head across the floor. Is that murder? Nah. Seems fine.The Red Man struck some weird shit into Ganta. It was some red thing, but to me I call that the ""Red Deadman Converter Thingy"", The Red Man struck that into Ganta and shit went down after that.Ganta faced court the day after, or month, I don\'t know and he was found to be guilty. So, he went to a prison called Deadman Wonderland which is a prison filled with Deadmen, which are people with the power to wield weapons using their blood. Cheating, yes I know.He meets a lot of prisoners there (what? really? not like its a prison.) and becomes friends with like 3 of them, the others are dicks.Art: 8/10The art is okay. It sticks to the art style of the manga, so I really do not mind it at all. I think it sticks to the art style of the manga, I cannot remember. They both look similar, so who cares.Sound: 6/10The opening of the anime is good, and some background music tracks are good. Everything else... eh...Character: 6/10There\'s not enough character development in this series, except maybe just Ganta\'s development. None of the other characters really developed that well, considering how well they were handled in the manga.Overall: 5/10The anime was a huge disappointment after reading the manga, which I loved. I know I shouldn\'t compare the two (Manga and Anime) but I do. Should I compare? Yes, I actually think I should.  Adaptions to Manga are generally not that good but anything in my list that is above a 6 is good. So, Deadman Wonderland is not that great of an adaption.The manga of Deadman Wonderland is much better. If you\'d like the ending not to be a trolly piece of shit, then read the manga. The manga is a great series and is one of my favorites til\' this day. These have been my opinions and I have no idea if I\'ve convinced anyone to watch/read it. If I have, congratulations.

It is constantly explaining the mysteries while introducing even more mysteries. Just when you think you have everything figured out, it will switch it up. In other words, the show is not as predictable as you would think. I watched Deadman Wonderland shortly after watching Another, and while the storylines of the two anime are very different, there are a lot of similarities between the two.As a final note, I feel must mention that the song during the closing credits of Deadman Wonderland fits perfectly. It is...a beautiful calming song that helps bring you back from the intensity of the episode.You might enjoy this if: You enjoy violent, spectated, fights to the death, i.e. Hunger Games, The Running Man, etc.You might not like it if: You are part of the younger audience or are turned off by blood and gore.

Actually, this anime has - in my opinion - a really good soundtrack overall. My personal favourite sounds though, were the theme song and the Corpse Carnival (or Carnival Corpse, as it would be announced in the subbed version) song (which incidentally reminded me of Cannibal Corpse - a nod to it perhaps).As for story and art and characters, I\'ll only say that they were involving in the 12 episode run. They could be better, because it being Shonen it is understandable that Woodpecker is the weak link in this anime and only in the 11th and 12th episode does his potential start showing (to marvelous effect, in my opinion). Wretched Egg is an interesting character who they held back on for a future second season which (alas) will never happen. So far as the place itself is concerned, the art style captures the... brutal, gorish, sickening perspective that was the aim and intention of this anime. It has a few faults here and there though (episode 4 for instance, has a scene in which Woodpecker\'s face injury was omitted even though the remaining scenes maintain it again), but so far as the use of ""horror closeups"", and character development is concerned, it captured the mood. There are moments when it tends to have a witty angle, although I think that these moments were unnecessary as a result of which they distracted me from a good anime overall.Credit where credit is due, I actually enjoyed this 12 episode anime for its unsettling atmosphere - but I\'d watch it only as a fan whose psyched by the theme song and the Carnival Corpse events.

If you liked Eureka Seven, you would probably like Deadman Wonderland too, just not as much. Both animes have a confused main character who have a mysterious girl by there side who give them hope in hard times. Also the guy who wrote the manga version of Eureka Seven, wrote the manga for Deadman Wonderland, so he probably bounced a few ideas from eureka Seven into Deadman Wonderland.The anime is quite gory, but the gore is neccesary for setting the tone of the environment the characters are in.Plot:...Ganta the main character, has been framed for slaughtering all his classmates, when in reality it was a mysterious character called the redman.The redman spared Ganta, and gave him a power that lets him control his blood into a weapon form.Ganta gets put into a privately run prison where, there are normal culrpits and others like him. In order to survive in this prison you need candy ( otherwise you die by posion already given to you), which is obtained by winning battles and other gory things.

Its unique and terrifying.It has something other stories lack and thats uniqueness.The thought of a middle school student framed for the murder of his best friends,and being sent to a prison filled with psycho  paths,and having to fight to the death,is so surprising,so warm and yet so chilling.The only thing that pissed me the hell off was the fact that the anime got cut short.It had a unfinished feel to it,do to low view stats.the manga still is a 10...out of 10,because its still running.But for the anime i cant say the same. Its a 9 of 10 at best,because there was so much unexplained.The anime left out so much good materiel,and it was a shame because it had awesome art and good english dub voice actors.Over all i was left with a emptiness in  my heart after watching the anime.It had such good side character but did jack shit with them.In the manga it has the full ending,more back story on the supporting character and over all better.I would personally recommend the manga over the anime.do you agree with me?  did you think the ending to the anime was shit?if you dis agree send a message to me and tell me why.  :Dthanks for reading have a awesome day. out of 10,because its still running.But for the anime i cant say the same.

Also love the sound editing, it was done nicely.Character- It has lots of unique and interesting characters that are cool in their own ways. The protagonist is cool, you got to like a character that doesn't give up even if he knows his opponent is stronger than him. I got to say that my favorite is Shiro.

Deadman Wonderland (DW) is notable for two things, these being its soundtrack and its portrayal of gore. I've seen anime with plenty of blood and innards (i.e. Parasyte, Tokyo Ghoul) but that in DW is more... how do I put it? It's more gruesome. I reacted more viscerally. Death and dying runs wild in DW, which is entirely to be expected given the setting -- a prison created to entertain the...public with macabre games involving the inmates. The soundtrack matched very well, I thought, and was good to listen to. I look forward to adding the OST to my fourth YouTube playlist, Resonant Thunder.DW is only 12 episodes long and let me tell you straight out, the story doesn't end after episode 12. I'm glad DW originated from manga because apparently the anime didn't reach even the halfway point in the manga plotline. Still, the way certain characters can fight is interesting and fun to watch, reminiscent of the fights in Parasyte. One character -- Crow -- is so cool, in my opinion at least, that he merits a spot on my favorite character list. The way mysteries are slowly unraveled is well done; that's always a necessary component of any good story. The animation as a whole was well-crafted, there weren't any VEEs, and the characters were well designed.Obviously with only 12 episodes any character development would be weak.

You get to school, everyone's sitting in the desks, but then all of the sudden, a crazy guy in red shows up and starts butchering everybody! Your best friend's head just rolled past your feet! The girl you had a crush on has her blood spread all over the chalkboard! You see the man coming your way and you pass out due to shock...Then you wake up, and you're in handcuffs. The public believes you committed this heinous crime, killing all of your...friends and classmates at school. This is what happens to Ganta Igarashi, the main character of Deadman Wonderland.\ufeffStory - 7/10After being framed for this sadistic murder spree, Ganta is shipped off to an insane prison called Deadman Wonderland. This facility is roughly half theme park, half prison, but all crazy. This setup is very intruiging and each episode throws more and more into the pot in attempt to add depth to the events at hand. Soon we discover Ganta is of a breed of people who can manipulate their blood and do so to fight. There are also mysterious things going on behind the scenes and higher ups in the prison have their eye on Ganta. This is all effective in making Deadman Wonderland more interesting at first, but so much is going on here that it makes the big flaw of the anime stand out more. This is one of those shows that lacks resolution at the end. It's extremely rare for any story to be able to successfully leave loose ends and feel gratifying, and Deadman Wonderland is not one of those special cases. Everything goes nowhere and it makes the anime feel pointless, even though the build up and journey to the end was fairly good. The only thing that even feels remotely like a resolved arc is the one involving some secondary characters that you got introduced to more than halfway into the episode count. It all screams for a second season, which I don't deny would be a good idea, but unless that happens this ending is horrid.Animation - 7/10There's this constant little skipping in the animation here and there. I thought this was an effect at first but I noticed it just seems like lack of budget or shoddy animation. It's pretty distracting and holds back what is otherwise a pretty decent animation job. There isn't anything great here really but nothing bad either. Character designs are as basic as the characters, except for Shiro, who has a pleasantly unique look. The effects on the Branch of Sin superpowers have a fascinating tech-looking design to them that works surprisingly well. The action is pretty good and on display very often being one of the main highlights of the show.Sound - 8/10Voice work is all solid. Deadman Wonderland is so over the top both in violence and dialogue that it could have been utterly horrible if some good actors weren't behind the characters. The lines are just off the wall at times but the delivery makes it believable to a point where it's actually fun to hear these characters be so vulgar and foul-mouthed.The soundtrack is surprisingly good, even if it's very standard in the use of the songs. You pretty much know after two episodes when you'll be hearing certain tunes chime but none of it is bad. The opening theme is actually one of my recent favorites I've heard in anime. The ending theme however, feels out of place and also breaks the serious mood that most, if not all episodes end on. It's a really happy go lucky song, there's nice lighting and a ferris wheel in the background. It would be downright whimsical if it was closing the curtains on almost any anime but this.Characters - 6/10The cast is what's going to lose the show many viewers. The characters are all stereotypes we've seen in one anime or another and very few even have one quality of any value. Ganta is the inferior whiny male lead incarnate. He feels like a black hole of everything that can go wrong with this trope. Even though the audience will feel sorry for him starting out, there's just so much time spent crying and not being good at anything that Ganta never makes up for his flaws. Shiro is the cutesy, dumb, obsessive girlfriend type, but she's got white hair so you know there's more to her than you think. Shiro spends most of her time eating and when she's not eating she's being irritating.The side characters are full of cold and violent people who are all crazy for no reason. The villains all feel the same, just adding to a number of things generic about Deadman Wonderland. The only characters that were really interesting are Nagi and Karako, a pair introduced very near the end of the show who honestly feel like they could've been the center of a much more interesting plot than what we have.Overall - 7/10If you're looking for a short anime that's got lots of solid action that isn't completely mindless, with some foul language, gore, and you don't mind unfulfilling endings, Deadman Wonderland might be quite enjoyable. For most though, it's going to come off as a standard anime that doesn't offer much. friends and classmates at school.

I really liked the entertainment 'carnival/circus' theme of the games mixed in with the death/horror, it was very much like a clown massacring a bunch of kids, with cute music in the background. Again, some people will dig this, some will not. (I must note that Shiro's character reflected this very thing to a tee once you find out more about her).The characters were driven with a passion due to their horrible surroundings. This caused them to become strong, emotionally as well as physically.In addition, the majority of the characters were very three-dimentional as you find out a lot about them as people due, mainly, to flashbacks. The flashback method which was used within the story makes it a bit easier to emphasise with some of the characters, especially those with bad pasts.As more and more characters get put through an emotional rollercoaster, so do you.I usually don't care so much about the sound and will skip an opening theme if I've watched it all the way through already but the Deadman Wonderland OP I watched/listened to every single time. It fit the anime pretty well but the heavy emphasis on the guitars, and the genre of the song in general, made it look more like an action anime than anything else (rather than a horror or a drama), which isn't necessarily wrong.Originally when I reviewed this anime, I could find no negative aspects, but since calming down as well as talking it over with a friend, that isn't true. One thing that annoyed me was the plot - it became quite unresolved and characters' aims became distorted or forgotten. However, if there's a second series, it will make this series better as it feels incomplete.At the end of the day, if you want to be shocked, WTFd and don't mind extreme forms of death and/or questionable methods of mutilation, give this a go.

Every chance we get, we sit in front of the T.V. to watch either someone escaping from a tank full of spiders, some girl bitch slapping another girl or the next stop for a spaceship and its crew. Probably (and sadly) the most popular of all television is reality T.V. I know it, and you know it to be true. We enjoy watching real people each week do crazy uncontrollable stuff just to gt attention because they are having a shinning moment. Now imagine if some dude took the concept of a bitch slapping another bitch and...some dude trying to escape from a tank of spiders and combined them into one reality television extravaganza and  you will probably get ""Deadman Wonderland.""DW (as I will call it for short) started off as an interesting survival/wrong man story. A young high schooler innocently sits in his classroom with his friends, joking and laughing about the next field trip. When suddenly a guy dressed all in red smashes through the window and kills everyone in the classroom, except Ganta. He is arrested and charged with the murders, (idk how they could possibly thought one kid could of done this, I mean that room was a disaster) and is sent to hell on earth, the prison/fun land known as Deadman Wonderland. And this were the really interesting stuff happens, Ganta is put to the test, as he must survive the brutal murders that occupy this prison, as well as survive the games they have the prisoners play. This stuff is great, its brutal and intense, kind of like how Shawshank Redemption would be if crossed over with  The Hunger Games. its a perfect example of taking reality T.V to far and showing that we are not far from showing killings on T.V. Then... it goes down hill.It starts to develop this story. Giving Its main character this background that makes little to no sense. Somehow, Ganta is connected with the white haired girl Shiro, who is this playful gitty girl who can suddenly turn into this deadly assassination. The problem is, there wasn\'t enough time to fully develop that. There is so much other stuff going on, like a group of deadmen trying to escape prison, but are stopped by this group of people called Undertakers who are the only ones who can defeat the deadman and there special powers to turn their blood into weapons. Suddenly a huge cast of characters introduced and the show is already half way over, so it feels rushed and the final climatic battle, is anticlimactic.DW starts off interesting. Pitting its characters in a battle of survival that earns them candy that keeps them alive, while the loser gets a piece of their body part taken off. it was brutal, it was bloody, but it was something different. But then it went in the direction of Bleach or One Piece, were one to many characters are put into the mix,  certain things are never answered. (Who was the Red Man!) certain characters just disappear, never to be heard of again. And the last two episodes were it should of been an awesome bloody fight, ended in a useless monologue and an anticlimactic fight. I liked the first half of DW, but the second made no sense and was rushed. It needed more episodes and hopefully will get a second season. Also the opening theme in English dubbed version is one of the worst I\'ve ever heard.

Pitting its characters in a battle of survival that earns them candy that keeps them alive, while the loser gets a piece of their body part taken off. it was brutal, it was bloody, but it was something different. But then it went in the direction of Bleach or One Piece, were one to many characters are put into the mix,  certain things are never answered. (Who was the Red Man!) certain characters just disappear, never to be heard of again. And the last two episodes were it should of been an awesome bloody fight, ended in a useless monologue and an anticlimactic fight. I liked the first half of DW, but the second made no sense and was rushed. It needed more episodes and hopefully will get a second season. Also the opening theme in English dubbed version is one of the worst I\'ve ever heard. Too bad.', ""The anime takes place in an absolutely fascinating setting of a prison turned reality-TV theme park where spectators watch the prisoners kill themselves and each other. And there may be more going on at the prison than it seems.Sure, the premise has been done before (i.e. The Hunger Games and TRON, just to name a few recent examples), but as a sucker for the trope of whole-cast-in-one-enclosed-space, this anime worked really well for me.Our hero, Ganta (voiced by Romi Paku, who was Ed in Fullmetal Alchemist), is framed for the murder of his entire class and then sent to the Deadman Wonderland prison, where he...meets an otherworldly little albino girl, a conflicted kleptomaniac, and a whole cast of nasty and cool characters.In his spare time (between bouts of fighting for his life using his own blood as a weapon), Ganta tries to catch the villain who really killed his friends.I quite liked Ganta and Shiro, but my favorite character was Yoh, even though he wasn't in the last few episodes much. meets an otherworldly little albino girl, a conflicted kleptomaniac, and a whole cast of nasty and cool characters.In his spare time (between bouts of fighting for his life using his own blood as a weapon), Ganta tries to catch the villain who really killed his friends.I quite liked Ganta and Shiro, but my favorite character was Yoh, even though he wasn't in the last few episodes much."", ""Now at first i really liked Deadman Wonderland, good start in my own personal opinion.The story was very good, there are many problems with it and some things i think they just went to far with, but made a certain amount of sense from the situation they were in.The art was great, i really enjoyed the effort put into the little things, there were some things they left out on but other than that it was very gory but you'll understand more of that when you watch the anime yourselves.The sound i personally dont have any complaints over, it was outstanding, sound effects of...the fight scenes and the ambient sounds of Deadman Wonderland. Which is quite rare i normally hate ambient sounds as i get distracted rather easily.Characters had some issues from a personal point of view, great never the less, the later characters really suited the environment they were in. Can't say i liked the main character too much for the first half, but it got better later on.I totally enjoyed everything except one particular scene which even for me was a bit too much, real or not and i love those kinds of things. Reason why i watched anime as a much younger age :D but there is a limit to everything. But it was great.Overall going from the scores thus far it is a 9/10 I recommend this anime for those among you who enjoy gory animes with creative ideas for a power, i have not come across something that has used this idea which who knows i might get told otherwise.Anyways it is quite gory the themes are quite 'degrading' and very much so dark, even creepier is the 'promoter' does it all with a smile.

But easily caught the interest of the viewer which is a very important to making an TV show or any story for that matter.Even if some of the details are missing, the anime still delivers the feeling of the manga in my opinion, it is a very well structured story topped off with very unique but memorable characters,...great visuals, fight scenes that keep building up in action and awesome sound effects.The story had great unexpected twists that were really surprising (which I wont spoil for you) and included a lot of emotion and character to the story which is my favorite thing about Deadman Wonderland.

The story line was very original and Pleasing but the farther you got into the show the more confused you became. Battles happened, people died and you didn't know whether to be sad or pleased. so much terror in a short amount of episodes.  This anime is dark and twisted rarely is there humor. it was agood show with an ending that makes you gasp! enjoy (only for people that can handle lots and lots of blood) "", ""Deadman Wonderland was a bit disappointing for me. Don't get me wrong, it's a actually a decent anime but this could have been adapted into something a lot greater. This had potential but the lack of a certain character and other aspects leave the show almost impossible to carry on. I read all 51 (I know theres more, although its on a hiatus) chapters of the manga and let me tell you, the manga is far better than the anime. The anime feels to rushed, especially at the end. If you're going to watch the anime before reading the manga then you'll most likely be...pleased with the series but if you read the manga first, like me, then you'll most likely be disappointed. Too many loose ends for the anime to end and too many mistakes for the anime to be continued. In Japan, the anime did not do too well compared to the manga so a second season is unlikely. The only way for the show to continue is if they somehow incorporate one important character in a random arc but that seems highly unlikely. And for fans of the anime, Genkaku is definitely not the main villain... Too me this seems like a short anime that's a teaser for the manga. This had possible potential to turn into a 25+ or even 50 ep anime but they squished about 21 chapters worth into 12 episodes.... The story had potential in the manga but is left at a huge cliff hanger in the anime, the art is very good in my opinion, the sound is good, the characters were all pretty interesting, the enjoyment for me was meh-so so, but might be more exciting for you if you haven't read the manga first.

If they just stretched it out a bit it would of been so great, but then don't know the reason why they only made 12 episodes (maybe money problem) but you should stream not buy, then again the box looks really sexy. "", ""Facing irrationality doesn't mean not feeling fear, but rather possessing eyes that gaze upon fear and standing against the world.Deadman Wonderland seems to be built upon quite an interesting premise when you look at it. Deadman Wonderland is the name of the only privately owned prison in Japan but it’s a prison with a twist. The prison makes its convicts face off in brutal matches to the death just in order to amuse on looking crowds of people, the general public! It’s like gladiator fighting in the 21st century except you’re not making it out alive, sooner or later you will die. Death is literally...around every corner, if you aren’t killed in the games, good luck surviving with all the other weird and twisted inmates, this isn’t quite the show it seems!Now, the main story revolves around Ganta, we start the show with him in class and just talking with his classmates, everything’s pretty normal, I mean what could possibly go wrong? Proceed with weird floating mad man with powers to appear out of nowhere and throw around a bit of red magic and end up murdering everyone in the class. A few limbs here and a bit of blood there, didn’t see that coming now did you? Oh and of course don’t kill Ganta, no, no, we can’t be killing the main character in this show in the first minute now can we.Ganta then wakes up and is accused of being the killer since he’s the only one alive and a strange clip of him confessing to the murders just randomly pops up. After a few court trials (which probably have empty-minded people on the panel of judges- such irrational people) he finds himself sentenced to death and joins Deadman Wonderland as a death row inmate. Oh and did I mention Ganta doesn’t look like he’s older than 12, so they’ve gone on and sentenced this 12 year old or so kid to death, wonderful. Ganta meets various people in the prison where no one is what they seem like and is sucked into a fight for survival, which is riddled with twists, not that all of them make very much sense. Over the course of this show he also finds out he has a superpower and slowly learns to control this power and there we have it ladies and gentlemen, that is more or less how this show starts out and to be honest, it’s actually quite interesting, even if it does seem like things are just going from bad to worse to this poor kid so fast, so fast.Character wise I think this show is actually rather interesting, it has a fair share of characters it seems to fit in over the short span of episodes and it does make you get to know them more- not that you’ll necessarily like them all. Ganta himself isn’t the tough kid with a temper or the macho man, in fact, he is portrayed as a weak character who has a very strong will and strong desire to keep pressing on in adversity. So often during the show when he is just getting the crap beaten out of him, you do often feel a bit a pity for him. He can be a bit frustrating at times because he isn’t always the best at thinking rationally and keeping his cool but you can’t really blame the guy after all he has been through, although there are times when his emotions and actions can leave you frustrated, mainly because he seems to have very wild mood swings in the depressing and dark end of the spectrum. The other main character who we are introduced to is called Shiro and she is by far the best character in the show. Shiro just pops up around Deadman Wonderland and often follows around Ganta and asks him to play with her and just generally spend time together. Shiro has a very peculiar white look about her (Shiro means white in Japanese) and combined with her eyes, something doesn’t seem quite right about her. However, with her super bubbly and extremely childlike behaviour you can’t seem but to really get behind Shiro, she keeps the show interesting and gives the show a very interesting angle. Also, she’s actually really strong and when I say strong, I am probably seriously understating her powers, something is most certainly not right about her, so given how her childish tendencies, it’s best to stay on her good side. The other characters all have their own distinct stories and aren’t all moulded around typical character traits- so this is certainly the best part of the show.There is a lot of gore in this show, some of it is the usual blood spattering everywhere and limbs flying around although sometimes they really do go into detail with some scenes and actually touch upon some very serious situations without holding back much on the details. It’s the kind of gore that I would describe would make you really uncomfortable at times and while you get used to it by the end, it certainly is enough to put some people off the show.Now in terms of how this story goes about unravelling itself, this is the aspect where it seems to take a nosedive. After building itself up with an interesting story, surprisingly good characters and some sort of direction, the plot just fails. It sinks into its own giant plot holes and leaves you very frustrated at the end since it just simply does not tie up any loose ends and keeps the viewer thinking, wait….what? It’s not the good type of open ending where you are left to ponder what could’ve been, it’s the kind of ending which screams we didn’t have enough episodes to fit everything in, so we will just forget about half the things we introduced earlier. It’s a shame because this was actually quite a mature show and had quite a lot of potential but I’m afraid the show does the plot no justice at all and you can tell the show is falling apart towards the end.I’ve mentioned this show is mature, it certainly does touch upon some topics which require a lot of maturity to understand, which is nice to see in an anime, even if the topics can be a bit uncomfortable to deal with. However sometimes they have some terrible one-liners which are just so out of place and unnecessary that it proves to be an annoyance and you will know when you’ve heard them, don’t worry about picking those up.The OP and ED are both okay, the ED especially really creeped me out for some reason probably because they showed Ganta and his school friends hanging out, which just made me feel uneasy. In terms of a soundtrack, this show did well enough in this department too, so no issues here. The art was mediocre, nothing was wrong with it, if anything, the most impressive aspects for me were the character designs for some of the characters and especially Shiro, not for details but for the styling and just how it seemed to work, even if it wasn’t very flashy. The colours used in this show are mainly quite toned down and mellow, so the palette they chose from was very muted and dark, which helped with the idea of the show.Overall, this is a show with massive potential which really could have gone on to be something great, however it is riddled with missed opportunities and sometimes it just seems to give up with the idea of closure or at least even explaining anything. Also the awkward script writing can spoil the flow of things at times, so in the end it’s a bit of a love-hate show. It’s certainly well worth a watch to enjoy something which feels a bit different to your standard anime, however be prepared to be disappointed. I would love more shows like this to be made in the future, except they should actually have a decent end.Final Score: 6.7Tukky12=)In terms of recommendations, I would say “Another” is well worth a watch, the show also has a lot of gore and an interesting pull with the story, however in the case of Another, it actually has quite a thrilling end.

If it was nothing more than a fighting anime, intended to just be blood, guts, and explosions, It would have done just fine. In fact, if that\'s all you want, don\'t read ahead, just go watch it. Instead, however, it tried to look into some deeper human emotions and failed. As I said before, the action scenes are actually pretty good, and the mixed soundtrack fits the fight scenes quite well (Shiny Shiny, the closing theme, is still stuck in my head). However, the people in the scenes besides the battles were...mediocre at best. Cliché after cliché, trope after trope, stereotype after stereotype, the characters couldn\'t have been more unoriginal if they cosplayed another anime. The brawny guy who\'s crazy and likes to kill people, yet for some reason conveniently shows mercy to the main character. The strong willed leader with a dark past and family problems. The supporting cast members that have a shorter lifespan than a redshirt or a Walking Dead side character. These things bothered me, but one bad area can\'t kill an anime, so what else broke it for me? The story. A boy survives a tragedy and gets magical powers, and has to use them to a). Atone for the tragedy b). Protect the innocent c). Seek revenge. It\'s been done a million times, and that\'s not necessarily a bad thing; new animes and movies have this theme all the time and work it well. The thing is, Deadman Wonderland didn\'t do too well at it. The power growth is ridiculous, with Ganta jumping from the bottom of the barrel to the strongest deadman in the wonderland in a matter of seconds, with no intermediaries whatsoever. The main nemeses had potential to be tools in exploring certain aspects of insanity, but the flashbacks lasted about 3 minutes at the very longest, just telling the viewer ""I got hurt this way so I hurt someone else this other way."" No elaboration, no development, just that and boom-battle. Gratuitous violence sugarcoats the writing, and the idea of blood as a weapon - literally - shows potential.

However Deadman Wonderland shows the possibility of the dehumanization of the future, which in my opinion is scarier than any other dystopian future. People's lives being used for entertainment really makes the viewers look deep into their own huamity.  The only thing that makes Deadman Wonderland weak is that there is not enough of it, and I truely believe that there should be a season 2. This is a very underrated anime and must be watched. "", ""My sister recommended this anime to me due to my love of the psychological/horror genres. I'm sorry to say that I'm rather dissapointed... This show had a lot of potential but the execution was terrible and it was crammed into an unorganized 12 episodes.The story could've been good but it wasn't. It started out on a high note than it went downhill into cheap deaths and characters with 5 second screen time. I was looking forward to the ending hoping Ganta would face the red man (and if you watched the show you know how complicated that whole situation would've been) because THAT would've...been a shock value. That ended up dissapointing me more than anything else. The arcs were strangely put together going from battles to the death to choppy backstories to the happily ever after approach?The art was very good, I enjoyed the character design and the gore wasn't too overwhelming. Theye also put good thought into color symbolism and how it affects the overall mood.The opening and ending were enjoyable. Nothing wrong there but not my favorite either. The opening bothered me a little though cause it looked.. fan made if that makes sense. Like an AMV. I liked the photography idea for the ending. Cute.Characters were all very interesting, I was hoping I could make one of them a favorite- but none of them had nearly enough screen time. Their stories seemed incomplete and the seemingly important characters didn't come until later. Speaking of later- what the hell was Ganta doing for the first 10 episodes? I get the whole underdog thing they were going for but his character is incredibly unrealistic and he would've died the second he stepped foot in that place. Also- the people running the place knew the (spoilers?) video was fake so why did they think he was so strong and special? His powers were lacking- the only thing they wanted was to test what the red man implanted.Enjoyment level is entirely biased and tbh I got bored after the fourth episode. I completed it just to see the ending (which drove me to write this review in the first place) been a shock value. That ended up dissapointing me more than anything else.

It's a story so good it makes people complain there aren't more seasons.The Art: You honestly can't complain. Clean shaders, amazing animation, style and effects.Sound: Amazing. Still memorable after all these years. Intro is iconic.Characters: very enjoyable to watch and need more of. Only the side-side characters suck. But that's in almost all anime.The difference with the manga and the anime is that as usual the anime sometimes does not give enough screentime to other characters in this show, like giving an indepth episode to each Deadman, etc.The story:Some complain about this and...that overall forgetting that the manga continues passed these 12 episodes. This first season only had time for 1 arc and that was divided between the main character finding his power, the prison break, and establishing the main character's inner strength. So I won't judge too harshly on Deadman Wonderland for these reasons. I think they honestly delievered in showcasing the manga into anime, but the only problem is we need MORE. More prison games, prison fights, prison character backstories, more Warden, more lore, more world building.However, just because Season 1 does not meet all these lengths, DOES NOT mean Deadman Wonderland doesn't have the capacity to fill its own gaps. There is enough content, but only 1 season.Season 1 ends with the main character finally learning to want to fight back. A question he didn't even know why during the 1st encounter with Shiro. So even in just 1 season, this main character goes from being a Neon wimp like Shinji to an actual developed character with his own answer to show for.Deadman Wonderland gets an automatic 8 for its enjoyment, and a 9 because it just touches the line between being a good show and a GREAT show with the amount of content it has to be built on. If this show was truly horrible, then there wouldn't be the desire for so many people to see more of Shiro, the main character, or any of the cool looking Deadman.9/10 Shiro did nothing wrong. that overall forgetting that the manga continues passed these 12 episodes.

I wish I had.  Instead I wasted a fair chunk of my precious hours away from schoolwork.The story is the same old tired shounen crap, spiced up (a few more seconds in) with a quadruple helping of gore and some sadistic Japanese game show cruelty on the side.  The whole thing feels like it is shouting, ""look at me!  I\'m more violent and horrible than all those other shows!  I\'m the cool one!  Look! Look! Look!"" Deadman Wonderland tries...too hard and only ends up bad. too hard and only ends up bad.', 'Allow me to start off by saying that the reason why I began to watch Deadman Wonderland was because of how amazing the manga adaptation was. Because I had set my expectations for this anime so high I was consequently pretty disappointed with its turnout. With that being said, let me jump straight into the review.Story(8)As you may or may not know, Deadman Wonderland revolves around the main character Igarashi Ganta whom is framed after a mysterious character, later known to be the antagonist called the Red man, slaughters his entire class. He is unfairly charged for murder of his classmates just because he...is the sole survivor and is sent to Japan\'s first privately owned prison, Deadman Wonderland. After this life changing experience, Ganta soon learns that he has gained an unbelievable ability that allows him to shoot his own blood (in the anime called ""branches of sin""). Ganta uses his power to survive through the prison defeating other deadmen (other characters that can also use branch of sin) in brutal carnival corpses to one day hope to face the red man and gain his revenge. The story was something I really enjoyed about the series but because the anime is only 12 episodes long, it only contains the first arc (up to chapter 20 +/- in the manga). That being said, a lot of stuff was rushed in the anime making it not as great as it should have been. There are a lot of mysteries yet to be answered after the 12 episodes which hint a second season. But after seeing the first, you may not want to even see another season.Art(8)I dont really have much to say about the art other than it wasn\'t too bad. It has a decent amount of blood and violence which honestly was all I really liked about the show itself (besides the story). The blood was gruesome and the colors blended nicely with the atmosphere. The characters were also drawn nicely so thats pretty much all there is to say about that.Sound(7)The opening to the series fitted the anime very nicely. It did a very good job of setting the tone for the anime and gave you an early idea of the horror and psychological mental atmosphere the anime contains. I thought the voice acting was well done and the background music was fine throughout the series.Character(6)Ok so here is where the series begins to lose some major points. Let\'s start with the main character, Ganta. Ganta is just a pathetic, whiny, and weak character. Because the anime only had 12 episodes and had to rush everything, it didnt give the main character any time to grow. There was little to no character development and it was just hard to fall in love with the main character. Not to mention all the other characters in the anime had even less screen time. Deadman Wonderland had a good cast of characters with great potential but sadly none of it was shown.Overall Enjoyment(7)Overall, this was just another average anime series. I really do feel bad for all the manga fans of the series because this anime had a lot of great potential to be amazing. But hey, its only 12 episodes and if you enjoy blood and gore then it isnt really a bad choice to just kill the time. is the sole survivor and is sent to Japan\'s first privately owned prison, Deadman Wonderland.

Now that is getting better (they picked the rights for Sym-Bionic Titans now!!), I decided to pay my respect to Toonami by reviewing Deadman Wonderland. Based on the manga by the writer of Eureka Seven, the anime adaptation of Deadman Wonderland is a loose adaptation of it\'s source material, just like FMA 2003 series and was released as part of the Toonami block but already ended since it\'s only 12 episodes. I already saw the whole series and I even bought the complete series on DVD, I find this show...to be my fun guilty pleasure but with some flaws of course.Deadman Wonderland takes place in Japan where 10 years ago, an earthquake shattered half of Japan\'s cities into the ocean and that event was named as The Red Hole, as we see a student named Ganta Igarashi, who has a normal life and has great friends. Then fate takes a turn for the worst when a mysterious man in red appears out of thin air and kills the whole class, leaving Ganta as the only survivor. When he wakes up at the hospital, he\'s been charged and framed  for all the murders, then Ganta gets sentenced to death and they send him off to Deadman Wonderland, a massive theme park like prison where tourists enjoy cruel and sadistic games that involves around prisoners forced to survive these gruesome games to win Cast Points, which is the currency for Deadman\'s own economy system. On the prison, he meets a mysterious girl named Shiro, who knows Ganta for a reason and knows everything about Ganta\'s childhood than he does. Later on, he discovers that he has the power to use his blood as a weapon known as ""Branch of Sin"" and now he must survive the deadly prison in order to find the one who killed the classmates and uncover the dark secrets behind this prison.The story is very interesting but it offers little answers to all the questions that keeps popping up in each episodes. Like what is the connection between Ganta and Shiro or better yet, what the hell triggered the earthquake to glow red? It\'s a shame cause the concept for the show is really neat and it offers some interesting themes like society\'s thirst and hunger for human violence and the corruption of the justice system but instead, it focuses a little too much on the violence and gore. Don\'t get me wrong, i like violence and fun gore in movies, shows and anime (I\'m a gore hound fan), but I also like that the writers can focus on story and character development as well cause I want to know more about the world that a certain film or anime takes place and while Deadman Wonderland does a decent job on introducing the world and it\'s characters, it falls short and while it doesn\'t hurt the experience that much, I wish they could expand the world a bit bigger with more episodes instead of 12 and that\'s my main problem with it: It\'s only 12 episodes and since the manga has a LOT of story, just 12 episodes isn\'t enough to end the series. Why they didn\'t go with 51 episodes just like FMA 2003 series did is beyond my reach.The characters in Deadman Wonderland range between normal to fucked up and to put it simple, they\'re awesome. Ganta is the normal kid stuck in a complicated mess that was blamed on him and therefore, having his life sentenced to rot in a hellhole like this and even with his Branch of Sin, he is still weak cause he is a child and he\'s afraid to die despite having such awesome power but keeps moving on to fight for his freedom and exposing the secrets of the prison. Shiro is like the mystery girl. On the outside, she looks and acts as a fun friend to Ganta and in occasions, she helps Ganta in situations that he can\'t handle but in later episodes, we get to see her real side and there\'s an episode where it reveals that Shiro is something more dangerous that we could have ever imagined. There other crazy characters like Senji, Tamaki and Toto but the less I say about it the better. The action and violence in Deadman Wonderland is brutal and twisted. Limbs get blown to pieces, characters go AWOL for carnage and little girls transformed from good hearted people to twisted little fucks that wants your ass punished, It\'s pure insanity but with a twist of fun to it. Something about using blood as your weapon against your enemies just sounds and looks cool.The animation by Manglobe (Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy) is stunning. The art is luxurious and grand just like the park itself with rich color palette, amazingly detailed background art and top notch character models that each has a neat style on their own. The music by NARASAKI is awesome, kinda like a mix of dark techno rock and industrial music that fits the shows dark tone perfectly and it has it music orchestrated moments but the overall music package is excellent. The dub by Funimation is a big surprise for me just because it\'s so damn good. Like Greg Ayres, a veteran voice actor who\'s 43 years old voicing a 14 year old boy and he nails the voice of a 14 year old boy and it\'s incredible to hear it. That is until I found his record of voice performances and just recently found out that he ALSO voiced a young boy protagonist in Oh-Edo Rocket! Wow, he\'s damn good. Monica Riel as Shiro was also great and yes at times, she sounds like Stocking cause she voiced Stocking in the anime Panty And Stocking, she does get gradually better in the later episodes delivering the lines in a very chilling kind of way. Leah Clark was a badass in her role as Mitsuki. The scene where the character taunts Ganta like a bitch is probably one of my favorite moments to see her performance go nuts and it\'s a thrill, you just gotta listen to the dub cause it\'s very rewarding to listen to.While the story could have been better if it was expanded to more episodes instead of only 12 episodes, Deadman Wonderland still offers fun thrilling moments of gore and violence while providing a strange but interesting world where a prison is a tourists entertainment park for audiences to enjoy blood splattering goodness and it offers just that: A fun and twisted gory mess of a show. It will be a while to possibly get a season 2 for this show cause it has potential for the story to expand even further instead of leaving unanswered questions behind, but we have to wait and see if it will happen someday. For now, Sit back and enjoy the wonderment of death for your enjoyment. to be my fun guilty pleasure but with some flaws of course.Deadman Wonderland takes place in Japan where 10 years ago, an earthquake shattered half of Japan\'s cities into the ocean and that event was named as The Red Hole, as we see a student named Ganta Igarashi, who has a normal life and has great friends.

', ""This is my first review I hope you like. Deadman wonderland was a interesting anime but with a lot of problems.First the story it is a simple story that gets way more complicated than it should be. The story is based on a kid who gets accused of murder which he didn't commit. So he is sent to a prison and has to survive so he can find the man who killed his friends. The problem is it gets wayyy to complicated it's just so annoying and sometimes kind of boring. But it does have a kind of cool idea so it's okay. But what...makes the story work in this anime is the characters they are just amazing I really felt for Ganta and his predicament I also cared for the people he meets in the prison. The most memorable characters are hummingbird and crow they both are insane but have a reason to be insane they have interesting stories and I though the story should have involved them more. There are more characters later but those were the most memorable but I loved these characters. I have to say this and a lot of people will hate me but the artwork was horrible I hated the colors and it was to dark for my liking I prefer the opening I swear it was like somebody else they were colorfuland the song was so cool I never skip the opening. Overall I'll give this a 7 out of 10 it was a enjoyable anime that while it had problems it was good and like high school of the dead needs a second season to make it better makes the story work in this anime is the characters they are just amazing I really felt for Ganta and his predicament I also cared for the people he meets in the prison.

If you did was it the worst one? If you think it was the worst the you haven't saw Ganta's worst school day ever. When he and his class were ready to leave on a school trip his entire class was murdered in front of him. And who did all of this? Ganta says it was a mysterious red man and everybody else acucuses Ganta for it. Now poor Ganta is sent to the worst prison ever, known as Deadman Wonderland. After the worst day ever he meets a weird white girl known...as Shiro and they become friends. Then Ganta finds out he has the power to control his own blood! That's really awesome but it has a price, He has to fight to the death with other people with the same powers. Will Ganta survive until the end?Another awesome and close to perfect anime that i loved. The story is amazing and the power to control you own blood is awesome. I was really sucked in by the story, and the characters are so interesting that i was always wondering what's going to happen next. It grabbed my attention and held it until the last episode. The only problem i had with  is that it is a short anime. It's only 12 episodes long and the ending leaves some questions unanswered. But that isn't such a problem because it has other great stuff like an awesome soundtrack and it's visually beautiful. In short i belive it is an amazing experience and you should watch it as fast as possible. as Shiro and they become friends. Then Ganta finds out he has the power to control his own blood! That's really awesome but it has a price, He has to fight to the death with other people with the same powers. Will Ganta survive until the end?Another awesome and close to perfect anime that i loved. The story is amazing and the power to control you own blood is awesome.

It tells an underlying story of what the world and society are literally a half footstep away from becoming. I can't describe how unfinished I feel it is, there is an ending somewhere, lost in a yet unmade episode, that absolutely needs to bring a sense of success. I felt very angry watching this masterpiece. "", ""It annoys when the main character is utterly pathetic and useless to the point people around are all affected by it. I do not understand why people like this anime as I would love to hear their point of view on why this was a good anime. There were some good points to the anime as it presents where the main character changes from being pathetic to being mediocre. Overall, if you're into useless, weak, coward type of main characters then by all means you will enjoy this anime as it does have a good plot. I just wish that the main character had a...bit more of an actual ballsack rather than 2 dried raisins. bit more of an actual ballsack rather than 2 dried raisins."", ""Deadman Wonderland was one of the first anime shows I watched, at a time when thrillers like Mirai Nikki were very successful. This helped me to create a certain hype for this anime which is one of my favorites.Story (10/10): The story of Deadman Wonderland is quite interesting, we are first introduced to a group of high school students, among them, our protagonist, who would go through a traumatizing situation. We see all the students die in the first episode, having a great shock that starts the plot.This story represents a man in despair who can run nowhere while being put the blame of a...crime he has not committed and punished with no one to help him, the story goes on very well, with a good presentation of the fantastic prison where our protagonist keeps his pity and its secrets. And we have a very interesting way to activate the superpowers, which is by wasting their own life energy, that is, their blood. We are introduced to various characters and their development is at least decent. However, the twists and the plot are what really move this anime forward, although the story ends up looking a bit incomplete, considering that little of the original material has been adapted.Art (10/10): The art is amazing, the fighting scenes are very well animated and it can be said that they got it right in the theme and ambience that the anime wanted to convey.Sound (10/10): The soundtrack also loses in nothing, the opening perfectly represents insanity in its purest state, and the ending is probably one of the best songs I've ever heard, being a good representation of a more colorful idea, which differs from everything the anime wanted to go through. But that may come into the deepest desires of the protagonist, who just wanted to live a normal life. The voice acting has no problem either.Characters (8/10): Characters are not quite Deadman Wonderland's best strengh, not that they are not good, they are effective in the story in their own way, but there is no perfect character development and growth occurring. It occurs in a slower pace, which does not necessarily do much damage to the work.Exploitation (10/10): I can say that Deadman Wonderland definitely got a good impression on me, I could feel the protagonist's agony, the fear in his heart and all the terror that would be being in that prison, you can be sure this anime is a great anime and I recommend it to everyone reading this review. crime he has not committed and punished with no one to help him, the story goes on very well, with a good presentation of the fantastic prison where our protagonist keeps his pity and its secrets.

I\'m not sure if having a main character this useless is supposed to be endearing or something, but it\'s not.I made it to episode 5 with the Ganta/crow fight, knew it would be completely one-sided, and decided that if Ganta won through some ass-pull because he\'s so determined and ""always gets back up"" I would drop the anime immediatelylo and behold, they use that exact phrase and Ganta wins against an opponent who is superior to him in every way because he\'s...just that determined.dropped. just that determined.dropped.', 'The Positive Side:  The show’s premise is gripping not only because of its horror, but also because of its originality.  Ganta Igurashi, a schoolboy of 14, witnesses the gruesome murder of his entire class by a strange, supernatural being in bleeding, red armor.  As if his life wasn’t horrible enough yet, Ganta is framed for this murder and back-stabbed by his own attorney.  Still traumatized by the death of his friends, Ganta is thrown into the hellish prison known as Deadman Wonderland, where inmates must participate in deadly competitions in order to stay alive.  The owner of Deadman Wonderland (who...is also the man who posed as Ganta’s attorney) rakes in profits by marketing the gruesome deaths of the inmates as entertainment to the public while convincing viewers that the deaths are actually staged via CGI.  It’s a premise that immediately places Ganta into a sympathetic position, and also offers insightful commentary on the evils of prisons for profits and on the use of violence as entertainment.Ganta gets a lot of accusations of being whiny and useless, and I’ve always found those accusations pretty baffling.  A fourteen year-old watches his friends murdered, and is immediately thrust into a prison where he is seemingly doomed to die horrifically, and the audience hates him for being upset?  What people seem to miss about Ganta (despite the fact that Shiro flat-out says this) is that he never gives up, even when giving up seems so tempting.  His determination to stay alive and avenge his friends is made all the more remarkable because of his fear, his weakness and the fact that he is perpetually outmatched by the people around him.The supporting cast is pretty strong (on the heroes’ side, anyways).  Ganta’s friend Shiro provides some much needed comic relief, but because she is obviously mentally damaged, her character doesn’t clash with the overall grimness the setting.   Nagi provides a foil to Ganta, his strength, stoicism and soft-spoken nature contracting Ganta’s perpetual state of panic.There’s some neat concepts in the setting, such as the power to form weapons out of one’s own blood (thus granting super-powers for the cost of constantly risking auto-exsanguination in combat), and the prisoners being forced to wear toxic collars that could only be staved off by consuming regular doses of an antidote.  The way that outsiders to Ganta’s plight are perpetually deluded and oblivious about what’s actually going on is unnerving from both sides.  It hard to say what’s scarier, the thought that we could be put through hell without anyone on the outside noticing or caring, or the thought that something horrific could be happening just under our noses without us knowing.The Negative Side: The first problem with this show is that it over-stuffs its cast with psychos.  I get that this is set in a futuristic and corrupt prison, but there are simply so many sociopaths, all shoving and piling over each other in their separate efforts to wow the audience with competing abominations, that each individual villain becomes less memorable.  This would probably be forgivable if Deadman Wonderland didn’t betray its own maturity in the last two episodes for the sake of indulging in the narcissistic power-fantasy that seems mandatory to the Shonen genre.  I’m going to be talking about an ending now, so there’s gonna be some spoilers, if you didn’t get that.  Seriously though.  Spoilers are coming.  In like, the next paragraph.The series’ downhill slide begins with the removal of every character besides the Protagonist who could hope to make a difference, starting with Karako.  Karako has been set up as Nagi’s second in command.  She successfully rallies the rebellion in Nagi’s absence, and when their escape attempt is interrupted by an acid-spewing robot-tank, Karako ensures that the rest of the group escapes before taking on the robot one-on-one and beating it to death with her fists.  In short, Karako is badass with a capital B.  Well, until the writers say otherwise.  In the series’ ending, Karako gets easily captured, and seemingly forgets about the sword-wielding psychopath standing right behind her, which results in her being impaled and disabled for the rest of series.  This sudden stupidity and helplessness is not at all consistent with her character.After swooping in and saving Ganta’s ass, the Hummingbird bows out of the escape effort by claiming she deserves to be in prison, a sudden turn of idealism that just feels wrong for her cynical, foul-mouthed personality.Worst of all, Crow, the man who demanded Ganta never, ever get in a fight when he isn’t there to watch, learns that Ganta is about to fight the strongest, scariest villain in the Wonderland with a brand new technique that Crow just finished teaching him, and Crow decides that somehow, this isn’t worth tagging along to see.  None of these actions are even remotely true to everything we know about these characters, but apparently, respecting interesting secondary characters you’ve spent the entire series developing isn’t nearly as important as making the Protagonist feel speshul.The absurd lengths the writers go to keeping the sidekicks out of Ganta’s way reach a climax when Ganta and Shiro are facing down the Gay Surfer-Monk of Darkness.  Shiro is in her absurdly powerful Wretched Egg form, and Ganta pushes her aside and flat-out tells her, “It’s time for me to be the hero!”  I get that they’re trying to show Ganta has become more badass then he was when the series started, but really?  They couldn’t find any more believable way to do it?Ganta is not an Escapist Character.  He has never been an Escapist Character, and abruptly deciding to toss him a Deus Ex Machina Super-Power and letting him take down the Season 1 Big Bad on his own is, like almost everything that happens in the last two episodes, completely inconsistent with the character development that made us care about these characters in the first place.  Ganta garners sympathy specifically because he ISN’T a typical Shonen hero.  He’s scared, perpetually traumatized and physically weak, and even when he learns to harness his supernatural abilities, he is surrounded by people with powers equal to and greater than his own.  Despite having every conceivable disadvantage, Ganta is determined to survive and attain justice, and that makes him an extremely compelling character.   By shoe-horning him into the spot-light and suddenly giving him a new weapon that is far more powerful than anything any other Deadman has shown, they’ve robbed Ganta of everything that made him interesting.  He’s just another Shonen hero, stealing glory from his supporting cast and pulling inexplicably superior fire-power out of his ass at any point the plot demands.  To add insult to injury, the only reason the Deus Ex Machina Gun is required is because Ganta’s hyper-sonic attack fails, even though the hyper-sonic attack was developed specifically to take down the kind of bad guy Ganta is facing.  It just doesn’t make any sense.Ultimately, Deadman Wonderland chose to compromise its artistic potential for the sake of appealing to a power-hungry, adolescent audience.

Not only does Deadman Wonderland spend it\'s first 4-5 episodes with virtually useless set-up, but it\'s also rushing way too hard through it\'s own plot. There are entire characterizations that are rendered meaningless after one or two plot twists, and premises are introduced which don\'t apply to the main character anymore after another episode. It\'s a frustrating watch, especially since some of these premises would leave a lot of room for interesting storypoints, but are never followed up on. Gladiator-like fights between the...inmates with gruesome punishments for whoever loses the match-up? Sounds interesting, right? Well, too bad, after 2 instances this idea is thrown out of the window. A kind of heist-plot around reaching a special inmates cell within the labyrinth of the deadly prison? Damn, can\'t wait for how this turns out! Whoops, sorry about that, but the writers already forgot about that idea after 1 episode and our cast of characters gets something else to do. This is how most of this anime\'s plot is constructed. Our main character is just thrown around these different premises like a rag doll with little motivations of his own. He\'s actually so indecisive and whiney about most things, that it started to decrease my sympathy for him the longer the show was going on. The side characters are without a doubt the most interesting part about this anime, and I wish they would\'ve gotten more screentime and further explorations of their dynamics. One very mysterious character is thrown into the narrative towards the end, that could\'ve easily filled an entire episode with it\'s backstory. Instead we spend more time with the lame antagonists and, in the grand scheme of things, filler-esque adventures of 2 prison guards that never really get a resolution in the end. I should probably mention that the entire ending doesn\'t feel like a resolution to anything. That is most likely due to the anime ""catching up"" with the manga, and therefore being out of direct source material to adapt. The animation is aesthetically pleasing enough, and the voice acting is fine.It definitely felt a little bit rough around the edges tho, especially during some of the fight scenes.Overall this is just a disappointment in most aspects. It lacks the surrealism and mystery of other similar animes, and fails to deliver on the potentionally interesting characters. If the creators would\'ve taken more time to build out it\'s premises and maybe even follow up on some of them, this could\'ve really been a gem. inmates with gruesome punishments for whoever loses the match-up?

I didn't really enjoy this anime, I kind of did in the beginning then things went downhill as the story progressed. There should have been a second season, but it would have been hard to do given the ending.I have read about the manga and the story behind it after the show, had it stayed true to that, had they animated all the arks, then this could have been an awesome anime, instead you have characters not explored properly, not even the main character Shiro.Shiro's personality and mental condition are not explored, barely mentioned.

Purely personal reasons. I don\'t like Prison stories, and I have a natural (maybe misplaced) trust in my government and police that they aren\'t screwing everyone over all the time for no reason, even if it\'s not true. This show takes the reality and pushes it to the extreme, which is hard for someone as easily trusting as me to watch. I don\'t like how Ganta, the main character is framed and the...police bully him, 2real4me dawg.The characters designs are pretty bare minimum, except for Shiro who looks like a mental hospital run-away, which I think is the point but it kind of creeps me out with how far they decided to take it, which I think is also the point. With the ugly art style it has it\'s hard to find her cute, not impossible in the hands of a good enough artist, just hard within the context of the show. But seriously being unable to distinguish which part of her body is the straight jacket (thingy) and which part is just her skin bugs me, also her brown mittens kind of spook me too. When she was introduced in the show, I honestly thought she was just fully naked with weird markings, or maybe she is naked and just has a collar on. Hot.I looked up fanart and she actually didn\'t look any cuter, way to go show you can\'t even do that right.I\'m just teasing, this show does have a lot of actual merits: It has a cool metal OP, which doesn\'t happen a whole lot but I like it (the visuals for the OP are a mix of awesome and disgusting).It\'s also a pretty good dystopia, the setting is extreme but not so much that it\'s impossible to tell why or what they amplified for more than ""Wouldn\'t it be interesting if..."" kind of deal. Prisons are carnivals; entertainment for the masses. We kind of already do that on a smaller scale with the flood of shows and books and whatnot about Prison life, such as Orange is the New Black, Scared Straight, (for more Nippon similes) JoJo 6, Rainbow, Prison School, and Nanbaka. We torture and scrutinize inmates who, probably aren\'t even that bad as well as basically ruin there chances of fitting back into normal society and becoming a better person when they come out.That\'s why this is the worst show I\'ve ever seen. Not because it\'s horribly written or perpetuates horrible cliches and the poison of the industry, but because it reminds me too much of how we actually do things, this show correctly depicts prison as well as the brutality of the police, and frankly, it\'s so hard to watch that I don\'t want. Call me part of the problem, but this show makes me upset thinking about how realistic it is, other than Ganta having weird superpowers.This show is fuckin\' terrible BUT if you like it I understand I can\'t blame you, it does a lot right. Just not my thing. police bully him, 2real4me dawg.The characters designs are pretty bare minimum, except for Shiro who looks like a mental hospital run-away, which I think is the point but it kind of creeps me out with how far they decided to take it, which I think is also the point.

Hot.I looked up fanart and she actually didn\'t look any cuter, way to go show you can\'t even do that right.I\'m just teasing, this show does have a lot of actual merits: It has a cool metal OP, which doesn\'t happen a whole lot but I like it (the visuals for the OP are a mix of awesome and disgusting).It\'s also a pretty good dystopia, the setting is extreme but not so much that it\'s impossible to tell why or what they amplified for more than ""Wouldn\'t it be interesting if..."" kind of deal. Prisons are carnivals; entertainment for the masses. We kind of already do that on a smaller scale with the flood of shows and books and whatnot about Prison life, such as Orange is the New Black, Scared Straight, (for more Nippon similes) JoJo 6, Rainbow, Prison School, and Nanbaka. We torture and scrutinize inmates who, probably aren\'t even that bad as well as basically ruin there chances of fitting back into normal society and becoming a better person when they come out.That\'s why this is the worst show I\'ve ever seen. Not because it\'s horribly written or perpetuates horrible cliches and the poison of the industry, but because it reminds me too much of how we actually do things, this show correctly depicts prison as well as the brutality of the police, and frankly, it\'s so hard to watch that I don\'t want. Call me part of the problem, but this show makes me upset thinking about how realistic it is, other than Ganta having weird superpowers.This show is fuckin\' terrible BUT if you like it I understand I can\'t blame you, it does a lot right. Just not my thing.', '[Spoiler Free]SPOILER-FREEThis is an anime where the concept is more powerful than the actual execution.  I could not enjoy it and I really really wanted/tried too.

Its not often in anime that you get to experience such brutal and bloody up front action however Deadman Wonderland has certainly provided in that department. Not only does this show get down to the raw details of injuries and deaths, but provides some of the best tension and build ups of any show. In the first episode, we experience the shocking massacre upon Igarashi Ganta and his class mates, however the initial sighting of the 'Red Man'...builds a mystery aura and questions around the character which is later subtly solved to the viewers, however kept out of reach of the characters of the show. This for me was an agonizing experience to know more than the characters and anticipate the worst, however this also provided a certain level of adrenaline to the show, and for me, solidified it as one of the greatest short running animes around today. builds a mystery aura and questions around the character which is later subtly solved to the viewers, however kept out of reach of the characters of the show.

What I wasn’t told was that I would be subjected to another unlikeable protagonist and all the cool ideas seem to get thrown out the window halfway through this twelve episode romp and are replaced by a fairly uninventive, though still entertaining second act.The reviews for this show are fairly mixed, and I can see where you can love it or you can hate it. First of all let’s look at the story. Ganta Igarashi is...in middle school, has a bunch of friends, and is the only survivor when his whole classroom in brutally murdered by a person simply known as the Red Man. Ganta is framed for the murders and sent off to a prison called Deadman Wonderland, a privately owned facility that doubles as a kind of amusement park where the prisoners perform for the civilians. This idea is fairly cool and it gets even cooler when we learn that the prisoners also participate in death games such as obstacle courses full of guillotines, electrified water and snipers. There are also fights called the Carnival of Corpses that are one on one battles between the prisoners. This was awesome. Another plus were the Branches of Sin, something never explained in the anime where a prisoner’s blood can be used as a weapon. Ganta for instance can shoot blood bullets and Senji Kiyomasa can turn his blood into arm blades. The biggest part of the plot was some of the prisoner’s ability to manipulate their blood.With that said, yes, this is a bloody and gory anime, though I can’t say it’s that bad. Elfen Lied is a lot worse in the gore department, though there are some cringe-worthy scenes scattered throughout Deadman Wonderland, especially at the beginning and toward the end. Personally, there was only one moment where I was kind of yucked out, and this involved an eye being ripped out of a head, but otherwise it seemed fairly tame, at least for something that touts itself as bloody and gory.The series starts off strong and the story is really good. The use of this carnival as a device for killing prisoners is both smart and entertaining, but after a second Carnival of Corpses fight, the series seems to taper off and it never uses the setting for anything else. The second half of the series never includes a portion such as a game or a Carnival of Corpses, it’s just this resistance attempting to escape. In a longer series, this may not have bothered me if the next story arc pertained to another obstacle game or something of the like, but in a twelve episode series, it is disappointing. And to add to that disappointment is the fact that there is no conclusion. It ends one story arc, starts up another, but leaves it hanging. While I understand that twelve episode seasons are the norm for anime, I just wish that decent series would wrap up at least a little more soundly, or even forgo following the source material and try for something different. Elfen Lied strayed from the source material and it worked. I think it could have worked here too.So the plot starts amazing, and flatlines toward the end with the same generic action and boring scenery I can get out of a long running shonen title.The animation is good, not great. The middle school kids looked weird. I mean, Ganta isn’t that great looking either, but I couldn’t get over how freaking scary Mimi looked. Backgrounds are…blah. The scenery during the first act and the games and fights is pretty cool, but the end of the series follows the characters through dull gray areas and bright white areas and boring brown areas. It’s all very unappealing.The sound is pretty good. I really, really liked the opening. Not only was it a badass opening that really got you pumped for the anime (and fit the first act’s adrenaline pumping action much better than the second act’s dullness), the song was done by Japanese band Fade in English and it makes sense! For those who may not know, Japanese songs tend to intermix some English in the lyrics and it typically makes no sense whatsoever with lines like “Oh my God is Jesus Christ!” being sung. This song is perfect English and is also pretty catchy. I sat through the opening every episode because of it and the cool sequence. The ending is meh and doesn’t seem to fit the grittiness of the show that much. It’s like an upbeat pop song or something. Music during the show is fitting.In the character department we have some flaws. As stated, Ganta Igarashi is not a fun character to watch. At first I liked him and felt sympathetic toward the fact that he was framed for a crime he didn’t commit. But later on you grow to get sick of his constant crying and wimpiness. Hell, even the other characters get sick of his being a total loser. He constantly screws up and talks about saving the bad guys and helping them escape and protecting his friends. He’s the classic teenage wuss found in anime such as Guilty Crown, and most notably, Neon Genesis Evangelion. How a kid who whines and bitches as much as he does survives a prison as hardcore as Deadman Wonderland is a mystery. I guess it’s something about friendship. But I don’t care because I didn’t watch this to learn life lessons. I watched this to see bloody action.Shiro is cool. And not because she’s almost naked. She’s cool because I know nothing about her. The series doesn’t explain much about her and who or what she is. She’s kind of silly, kind of sweet, but also the only character who has any sort of depth. Now, I could be wrong, but I felt like if the anime did continue she would be the character with the most development.Other notables are Minatsuki Takami, a teenage girl who acts all cute and adorable and turns out to be a crazy-freaking bitch. I knew she wasn’t all flowers and smiles, but holy cow did I not see how totally insane she would turn out to be. I loved her.Nagi Kengamine is another pretty decent character. He has a bit of backstory and is real calm under pressure. He was enjoyable to watch and I wish there were more scenes with him. Senji Kiyomasa is another cool character with very little backstory, but he’s a total badass.Toto Sakagami shows up about two thirds of the way through Deadman, but he never gets much screen time and the time he does get makes me want to see more of him. Who is he, what is he? These things are never explained and apparently left to a second season.And that’s where I shall start my conclusion: There will be no second season. Sales of the DVD and Blu-Ray were horrible in Japan, meaning this is another anime that just leaves off and is going to be the target of terrible fan fictions for years to come in an attempt to conclude it. Actually, the manga does continue the story and I believe I’ll be heading over there to see if it’s worth my time.I wanted to love this Deadman Wonderland and be a raging fanboy about it, but I can’t because of it’s many shortcomings.

However, it is plagued with lack of depth, unanswered questions by the time the series came to a close, and has its fair share of plot holes. The pacing also gets flak for being inconsistent and spirals down...fairly early.ART : 6The animation was on par with modern anime series - nothing more, nothing less. Even though it has elements of gore throughout the series, it isn\'t to the extent to that of a true horror anime would be. It also lacks depth in non-human objects directly linked to the plot such as the timed devices around their necks, rarely displaying much needed information.SOUND : 7The OST of Deadman Wonderland is absolutely huge in comparison to the majority 12-episode series out there and this would be its highest praise. Unfortunately, no part of the OST stood out in particular, but it served its purpose in setting the atmosphere. The opening was fitting for the show but nothing worth writing home about. One positive aspect about the show was the dub. It was on par and one can even say it exceeded its Japanese counterparts. This probably explains its popularity in North America.CHARACTERS : 5Similar to the OST - the show has loads of characters for a 12-episode series, however in this case this causes a major headache in the character development department for main characters, let alone side-characters as most of their motives or side-stories are almost non-existent (and not taking the OVA into account). None of the characters stood out with the exception of Shino who was ""likable"".ENJOYMENT : 5The show started off well, but then the pacing went to hell until it caught up again mid-series. The open-ending was also disappointing as there are no current plans for a second season. Not that it would\'ve saved it as the show induced its own spontaneously combustion by the end.OVERALL : 6Taking into account the OST and characters, it is daylight obvious that this series was intended to have at least 24 episodes which would\'ve made it much, much better. That being said, Deadman Wonderland can\'t be regarded as a waste of time as it is fun for casual viewing, but I\'d rather recommend Mirai Nikki as it is also intended for the same audience and succeeds in most of  the departments where Deadman Wonderland fell short. fairly early.ART : 6The animation was on par with modern anime series - nothing more, nothing less.

But there was too much similarities between this anime and Mirai Nikki. They both were thrown into a kill or be killed survival game,and both main boy protagonists have a girl protecting them almost the entire time. The only difference between the two, is that Mirai Nikki had a amazing ending, but Deadman Wonderlands\' ending sucked ass.I mean, once I got to the end, I thought to myself ""where\'s the rest of it?"" It felt unfinished, and it felt a little rushed to me. I just wanted to throw myself out...of a window. But the plot, rules, graphics, and soundtrack were all great. the ending however, pissed me off.

The plots sounded so intruiging and I felt like it had potential to be one of my favourite animes. This was NOT the case.The writers or DW tried to create a plot that intresting and gripping but failed miserably. The characters were pathetic and had barely any development, not to mention the fact that every episode just raised more questions than it answered. I couldn't even make it to episode 12, it was so boring. The only good thing about Deadman Wonderland was the art, and even that was average. The entire anime...was just tragic and should be wiped from existance.If you ask me, watching Deadman Wonderland is just a waste of time. was just tragic and should be wiped from existance.If you ask me, watching Deadman Wonderland is just a waste of time."", '---SPOILER FREE REWIEW---I wanna start of by telling that this review will judge the anime and the anime only. I\'ve read the manga, but i don\'t wanna compare them to each other. So here comes the review.""You know what makes Ganta so amazing? He always gets up again.""Story: 7/10Well the story centers around Ganta, a boy who\'s been falsely accused for murder. After seeing his friends get killed by a mystical red man, he\'s the only one left back alive and then gets sent to prison. In this special prison which holds the most dangerous of all criminals, Ganta finds himself in the middle of...all this, without the power to protect himself.But then he meets this girl Shiro. A sweet, clumsy, albino girl that nobody really knows who is, but one thing is for sure, she cares about her friends and most of all, she cares about Ganta, but why?The longer Ganta is in this prison, weird things start to happen, and soon he discovers that he\'s received a strange power since his meeting with the red man, which gets him into even more trouble than before. And so the journey of Ganta and Shiro begins.-With only 12 episodes, of course this anime will seem rushed. It\'s like you get on and a big big rollercoaster and then you ride up, high up and just get more and more exited. And now you stand on the top of this rollercoaster and look down... and then... the anime ends. I loved the story sooo much. I love everything about the plot, but it just ends. And yeah you can read the manga and yeah yeah it only covers the first 5 volumes, but come one, this was so great, don\'t just end it like that!Art: 10/10Well this is gonna be short because it\'s just AMAZING. If I wanna watch an anime I ALWAYS goes on youtube to watch an AMV or something like that, to check out the artwork. An in my opinion this was better than great. Well I don\'t think everyone agree because we all like different styles of art, but this was definitely my style so I enjoyed it very much.Sound: 6/10I seriosly didn\'t know how to rate this. I don\'t really listen to the bag ground music, I only notice it if i find it bad, and obviously i didn\'t. The opening didn\'t catch me, but it then again wasn\'t so bad. So yeah, don\'t know what to say about it. It was fine I guess.Character: 5/10Having read the manga I find it very hard to rate this category, because it is hard to separate the show and the manga from each other. But I\'ll try anyway.Ganta:Some people say that he doesn\'t develop at all, but I don\'t agree on that. At first glance he\'s this little, innocent and scared boy who don\'t know have to protect himself. But as the story goes on, he see\'s that the world he once knew and this world he now lives in, are totally different. His personality starts changing and instead of needing protection, he starts providing protection.Shiro:Let me put it like this. At first your like ""whaaat, who is she, why is she white, why does she wear those gloves, what what"". And the strange thing is, the anime let YOU know a little about her, but Ganta never learns about those things. Ganta is Shiros best friends, and at some points he start remembering some things. Like, he\'s known here when he where a child? But you don\'t find out what that has to do with anything really. That made me really disapointed.But then again, looking at development, she is this girl who\'ed been raised inside walls, away from the world, and therefor she doesn\'t know how to act. But the more she\'s with Ganta, the more ""human"" she becomes, and the more she matures.I don\'t really wanna talk about the other chapters, they all have a GREAT bag ground story, and don\'t worry, you get to know it in the anime, but they don\'t really develop that much.Enjoyment: 9/10As said before, I LOVE IT. I love all the psychological twist and turns, I love all the crazy characters and their insane bag ground storys, and I love the fight scenes. So even though it disappointed my in many ways, I actually didn\'t regret watching it.Overall: 7/10I would definitely recommend it to someone who loves insane and psychological storys and doesn\'t mind scenes with fighting and blood. BUT I would tell them to read the manga first. I read the manga after seeing the anime, but I really think it would be better the other way around. Bravo to the anime for sticking so fine to the manga. Because of that I se the anime as a way of bringing the mangas first couple of volumes ""to life"" with colors and music and all that.Thanks for reading, this was my first review, I\'m hoping some of you finds it helpful ^_^ all this, without the power to protect himself.But then he meets this girl Shiro. A sweet, clumsy, albino girl that nobody really knows who is, but one thing is for sure, she cares about her friends and most of all, she cares about Ganta, but why?The longer Ganta is in this prison, weird things start to happen, and soon he discovers that he\'s received a strange power since his meeting with the red man, which gets him into even more trouble than before. And so the journey of Ganta and Shiro begins.-With only 12 episodes, of course this anime will seem rushed. It\'s like you get on and a big big rollercoaster and then you ride up, high up and just get more and more exited. And now you stand on the top of this rollercoaster and look down... and then... the anime ends. I loved the story sooo much. I love everything about the plot, but it just ends. And yeah you can read the manga and yeah yeah it only covers the first 5 volumes, but come one, this was so great, don\'t just end it like that!Art: 10/10Well this is gonna be short because it\'s just AMAZING. If I wanna watch an anime I ALWAYS goes on youtube to watch an AMV or something like that, to check out the artwork. An in my opinion this was better than great. Well I don\'t think everyone agree because we all like different styles of art, but this was definitely my style so I enjoyed it very much.Sound: 6/10I seriosly didn\'t know how to rate this. I don\'t really listen to the bag ground music, I only notice it if i find it bad, and obviously i didn\'t. The opening didn\'t catch me, but it then again wasn\'t so bad. So yeah, don\'t know what to say about it. It was fine I guess.Character: 5/10Having read the manga I find it very hard to rate this category, because it is hard to separate the show and the manga from each other. But I\'ll try anyway.Ganta:Some people say that he doesn\'t develop at all, but I don\'t agree on that. At first glance he\'s this little, innocent and scared boy who don\'t know have to protect himself. But as the story goes on, he see\'s that the world he once knew and this world he now lives in, are totally different. His personality starts changing and instead of needing protection, he starts providing protection.Shiro:Let me put it like this. At first your like ""whaaat, who is she, why is she white, why does she wear those gloves, what what"". And the strange thing is, the anime let YOU know a little about her, but Ganta never learns about those things. Ganta is Shiros best friends, and at some points he start remembering some things. Like, he\'s known here when he where a child? But you don\'t find out what that has to do with anything really. That made me really disapointed.But then again, looking at development, she is this girl who\'ed been raised inside walls, away from the world, and therefor she doesn\'t know how to act. But the more she\'s with Ganta, the more ""human"" she becomes, and the more she matures.I don\'t really wanna talk about the other chapters, they all have a GREAT bag ground story, and don\'t worry, you get to know it in the anime, but they don\'t really develop that much.Enjoyment: 9/10As said before, I LOVE IT. I love all the psychological twist and turns, I love all the crazy characters and their insane bag ground storys, and I love the fight scenes. So even though it disappointed my in many ways, I actually didn\'t regret watching it.Overall: 7/10I would definitely recommend it to someone who loves insane and psychological storys and doesn\'t mind scenes with fighting and blood. BUT I would tell them to read the manga first. I read the manga after seeing the anime, but I really think it would be better the other way around. Bravo to the anime for sticking so fine to the manga. Because of that I se the anime as a way of bringing the mangas first couple of volumes ""to life"" with colors and music and all that.Thanks for reading, this was my first review, I\'m hoping some of you finds it helpful ^_^', ""Spoiler free article: A short description that's just a bit longer than normal synopsis to give you rough idea what to expect from this anime. Conclusion for TL;DR at the end of the articles.Reading time: 2 minutes readReview:The story are just basic shounen plot, but the execution can't be worse than this. I would complaint even at the basic story and pacing, but they did more than that, they butchered the whole things with a lot of skipping and missing lots of details and hope the viewers understand, the pacing also super fast and just unnatural. The easiest thing I can point out to give...example is that a shounen should have some kind of training arc, they did, but it's at the end of the series (Episode 11 out of 12 to be exact). Everything in this anime is so wrong with the plot armor and plot holes here and there, but the worst part is the MC, he's not only pathetic, but also inconsistent to the core. If you want to make a pathetic MC then it's fine, but don't make him suddenly become shounen protagonist for a couple minutes to be back to his pathetic self later, believe it or not, they did this for most part of the series. If I don't know better, I would assume that he have multiple personality disorder. I think they should add some fantasy tag to this series, because everything in this anime is just modeled to real world, but none adhere to it's rules, it's just like fantasy. Small notes also goes as to why they think gore brutal killings are okay but not curse words...The visuals are okay, not the greatest, but it's decent to some degree, and it's able to at least hold that quality until the end. The battles are mostly using the blood technique, so there's hardly any movements, and if any, it's choppy, but the blood itself are decent if not for the unnatural way of the blood splash and the blood amount, but you can argue that it's controlled so by them, so it can't be bound by normal logic. The perspective of several buildings and rooms are weird, the size are inconsistent, and looks like the designer didn't research much to several things, many things are just defying physics, I think it's okay if it's some fantasy magical world, but it's not okay in this anime that took place in normal nowadays earth that supposedly have this blood control super power, because then the other thing should work just as normal as it were before (except the blood things).The sound effects are just bad, let me put it out first, even some retro games have better sound effects in this one, it's so over the top, so exaggerated that even normal people can recognize it as fake, maybe it's supposed to give extra creepy effects, but it's working adversely to that. The voice actors are also something, when several have done okay job, the others did horrendously wrong, the quality between the seiyuus can't be this wide... The OST are mediocre at best, I didn't remember any of it, nor I feel it helps to build the atmosphere while watching this anime.Conclusion:Reasons to watch:-You're looking for some gore bloody anime with a decent visualsReasons NOT to watch:-Inconsistent characters build-Overuse of plot armor-Rushed pacing of the empty predictable plot-Bad sound effects with some mediocre OSTs example is that a shounen should have some kind of training arc, they did, but it's at the end of the series (Episode 11 out of 12 to be exact).

However, this potential is grabbed and trown into a sandpit of horribly lame characters that we've seen in a myriad of other animees already.However what really destroys it is it's lack of explaining the backstory to the incident that started the whole thing. It's leaving the main plot of the story unresolved.The protaganist is an appaling character that is of course weak, but always stands up even when he should be dead - the same character you'll find in all mediocre animees.The show boasts a bare amount of 12 episodes, and...it's really not enough - it's rushed through and leaves a lot of characters unresolved and gone. You never even get the time to create attachment to the characters before they are best friends and would die for each other.This anime is something you shouldn't watch. leave it be, I've only found frustration here. it's really not enough - it's rushed through and leaves a lot of characters unresolved and gone.

Well... it cant, but Deadman Wonderland Sure gave a good effort.This Anime had potential to be amazingly awesome, but was held back by some of its flaws. The execution just wasn\'t as god as it should have been.Story:The story of Deadman Wonderland is extremely cool. Even though the basic premise has been done before, some interesting twists were added making it very entertaining. If you like blood, this Anime is perfect for you. Its not full of mindless gore, but its sufficiently bloody. It also...has a lot of violence, which makes it decently exciting to watch. Unfortunately it got cancelled, so it is unfinished. Unless you read the Manga, be prepared to be left hanging.Art:The art is consistently good quality throughout this Anime. The action scenes are animated very well. I am pretty satisfied with the art.Sound:I LOVE the opening song to Deadman Wonderland, ""One Reason"". It really fits the dark theme. The ending song on the other hand, ""Shiny Shiny"", is far too cheery and happy for an Anime like this. Most of the background music is metal, but it\'s not distracting. A few of the voices in the English version get on my nerves, but most of them are decent.Characters:As far as characters go, most of them seem super underdeveloped. I mean, how are you supposed to root for characters that you know nothing about? Barely any of the characters had any depth to them, which was disappointing. Luckily there were still a few likable characters that I was happy to cheer for. The main character, Ganta, is not one of them though. He becomes annoying very quickly due to his constant whining. Maybe he would have had time to grow a pair before the next season.. If there was a next season.Enjoyment:Despite its flaws, Deadman Wonderland is very enjoyable to watch. It is exciting enough to keep you coming back for more.Overall:I rate it a 7 overall, and  I think its definitely worth watching. has a lot of violence, which makes it decently exciting to watch.

An innocent guy gets trapped in this game where he has to kill or survive till last. Plot is actually similar to Mirai Nikki but Mirai Nikki has more depth to everything.Story is stupidly stupid and its just there to show the blood.Character development is worse than any anime I have watched.The sound effect is nothing much just few soundtracks and blood splatering efects.Art is good which is why I gave a fair 7 but its used in wrong way because all they did was add blood to everthing.Enjoyment is also...very less. I was intrested for first 3 episode but then later it was just Shiro saving Ganta and the Ganta sorry about everything that is happening to him. It looks like the Ganta wants to be innocent but then next moment he looks like a psychopath. Shock factor might be like 8.And also this anime is extreamly unrealstic. It mostly is a mash up of Mirai Nikki and Elen Lied.*****************Spoiler Review- OpinionThe ending was bad they did not even show the whole story. It looks like there no open interpertaion also. Its just a unfinished ending. The ending makes you feel like there are more episodes of this anime but no. For complete story you need to read the manga no other choice.Anime would be 6/10 but manga would around 8.Anime missed the whole oppurtunity to develop everything from characters to art to story.Conclusion: Just an unfinished anime with no point of anything.

However, the story is also incredibly disappointing and heart wrenching because it's not finished. If the plan from day 1 was to shorten a 13 volume manga into a 12 episode anime then the director needs to a long think about whether he's in the right business. Deadman Wonderland is a dark and gore filled tragedy. There's no laughs or humour in this, unless you find the misfortunes and mutilation of others funny.The art and sound is standard to...most anime really. And most I find to be excellent. The OT is ok but I'm not into that kind of music. The ET usually brought tears to my eyes. The song has sadness woven into it's melody and in the video you see a glimpse of who most the characters once were. Who they were before they were flung into the hell of Deadman Wonderland. Something which makes me sad just thinking about. I won't spoil it but you need to understand the context for it too.A lot of the characters are interesting and unique in their own dark and twisted manner. I feel if the show was longer the character could develop to be even stronger. The voice acting is excellent as well (sub) Always like hearing Romi Park. The main antagonist(s) could have done with more development as you don't know about their motives and reasoning as well as their past.The two characters I'm referring to are Tsunenaga Tamaki and Rinichirō Hagire. Also I would have liked to see move of the individual powers and more story of the background of said powers.I thoroughly enjoyed Deadman Wonderland. I usually feel sad when I finish a series away but this show made we feel depressed for a while. Not only because of the abrupt ending and no indication of a second season but perhaps just because of the story it's self. I would recommend Deadman Wonderland to anyone deemed old enough to watch it. However, you'll be left with questions.

The problem I have with this anime its the inconsistency with the whole candy thing and the blood which I cant get into without spoiling it but trust me when your watching this you'll being to notice how it just doesn't make sense and I done care how motivated you are you CAN NOT SURVIVE HALF THE THING THAT HAPPENS TO THEM. what is this Disney true love concurs all bull sh*t.this anime gives away a lot and I don't know if they do it on purpose or accidental but I could tell who the red man was within the first few episodes and no I did not read the manga. Now I don't care much for spoilers even if i know the ending to something i can still equally enjoy it as much as i would if i didn't, but the thing is the would anime is based on Ganta trying to kill the red men thats the only motivation he has to go on so why give it away so fast why not wait till the end to show us who it was. to them and i love how they develop the characters showing off all the sides of them and everything they're capable of , I just wish they would of developed shiro a bit more so we could understand why she does the things she does or what drives her.

Starting with the intro. The intro is really catchy but the problem is that it doesn't fit the anime. It's a lot heavier and more rockish than it should be. Next is going to be characters. The MC is a whiny bitch and can't do anything to for himself and has an annoying voice (watch sub not dub because the dub is so bad it makes my ears cringe). The side...characters are really cool. I enjoy them more than the MC which is a good thing sometimes but not in this case. There are some side characters that are useless but the main ones are a lot more interesting than the MC.

The manga is amazing as well, and I think the judgement placed on the anime for its length and abrupt stop - some calling it merely a prologue to the manga - is misplaced and unfair.Story:This series has perhaps one of the most original and engaging plot-lines in any modern anime. It\'s constantly progressing, despite the short length, and it moves very fast, but not so fast as to seem rushed. There are lots of twists and surprises that I won\'t mention here for the sake of spoilers. It\'s easily the star of the...show here.Art/Sound:The art, while good, does suffer from the evidently low budget of the series. It\'s clean and fluid, but some fine detail has been left out and animations for things such as blood are sometimes seemingly missing frames or having frames cut short. It fits the series in a way, but can be a little off-putting. The soundtrack, however, including the amazing OP ""Fade"" by One Reason, is perfectly chosen for the series and adds that little bit extra depth to an already marvellous series.Character:The characters in this series are so varied and unique that it\'s comparable to larger series such as Psycho-Pass and Darker than Black. Each has their own distinct personality, and there\'s obvious development for both Ganta and Shiro as well as the other characters they interact with. They help the plot move along nicely, and dance the perfect act that character and plot are supposed to dance. It\'s also one of the very few series where I prefer the Dub to the Sub because the voice acting is so great.Enjoyment/Overall:With never a dull moment, this series is insanely enjoyable. It\'s engaging, exciting, fast-paced, and exhilarating. The art is decent, the soundtrack is perfect for the show (I love the OP), and the characters and plot work together perfectly to create a truly intriguing and seriously under-rated series.10/10 show here.Art/Sound:The art, while good, does suffer from the evidently low budget of the series.

In my own point of view I didn't like too much this anime, because you could already know it would end, also I didn't because it ends in a cliff-hanging and I hate cliff-hangings. Also it was kind of fun because the main characters likes to cry at any time and it is the typical kind of anime in where the main characters says he or she isn't strong enough to defeat the...villain, and out of nowhere he or she appears with a great power and defeats the enemy.

Especially like how the MC ended up in prison, it is too mediocre, the evidence, the laws and the court execution. There are so many inconsistencies.The main character is too pathetic and dumb.The anti character are well established, otherwise most are dumb like they cant think alone.Most...like character: kenji or the owl, he is not dumb for a muscle head character like character: kenji or the owl, he is not dumb for a muscle head character', 'Do Not, I Repeat, Do Not, have high hopes for this series, it will disappoint you, unless you\'re into gory stuff, this isn\'t the anime for you, I\'m not saying that I dislike gory thinks, in fact I love them, but there is little to no development in the story and characters.Honestly this series had a lot going for it but failed to execute the story and character development properly and almost seems like they gave up mid way through the story, they often bring up the so called ""redman"" but they don\'t dive in deeper into how the person came to be known as...the redman, the place of origin or it\'s true power. Deadman Wonderland is explicitly a gore anime, a bloodbath of an anime to compensate for it\'s terrible story and little character development.

Why is he specifically framed for the massacre of children.

There's an obsessive amount of swearwords. And honestly, it's just insanity on crack. This anime takes a look in to the depths of the human psyche.

So I'm wondering, why is it that something that had promise end up so mediocre? It makes the whole thing just bad overall. The fact that it started out with an interesting premise (the prison) makes me want to read the manga and hope it turns out better. But, the fact that it just evolves into a stinking pile of pathetic-boy-has-to-find-his-courage-and-power-within just made the anime so blah. "", ""Story:The story of deadman wonderland is good...to begin with.The first few episodes set up the premise of the very well,telling the story of Ganta Igarashi, a student attending Nagano Prefecture's middle school. This all changes when a strange person covered in blood and crimson armor floats through his classroom windows. Grinning madly, the 'Red Man' massacres Ganta's entire class but instead of killing him,he plants a red plot device in Ganta's chest.a few days after the massacre, Ganta is sentenced to death and is incarcerated in Deadman Wonderland, a massive theme park-like prison for killing all his classmates.Because we all know that a fourteen year...old boy would have no problem conducting a mass murder such as this.Sadley the story takes a turn for the worse, new plot lines are intoduced and never explained properley and the result is an ending that leaves a lot to be desired.Art:the character designs here are very good and so is the animation.Effects for the Branches of Sin (a power that ganta and some other inmates have that lets them controll their blood)are great too.Sound:the soundtrack is overall very good with a heavy metal feel to it.This suits the animes darker tones and general feel.The ending theme is nothing special but the opening is pure awesome,and the english dub is okay,and i say okay because although most of the dub is good but ganta's voice is annoying as F***.Character:The characters in this anime are a bit hit and miss.Our protagonist ganta is bitchey and yes although i felt sorry for him at first he never develops and gets over his hardships and just moans instead.A real shame because he does get some development in the manga.on the other hand we have shrio a crazy naked albino girl from ganta's past.She provides light hearted comic relief and insane robot dropkicking homicidal badassery that provides a nice ray of light into the dark tale that is deadman wonderland.The supporting cast of characters are underdeveloped and for the most part boring and forgetable.Enjoyment:make no mistake, deadman wonderland is gory, dark and borderline insane.If you liked elfen lied or berserk then you might enjoy this,but the amount of  Enjoyment you may get from this will be tainted by flaws that are too great to ignore.if you like the premise then read the manga instead,its much much better.Overall:Decent but too flawed to fully recomend as an anime or over it's manga counterpart.7/10 old boy would have no problem conducting a mass murder such as this.Sadley the story takes a turn for the worse, new plot lines are intoduced and never explained properley and the result is an ending that leaves a lot to be desired.Art:the character designs here are very good and so is the animation.Effects for the Branches of Sin (a power that ganta and some other inmates have that lets them controll their blood)are great too.Sound:the soundtrack is overall very good with a heavy metal feel to it.This suits the animes darker tones and general feel.The ending theme is nothing special but the opening is pure awesome,and the english dub is okay,and i say okay because although most of the dub is good but ganta's voice is annoying as F***.Character:The characters in this anime are a bit hit and miss.Our protagonist ganta is bitchey and yes although i felt sorry for him at first he never develops and gets over his hardships and just moans instead.A real shame because he does get some development in the manga.on the other hand we have shrio a crazy naked albino girl from ganta's past.She provides light hearted comic relief and insane robot dropkicking homicidal badassery that provides a nice ray of light into the dark tale that is deadman wonderland.The supporting cast of characters are underdeveloped and for the most part boring and forgetable.Enjoyment:make no mistake, deadman wonderland is gory, dark and borderline insane.If you liked elfen lied or berserk then you might enjoy this,but the amount of  Enjoyment you may get from this will be tainted by flaws that are too great to ignore.if you like the premise then read the manga instead,its much much better.Overall:Decent but too flawed to fully recomend as an anime or over it's manga counterpart.7/10"", 'Deadman Wonderland is a good anime, but it did take me some time to get into it.So basically, there\'s this prison/amusement park and most of it\'s prisoners have this crazy power that involves them using their blood to fight, and some of these prisoners were framed so the prison/amusement park can make a nice profit. Deadman Wonderland is the name of this prison. Probably because most of the people are on Death Row.The story kicks off with Ganta Igarshi looking up Deadman Wonderland as his class were going there for a school trip. It\'s all sunshine and rainbows when BAM all his classmates are...murdered by ""The Red Man"" who is one of the people with the blood power. He puts something in Ganta (the power) before he blacks out. When he wakes up he realises he is being accused of murdering all his classmates. He was framed and the person behind it made a video to back them up with framing him.So Ganta is thrown into Deadman Wonderland where your life is just made a misery and there\'s nothing you can do about it... except die.The art looked nice, I liked how some characters were drawn but others annoyed me. The scenes looked amazing, except that one scene that I couldn\'t watch because it was quite gruesome.The sounds was good, the background music fit the mood and the opening song was really really good. I wasn\'t a huge fan of the ending though.The characters were good. Ganta really annoyed me though, he was so wimpy, fair enough he was thrown into a prison with a high possibility of a painful death and death is only slightly avoidable. But he was wimpy and annoying before he was thrown into Deadman Wonderland. So if you can\'t stand characters like that, stay away from this anime.Shiro was really funny and adorable, she was a badass too. She was there for fun and nothing else. Even when she was right at death\'s door she didn\'t give a damn all she did was jump around and smile and tell everyone how Ganta was her bestest buddy. Even though he couldn\'t remember her because he\'s a jackass like that.Overall  I enjoyed Deadman Wonderland. I do recommend it but only if you can bear extremely wimpy main characters..(just Ganta but he could fill about 20 roles of wimpy characters). If you are easily scared by gruesome scenes I don\'t advise you to watch this as there are several scenes like that. But other than that it\'s really good and enjoyable. murdered by ""The Red Man"" who is one of the people with the blood power. He puts something in Ganta (the power) before he blacks out.

It rides heavily on its visuals and its mood, but ends up not delivering as far as plot and characters.  The MC is pretty much an even more wimpy version of Yuki from Mirai Nikki.  That can work out, but the problem is that the woman he leans on is in this case a very shallow character.  Shiro is basically a walking piece of fanservice, and despite her apparent badassery, has little effect on the overall plot.  It really seems like Ganta\'s story, with Shiro just being there to provide TnA...and a forced romantic appeal.That could work but all the characters are painfully shallow.  I understand the source material was quite compressed, but I don\'t feel like giving more time to these characters would have helped.  All in all it seemed like it was relying way too heavily on aesthetic to compensate for bad characters and a lackluster plot.  The entire world setting just appears less than thought through, and it feels like someone just wanted to make a ""Carnival of Death"" anime and tried to force some absurd plotline onto it.  There was not a single likable character throughout the show, and the only women shown without fanservice are either old, children, or the single female character not shown in ways which are meant to appeal to men\'s sexual desires.I thought they had lots of room to work within on their soundtrack, band that while it was pretty good overall, that they failed to explore the possibilities that lay within using a metal-themes soundtrack to anime.  And the animation quality is pretty phenomenal, but it can\'t gloss over the lack of plot stability and the weak characters.I\'d recommend this anime to anyone who likes edgy stuff, who is more interested in action than plot, or who has a soft spot for useless MCs who are constantly harping on their own patheticness. and a forced romantic appeal.That could work but all the characters are painfully shallow.

There is the template for a very clever show here, but they strayed away from it about halfway through the series. I think that they should have gone deeper into how the prison treats the inmates. This would have helped improve the drama and added some more social commentary. This might be the darkest anime that I have ever seen, and manages to not just be dark for the sake of being dark for the most part, but can also be rather draining. I also am not a fan of the confused tone...of the show, almost exclusively due to Shiro's character, who is so out of place that it was almost comical.

At the very beggining unfortunete things has happened to Ganta and he was sent to Deadmen Wonderland as it was written in synopsis. The concept was pretty interesting at first and it made curious for going further. However the lack of this anime was unsufficient information for the background of some of the side chracacters.

The originality of the story was lost due to it. Nevertheless, the Shounen effect was present and I did enjoy it. However I was disappointed with the level of goriness since that was overly emphasized in almost every review I read of this anime. Shiki had more of that eerie feeling but did not get that from this anime.Lets start with the bad news before the good, shall we?Bad News:1. Story is insanely similar to Deathrace where the plot lies in winning enough points to win your freedom and a inhumane dictator of sorts is creating new...rules to keep the prisoners in.

I\'m talking about a series that makes you so angry, leaves you feeling so empty and disappointed inside that you literally are at the point where you can\'t say a damn thing about it that would make it sound extremely bad. That\'s how little you feel about it and how apathetic it made you. Indifference is worse than hatred, and this anime and my relationship with it is a prime example.This is Deadman Wonderland.STORY: 5/10Okay, before I go into the plot, let\'s talk about Sword Art...Online for a sec. An MMORPG where real lives are at stake. You can\'t leave until you beat the game, but if you never beat it, you can never join reality again. Beautiful concept. Excellent sales pitches all around.The execution is horrible. You don\'t need me to tell you that.Anime has proven time and again that a seemingly terrible concept can lead to a spectacular anime, (i.e. Polar Bear Café or Detroit Metal City,) and, likewise, a wonderful concept can lead to terrible execution, as stated above.Unfortunately, Deadman Wonderland is an example of the latter.The story follows a boy who gets unjustly framed for a murder he clearly didn\'t commit, but due to a corrupted courtroom and his screwy defense attorney, he gets locked away in this prison that\'s an amusement park on the outside and a fight club on the inside. Prisoners are used for entertainment a la Roman Coliseum by having to fight each other to the death, complete obstacles that could end their lives, and use their own blood as weapons until they pass out or their opponent gets brutally murdered---whichever comes first.There you go. Some business guy probably used that as a sales pitch and an entire boardroom gave him an ovation.But.BUT.The show itself is UNBELIVEABLY forced in tone. It is extremely hard to believe, even with your suspension of disbelief, that a small child who is being tried for brutally murdering his classmates was sent into a courtroom that was literally built to screw him over and that\'s all he gets. I get that this is supposed to be this dystopian version of Japan, but it\'s kind of like Tokyo Ghoul in the sense that, even though it\'s supposed to be dark, it\'s a little too unfair at the point where the viewer may not want to cheer for the main character because it\'s pointless. They\'re going to lose because life just isn\'t fair for fifteen-year-old boys that the world will never understand.And before you think this show will be worth watching through the end after such a shady beginning, it\'s not. The ending comes directly out of left-field and is about a random side-character without ever bringing up a possible resolution for our ""hero.""I have never read the manga, but apparently this show is an adaptation of only the first four books of a twenty-something part manga. If that\'s not a red flag, I have no idea what else I can tell you.ART: 5I mean, like...eh. It\'s fine. I don\'t have a tremendous amount to say about it aside from it\'s jarring like it\'s supposed to be.There isn\'t really a stylistic approach. It\'s just a basic, ""Oh, this is a dark anime with a twist on the innocent nostalgia of amusement parks; let\'s put dark colors on what are supposed to be bright objects!! :D""Example: It\'s no secret that Madoka Magica is both kawaii and kowai. There\'s a blend of huge pops of color and entirely different mediums are used to create the witches in the show to make the danger stand out that much more, so when someone dies or when a fight occurs, it catches you that much more.A lot of Deadman Wonderland is just...blank. Two characters talk in a blank room with a poster on one of the walls, panning back and forth to crowds of people. Fight scenes are eh, character designs are eh, it\'s all eh when it doesn\'t have to be.SOUND: 6""Any questions?""""Yeah, how big are those titties?""""I\'m a G.""The dub has some gold nuggets in it. I have no idea why they decided to cast that annoying blonde kid from Clannad as the main character, though. Don\'t ask about music. I literally could not tell you what instruments are being used in the soundtrack, much less the 2007 Linkin Park wailing of the OP.CHARACTER: 5Here\'s a test for you weebs to try at home to see how long an anime will stick with you.Go on Google Images and type in ""*insert anime here* character wallpaper"" and pull up the wallpaper with the most characters in it. It could be two, could be twenty. If you can name every character, no matter how many there are, it\'s safe to say that the anime did a great job nailing the characters in your head, thus they\'ll be your waifus forever.I literally cannot name a single character from Deadman Wonderland, not even white-haired big gloves. I think there was a guy named Yo, but I literally can\'t remember. This show glazes over character arcs that would have been more interesting had they been panned out more. Like I remember this one episode about this seemingly innocent girl who goes batshit crazy due to trauma behind the crime she had committed to get sent to Deadman Wonderland, but after two episodes, we literally never hear from her again. The last episode is about a cop or something.I don\'t know.I don\'t really care, either. Not like I\'m getting paid for this.ENJOYMENT: 5I have a feeling we all would have enjoyed this show much more if we were all in seventh grade and Evanescence was still the best thing to happen to us. At first, in all honesty, I adored this show. Thought it was the shit, immediately looked up merchandise for it, wanted to cosplay Red Eyes McBigBewbs at the next local con.But the more I watched, the more I questioned.This was one of the first ten anime I had ever watched from beginning to end. I hadn\'t even seen Death Note yet, that\'s how small of a weeb I was. So, at the time, this was the darkest anime I had ever seen.Then I watched more anime and began to hate myself and my standards.I kept asking, ""Why?"" Why does no one try to escape? Why does literally no one sympathize with children in a death camp without much reason to be there? Why is REMBB even here?It was fine when I started, but then I wanted to quit several times but didn\'t because hey I already started and I only have two episodes left and I have nothing else to do with my pathetic life except watching children beat each other with their own bloodAnd again. No reward.Literally could have...I don\'t know, hugged my cat more instead of watching the ""finale"" that was basically an ad for the OVA, which has basically NOTHING to do with the anime itself.OVERALL: 5In short, it was genuinely disappointing. A beautiful concept with an apparently brilliant manga gets a horrendous adaptation that leaves the viewer not getting anything but not wanting anything else. I honestly checked years ago to see if they were going to make a second season to this show just to see if they were going to try again. I would love to see a wonderful concept like this pull through and grow enticing, or at least incite a reaction besides, ""Eh.""So...is this the worst anime I\'ve ever seen? Well...no. But it\'s the worst relationship I have with one. It\'s like watching your kid, who you know is super talented and can probably end national poverty and hunger, never move out of the house and does nothing with their philosophy degree while bragging to everyone about how smart they are without actually doing anything with their knowledge, instead just locking themselves up in the basement and ranting on their blogs about how the smart people never get the jobs they deserve while he hasn\'t even looked in the classifieds of the newspaper. You can\'t say they\'re a terrible human, nor can you say they\'re good.Talent, along with a beautiful concept, means nothing if you don\'t do anything worthwhile with it.And this anime barely tries. Online for a sec. An MMORPG where real lives are at stake. You can\'t leave until you beat the game, but if you never beat it, you can never join reality again. Beautiful concept. Excellent sales pitches all around.The execution is horrible. You don\'t need me to tell you that.Anime has proven time and again that a seemingly terrible concept can lead to a spectacular anime, (i.e. Polar Bear Café or Detroit Metal City,) and, likewise, a wonderful concept can lead to terrible execution, as stated above.Unfortunately, Deadman Wonderland is an example of the latter.The story follows a boy who gets unjustly framed for a murder he clearly didn\'t commit, but due to a corrupted courtroom and his screwy defense attorney, he gets locked away in this prison that\'s an amusement park on the outside and a fight club on the inside. Prisoners are used for entertainment a la Roman Coliseum by having to fight each other to the death, complete obstacles that could end their lives, and use their own blood as weapons until they pass out or their opponent gets brutally murdered---whichever comes first.There you go. Some business guy probably used that as a sales pitch and an entire boardroom gave him an ovation.But.BUT.The show itself is UNBELIVEABLY forced in tone. It is extremely hard to believe, even with your suspension of disbelief, that a small child who is being tried for brutally murdering his classmates was sent into a courtroom that was literally built to screw him over and that\'s all he gets. I get that this is supposed to be this dystopian version of Japan, but it\'s kind of like Tokyo Ghoul in the sense that, even though it\'s supposed to be dark, it\'s a little too unfair at the point where the viewer may not want to cheer for the main character because it\'s pointless. They\'re going to lose because life just isn\'t fair for fifteen-year-old boys that the world will never understand.And before you think this show will be worth watching through the end after such a shady beginning, it\'s not. The ending comes directly out of left-field and is about a random side-character without ever bringing up a possible resolution for our ""hero.""I have never read the manga, but apparently this show is an adaptation of only the first four books of a twenty-something part manga. If that\'s not a red flag, I have no idea what else I can tell you.ART: 5I mean, like...eh. It\'s fine. I don\'t have a tremendous amount to say about it aside from it\'s jarring like it\'s supposed to be.There isn\'t really a stylistic approach. It\'s just a basic, ""Oh, this is a dark anime with a twist on the innocent nostalgia of amusement parks; let\'s put dark colors on what are supposed to be bright objects!! :D""Example: It\'s no secret that Madoka Magica is both kawaii and kowai. There\'s a blend of huge pops of color and entirely different mediums are used to create the witches in the show to make the danger stand out that much more, so when someone dies or when a fight occurs, it catches you that much more.A lot of Deadman Wonderland is just...blank. Two characters talk in a blank room with a poster on one of the walls, panning back and forth to crowds of people. Fight scenes are eh, character designs are eh, it\'s all eh when it doesn\'t have to be.SOUND: 6""Any questions?""""Yeah, how big are those titties?""""I\'m a G.""The dub has some gold nuggets in it. I have no idea why they decided to cast that annoying blonde kid from Clannad as the main character, though. Don\'t ask about music. I literally could not tell you what instruments are being used in the soundtrack, much less the 2007 Linkin Park wailing of the OP.CHARACTER: 5Here\'s a test for you weebs to try at home to see how long an anime will stick with you.Go on Google Images and type in ""*insert anime here* character wallpaper"" and pull up the wallpaper with the most characters in it. It could be two, could be twenty. If you can name every character, no matter how many there are, it\'s safe to say that the anime did a great job nailing the characters in your head, thus they\'ll be your waifus forever.I literally cannot name a single character from Deadman Wonderland, not even white-haired big gloves. I think there was a guy named Yo, but I literally can\'t remember. This show glazes over character arcs that would have been more interesting had they been panned out more. Like I remember this one episode about this seemingly innocent girl who goes batshit crazy due to trauma behind the crime she had committed to get sent to Deadman Wonderland, but after two episodes, we literally never hear from her again. The last episode is about a cop or something.I don\'t know.I don\'t really care, either. Not like I\'m getting paid for this.ENJOYMENT: 5I have a feeling we all would have enjoyed this show much more if we were all in seventh grade and Evanescence was still the best thing to happen to us. At first, in all honesty, I adored this show. Thought it was the shit, immediately looked up merchandise for it, wanted to cosplay Red Eyes McBigBewbs at the next local con.But the more I watched, the more I questioned.This was one of the first ten anime I had ever watched from beginning to end. I hadn\'t even seen Death Note yet, that\'s how small of a weeb I was. So, at the time, this was the darkest anime I had ever seen.Then I watched more anime and began to hate myself and my standards.I kept asking, ""Why?"" Why does no one try to escape? Why does literally no one sympathize with children in a death camp without much reason to be there? Why is REMBB even here?It was fine when I started, but then I wanted to quit several times but didn\'t because hey I already started and I only have two episodes left and I have nothing else to do with my pathetic life except watching children beat each other with their own bloodAnd again. No reward.Literally could have...I don\'t know, hugged my cat more instead of watching the ""finale"" that was basically an ad for the OVA, which has basically NOTHING to do with the anime itself.OVERALL: 5In short, it was genuinely disappointing. A beautiful concept with an apparently brilliant manga gets a horrendous adaptation that leaves the viewer not getting anything but not wanting anything else. I honestly checked years ago to see if they were going to make a second season to this show just to see if they were going to try again. I would love to see a wonderful concept like this pull through and grow enticing, or at least incite a reaction besides, ""Eh.""So...is this the worst anime I\'ve ever seen? Well...no. But it\'s the worst relationship I have with one. It\'s like watching your kid, who you know is super talented and can probably end national poverty and hunger, never move out of the house and does nothing with their philosophy degree while bragging to everyone about how smart they are without actually doing anything with their knowledge, instead just locking themselves up in the basement and ranting on their blogs about how the smart people never get the jobs they deserve while he hasn\'t even looked in the classifieds of the newspaper. You can\'t say they\'re a terrible human, nor can you say they\'re good.Talent, along with a beautiful concept, means nothing if you don\'t do anything worthwhile with it.And this anime barely tries.', 'Deadman Wonderland was a very interesting anime in it\'s concept. The whole premise of someone being wrongly accused and forced into a violent situation is not unused by any stretch of the means but the way that it incorperated other elements made the anime very unique. I also loved the opeing theme.--STORY--As I said before, the main story of this anime is a story that has been used many times before but it is still a very good plot. The whle idea of Deadman Wonderland and the idea of a theme park like it existing is very fasincating to think about and is really...interesting to see. I loved the idea of the powers in this anime which I won\'t say to much about but just that they were pretty cool. The way the powers fit into the plot as well with different characters was great. The premise of the ""deadman"" as well was a great.--ART--The art style of this anime was very nice. It looked really good and was clear. The bright colours of the characters, the powers and the theme park in itself I think really made it so that art style could really be reconginsed and admired.--SOUND--Sound in this anime seemed like quite an important thing with the park and the fighting with powers. The sound used for the powers was great and I think really fit in well and the music was great too. As I said before, the opening theme is really catchy as well. ""i will be your deadman! with nothing but this blood on my hands, stuck in you wonderland!"" uh it\'s great.--CHARACTER--Let\'s just talk about the characters in this anime. They all really fascinated me and I was interested in all of them. Shrio was a great character to get to know and seeing her storyline and that was seperate to the main storyline was some of the most interesting parts to me. (spoliers i think, idk just spoliers to be safe) Also, once you meet the deadman and the characters that are trying to keep the tamed or destroy them if need be, all those characters are really interesting.--ENJOYMENT--I actually really enjoyed this anime and I remember whenever I was at school I would be sitting in class just waiting to get home to watch the next episode and therefore I watched it in two nights. I also may have missed a few project deadlines for it but it was worth it!--FINAL THOUGHTS--Overall, I really liked this anime and found it very intriging, unique and interesting.

This review may not be accurate and forgive me, but while watching this I did not comprehend everything that was happening. The boy was scared because he was in a place he shouldn't be for he was not guilty.In confinement...there are different type of torturing he indure each one worse than the last and none of it makes any sense because he shouldn't have to go through this and no one helps him. there are different type of torturing he indure each one worse than the last and none of it makes any sense because he shouldn't have to go through this and no one helps him."", ""If you don't like blood, then this isn't for you.

It is dark, bloody, depressing, and poised to make you hate almost every single character (and then love them and then hate them again) , and that's why for me it shines. While its structure is quite shonen in reality (strange powers, some villains look...like they were stolen straight from Kubo's sketch pad, themes of getting stronger, etc.), the series is so twisted that I can't really compare it to any other shonen manga out there. It truly is a class alll its own.

One of those is character development. While you do get background information on a lot of the characters, most of them aren't very traumatized by what they experienced. There is a lot of death and violence in this anime, but the characters, especially the main character who is still just a kid, aren't very affected by it all. Ganta is essentially the...same person he was in the beginning of the anime as he was at the very end of it. Though aside from most of the characters keeping their sanity despite being in situations that would make most people more than little insane, this anime does have very interesting, likeable characters in it.Another thing that just irks me about this anime is that it feels like the story isn't complete and is missing a couple things. There is a lot of senseless violence in this anime, but anyone who is even considering watching this anime probably already knows that, yet that isn't the problem I have with the story. You can tell that by the very end of the anime that the makers were trying to put a message or a moral behind the anime, but they failed and a lot of the reason why they failed has to do with the characters. If the characters had actually lost their sanity and perhaps of went through depression or something, then they could of effectively pulled off the message they tried to get through in the very last episode, but it seems like that message was a last minute idea that popped in their heads too late to be able to effectively produce it. Then there is the fact that a lot of things just don't add up at the end of the anime and you don't get any real closure, you're only left with questions without answers, though perhaps they did that on purpose so they could make a season two.Ultimately, Deadman Wonderland's major fault is with the characters and a couple of story holes, though everything else is what any violence lover would want in an anime. It has pretty great art, a catchy opening, and a great story concept, they just weren't able to pull it off to its full potential. I really do feel like this anime could have been something amazing like Wolfs Rain or Naruto if /only/ someone had put a little bit more work into the characters and patched up those story holes. However, I'm sure that if a season two is ever made, it will probably be /amazing/. same person he was in the beginning of the anime as he was at the very end of it.

Id say that if maybe it was more like 20 or so episodes that it would have...a soild story.I personally love this show but there are too few episodes and i noticed at first the storie was kinda slow up until like the 5th episode and then at the last 4 episodes there trying to hastaly rap up the series.So long in short i say that this anime definatly had potental but with only 12 episodes the story gets pushed along to fast a soild story.I personally love this show but there are too few episodes and i noticed at first the storie was kinda slow up until like the 5th episode and then at the last 4 episodes there trying to hastaly rap up the series.So long in short i say that this anime definatly had potental but with only 12 episodes the story gets pushed along to fast', 'Now... I really really enjoyed this anime. From beginning to end I absolutely loved it. You may be wondering why I gave it a 7 then. Well unfortunately, even though there is no big problem with the small amount of episodes I have here to judge, there is a problem. Way too short. This series has so much going on and it builds so much up only to have an ending that leaves so much to be wanted, almost as if they were going to make a second season but never did. I highly recommend watching through this anime and then reading the manga starting...chapter 21. As an experience, it\'s incredible. The world it creates is cruel, and never ceases to cause our main character, Ginta, problems. The animation is beautiful and everything from the fights to serious moments are captured beautifully. There is some issues with characters being weirdly low detailed when they are far from the ""camera"" but that\'s not a huge issue. The music is enjoyable and fits the tone, but it\'s very forgettable. There are many likable characters with great personalities, brought to life by a great Japanese voice cast(the English dub can get a bit irritating).

HOKAHA"", 'Gladiator games. In a theme park. With blood controlling mutants.This is a overview of Deadman Wonderland, a shorter adaption of the manga written by Jinsei Kataoka who frankly is probably crying himself to sleep knowing that such a reimagining exists. While such harsh critism is easy to give, I do in fact have a base for such words. Firstly when I first started watching I wasn\'t expecting much but a decent anime. How wrong I was. The basic plot is Ganta, the main character, is attempting to hunt down ""the red man"" who slaughtered his classmates and gave him the power to manipulate his blood...as a weapon. What could go wrong? Well, the thing is the series attempts to incorporate several arcs while keeping the main story going, but the 12 episode run time doesn\'t help them and the end result is a mess of loose ended arcs. Jumping from character to character, we don\'t even have time to fully engage with each person, resulting in a lack of interest. Each is 2D with a small back story but that is pretty much the limit with exception of shiro. also while I\'m on the subject of characters, how about this for development. At the beginning we are introduced to Ganta who is pretty much a whiny little bitch. But guess what? Come episode 12 what is he? Oh wait... Still a whiny little bitch who now has power to shoot blood. And Shiro just seems to have a mass crush on Ganta and takes it on herself to appear from everywhere,anytime, at just the right time to save him. Where does this romance lead? Nowhere. Okay rant on characters, check. Next up, setting. Long dark tunnels. And a birdcage. Oh, and a few empty rooms. That is what we\'re treated to over the course of the series. This ties in with just how twisted the series is a whole. And I mean twisted. The excess blood is necessary, but the torture themes are just there for the hell of it. Sound wise, the series is awesome with the opening theme actually working very well despite English language. artwork is average I guess, it was too covered in shadows and blood so meh. I decided to wrap this up relatively quickly purely because I genuinely just despise this series with a passion. If you\'re looking for a creative bloody drama then perhaps this is worth the risk given its different ideas. But if you want a good anime in any aspect, I suggest you give this a pass. as a weapon.

It has a couple of positives that save it from the 2 or 3 rating that it otherwise deserves, but this show is largely an abomination.Art-The art in this anime is actually quite good! Animation is fluid, there are a few presumably difficult to draw and animate moments such as the death race and the carnival corpse fights which were visually impressive and several characters are pretty...detailed in their design. I dislike some of the specific artistic choices that were made, but those ultimately come down to the extreme immaturity of the show as a whole rather than the way in which things were drawn and animated being butchered.Sound-Starting with the huge positive, the intro sequence and song are truly exceptionally high quality. The intro was among the best I\'ve ever seen, right up there with true standouts such as that of Cowboy Bebop or Death Parade. Also, the soundtrack as a whole is pretty good.Voice acting as a whole is decent, but it\'s hard to take it seriously with the ATROCIOUS writing in the dub. The script is among the worst I\'ve ever encountered and is unbelievably juvenile. I am nowhere near an anti-profanity Nazi by any means, but the constant foul language in this anime, and I do mean constant, is not utilized in a ""sometimes people swear in emotional or tense moments"" kind of way. It\'s much more ""I\'m 14 and I want to sound cool/be an adult"" and it simply sounds horrible. Constant F word, C word, P word... All the characters sound like middle schoolers who really need to mature and grow up. There are also loads of instances of characters calling each other ""bro"" or ""dude"" or saying lines such as ""It\'s called betrayal dude, duh..."" that you\'d expect to hear from someone very young and immature.Also, while I admit to possible subconscious bias as Greg Ayres is definitely one of my least favorite voice actors as an in general, I find the voice and tone of the main character to be absolutely obnoxious and I find him utterly wimpy, pathetic and unlikable.Also, there were definitely multiple occasions in the dub where characters were speaking/making sound but their lips/mouth were not moving. It was outright sloppy.Character/Story-Not saying this in an attempt to be humorous nor am I using hyperbole in order to convey a point- 100% dead serious it\'s clear to me that the target audience for this show is a troubled kid, probably male and between 12 and 16, who gets picked on or bullied and has no friends and dreams of revenge against his tormentors. I just cannot imagine this show resonating with anyone other than a troubled teenager. I loved the dark and nihilistic base premise of the show and badly wanted to get into the show as a whole but it very quickly derailed into an immature mess.And the plot as a whole is exactly that- a mess. It\'s absolutely all over the place, has many unexplained elements, has major issues with lack of resolution in regards to multiple important plot elements and overall lacks direction in a big way. It just jumps from here to there to somewhere else and there is very little rhyme or reason to it, all with terrible writing, an obnoxiously voiced lead character and violence and blood for the sake of violence and blood along the way.Speaking of violence and blood, this show has a major case of what my wife and I lovingly refer to as ""Claymore Syndrome""- that being when the fight scenes themselves are made up of 85% talking and 15% actual fighting and characters routinely pass up on opportunities to finish off their opponent, would rather have a conversation/talk smack/give a warning than actually fight and generally have no interest in actually harming or defeating the main character. The fight scenes should have been some of the highlights of the show but they just aren\'t. They\'re largely just more bad dialogue.The biggest positive in the character department is probably that Shiro is a truly unique and memorable character and she\'s pretty awesome as a whole, but she\'s not enough to extinguish the dumpster fire that is this show\'s plot.Enjoyment-If you read up to this point it\'s probably pretty clear that I largely disliked this show. It\'s not at all because I don\'t like dark and weird stuff either. Quite the opposite, actually. I watched and thoroughly enjoyed shows such as Future Diary, Madoka Magica, When They Cry, Hell Girl and others, but this show is just unbearably juvenile and the writing in the dub really is THAT bad.It scores a small amount of redemption points for mindless entertainment value- if you watch the entire show on mute and without subtitles- and Shiro is a cool character, but that\'s about where the positives end.Overall-Dark, creepy premise with a ton of potential absolutely butchered by juvenile, all over the place, free of resolution execution. Not a full on abortion because Shiro is awesome and a small amount of mindless entertainment value, but objectively a really bad show that I definitely don\'t recommend.+Dark, unique premise with a lot of potential+Shiro is unique and memorable+Great intro song and sequence-Unbelievably juvenile and immature from top to bottom-Atrocious writing-Wimpy, unlikable main character-Plot is all over the place and an overall mess-Lack of resolution to many important plot elementsOBJECTIVE RATING- 3PERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 4 detailed in their design.

What in the world...Thought this was the best tv show ever.. until half way through the season. It became super rushed. I found myself staring at my phone hoping to get notifications from my friends replies in messages.Wish the show had more episodes so it wouldn't feel so rushed. It didn't feel finished. I was shocked to see the season was over when I finished it!Super awesome soundtrack! It had a fresh new song for every scene! Matched the scene perfectly too.Characters needed more build up though. When some died I didn't really feel sympathy. I felt like I should have been...depressed or something like that but it was really just like finding out somebody died in the newspaper. depressed or something like that but it was really just like finding out somebody died in the newspaper."", 'I won\'t give this anime slack for being incomplete, even without any attempt at a satisfying conclusion, whether for a season or otherwise. I knew that going in, so it wouldn\'t be quite fair.However, that set aside, it really disappointed. The story, which sees Ganta Igarashi being imprisoned in a cruel, brutal and privately owned prison-slash-amusement park (which is a very disturbed concept to begin with, so shouldn\'t that at least have been somewhat interesting?), veers off-course at least twice, and those veers aren\'t insignificant. Is it really about the prison, or is it about the sudden superpowers that show up almost out of the...blue? I know the answer may be ""both"", but what we did have going on about the prison was suddenly tossed aside for the powers.The art is decent, but not exactly the nicest looking style if you ask me. That\'s pretty subjective, though, so I\'m sure lots of people like the look of it a lot more.The music is pretty good. The opening theme, in particular, is much better than the rest of the anime (really, you might as well watch the opening and skip the rest of it, if you really want my opinion). Why do I give the sound a 5 then? Ganta Igarashi\'s dub voice is one of the most annoying voices I\'ve heard in my dubbed anime history (which includes 4Kids, for perspective). I really do want to feel bad for this kid, he really is in a crap situation and I\'m sure most people would react to his situation the way he does, but that voice really gets on my nerves.The main characters are not at all interesting, at least to me. Ganta whines and cries an babbles on uselessly. Shiro is mysterious, but mostly just comes off annoying (particularly if you don\'t look up spoilers). Crow is about the coolest character in the show, and about the only one I actually like, but that may just be because he\'s voiced by Patrick Seitz in the dub; if it were anyone else, I probably wouldn\'t even like him.In terms of enjoyment, and overall, it was a drag. It was pretty boring, and as far as it being a violent and gory anime, well...I guess so. But there honestly wasn\'t that much gore (at least in the version I watched. Maybe that was the censored version and it\'s much worse). I\'ll give it kudos, I guess, for having some hard-to-watch scenes. I was just expecting more in terms of violence and gore, and was quite disappointed with what we seem to have gotten. Guess I shouldn\'t have watched Hellsing Ultimate before this.Overall, while I would like to be able to recommend Deadman Wonderland, I just can\'t.

There aren't too many huge plot twists like in a lot of other anime.The only gripes I have are that i don't really like reading subtitles so i like English dubbed anime and they always use the same crappy voice actors....the main characters voice is especially annoying.It was also disappointing to get to part 12 only to realise that it wasn't the last episode and there was a whole other series that they haven't finished yet the main characters voice is especially annoying.It was also disappointing to get to part 12 only to realise that it wasn't the last episode and there was a whole other series that they haven't finished yet"", 'Theres a short and easy way to explain tbis series and it is ""Wasted Potential"".Story-3The story is what pulled me into the series in the first place it was a unique and interesting idea to me. Although episode after episode the story crumbles. I had more and more questions that were never explained which just ended up feathering my interest. Also its incredibly predictable and takes alot of the initial punch from many scenes.Art-2The only reason im even giving a 2 and not a 1 is because i love Shiros character design.Other than that the scenes are filled with choppy and embarrassing frames, the...main characters look like extras in a more popular show. The protagonist design is unappealing and quite frankly is a shame to shiro. Shiro deserves a better cast with a better show.Sound-5Nothing really stuck out to me.

Shiro is the reason im giving a 2 and not a 1. Shes lovable and badass besides the fact her backstory is awful and leaves more plot holes. Every other character relationship is god awful. The show just throws away characters we thought were going to be useful to the side like we never even met them. The protagonist is useless, he doesn\'t ever strive to become stronger despite the fact he always wines about being weak. And when he FINALLY does the plot gives him a boost.

There is high amount of cursing and profanity but it seemed cringy for me and that they try and curse in every sentence.

It was a pretty good and entertaining anime. Plus, in my opinion, the dub was pretty funny and decent. The theme song slaps and the story was well told. Most of the characters were great and helped to push the story forward. But have you ever watched an anime where you despised the main character? And or thought that they were unfit to be the main character? Well, get ready for Ganta, one of the most pointless and useless main characters around. I understand that he went through a horrible experience and he\'s just a...kid thrown to the wolves. But, that does not give him an excuse to be as toxic a person as he is. I feel like every time Ganta takes a step forward in his character development the next scene pushes him 2 or 3 steps back from where he just was. It also doesn\'t help that his plot armor is so thick. In most of the fights that he gets in, he should not win or he should die, but he doesn\'t. And I don\'t mind the plot armor, but I can feel his kicking in in EVERYTHING he does. It\'s like the writers put him into a fight and then realize he can\'t win unless some ex-Machina shows up or the enemy lets him KO them. I feel he goes nowhere in his journey of growth, even when the writers have Shiro talk about how he, ""always gets back up"" it feels like she\'s talking about someone else to me. Even at the end when Ganta gives his monologue showing his growth I didn\'t believe it.

I was looking forward to getting this anime off my ""planned for later"" list, but alas, it did not live up to the expectations that I had in mind. The first couple of episodes were honestly God Tier and made me want to binge, however, I believe this anime fell into the 12-episode curse, where so much started happening, that nothing felt important, and lost its way. By what I recall the 5th episode, this show started feeling like a chore to watch and stopped being entertaining. I couldn\'t tell you the premise after that episode....I think it banked off the gore aspect and put little thought elsewhere.If you want to watch this show, go for it, I am sure there is an audience, because it has become a cult classic. but in the end, I was left feeling very underwhelmed.

The story is very interesting, being explained with enough detail so that you know what you\'re following, but not too much so that you don\'t feel the mystery factor. During the whole watch, you will find yourself wondering what are the true intentions of this mysterious...prison really is. One weak side of this anime though is that it often rushes stuff, and you will often question a lot of stuff that needed answers really badly.But the story isn\'t the only thing that this anime excels at. One of the best things about this masterpiece is the characters. Each one is lovable and hateable in their own sense, I\'m sure they will leave you in a rollercoaster of emotions. One bad thing about this anime, which sadly is all too common is the basic main character syndrome. If you\'ve seen a shounen anime you know what I mean. Ganta is the typical Wah-i\'m-useless-in-all-aspects-but-everyone-loves-me-because-of-my-dedication-strong-will-and-love-of-friendship MC, but if you manage to ignore it then you will find this anime really enjoyable.The art style is really detailed and pretty, even though there are gigantic amounts of blood almost every minute (though that is an important premise). All the characters look unique and interesting. The art style also looks like a mix of old 90\'s anime and new 10\'s anime, but that mix suits this anime pretty well.The sound is nothing special, but it\'s nothing bad either. One annoying thing is using the same battle music and ""sad moment"" music over and over again, it gets kinda boring. Other than that the voice acting is really solid in the Japanese version (i haven\'t seen the dub to judge), but they usually fall for the engrish cliche, and that happens often here.Other than the engrish cliche, there aren\'t many more. Of course, you will sometimes find the classic \'Don\'t look at my boobs you perv\' cliche but that happens rarely, i think it happens only in about 2 or 3 episodes. Other than that there aren\'t other cliches.Overall this anime is really fun and interesting and I recommend you watch it, especially for the characters, except the main character. prison really is.

Not by treating you to expressive animation or developed characters, but by some other method. A series can show you just how lucky we are to live in a world where its peers do not follow in its footsteps, for if they did, there would be no reason to watch anime at all. For me, that series is Deadman Wonderland.This series sucks. I've watched 3 episodes, but there is no indication to me that there will be anything of value in the entire series. I'm no expert, but I think...it is best to avoid this show completely.[Rating]Story: 2Art: 2Sound: 2Character: 1Enjoyment: 2Overall: 2[Story: 2]The story is what I can talk about the least, given that I only made it three episodes in. However, I can tell that the world-building is completely sporadic and just does not make any sense. It seems like the entire world is based on the idea that seeing people suffer is fun. I was turned off by this during the court scene in Episode 1, where the court members physically beat Ganta and seem to be so sure that this little boy caused the tragedy at his school. I normally don't care about how a series deviates from reality in order to progress its plot, but this is just a fundamental misunderstanding of human nature. It happens again as early as Episode 2 in the obstacle course, where the crowd is just super excited to watch the prisoners. I would be fine with this if there were some reason, but there is no reason. It is awful world development.Along these lines, the story-telling is garbo. It is so incredibly disconnected and incoherent. Episode 1 is packing so many things in and failing while Episode 2 is just a throwaway episode where nothing of consequence happens. There are several moments when the audience is just totally uprooted, like in Episode 3 where Ganta is trying to get to G Block, is running through the facility, and somebody has to tell him that he has no idea where G Block is just so that he must ask Shiro for help. Like... where the hell are you running if you don't know where you are going. These things are so simple to not screw up with any semblance of planning or storytelling talent.I'm sure the story gets more involved and the stakes get higher and the mysteries of the red dude get revealed but... come on. There is just nothing truly exciting about any of this. It isn't all on the story; the characters take a large brunt of this criticism as well. But the story isn't doing us any favors.[Art: 2]Everything is boring and sucks. The action animation sucks, the effects stand out way too much. The color palette is dreadful. The background and machines suck. The character design really sucks, so bland or just ugly.

Other than that, sure the sound design is usually absent. Which is better than it being there but awful. So... thats something, right? But when the sound design is activated, it just blows out everything with gusto and totally uproots the audience. Why is this show like this?[Character: 1]There are no characters. There you go. Ganta is nothing. The only thing I know about Ganta is that he had friends that we know nothing about and that he is whiny. He is the main character. That is all I can tell you about his personality. Shiro is maybe unique but I still have no attachment to her. Every other character is like a trope of their respective character archetypes, like the warden or the prison boss. No character has any depth or even motivations. A complete joke.[Enjoyment: 2]I think I have made it obvious that I don't enjoy really any category of this series. In fact, I think what I enjoyed most is simply how bizarre it is and how spectacularly it fails.[Overall: 2]Nothing to say here. it is best to avoid this show completely.[Rating]Story: 2Art: 2Sound: 2Character: 1Enjoyment: 2Overall: 2[Story: 2]The story is what I can talk about the least, given that I only made it three episodes in.

It had an awesome opening and while the protagonist was annoying from the get-go, he was at least believable. It starts strong and then putters out as the series progresses.Starting off, the art style and animation work is absolutely phenomenal and at no point did it ever falter. Characters are crisp, movements are fluid, and the amount of work the creators put into the visuals is evident in every frame. The violence and gore is top notch and every wound is visceral and fulfilling.The sound is also superb. No overused soundboard effects.The music could overall have been...a bit better and that is my only complaint.As for the story, you will be let down. There is much intrigue toward the beginning but then the story quickly develops major pacing problems that plague the narrative up to the final seconds of the last episode. Characters are introduced and killed within seconds, characters that deserve  full introduction never get one and the viewer is left wondering why they should care in the slightest about a character they've known for a little over half an episode. Except for several side characters, character development is slow and we get a meager piece of it in the final episode.Characters come and go without warning and simply disappear with no explanation. Several of the characters have far more interesting backstories than the episodes give them time for. This is especially so with the villains. Antagonists go from being on the side of the hero to simply not with little explanation as well.There are so many loose ends at the end of this one. There is no fulfillment for the viewer and nothing is explained. There are major subplots that you never see come to fruition. Shiro's backstory is barely explained and her true nature is barely revealed at all. So much is left unresolved that it's frustrating and was honestly upsetting for me. because the investment I had in the series never paid off.Much is hinted at but it feels like it ends halfway through a season, not at the end of one.Speaking of that, there are no plans for a second season (at this time) so you'll have to read the manga (which this detracts from slightly) if you want to know what happens.About halfway through I would have recommended this anime but by the end all I can say is steer clear or read the manga. a bit better and that is my only complaint.As for the story, you will be let down.

This one of those shows that meets a lot of hate and criticism, some say it sucks, some call it a masterpiece, others hide behind the fact that the manga was better. But no matter how good or bad the source material is, the...adaptation is an entirely different work that can have a lot of issues on its own, slow-pacing, event-skipping, filler and more.- Story (6.0/10):On one of those lovely quite days, a major incident took place in Tokyo, a humongous explosion that ended up erasing great landscapes in an out-of-this-world manner. 10 years later, A private prison had already rested on the exact same location the explosion originated from, under the name of Wonderland that uses its prisoners as a source of entertainment for other people putting them in death battles, challenges, events. And keeping a spare of interesting residents are test subjects.A naive middle school student, Ganta, gets framed for killing his entire classmates by some of the prison's officials and as consequence, he's sent to Wonderland to serve his sentence. Filled with hatred and Anger towards the Red Man that massacred his friends, he strives to get his revenge. If you're still wondering about the “Deadman” part in the title, that's a term used to refer to people that have a special power called “The Branch of Sin” that allows the users to control their blood in a manner that enables them to fight, we're talking about bloody swords, tentacles, bullets...etc. Cool huh? Well, the idea and everything is there, but the execution was not what you'd call a great job. In a lot of other shows, slow pacing kills off a lot of the hype and story progression, but in this one, there was a pacing very fast that the story itself couldn't keep up in a steady way, and thus rendered most of the event blurry and dull. The action starts up very early on, but I'm really not the type of guy that gets impressed by flashy colors and butterflies, in this case, gore and violence. Yes, I do enjoy my gory anime, but only if it was done right and in concise doses, and I'll spare Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate from this because those had their reasons. As I mentioned before, this is like that edgy early teen boy that thinks he is cool and badass just because he can spit off slurs and throw in partial nudity and excessive gore every 3 minutes, no, that's not the way to do it. A lot of very important plot points got skipped and never were explained, and most of the flashback characters were never officially introduced or given a proper reason on how they disappeared.- Art (8.0/10):If anything, they did not slack off animating blood, and thankfully they didn't, seeing how it plays a major role than just acting like a dumb liquid that needs every excuse to splash around (Why am I getting worked up over blood? lol). Something I like here was the character designs, I have to give some extra points just for that, no crazy hairstyles, no inhuman anatomy or anything from that caliber, but still, it had its own cartoonish taste, and fed perfectly their sadistic smiles with life and horror. And I'm dead serious, those were some really terrifying evil smiles that could alone immobilize you. The way the fights where animated made up for the horrible story progression in my eyes. I never knew I was into good liquid animation until I saw how fluid their blood flowed (literally). I'm queuing up some GIF of blood projectiles at the moment of writing this review just for how satisfying they felt when they hit the target.- Sound (7.0/10):Let's talking about the opening and ending theme songs and get them out of the way. The opening is unforgettable, and seeing how it has English lyrics all the way till the end makes it a bit easy on the memory, sounding as savage as the show wants to pretend to be like, and as the first lyric says “Slit the throat of reason and reality”, that alone prepares you for what there is in store of madness to come.Unlike the opening, the ending theme song was very light on the heart, both on the audio and the visuals, complimented by the characters in their past lives when everything was still okay. I can't say much about the soundtrack as I am all focusing on the blood animations, I could have sworn I canceled all other senses just to power up my sight and get the most out of those fluid animations. The voice acting was decent, talking about the SUB version here, I didn't enjoy the main character's high pitched voice that much, to be honest.- Character (6.5/10):I thought for the longest time that Yuki from Mirai Nikki is holding the title of the most annoying main character, but I guess that Ganta might steal that away from him, the guy literally is made to annoy the freaks out of you. Making immature wrong decisions all of the time, and never learns from his mistakes, acts always like he's the one in the right path and keeps mumbling some talk-no-jutsu black magic while being the most hypocrite figure on the show. And the list keeps on going filled with forgettable characters except for one cool guy called Crow, he sure got his ssslices (yes, that's how it's spelled) on point.- Enjoyment (7.0/10):I would be frank here, I had to pause the series midway for some in real life reasons, and I haven't resumed the watch until a month later, and to make it even harsh on the show, the first 6 episodes weren't all that exciting for me that I was going to give up on the series and give it a 5 or lower, but I feel like the last half had some improvements over the first one. It really took its time to introduced major characters, 4 episodes left to the end and tons of questions were still unanswered.- Overall (7.1/10):Not my proudest recommendation. Before watching it for myself, the title of the show always gave me shivers of badassery and excitement to see the actual anime, but it didn't turn up the way I imagined it to be, in fact, it wasn't even close. However, that doesn't make it entirely a bad show, I enjoyed what there was for me to enjoy. Do I want a sequel? absolutely, and as I've said, the general idea of the plot sounds very cool, and I'd like to see a better remake or a deserving sequel that makes up for this, a lot say the Manga is better, and that brings some hope. adaptation is an entirely different work that can have a lot of issues on its own, slow-pacing, event-skipping, filler and more.- Story (6.0/10):On one of those lovely quite days, a major incident took place in Tokyo, a humongous explosion that ended up erasing great landscapes in an out-of-this-world manner. 10 years later, A private prison had already rested on the exact same location the explosion originated from, under the name of Wonderland that uses its prisoners as a source of entertainment for other people putting them in death battles, challenges, events.

I\'m going to make this as cognitive as possible, but seeing as how the show lineage itself was a bit hectic, we\'ll see how this goes.My biggest problem with the show was exactly that, lack of information. It felt like it missed some episodes somewhere in the middle or something. Events just sort of happened, and they weren\'t explained until much later if at all. I\'m all for ambiguous stories, but this was just hard to follow altogether. The main plot holes being this:What is the history of Ganta and...Shiro being together as little kids, and why did Ganta not remember it at first?I\'m assuming Shiro had split personality or something, right? For that one moment she wasn\'t Shiro, but that\'s the only thing we ever saw of it and it was never explained. Or how Shiro ended up in Deadman Wonderland far before Ganta.Also, not near enough was explained about the expolsion that orignaly caused the blood-power disease thing. We were handed a LOT of events, but not enough information to make it coherent.BUT, I give a strong E for Effort. There was definitely a lot of really incredible and unique things about this show too.Of course, my favorite thing is Shiro. She is your typical cutesy character on the surface maybe, but she has a very complex story (one that audiences really have to configure on their own granted) but her unusually sweet atmosphere along with her unique attire, Shiro is easily the most interesting thing in this show. She is a sweet, fun loving girl who loves sweets, but she can also be insanely strong and kill pretty much anyone. Which, I can always get behind a strong female lead who DOESN\'T depend solely on the guy she loves. It\'s really vice versa in this case. Ganta is kind of a sniveling little weasel for 90% of the show, but that\'s his arc, right? He is driven solely on revenge of his friends who were murdered in the very beginning, but at some point he reaches the arc of realizing he can\'t live solely off of hatred for the red man, but we never saw when that change exactly happened? And by the end, he stopped talking about the red man altogether. Except for that ending, which I actually kind of loved. Like I said, I like ambiguous things. Leaves room for interpretation. Can Ganta still love Shiro after that discovery? Who knows?The music in this show is PHENOMENAL. I felt the heavy rock intro and OST parts were really fitting and exciting, but really all the music succeeded in adding suspense and excitement.The animation style was also exquisite. Especially the design of the characters, obviously.I see a lot of complaints online about 2 things with this show though, one of which I don\'t agree at all with, the other only half way.The first one is that there is a debate that this show has ""too much"" gore and cursing and is there solely for the sake of being shocking and over the top. I think it is a little over the top yes, but I think it is that way intentionally. Though the show is chaotic from start to finish, some of the themes in it are very blatantly obvious. An amusement park where people watch criminals compete in competitions and kill each-other is obviously something that would never happen in real life, right? I think so because I still have enough faith in humanity. But humanity is also really sick and a lot of us enjoy watching things equally as sick, just in our heads, it\'s all make believe. We watch horror movies and read scary stories because we know it isn\'t real. But why do we enjoy it? Doesn\'t it make us just a little bit whach to get such enjoyment out of others misery? Fictional or not? Deadman Wonderland is the same thing, and while we know the theme park is real, the customers there do not. It\'s like it\'s punishing us for liking something so sick and twisted. This show is taking a mirror and shouting at us ""look at how messed up you are!"" And while it isn\'t exactly a pretty and positive one, I think it IS effective. So yes, I do think the cursing and violence was VERY necessary indeed.The last thing I see a lot is complaints about there being too many characters. I think I disagree with this too for the most part. I think the characters we had were a good number, I just wish we had seen more of some. My biggest example is Ganta\'s two friends at the beginning who died. This is the thing that drives Ganta through it all, yet we as an audience know basically nothing about them. Obviously they were innocent kids, and their death is sad and all but... because we knew nothing about them, it didn\'t affect us as deeply, therefore we didn\'t connect with Ganta as deeply as we could have. I do also wish we could have seen more of Minatsuki (Yo\'s sister) simply because she was quirky, and because she had a very complex story which we never really learned much about (goes back to that lack of information thing I was talking about). But she was an interesting character, who obviously had some evil IN her (like all of the other prisoners) but wasn\'t all bad. Her and Senji.... Senji was cool. I wish we could have seen more of him too, simply because he was probably one of the most likeable characters, aside from Shiro. (But the OVA does give us a good background on Senji, which is nice).But all in all, this anime is very ambitious and does sell itself a little bit short, but... I think there is something there. I\'ve heard the manga is significantly better so maybe I\'ll give that a shot. But if you\'re interested in watching a show that is unique and beautifully animated, check this one out. It\'s a lot to decipher, but I think it\'s still pretty solid. Shiro being together as little kids, and why did Ganta not remember it at first?I\'m assuming Shiro had split personality or something, right? For that one moment she wasn\'t Shiro, but that\'s the only thing we ever saw of it and it was never explained.

Which, I can always get behind a strong female lead who DOESN\'T depend solely on the guy she loves. It\'s really vice versa in this case. Ganta is kind of a sniveling little weasel for 90% of the show, but that\'s his arc, right? He is driven solely on revenge of his friends who were murdered in the very beginning, but at some point he reaches the arc of realizing he can\'t live solely off of hatred for the red man, but we never saw when that change exactly happened? And by the end, he stopped talking about the red man altogether. Except for that ending, which I actually kind of loved. Like I said, I like ambiguous things. Leaves room for interpretation. Can Ganta still love Shiro after that discovery? Who knows?The music in this show is PHENOMENAL. I felt the heavy rock intro and OST parts were really fitting and exciting, but really all the music succeeded in adding suspense and excitement.The animation style was also exquisite. Especially the design of the characters, obviously.I see a lot of complaints online about 2 things with this show though, one of which I don\'t agree at all with, the other only half way.The first one is that there is a debate that this show has ""too much"" gore and cursing and is there solely for the sake of being shocking and over the top. I think it is a little over the top yes, but I think it is that way intentionally. Though the show is chaotic from start to finish, some of the themes in it are very blatantly obvious. An amusement park where people watch criminals compete in competitions and kill each-other is obviously something that would never happen in real life, right? I think so because I still have enough faith in humanity. But humanity is also really sick and a lot of us enjoy watching things equally as sick, just in our heads, it\'s all make believe. We watch horror movies and read scary stories because we know it isn\'t real. But why do we enjoy it? Doesn\'t it make us just a little bit whach to get such enjoyment out of others misery? Fictional or not? Deadman Wonderland is the same thing, and while we know the theme park is real, the customers there do not. It\'s like it\'s punishing us for liking something so sick and twisted. This show is taking a mirror and shouting at us ""look at how messed up you are!"" And while it isn\'t exactly a pretty and positive one, I think it IS effective. So yes, I do think the cursing and violence was VERY necessary indeed.The last thing I see a lot is complaints about there being too many characters. I think I disagree with this too for the most part. I think the characters we had were a good number, I just wish we had seen more of some. My biggest example is Ganta\'s two friends at the beginning who died. This is the thing that drives Ganta through it all, yet we as an audience know basically nothing about them. Obviously they were innocent kids, and their death is sad and all but... because we knew nothing about them, it didn\'t affect us as deeply, therefore we didn\'t connect with Ganta as deeply as we could have. I do also wish we could have seen more of Minatsuki (Yo\'s sister) simply because she was quirky, and because she had a very complex story which we never really learned much about (goes back to that lack of information thing I was talking about). But she was an interesting character, who obviously had some evil IN her (like all of the other prisoners) but wasn\'t all bad. Her and Senji.... Senji was cool. I wish we could have seen more of him too, simply because he was probably one of the most likeable characters, aside from Shiro. (But the OVA does give us a good background on Senji, which is nice).But all in all, this anime is very ambitious and does sell itself a little bit short, but... I think there is something there. I\'ve heard the manga is significantly better so maybe I\'ll give that a shot. But if you\'re interested in watching a show that is unique and beautifully animated, check this one out. It\'s a lot to decipher, but I think it\'s still pretty solid.', ""I don't usually write reviews but this show is getting undeserved hate.the show knows what it is doing and delivers it perfectly. the direction is good and it isn't a bad adaptation at all. it delivered what it promised.the studio went bankrupt after an year so there won't be a second seasason thus the story is imcomplete but it doesn't leave off at an unsatisfactory moment. you'll have to read about 30 chapters after the show.it has some pretty violent themes especially blood and gore is excessive. so' you should avoid it if it isn't to your taste. and if you dislike it after watching...then my friend, the show's description and genre tags make it clear what you are getting into so it's your fault for not doing any research before starting the show. then my friend, the show's description and genre tags make it clear what you are getting into so it's your fault for not doing any research before starting the show."", ""Deadman Wonderland, an anime which is awesome in its battle sequences, and the games themselves are just brutal.I quite enjoyed it.

I can't say why though, because it'll contain spoilers.The overall premise of the story was good. We both liked it. It was weird and grotesque in its deliverance, but, all the same, it was good.The only problem was, was that it doesn't end in the way...the manga ended I think, I haven't read the manga, but I'm sure it didn't end the way the anime ended it.

First episode did not make me feel that much at all, second episode was much better and I started telling myself that maybe it wasn't going to be bad but when I finally reached the middle, I just wanted the anime to end already.I don't know how much the anime is similarly to the manga but I personally did not like the flow of the anime. One episode the characters are doing something, some episodes later...something else is going on, few episodes later the mc has another goal already and I honestly felt incomplete with mostly everything. A lot happened in those twelve episodes but none of it felt complete to me. I felt like things were only partly developed and comparing the ending with the beginning made me feel like nothing was accomplished in the end.All of the MCs' goals did not bear any fruits.Concerning the characters, only Crow/Senji was interesting to me. He was the only character that I actually liked from the moment he was introduced until the end. I just like his general aura and the other characters just didn't do anything for me. They didn't impact me in any way. Some of them were introduced but they didn't do anything important at all. They were just there.About Shiro, I saw her, I was not sure if I was going to like her, ended up telling myself that she was not as bad as I thought she would be but in the end, she turned out to be annoying to me. About the main character, I don't know about him. I guess that in the end he made some progress? I just guess. And the villains are just so-so.To be honest, I like the power that Ganta acquired. Fighting with blood is really interesting but what more can I say? I will probably (maybe some day) read the manga to see if things are better there but yeah, I did not like it. something else is going on, few episodes later the mc has another goal already and I honestly felt incomplete with mostly everything.

Thus leaving people scratching their heads going ""How?"". And as I jump from one boat to the next I can only now fulling understand how big the gap is. I still made the jump though lol.So Deadman Wonderland is a show with an eye catching title. In fact, that is probably a great way to describe this show. This adaptation takes us through a world where a prison doubles as a theme park and how an...innocent boy must survive it. Sounds fun, but it\'s also pretty generic. Like take out the prison part and leave the statement how it is and you realize that the setting could be replaced with anything and you could probably find a show title to fit it. To be fair, I didn\'t give much more context, so I do it again except not include a setting. Ready?An average middle schooler is put into a life or death situation against his will and must fight for his life or roll over and die. He has a special power he only got maybe ten minutes before said thrusting into dangerous situation and needs to learn to use it to survive.See what I mean? Add a new setting and you get a different title. I mention this now because it will come up a lot across this review since it affects a lot of the story. So let\'s finish off the corpse that is a left behind.Story: 5Well considering the above, this section really falls to further details and thoughts. Oh well lol. So our mid schooler is known as Ganta. He was sent to prison for mass murder, that he didn\'t commit, and now has to live in a prison till his execution comes. The prison just so happens to be the only prison that is also a public theme park. A park that shows the most viscious survival games to be shown at any event. I mean these events are designed to kill the prisoners kind of viscious. ""But why must the prisoners participate. if they know its meant to kill them?"" You may ask. Well because they are all on deathrow, the execution is done by poisoning. They run these games, among other things, because that allows them to buy themselves the antidote that is put in a piece of candy (gotta stick to the theme, am i right?). The antidote, however, has a limited effectiveness time and they are slowly being poisoned. So its a constant struggle to get more.You may be thinking that this makes the story less generic, but the whole thing about the park is more setting building and the part I described about the main character is just how he got thrown into his deadly situation. The story hasn\'t even begun yet. It starts after he realizes that he can shoot a bullet, made from his own blood, out of his hand. This gets him admitted to a gladiator game and this is where his story truely begins.As far as I can, and want, to say, this story could use some work or maybe just not be event driven. The story revolves around the events presented, the characters act in accordance to how the event is laid out, and then its wait for the next event. It gives the illusion of growth by having the characters have desires and plan stuff, but its just a trick because they still play their part when each event comes. For example, Ganta never stops being a whining kid. He doesn\'t grow from being a kid who either wishes he was dead or complains about how horrible something is. He learns a new move or two but he as a charcter never changes.Another thing is that the adaptation only covers part of the manga, but that is outside of the shows control. Still sucks though.I honestly would have liked for better than just simple blood and gore. I liked it when I watched it both times through, but I can\'t help but think that there was more that could of been done to make it less generic.Art and Sound: 8 and 8High points here. To start with, the art looks great. It does very well with showing the colorfulness of the park while also giving you a sense of dread with how dangerous or unforgiving the the prison is. The animation is also really good as well. Characters movements have a really good flow to them and the gore is good to a sicken level. Effects are good between the blood attacks to the theme park fireworks. It looks simply great while also accoumpanied by great music. I headbang to the opening everytime my phone lands on the song. It is honestly the best track this show has. The ending is good too, but I didn\'t get into it as much. The background pieces are also good too. the metal theme sticks around as well as adding some piano pieces. Even better, the pieces seem fitted to the scenes they are shown in. So that is another plus. I keep haveing little to say about both of these since I believe that when art and sound is done well, you just go along with it. It took me the second run through to really come up with descriptive details.Characters: 6Another hit for this show. Like I said earlier, this is an event driven plot, not a character driven one. That means nobody gets developed; they just stay as their archetype. To be honest, the list of archetypes on both good guys and bad guys are getting a bit old. For example, there is a big, tough guy character who enjoys one thing. Can you guess what? If you said fights then you win. I already mentioned Ganta and his weak kid archetype. Or how about a guy who enjoys using his power to prove how much stronger he is than the other prisoners but underestimates the limits of his powers. Yep these are getting old. I mean, these are basic and hard to avoid but where are my midget cowboys with twin revolvers and a bad temper. Looney Toons refrences aside, the one thing I can say is that they have nice voice actors. Even if one has to voice a doctor who enjoys seeing people i pain as much as she does giving it. Damnit, the archetypes are just flooding out now. Next segment, please. Hurrry.Enjoyment: 7Putting it all together, I have to stand by my ""Appealing to the eye"" summary. This show is basically another filter of the same, old story we have heard over and over again. But damnit, I had fun doing it. I love blood and gore and this gave and gave and gave to the point of being concerning. The story might as well of been ignoreable but I followed along anyways. I just wanted to get to the next piece of gore. So I guess that is where the hook lies with this show. So may say you need to turn off your brain to watch this but honestly leave it on...... You don\'t want to develope any nasty habits while its away.Overall:7And yes, I have already seeked help for the gore obsession. I am currently playing BLoodborne and is on New Game+ 4. :P innocent boy must survive it. Sounds fun, but it\'s also pretty generic.

It had so much potential that was wasted. If shows going off track of the original plot doesn\'t bother you as much as me I would give it a try.For starters, the idea of this brutal prison that makes its prisoners fight to survive is thrown out the window half way through the show as the characters decide to focus on escaping instead.It started out with the prisoners playing life or death games in order to get...the antidote to a poison being injected into them through a collar. But Ganta then awakens a power where he can use his blood as a weapon and he\'s now apart of the ""Deadmen"" who have to do one-on-one battles and the loser loses a random body part. The battles and antidote were never brought up again until the last episode but then it didn\'t even have any significance.Ganta has little to no development. He whines and cries the entire show but somehow wins in fights against characters who are stronger than him in every way possible. Speaking of characters, there were so many that seemed important and then only got pushed to the side later on.They sounded like middle schoolers who just learned the word fuck. Maybe it was just the dub that was like this but every sentence they spoke had shit and fuck in it at least twiceAll in all, if you like blood and violence go for it.

As a fan of action, mystery, and horror anime, I was awed in the beginning of this anime because of the intriguing story of deadman wonderland. However, when it got to the middle, the character development was somewhat poor since I didn't learn any background information from major characters like Crow and the Mockingbird. I still had my hopes up since the art style and story was up my alley. However, the anime ended in a very confusing way and it felt incomplete. Is there a season 2 to this because it needs it.

I\'ll give more details in the paragraphs below, and you should expect spoilers, I\'ll always put...warnings beforehand, but be careful, read at your own risks.I can think of two main things that the anime does well, and they are linked : the fighting scenes and the animation in general. It was released in 2011 but the visuals are great, I have to reckon that every fight felt epic and dynamic, and one could argue that it\'s the most important thing for a shonen, Deadman Wonderland didn\'t dissapoint in that regard. To some extent, the fights and the animation look better than some seasonal isekais or romcoms released in 2022. Furthermore, the gore aspect felt coherent, and I can assume it was something the manga fans were expecting at the time of release, so yeah in the end, regarding the animation, I really think it\'s one the best thing the anime has to offer, that\'s mostly what kept me entertained enough to finish the show.Unfortunately, pretty much everything else felt weird, inconsistent or too rushed.!!! Expect spoilers in the following paragraph !!!- The story :I know we are talking about a shonen, meaning that scenarios aren\'t usually the strongest thing, but here, the story just doesn\'t make sense at all. I assume better explanations are given in the manga ( but at the same time, I\'m pretty sure many incoherences are the in the manga ) , but judging from what is shown in the anime, the world building is simply bad. They are trying to establish some rules all along the story, but they aren\'t respected or will make you tear your hair out because of how stupid the rules are and what they imply. Here are a few examples : around episode 5 or 6, we learn that there is a secret part in the prison called G block, where ONLY Deadman prisoners go. Deadman people being humans with blood superpowers, but somehow, you\'ll only see a few of the prisoners there actually use their powers ? The heroes will meet a resistance group later on, and only the leaders will use superpowers, the rest of the mob will use normal weapons during fights ? The show explains the existence of a ""tournament"" where deadman fight each other, a deadly match with high stakes, if the loser is still alive, he\'ll face a harsh penalty etc... Alright, but how are we supposed to believe the credibility of such a thing ? One of the deadman the mc will meet has been in the prison for 2 YEARS ? Trust me, this isn\'t nitpicking, and it\'s probably linked with the rush problem of this season, but rules introduced aren\'t explained enough and/or arn\'t plausible. And by the way, why is there even a resistance group in this ""secret"" part of the prison ? Why is it allowed ? How come those prisoners; depicted as death row inmates/violent criminals; can roam freely in this secret prison ?In addition, the anime will try at times to slip a few jokes here and there that feel completely out of place, the same goes for the few fanservice scenes. It\'s another problem of the story, the targeted audience, at times the story tries to go full drama and build some tension, give a dark atmosphere to the story with life or death situations, but in the meanwhile, the anime will use some cringe dialogs to look ""cool"" by using swear words, english swearing etc...!!!!!!! BIG SPOILERS AT THE END OF THE NEXT PARAGRAPH !!!!!!!- Characters and development :The rush problem hits again, the characters arn\'t bad per say, while not being that original, the cast works and there is enough diversity in the profiles, but there isn\'t time to properly establish relationships, to explain the characters\' backstories. It\'s problematic because the viewer can\'t feel ""involved"" with the cast, and as a result, the few drama scenes in the last episodes can\'t work at all because they come out of the blue. Moreover,  from what I\'ve read on other reviews, this season  covers a specific arc of the manga, and that\'s fine, it\'s common for most anime, especially shonen. The problem is that despite this rush feeling, after watching the last episode, there is legit not a single plot/question introduced at the beginning that is answered lmao.  / SPOILERS / The MC doesn\'t learn anything about the antagonist he wants to get revenge of, we still don\'t know much about shiro\'s past and her link with the MC, for some reason the subplot with the chief of security lady goes nowhere aswell, it\'s quite frustrating.In conclusion, I have very mixed feelings about Deadman Wonderland. On the one hand, the animation was entertaining to watch, the fights were really good and felt logical in their execution, but on the other hand, the word rushed isn\'t close enough to describe the story\'s pace, meaning that you won\'t have the time to care about what\'s happening after episode 5 or 6. The silver lining is that the story being what it is, in the end, it doesn\'t matter if you don\'t care about the events, because they aren\'t coherent in the first place. I still think that this anime can appeal to some viewers, but watch this without any expectation storywise, or you\'ll be disappointed. warnings beforehand, but be careful, read at your own risks.I can think of two main things that the anime does well, and they are linked : the fighting scenes and the animation in general.

I listened to it for months and so it wasn't for “One Reason” as a song, I wouldn’t have even checked this anime out. That’s why I give the music a 10/10.This anime started of good, but it just felt really rushed and incomplete towards the end. I’d like to have seen more of the lifestyle in Deadman Wonderland, like more minigames, more conversations and just to take a bit more time in the...story.The whole cast points for food just felt like it should’ve been used a lot more as a struggle since one of the guards saying there’s no free food here, but nobody seems to have a problem with it which is why the restriction felt insignificant. I also thought the candy thing would come up more since it’s essential for survival, but it was only a concern at the very last episode from when it was first introduced.I would've like to see more battles and more survival games, but there was literally one game and 2 of those TV fights. I can see why since it could be a lot for 12 episodes to cram it all in, but a few more wouldn't've hurt, and that’s why I think it should be a lot longer.I think this anime should’ve been 30 episodes or at least 24 (doubling what they used, in other words another season). There were just so many things that ended quickly and didn’t end up getting the real story time and development it deserved. I thought You would be a crucial supporting character, and he was in the first half, but he got killed/ disappeared around episode 7 and that was just it. He got stopped by a villain and that was the last I saw of him. This anime was like how much detail you would sit down and tell your friends about, forgetting some parts or skipping over them here and there, but this the legitimate whole anime and that’s why I can’t say it’s one of the best I’ve seen. Another way to put it is like in an English exam and you have to cram in your story so you some up with quick solutions for the sake of finishing it, and just turn it in at the end with an ending that feels incomplete or one that was not as good as you originally planned. Where you think to yourself “If only I had more time this would’ve been so much better”, that’s what this anime is.//Overall, it has the tools to be a 10 and it’s a shame it couldn’t capitalize fully on the execution. I’ve heard the manga was a lot more detailed and complete, and when I watched a summary video on how the story continues and ends in the manga, I felt a lot more satisfied with this series, if only they copied and pasted it onto the anime, this would get a higher score. Although it sounded like a gave a lot of criticism, these are the just reasons I wouldn’t give this a 10/10 because like I said, it had the tools. Based on everything I said, I give this anime a 6/10! story.The whole cast points for food just felt like it should’ve been used a lot more as a struggle since one of the guards saying there’s no free food here, but nobody seems to have a problem with it which is why the restriction felt insignificant.

It has a great vibe, the music is great, the characters are interesting, you can feel your heart start racing quite a few times, and a consistent plot is given.The only problem with the show is that there were not more seasons made of it and the producers seemed to have known this themselves.  There are many plot holes left open and even some where you see one single clip of something else that you can guess is covered deeper in the manga but just is not in the show.  The end of the show is abrupt and...you can feel it being played that way.  Just that and the unopened plots presented is what makes this Anime drop, because it is otherwise a wonderful show with great humor, horror, visuals, and more.If anything I would say that the Anime is a great pathway to the manga.

Spoiler alert: it didn't quite live up to my expectations for it, but thankfully, I didn't hate it.I feel like there was a lot built into this story that made it worthwhile. The concept and initial plot line were very interesting. The way it presented itself in tone and story hooked me in the beginning. I was expecting a lot from it just based on the first episode. In addition to that, Shiro (one of the main characters) captivated me from the first moment she...was introduced into the story. Actually, she was my favorite character throughout this whole anime, though there were others that I liked a bit as well. The way it was able to deliver in the horror and gore aspects was inconsistent, but when it did it well, it did it really well. I found the sound to be pretty basic, but the art style was quite nice.Beyond these things, though, I do have some pretty annoying gripes with Deadman Wonderland. I mentioned the tone being inconsistent, but really, the entire thing was. The expectations I built up from the first episode or two weren't pursued in the plot much at all. I don't know if that's because it's meant to be addressed in the story that takes place after the anime ends, but wherever the plot made me think it was gonna go, it didn't. Actually, the first initial shift away from the beginning couple of episodes made me even more interested in the plot as I thought the new material would tie into the original material nicely. However, that stuff got shoved to the side for a weird subplot-turned-main-plot that didn't really need to happen. That caused me to not really care about the new characters coming in, and really, not care about the plot at all. When it finally wrapped back around to the first bit of story at the end of the series, the anime was over. So, all in all, a lot could've been done better.It sucks because it has a lot of good things going for it. If it would've stuck to those things and made a fleshed out story from it instead of going off the rails for a plot line that didn't seem to matter much in the end, I would've liked it a lot better. Or, at least, if it had taken the time to nurture that storyline all the way back at the beginning with hints here and there that it was gonna occur, it would've been easier to digest. Not to mention the antagonist jumped around over and over again, and to be honest, I'm still not sure who the main bad guy is supposed to be.The beginning really did have a lot going for it, and if it'd capitalized on it properly, this would've gotten a better score from me. However, the amazing things it did have were pretty damn amazing, so it was fun to witness those things with certain characters for the duration it was available.

It is also about surviving prison by participating in deadly activities for the guests to enjoy. It is also about a couple more things but that will spoil a bit too much.Story: 6 - The text above is just to prove a point, the story does not feel cohesive at all. To...me it feels like 2 arcs that both need 12 episodes (or the second one maybe even more episodes) smashed into the 12 episodes it got.Because of this everything feels so rushed and the glue needed to make it one great story is just removed to make place for what I called the second arc.This doesn\'t mean the story is bad. Every story presented was interesting to me, but the anime just moved on way to fast and I liked to see more of those parts but also to see why the previous episodes (or at least parts of it) were important to the current episode.Art: 7 - For what it is trying to be it really works, just nothing more.Sound: 8 - The intro and outro are both forgettable, but the rest of the sounds are great. Every fight is 10 times more interesting thanks to the background music and the characters are all made really enjoyable thanks to the voice actors.Characters: 6 - The characters suffer the same fate as the story does, because there is very little time there is almost no time for any character development.I still like the main characters and they have some development. Most of the side characters are also good, but some of them are just introduced to us and then they tried to give them an emotional goodbye.This made the characters overall just okay, nothing special but also not unlikeable.Enjoyment: 7 - I personally like the anime, it isn\'t the best anime ever but I do not regret watching any minute of it.Overall: 7 (6,8) -  An enjoyable anime that could have been so much more.You most likely find enjoyment in this anime, but it will not be your favorite. me it feels like 2 arcs that both need 12 episodes (or the second one maybe even more episodes) smashed into the 12 episodes it got.Because of this everything feels so rushed and the glue needed to make it one great story is just removed to make place for what I called the second arc.This doesn\'t mean the story is bad.

He was accused for kill his entire school class but a guy named “Red Man” was responsible for the mass murder and instilled a red crystal into Ganta’s chest allowing him to manipulate his blood  and use it as a weapon. Capital punishment in this wold is a prison called Deaman Wonderland, an amusement park where convicts are forced to play deadly games as pure amusement for the rest of the rest of the world. After arriving at Deadman Wonderland Ganta figures out he has...a new ability and and that he is not the only one. As the story goes on Ganta meets new friends and figures out who his foes are along with trying to figure out his new abilitiy and the abilities of others.Review:I really did enjoy Deadman Wonderland but it was just too short. The story was interesting and the abilities were unique and I felt like it had a lot more potential. Just as Ganta starts to improve his abilitie’s skill and grow as a character the season is over. It was just getting good before it ended. It did wrap up fairly well but there were still a lot of unanswered questions and characters you’d like to have seen more of. It definitely left the ending open enough to set up for another season. I loved the opening and it’s music. The animation was different but I liked it quite a bit.

I was captivated, enthralled, and disgusted all at the same time. Aside from the excessive amount of gore, which I say fits the setting and story perfectly, The show had me at the edge of my seat wanting more and more to be revealed. sadly no second season came out and will most likely never which kinda makes it more appealing in the sense that it's up to the audience (who haven't read the manga) to make their own guesses and opinions about what might happen and be revealed. Overall amazing would recommend to anyone with...the stomach to handle it! the stomach to handle it!"", ""Ganta is wrongfully accused of murdering his whole class, and as a result of his conviction, is put into the hands of the privately-owned prison Deadman Wonderland, where lethal collars are put on all inmates which are only maintained by winning in the prison's deathly games where civilian spectators boo and cheer. Ganta's world goes from boring to worse-than-hell in such a quick span of episodes that its remarkable that any sanity is left when the plot really gets moving. His determination and sheer willpower would rival Eren from Attack on Titan.Though attempting to jump the shark more times than it probably should, Deadman Wonderland...manages to make such efforts rewarding and tense; building on flawed characters and fantastic pacing and atmosphere.

The characters all have baggage that is relatable, though sometimes it comes off as cliche and stilted, especially the motivations of a few of the antagonists.

It has a lot of elements that make It interesting like its world and its characters. The aesthetic of the show is also very nice. The problem is that the elements that make it good could've been a lot better. This show had a lot of potential in all its aspects and none of them reach their full potential. Some people say you should read the manga instead because it has a better ending and it's laid out better. I don't think it's an anime that you need to watch but at the same time, it's not something...that you should avoid watching. It's just there lol. That's why my rating is 5/10. It's not bad but not good either. Could've been better and again, the strong points are there. Mainly, the aesthetic, the characters, and the world.

It\'s that kind of story that has absolutely nothing to contribute, of which nothing can be highlighted because nothing stands out, of those that while you see it you notice a constant déjà vu regarding what you are seeing. No surprise capacity, no emotion capacity. At least we have to admit that it is moderately entertaining (and being short does not make its mediocrity so heavy), but that does not take away that in a couple of days, being generous, it going to fall into the...trunk of forgetfulness without remission.In the beginning it starts from an interesting idea such as a prison turned into a public show, in this case an amusement park. A concept that, although not entirely original, is attractive due to the moral dilemmas it entails. It is also a scenario that offers a lot of possibilities in terms of the different characters (prisoners), each with their own different histories and ways of seeing life (and death).The problem is that development happens very poorly. There is no sign of moral conflict whatsoever that the lives of human beings are being used as a spectacle, nothing, nobody at any time is asking or commenting on this subject, albeit in passing. Instead, what we have is the typical story of surpassing, comradeship and adding deaths and artificial romances with no capacity to affect or motivate.And yes, perhaps one can say that the battles are visually spectacular (especially for lovers of helmet and blood, which is not my case), but  personally I am tired of animes with constantly fightings and powerful techniques. The only thing that produces me is boredom and even more so in one with such great potential to do something different as ""Deadman Wonderland"". They don\'t even take advantage of the ""human amusement park"" concept to create different ingenious tests. At best in a single chapter, and only here. I guess the idea of fighting seemed much more novel to them.As for the characters, the situation does not get much better, although perhaps this can be excused because there are only twelve episodes to develop them. It\'s a pity because the theme of showing the pasts of the different characters would have given a lot of possibilities and is left alone on the surface without getting too deep. What he does not have any forgiveness is to present a protagonist as archetypal as Ganta: the typical ""loser"" who is weak but who keeps a great potential inside and brings him out with the help of his friends. Don\'t fuck, reading that description you wouldn\'t know if I was talking about the protagonist of ""Deadman Wonderland"" or about Naruto, Eren Jaeger or any of the dozens of protagonists who would fit into it because they are authentic clones with different wrappers.I did want to mention the musical section, which I think is perfectly integrated with aesthetics. Metallic melodies, strong, powerful, what one can expect from a violent and cruel environment (unless you have so much talent as to merge opposing concepts and you make this fits perfectly, as in ""Madoka Magica"", but that\'s another story). The opening is very good, according to this mentioned darkness, both in aesthetics and music, although I recognize that the lyrics seem too simplistic. The ending as usual breaks completely with the general style and goes towards a pop style, but it also does its job well.Finally, as is the case in many short anime and as I have already mentioned, the fact that it has 12 episodes is a problem in terms of story and character development. It would be nice if only be this, but the real ""Deadman Wonderland"" shit is that it doesn\'t end, no more, there\'s no end. And that is a huge point against it. It seems perfect to me that the manga does have an end and even that for this reason is much better (I don\'t doubt it), but as far as I know this is the section of the adaptation to anime, just as the manga also has its own. Therefore qualification must be individual, since each product has its own characteristics. The one of justifying the mistakes of this anime with ""it is necessary to read the manga"" shouldn\'t be buy anyway.- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)Sinceramente, después de terminar de ver ""Deadman Wonderland"" la primera opinión que alcanzo a sintentizar es ésta: meh. Es ése tipo de historia que no tiene absolutamente nada que aportar, de la que no se puede destacar nada porque nada destaca, de ésas que mientras la ves notas un deja vú constante respecto a lo que estás viendo. Sin capacidad de sorpresa, sin capacidad de emoción. Al menos hay que reconocer que resulta medianamente entretenida (y al ser corta no se hace tan pesada su mediocridad), pero eso no quita que en un par de días, siendo generoso, sea carne de caer en el baúl del olvido sin remisión.En un principio parte de una idea interesante como es la de una cárcel convertida en espectáculo público, en este caso un parque de atracciones. Un concepto que aunque no es que sea original completamente, sí que resulta atractivo debido a los dilemas morales que conlleva. También es un escenario que ofrece muchísimo juego en cuanto a los diferentes personajes (presos), cada uno con sus diferentes historias y formas de ver la vida (y la muerte).El problema es que el desarrollo en realidad se hace de forma muy deficiente. No hay ni rastro de conflicto moral alguno al respecto de que las vidas de seres humanos se usen como espectáculo, nada, nadie en ningún momento se pregunta o comenta sobre este tema, aunque sea de pasada. En su lugar lo que tenemos es la típica historia en la que se habla de superación, de camaradería y en la que añadir muertes y romances artificiales con una capacidad nula de conmover.Y sí, quizá se pueda decir que las batallas son espectaculares visualmente (sobre todo para los amantes de la casquería y la sangre, que no es mi caso), pero yo personalmente ya estoy cansado de animes de combates por doquier y técnicas poderosas. Lo único que me producen es hastío y con más razón en uno con un potencial tan grande para hacer algo distinto como es ""Deadman Wonderland"". Es que ni siquiera se aprovechan del concepto ""parque de atracciones humano"" para crear diferentes pruebas ingeniosas. Como mucho en un capítulo suelto y ya, supongo que la idea de los combates les pareció mucho más novedosa.En cuanto a los personajes la cosa no mejora demasiado, aunque quizá esto se pueda excusar en que solo hay doce capítulos para desarrollarlos. Una pena porque el tema de mostrar los pasados de los diferentes personajes habría dado muchísimo juego y se queda solo en la superficie sin llegar a profundizar demasiado. Lo que sí que no tiene perdón alguno es presentar a un protagonista tan arquetípico como Ganta: el típico ""pringao"" que es débil pero que guarda un gran potencial en su interior y que lo saca adelante con ayuda de sus amigos. No me jodas, leyendo esa descripción no sabrías si estoy hablando del protagonista de ""Deadman Wonderland"", de Naruto, de Eren Jaeger o de cualquiera de las decenas de protagonistas que encajarían en ella porque son auténticos clones con diferente envoltorio.Sí quería hacer mención al apartado musical, que creo que está perfectamente integrado con la estética. Melodías metaleras, fuertes, potentes, lo que uno puede esperar de un entorno violento y cruel (a no ser que tengas tanto talento como para unir conceptos opuestos y que te quede perfecto, como en ""Madoka Magica"", pero eso es otra historia). El opening es muy bueno, acorde a esta mencionada oscuridad, tanto en estética como en música, aunque reconozco que la letra me parece demasiado simple. El ending como suele ser habitual rompe completamente con esto y se va hacia un estilo pop, pero también cumple bien su labor.Por último, como ocurre en muchos animes cortos y como ya he comentado antes, el que tenga 12 capítulos supone algún que otro problema en cuanto a desarrollo de historia y personajes. Estaría bien si se quedara solo en eso, pero la verdadera jodienda de ""Deadman Wonderland"" es que no termina, sin más, no hay final. Y eso sí es un punto enorme en contra. Me parece perfecto que el manga sí que tenga final e incluso que por esta razón sea mucho mejor (no lo dudo), pero hasta donde yo sé esto es la ficha de la adaptación al anime, al igual que el manga también tiene la suya propia.

Only reason I gave it a 9 was because it ended verrrry abruptly. It makes me sad... it definitely could have and should have had 12 more episodes. The story had so much potential. Though I heard that their funding was cut, so it can't be helped. With that being said, I don't think there was a single moment where I was bored! Probably one of the main reasons why I loved this show.I would still give it a 10 anyway, but it wouldn't be fair to anyone reading my...review. : P (Also, time to read the manga?)Characters - Loved them! Ganta was our resilient little protagonist, Shiro was a cutie, and the supporting characters all had great, varied personalities. You're bound to find someone you like in this show! Personally, I really liked most of them! Somehow I grew attached to them in those 12 episodes, even half that for some of them. Their back stories really were touching though.Story - Now, the reason why people wouldn't like this... perhaps the lack of story progression? It definitely skimmed over a lot of things, but as I mentioned earlier, the funding was cut, so it can't be helped. Personally, I loved the action, and the character's and their back stories. It was actually quite touching! Heck, it's pretty much what makes the anime.In conclusion, I think, it's best to not go in with any expectations. I went into this thinking it'd probably heavily rely on fight scenes/action, and while that played a big part in it, the characters themselves did too! Definitely the main two reasons why I loved the show. That, and it was different. The concept itself was unique, and it was pretty engrossing to see it unfold.So... all in all, I just loved it. If the plot interests you at all, please, watch it! You won't regret it! review. : P (Also, time to read the manga?)Characters - Loved them!

I hope someone in the future does pick it up although unlikely given it is now 2020.The show has only one real annoyance and that is the main character Ganta being a whiny little brat. Crying does not save you and then he gets angry whilst crying that Shiro protects him. Problem with this is yes he is young, Shiro is too and she has been through worse. Shiro also grew up with him...and he was there crying in fights whilst she was being experimented on. The female undertaker Hibana was tortured as a child and is still a child and Minatsuki was abandoned by her mother yet Ganta is such a pathetic character. Ganta is a difficult character to like at all and him not realising at the end who the red man is was just astonishing.

She even with her personality being split is cute on both sides. Her happy clumsy side is adorable. Her evil and sadistic side is equally pretty cute.

The best is the ending song which is spectacular for the show and totally unexpected after the first episode to have such a reflective song in this chaotic show.The show is great and enjoyable. Shiro is the best of all the characters and makes it a fun ride. I do wish she got more of her Wretched Egg side shown though.Overall it is a good 9 for me. Just wish it was continued to the end. I guess that is what the Manga is for. and he was there crying in fights whilst she was being experimented on. The female undertaker Hibana was tortured as a child and is still a child and Minatsuki was abandoned by her mother yet Ganta is such a pathetic character. Ganta is a difficult character to like at all and him not realising at the end who the red man is was just astonishing.

As much as I hate to admit it, previous statement is in 100% accurate. DW started with an awesome episode to be honest but as much as the story progressed, it became rushed and rushed until the end.What I like about it:+Great story - People that have commited diffrent crimes go to the biggest prison in the country where they must learn and fight to survive.+Simple cash system that actually works+ This anime is enjoyable.+Characters have goals and unique characters+ Normal non OP character - That is something...that seems to be lacking in other animes. Main characters often gets beaten in DW and learns from his mistakes, he wants to overcome his weaknesessThings I did not like :- Some concepts doesn\'t make sense like why don\'t they cut their collars ?- Rushed- Well the writers kind of forgot about some characters.- As there is no continuation, this  one has VERY bittersweet ending that seems to be lacking in other animes.

It's dark, gritty, has a few twists and turns, and includes characters with superpowers. I heard people talk about it in the past and when I heard it was going to be airing on the newly revived Toonami block on Adult Swim I was interested. On with the review!Story: 7The story revolves around a kid who is accused of a crime he didn't commit and is forced to survive in a theme park called Deadman Wonderland. It starts off simple enough, something that can be easy to get into if you like...the type of shows in the action, horror genre. This show is very dark as well with lots of violence and gore to fit the overall tone of the show, depending on who you are and what kind of shows you can watch you will either love it or hate it.Art: 8The animation is solid with lots of gritty detail and a dark atmosphere that fits well with the show and its setting. It also looks amazing during the action scenes, which is a big plus.Sound: 8The music is very good with a lot of tracks that fit particular scenes over the course of the show, and I do have to give props for the opening as it's a good way to get you into the show, and if I ever decided to make a list of favorite anime openings, this would be one of them. As I stated before I saw the show on Toonami and am only able to critique its English dub. It's a solid dub with all of the actors giving a good performance to the characters.Character: 7With any action survival show the characters are going to be the main focus, hopefully, and this is no exception. What's interesting though is that most of the characters that do have superpowers are able to draw out their blood from their body and form a weapon to fight, which is a new and creative way to give powers to a character. The main characters and some of the supporting cast serve their roles appropriately, but there were only a handful they could focus on and even give a back-story to within this 12 episode series while the rest don't get much screen time and are easily forgotten. The main protagonist annoys me because he never stops whining about his problems. I can understand him being upset because of the situation he's been put in, but he almost never gets over it.Enjoyment: 6I really wanted to like this series, but with all of its problems I can't, which is a shame because it has a lot of good points in it. While I am glad I saw it, I'm not sure if I would see it again. the lack of a good conclusion, a whiny main protagonist, and the amount of gore and violence really keeps me away from loving it. While the violence serves the series well considering the subject matter, it's not something that's going to please everyone.Overall: 6This show isn't bad by any stretch of the word, but it could've been better. If the show had an additional 12 episodes, then it probably would be better from a storytelling standpoint and an enjoyment standpoint. However it is worth seeing at least once. Since it stopped airing on Toonami after its running time ended, you can watch it on Funimation, or Hulu.

The promoter (the owner of the park) keeps a lot of secrets all the way throughout the series, and keeps some prisoners like pet birds.As long as all of the inmates have the collars on they will always be threatened by death as one of the main attractions at Deadman Wonderland is what they call the dog race, this is just like an obstacle course but the bad thing is depending on the promoters mood a certain amount of people will die, when the main characters Ganta and Shiro enter the race it\'s set on the highest level so nearly every single person who takes place in the race dies, on each obstacle in the race there\'s another way to die and as it\'s the most popular event at Deadman Wonderland thousands of people go to watch just one event of the dog race and they all get to see the players die.Thing is though they all think that it\'s all special effects and most of them enjoy it whilst some others think it\'s disguisting and real, even one man says to a friend that ""who cares if they do die, there all criminals."" No one really cares but the inmates need to do this to survive so every day they risk their lives and sometimes their ended. The inmates have to take part to gain Cast points...Cast Points/Cast Cards: Every inmate has to have one, whenever you take part in a event in Deadman Wonderland you gain Cast Points they can be used for buying food, cigarettes, drinks you name it and everyone needs them to buy Candy....If you can\'t afford the Candy then you can kiss you life good bye...Candy: In Deadman Wonderland everyone has a collar, and these collars can obviously be used for all sorts of things....One of the worst features is the fact that when you put them on they automatically start to pump Poison around your body...The Poison only takes three days to kill you and on the third day you have to take the Candy if you don\'t then you\'ll obviously die....What the Candy does is break down the poison so it can be disposed off through your bodies organs..If you don\'t take the Candy You\'ll feel the effects of the poison and you\'ll slowly die......(What a lovely way to threaten inmates).Ganta: At the beginning of the short series we see Ganta as a 14 year old high school student in a class happily talking to his friends about their next field trip. In the next episode we see him in Deadman Wonderland, He becomes a prison inmate and is on death row....He learns most of the things that he needs to know to survive off of the other inmates. In this short series Ganta is seen as weak and spineless, he can\'t fight or stand up for himself very well so he stands there and takes the criticism he gets from the other inmates. He doesn\'t really learn how to stick up for himself in the series, and to say he\'s a main character you would of though he would of been stronger as a person and a Deadman, Near the end he seems a bit stronger but he hides it quite a bit.Shiro: She helps Ganta out quite a lot in the series and knows him from when she was younger but he doesn\'t remember her....She doesn\'t seem to bothered about it though and doesn\'t really pay attention to what Ganta says and keeps on reminding him that he can\'t o everything himself. Shes always seen wearing this weird white all in one suit, shes quite mysterious and pops up when you least expect it. All in all shes a lovely character and loves everyone!! Her mysterious background and sometimes quietness makes people feel a bit uncomfortable around her.All together the series is amazing and i wish there was a second series. There where some really gross bits with all of the blood and gore, but if you get past all of that then the story line is amazing and sometimes a little bit confusing....If you don\'t know what i mean then pay more attention to those little side stories with the other characters. I really do wish there was a second series as all of the inmates could escape and tell the world about the true intentions of the Promoter and other staff that work together to make every ones life a living hell.This really is an amazing Anime but it\'s a shame i haven\'t gotten round to reading the Mange series yet. There is a lot of violence, Blood and Foul Language but the graphics are alright and the fighting scenes are quite detailed to some extent.

I'm not going to break down this one, as not having finished the anime would make it improper to do such a thing.I thought that, for the first 2 chapters, this show was fine, it was dramatic, strong and straightforward (for the most part). Now, as I went on through the next chapters one thing really made me very anxious, and that was: The MC's absolute punyness. It became unbearable at some point to have to watch Ganta cry like a da*n baby every single chapter, literally, up to where I decided to drop it (Chap 5) there wasn't...a single chapter where he didn't cry, and in most he did it more than once. That said, I really, really HATE, feamale seiyuus doing male voices. To be honest I didn't even check the seiyuu's cast in the first place, but after hearing Ganta shout like a baby so frustratingly often, I realised and checked, and yep, it was Yuki Kaji doing the girly shouts. To add up to this, Shiro played the most annoying kind of cliché possible: The stupid careless girl. I really don't get how there can be anyone out there who cares for this kind of character, but one thing is sure I don't. It really annoys me to have a stubborn topped with mindless character, no matter how breasty (o.O)Anyway, those are my reasons for dropping this anime. A little advice: If you want to see a pathetic character, go watch Watamote and have a nice laugh, instead of just hating the MC the minute he opens up his mouth.Thanks!!!Overall: 6 a single chapter where he didn't cry, and in most he did it more than once.

It\'s violent, bloody, has a really metal soundtrack, and even has a reference to one of my favorite bands, Cannibal Corpse.  This had all the makings of a 10/10 for me ... until I watched it.The story is pretty generic. Teenager (of course) gets thrown in a deadly situation, sucks and gets his ass kicked, BELIEVES IT, and then gets stronger. The world it creates is pretty interesting, if you forget about the prison being an amusement park where prisoners are murdered for entertainment, and it has some decent character building....It\'s so stupid though. The whole ""torturing prisoners"" thing could have been turned into a pretty decent exploration of ethics and humane treatment, but it was a fucking amusement park. It was just a little too silly for me. The plot gets a little convoluted later on and then shits the bed in the last few episodes with an incredibly unsatisfying ending.The art is pretty generic but is at least fairly well animated. As I said before, the soundtrack is really kick-ass. I need more anime in my life with death metal soundtracks. The very Cannibal Corpse-esque music playing during the Carnival Corpse absolutely made my day. The OP is decent and with the exception of the ED all the other music used is really kick-ass.The characters were shit. All of them. Except maybe Crow. He was pretty baller. Ganta was definitely the shittiest character in the entire show, which is unfortunate because he\'s the main character. He\'s a whiny, useless, dipshit. It\'s like if Shinji from NGE and Simon from the first few episodes of TTGL, were combined to form the ultimate waste of space. All of the other characters are either painfully edgy or painfully stupid, or both.I enjoyed the fuck out of this, until the last few episodes. It was stupid and edgy, so I had a laugh at its expense, and it was fucking brutal. Then the story started getting even more stupid and the last couple of episodes, on top of being a clusterfuck, answered nothing and left me entirely unsatisfied. I finished the last episode and felt that it had not been worth it to watch that entire show just for it to end that way. It\'s almost like it expected a second season so it left all the loose ends to be tied up later.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Hellsing Ultimate, Mirai Nikki, or Tokyo Ghoul ... as long as you drop it before the last couple of episodes.Overall 4 branches of sin out of 10 It\'s so stupid though.

After years of being on my 'plan-to-watch-list' I finally watched Deadman Wonderland. I guess I need to mention that I finished all 12 episodes at once and right after finishing this review, I'll read the manga too. So, without any further ado, let's get to the review. Enjoy!PLOT AND STORY LINE 📜Deadman Wonderlan is a 2011 anime based on a manga with the same title. Just as I did in the beginning, you...would think that a 12-episode-long anime cannot have a good story line. That is mostly correct, because a story just hardly develops  within just 12 episodes. Still I was really surprised to see that Deadman Wonderland is an exception. Now, the anime does not have an extremely good story with a proper moral but one thing is for sure. Deadman Wonderland is entertainment pure.The story follows Igarashi Ganta-an ordinary 14-year-old boy whose life turns upside down when a mysterious man in red massacres his whole class including his best friends Mimi and Yamakatsu. Just after waking up in hospital, being the lone survivor, Ganta gets accused of murdering the hiss whole class.  Charged guilty and sentenced to death, Ganta is taken to the only private prison in Japan-Deadman Wonderland. The special thing about this 'Wonderland' is that it's a prison amusement park where the convicts perform dangerous acts in order to amuse the visitors.And so begins the story of Igarashi Ganta. A boy who is wrongly accused now fights for his life in dangerous prison games, for his pride following only his own rules and his name, that will be cleared once he finds the Red Man. I don't want to reveal much of the story, but be prepared for some amazing powers and epic fights throughout the whole show.Action is definitely the best thing about this anime but it also has something else. I cannot clearly say what it is but it was definitely the reason that made me watch the whole thing in one day.  The story is thrilling, exciting and unpredictable. All that with a couple of plot twists that made the anime even more entertaining.And just as I said in the beginning, if you look for a great story you wont find it here. Don't get me wrong. The story is good and really moving from time to time but it doesn't have a great moral. Still, you'll definitely find an extremely intriguing story with no major plot holes  and a high level of entertainment. I sad no major plot holes, because there were some tiny parts of the story that I'd like to know more about but were left out. Still, Deadman Wonderland's story continues in the manga and maybe it would be revealed in another season but I don't think a second season will ever come. I mean, it's been six years since the first season aired so...😞CHARACTERS 👩👦For a really short anime like this, the characters are really well developed. There are so many different and unique characters with a lot background stories. Seriously, I have no idea how they managed to put all that in only 12 episodes.When it comes to the main character, Ganta, he undergoes a huge character development. And despite being weak and pathetic in some parts, he actually manages to find himself and become stronger. He decides not to be ruled by others and makes his own path following his own rules. He is a stubborn boy, with a lot determination and hope.The female lead, Shiro, is a mysterious albino girl that Ganta met on his first day in prison. Even though she is the same age as Ganta, she behaves as a child but has enormous physical strength and great combat skills. With only a skin-tight bodysuit on, Shiro stands out among the other prisoners due to her bizarre appearance and mannerisms.  But despite her innocent looks, Shiro has a big secret regarding her background but as always...NO spoilers! 😉ANIMATION AND STYLE 💻✨And again, the animation becomes my favorite part of an anime. Manglobe studios and Kodakawa Shouten did an incredible job when it comes to animation and style. It was flawless, just as any other animation should be. I would really like to talk more about it but I seriously don't know what to say since it was...well, perfect.CONCLUSION 👆❌👇If you have some free time and just want to watch a relaxing yet thrilling anime with a huge entertainment factor then Deadman Wonderland is an anime for you. A great anime that managed to deliver a good and entertaining story, great character development and amazing animation in only 12 episodes. This anime is high on my recommendation list for every action, horror, Sci-Fi lover and now if you'd excuse me, I have a manga to read. would think that a 12-episode-long anime cannot have a good story line. That is mostly correct, because a story just hardly develops  within just 12 episodes. Still I was really surprised to see that Deadman Wonderland is an exception.

But despite her innocent looks, Shiro has a big secret regarding her background but as always...NO spoilers! 😉ANIMATION AND STYLE 💻✨And again, the animation becomes my favorite part of an anime. Manglobe studios and Kodakawa Shouten did an incredible job when it comes to animation and style. It was flawless, just as any other animation should be. I would really like to talk more about it but I seriously don't know what to say since it was...well, perfect.CONCLUSION 👆❌👇If you have some free time and just want to watch a relaxing yet thrilling anime with a huge entertainment factor then Deadman Wonderland is an anime for you. A great anime that managed to deliver a good and entertaining story, great character development and amazing animation in only 12 episodes. This anime is high on my recommendation list for every action, horror, Sci-Fi lover and now if you'd excuse me, I have a manga to read."", 'I was really disappointed. When I began the first few episodes, it didn\'t seem all too bad. The story was alright, but I figured it would get better. Well, it didn\'t.They crammed so much into all the episodes and spent like 4 out of the 12 episodes focusing on the undertakers, which... I didn\'t really see the point of. I think they could\'ve summed the whole undertaker plot into at MOST 2 episodes. It really didn\'t need to be dragged out that much. The Red Man was more of an issue than the undertakers, in my opinion.Also I really hate Ganta. This little...kid who kinda sucks at fighting ""masters"" the whole blood thing in less than 5 minutes. Ok.I think the ending was the worst part.The ending was just.... stupid. They didn\'t resolve a thing at all.side note: I hate ganta so much kid who kinda sucks at fighting ""masters"" the whole blood thing in less than 5 minutes.

Great ideas and characters are thrown out there, but never built upon. This anime just screams ""incomplete"".I truly suspect that the studio was going for a longer run, but had to cut everything short after half of the episodes. The overall feeling you get is that they really had a good idea, that everything was planned to be something else. I find no other explanation.The overall score is too good for what I saw...but the awesome metal soundtrack (kinda ripping off Cannibal Corpse and Marilyn Manson, but...meh) and the satisfying Art and Character design saved it.Not much more can be said...no meaningful story in 12 episodes of sheer incomplete chaos.I\'d advise you to stay away from it\'s grip. meh) and the satisfying Art and Character design saved it.Not much more can be said...no meaningful story in 12 episodes of sheer incomplete chaos.I\'d advise you to stay away from it\'s grip.', 'Deadman Wonderland, great idea, poor execution.To properly review this anime, I need to review it in three parts. The first 6 episodes, the last 6 episodes and then the entire anime as a whole. Spoilers will be said, but minimized.The First Six:Ginta\'s classmates are completely destroyed by a man in red for seemingly no reason, and implants a red crystal into him. He gets blamed for the murders being the only survivor. As such, he is given a life sentence at a place called Deadman Wonderland which is a theme park staffed with criminals who also entertain guests to gain valuable candies that...work as a temporary antidote to the poison injected into their necks via a collar they are given.The prisoners are also able to purchase food, alcohol, cigarettes and other things in the form of points that they earn as well.However, there is a secret game as well, a tournament to either death or knockout by people with blood powers referred to as the Deadmen. They get money and candies for participation, but if they lose, they lose part of their body. The promoter promises Ginta that he can avenge his classmates if he makes it to the top of the tournament to challenge the dubbed ""Red Man.""This is the story for the first half which seems standard but also interesting as well. A prison/death tournament/revenge/magic weapon story. It was actually pretty good.The Characters were for the most part interesting, though everyone was generally rude or mean except for Ginta, Yoh and Shiro, but in a way that I found entertaining or at least made sense within context of the story. The three mentioned above function as the protagonists and are alright, though Shiro is too childlike but that\'s to be expected with anime. First half, easily 8 out of 10 with strong potential to have ended with a 9  or 10 out of 10.The Second Six:Boy is this where the story gets railroaded. So now it\'s a story about a bunch of Deadmen who hide in plain sight, don\'t take themselves too seriously, are planning a big prison break to complain to officials about the conditions there. Fighting them are a group of Anti-Deadmen, people whom have had notions of mercy and kindness removed from their brains and whose weapons can nullify the blood powers.So we\'re now introduced to a mostly dull cast of freedom fighters who the Anti-Deadmen know where they are and just mess with them every once in awhile. Ginta decides to get wrapped up in all this and the story focuses exclusively on these boring and moronic people. No more matches, no more critique of a privately owned prison complex, no more interesting characters. These people and the villains are entirely bland. The people introduced in the first six episodes are given brief cameos, with Yoh being dropped as a protagonist, Ginta flips between being brave, being a pussy, or being emotional. Shiro had an arc that began that really isn\'t explored. An arc begins with the warden but then is kind of dropped. A few other arcs or people are mentioned but never fully explored. This second half made me want to watch High School Of The Dead again. 3 out of 10.Overall:The series came out strong, has a fantastic opening, great premise and interesting enough characters for the first 6 episodes. I didn\'t like Shiro, but didn\'t dislike her either but liked everyone else. Once it was set up, I thought it was going to play out to be an action anime that was perhaps critical of the prison system, or just a fun anime setting that was kind of unique. However it dropped that ball rapidly when episode 7 began and this freedom fighter group thing began. There was absolutely no reason to shift gears from excellent set up to generic garbage that a high school writing class teacher would give a C- to with the comments ""fantastic premise, needed a lot more effort.""So why am I giving it a 6 instead of 5 or lower? Because if you stop watching at episode 6, then fanfic your own ending, the series would easily be an 8 out of 10. I don\'t think the series\'s early creativity, story and characters should be penalized for a lazily written and generic second half. It\'s still a worthy watch up until episode 6, and should be watched by everyone.

I did not hate this series as much as it shows on the overall rating I gave it. Here's the problem:I did not enjoy my time, I was confused with every passing second, and I thought there should be more to it. More than that, the ending left such a bitter taste in my mouth, that I would rather have dropped it before the ending, just to spare this of such a low score (maybe then I'd have put a better score, who knows). And no, you do not get a pass for having great manga,...honestly this adaptatioin makes me not want to read the manga.Simply put, don't watch it.

The story is ridiculous but they camp it in serious tones and don't let the humor show through at any point....The main character is a lil shit who only gets worse halfway through, sniveling and crying while taken along for the ride.

But in the short running time of 12 episodes it doesn't explain or end anything so you have to wait for another season that may never come out, or you know, read the manga. (4/10)+ Really well done work on animation by Manglobe. The show looks colorful, yet dark enough to fit the atmosphere, everything looks...fluid, especially the branch of sin, with minimum CGI used. Despite that I have some minor complaints, there are some gore moments that look too cartoonish and it could use some more action scenes. (8/10)+ I have to praise overall sound design, a lot of great ambient and background tracks, and a lot of detail is given to the environmental sounds. The seiyuu-s are well chosen and their performance is good enough. The OP is decent at best and the ED is a bit underwhelming. (4/5)- There is a bunch of interesting characters and while some of them get some backstory, there is still a lot left out. And on the other hand, some minor chars get some explanation behind them that is totally unnecessary with the tiny amount of screen-time they got. They tried to add some development to main few ones, but it feels awkward and very forced in; this really should be at least 25 part series.

She’s a surprising big fan of dubs, so I was like “okay let’s see this train-wreck”, but I was pleasantly surprised that the dub was great.This show is filled with swearing, of the kind I’ve never heard before on an anime, and I was super shook and amazed, AND I WISH MORE ANIME GOT THIS KIND OF TREATMENT BECAUSE WOW. Tho tbh, MC’s voice was kinda…not that...good at first, but it grew on me.This does end in a “to continue”/we haven’t finished the story kind of ting, but I was told it’s cause the studio went bankrupt, so can’t be helped :V I do wish they’d outsource it to another studio, but the manga is already over OTLThe anime had wonderfully vicious scenes of skin melting, and chunks of meat getting ripped, AND IT WASN’T CENSORED, IT WAS AMAZING. Plus the character design was great, and I liked how some characters weren’t what they looked like. Especially being foul motherfuckers once the penny dropped and they turned vicious~This was really engaging, fast-paced and never bored me, so if this sounds like the type of show you enjoy, GET ON IT, YOU WON’T GET DISAPPOINTED. I recommended watching the dub because it’s not censored, at all, so it’s always great to see it! good at first, but it grew on me.This does end in a “to continue”/we haven’t finished the story kind of ting, but I was told it’s cause the studio went bankrupt, so can’t be helped :V I do wish they’d outsource it to another studio, but the manga is already over OTLThe anime had wonderfully vicious scenes of skin melting, and chunks of meat getting ripped, AND IT WASN’T CENSORED, IT WAS AMAZING.

That\'s honestly a major reason for this review, because this is actually fresh off of a decent amount of people watching it, and I\'m not good at catching current anime episodes in Japan. And also because this is a very interesting anime, for me at least.Now, the story is a very cool idea. Deadman Wonderland is just a very clever and terribly dark prison where absurd games are the only way to get money to stay alive or eat etc. Lots of possibilities for creativity just from that and...it\'s very mature and dark and shocking. And they quickly go into typical shonen territory. Filled with one on one fights between people stronger than any human and have bizarre attacks and also a rebellion and a forgotten past. ...ok.The characters are pretty good. The main characters, Ganta and Shiro, can be annoying but usually work decently for what they are. Ganta being the kid who constantly suffers through crap no kid should go through and wants to be stronger because of it and his seemingly dumb possible love interest character who is actually uncontrollably strong and dangerous at times. Most of the other characters are either weird or don\'t have nearly as much of a fleshed out personality.The art is just fine. It works, it\'s decent enough. Animation\'s pretty good. I can\'t praise it a lot but often all I ask is competence for anime on tv. Music\'s also pretty decent, can range from dramatic to being a lot more fitting for the dark setting. It isn\'t too memorable for the most part but it works well enough.Now, you might be thinking, this sounds like an anime that\'s ok at best, below average or bad at worst. So why an 8? Well first of all, it\'s an arbitrary number, who cares? But second of all, I still enjoyed it quite a bit, maybe more than I should have. There\'s 4 main reasons I\'ve thought of.1. First impressions. It has one of the best first episodes I\'ve seen in a series. It immediately grabs your attention, shocks you and gives you no choice but to be interested in where it\'s going. It\'s what any first episode should do, make you want to continue watching. Even if you are annoyed by Ganta, you have to feel bad for the kid. He goes through so much crap and while I\'m not a big fan of trying to be shocking in a story considering how often that means ""not making sense or being offensive for no reason"", it works here and gets your attention.2. It\'s a shonen series. Like, I\'m not sure if it\'s actually a shonen series, but the weird mix of childish and mature stories, the one-on-one fights, the variety of bizarre characters that have unique attacks all from a similar source of power and everything about the series is very much like your typical action shonen series. And I\'m a big fan of a lot of shonen, so this really appealed to me.3. It\'s only 12 episodes. Now I often care more about characters the longer a series is (short of maybe some notable character derailment) and I tend to prefer a series continuing to see more stories and see how stuff is resolved. But how shocking this series was had worn off after a while and nothing exactly made me beg for a 2nd season. If it continued, I have a feeling the flaws would be made so much more apparent and annoying.4. Being the first show on the new Toonami. This was probably the perfect choice for the first series on new Toonami. It was now late-night, Adult Swim with an audience a few years older. Now, the great first impression helped but also, what was the most popular anime on Adult Swim? Shonen action anime. And since this is like a TV-MA shonen series, it just fit perfectly. It was the type of action anime people loved on Toonami, but with more blood and violence and swearing etc. It makes complete sense. it\'s very mature and dark and shocking.

The prison breaks weren't really exciting either. Everyone just walked around whenever they felt like it.Art: It does look pretty cool (Unsurprisingly. It was illustrated by Kazuma Kondou, who also illustrated Eureka Seven.), I really like the character designs. They all look...unique and interesting. The animation isn't the best, though. It looked a little off at times.Sound: I didn't find the sound all that impressive, but it wasn't bad either. It has a pretty good soundtrack. The only thing that annoyed me sound-wise was Ganta's voice actor.Character: This was one of the biggest problems I had with the series. Ganta was pretty boring. The only time he did something interesting was in the last episode. Shiro was mildly interesting.I really didn't care about anyone at all, though. Near the end there was a lot of flashbacking to make you feel bad for people right before they died. Nope. Didn't work.Enjoyment: Some episodes were more enjoyable than others, but none of them were so boring that I paused to go do something else.Overall, I think it was a decent series. It could've been a lot better than it was, but I still enjoyed it enough to watch the whole thing. If there's a second season, I'll probably watch that too. unique and interesting.

The major let down for this anime is purely that it doesn't continue to a proper ending. "", 'Disclaimer: may contain spoilers (if you could call them spoilers)I normally don\'t write reviews, but I feel I ought to in order to save some future viewers from attempting this anime.  Years ago (and I mean years) I picked up this anime (I was going through a phase of gory, messed up story lines etc.) and I dropped the series smack in the middle.  I should have learned from that lesson, but alas, it was one of those that was haunting my inability to finish.  Thankfully it came on Netflix and I had my chance to finish.The start isn\'t terrible, the first...few episodes really sink their teeth into you and leave you with a sense of anticipation.  I mean a messed up jail where inmates literally get publicly executed! Red-man, branches of sin!  It had so much going for it.Once again, I felt my interest wan in the middle, but decided to stick with it this time.  The storyline became convoluted, the characters were not growing.  Some you would meet and get a back story only for them to be killed of quickly and the main protagonist Ganta cannot do a damn thing except cry about his helplessness.  Even the shogun quality to this anime was weak.  I wanted to learn more about the red-man and Shiro\'s tie to being the ""Wretched Egg.""  We even meet mockingbird, a strong character who knows who Shiro is, right at the end.  My thought was that there could be no way the story could be tied up in a nice package at the end, hoping against all odds that I would get some sort of answer.  Well, I can\'t say that I\'ve spoiled anything because there absolutely is no conclusion.  It\'s a big ball of mush that I just wasted precious time watching. few episodes really sink their teeth into you and leave you with a sense of anticipation.

The main character is a mere child falsely accused and put in a prison were people engage in life endangering activities for the personal enjoyment of the public. Things only gets worse from there when this character is sent to an underground section were he must fight to the death on PPV and the supernatural aspect of blood manipulation is prevalent in these fighters. The obstacles seem to only get even harsher when a breakout occurs against all odds and the continuously occurring...feeling of hopelessness is almost constant throughout the series. Many people\'s problem with the plot is that it does not really end but this is because it is a 13 episode series with no second season although the manga continues on so I cannot blame the series for this.Art(6/7)The art was actually very good but unfortunately the actual character designs are not anything special. They are not generic but nothing memorable is in them. Normally i would have given it a higher score but I feel like Studio Manglobe\'s use of darker tones went too far and made it actually difficult to see scenes that were easily presentable in the manga at times.Sound(10/10)The sound for this series is in my opinion extremely good. It presents many different back round songs that are short and often not reused so any song is not over saturated. The opening theme song is my personal favorite of all time and the band Fade had great success with the song as it went to #4 in the japanese pop charts with this ""engrish"" rock song. The ending theme is also more gentle and presents images of the main character\'s tragic past so that you are constantly reminded of what was lost so motivations are constantly prevalent.Characters(8/10)The best character in the series is the main character Ganta Igarashi. Ganta is a young boy forced into a orison worse than any in the modern US. People often say they are annoyed at him being ""whiny"" and not getting over the situation but I fell it presents the most realistic reaction I have seen in anime to the situation. Despite this Ganta still develops as a character even as the situation gets all the more dangerous and decides to face situations head on without fear on several occasions. The characters of Senji Kiyomasa and Minatsuki Takami are also very interesting as Senji presents the usual bad ass warrior who you just always want to see in action while Minatsuki is a little girl who is heavily disturbed with the most intense back story in the series which is really saying a lot. The villian, Chief Makina, is a very good villain that can truly give you the creeps as the perfect incarnation of a true psycopath. feeling of hopelessness is almost constant throughout the series.

This story follows Screamy McScream and his bloody adventures that made me wuzy. Its not really gore its more of the feeling when a nurse takes your blood, but if your fine with that then great. The show has really pretty fight scenes which is where it shines and a plot to drag it back into the gutter. Especially the end, which leaves on a cliff hanger and makes me mad even remembering it....So be prepared for that if you want to watch the show. It also has the worst yandere girl because while you know she’s yandere she doesn’t ever show it on camera so to speak. So if you want to fill the future diary void watch this once and then just go re-watch future diary over and over like the rest of us. If you’re here and haven’t seen future diary just go watch that.

That is until his classroom is blown up by a mysterious figure in red, killing all of his friends in the process. Ganta is falsely accused of the crime and is sentenced to life in the most awful...prison imaginable, Deadman Wonderland. In Deadman Wonderland, prisoners are put through fatal challenges and experiments, all while under the guise that Deadman Wonderland is a simple theme park. While inside, Ganta realizes that he has the power to control his blood (Hemokinesis is one of my favorite powers btw) and use it as a weapon. He must learn to control this new power if he hopes to survive in a world where the only rule is survival of the fittest is the only law, and get his revenge on the man in red.  (I just now saw the side that says not to write a summery, but I already wrote it and I\'m not going back on my work now.)I\'m sorry that the summery was so long, but this anime needs a lot of prior explanation in order to understand without seeing the first episode and thinking ""What am I watching exactly?"" This anime is by no means bad, it\'s actually quite an interesting concept for an anime, one that feels fresh and unique.

However, if your new to anime, this may go a bit over your head.The characters were very much in the ""eh..."" category. They weren\'t bad, but they weren\'t exactly good either. The main character keeps having these moments of ""I have to be strong to survive"" where upon he acts upon them. While this is normally a good way of pulling the audience in and making them care about the character, this seems to be the only trick the writers could come up with, as this same exact moment happens over and over again, with the same music to boot. When a character intends to make a change, he has to make it permanent, and than he can adjust his beliefs to meet the situational needs.While everything thing else in this anime was either average or slightly above average, a kick ass intro song being one of the best parts, the main thing that drags this anime down is exactly what I stated at the beginning of this review, the pacing of this anime is far to fast. Important events are blown through without giving viewers time to analyze the situation and figure out if they should care about what is happening in a given scene. Instead the anime just pushes you ahead as if saying ""No time to dilly dally, keep walking, nothing to see here"" WHAT ARE YOU HIDING FROM ME DEADMAN WONDERLAND?!All jokes aside, I assume it was done this way in order to squeeze as much out of the manga story into the 12 episodes that they had to work with.

highly or poorly, so i\'m going to write reviews after completing each series so i can reference them in the future.~~~this review is going to be a short one because my reasoning for giving it a 6/10 is pretty straightforward. there\'s not much here for me to dissect. in short, i rated this so lowly not because i didn\'t enjoy it, but because it\'s unfinished. this is one of those shows that feels like it\'s just advertisement for the manga...series since it doesn\'t resolve any of the story elements and didn\'t get any follow up seasons. the anime shrouds itself in mystery and does a good job teasing you onward and keeping you invested. it brings up questions you desperately wants answers and then gives you small glimpses at the overall picture without spoiling the truth. but it just feels so disappointing when the anime ends and literally nothing has been answered, saying ""just read the manga!"". and while i could read it and get invested in the series further, i don\'t really have that strong urge to pick it up. i\'m sure it\'s great, but i just can\'t be bothered.other than that, the other thing that really annoys me about deadman wonderland is how it feels like the writer doesn\'t know what direction he wants to take the story or the overall feel of it. in the beginning, after the main character, ganta, arrives in prison, the show makes a big deal about cast points and the inner economy of the prison. without it you wouldn\'t be able to buy food, but more importantly, you wouldn\'t be able to buy the medicine to keep you alive. and the show shows us that the solution to this is to join events, like the dog race, which will reward winners with money. so this really builds it up like this is going to be the focus of the show: ganta is going to have to participate in these gruesome events which will slowly build his character and power and along the way he\'ll learn more about the red man. but then events like these are never mentioned again. so i guess it doesn\'t matter. and right after the dog race, ganta gets himself into this underground fighting ring that pits deadmen against deadmen. this is the real purpose of deadman wonderland and he\'s told that the winnings are are even greater than in events like the dog race. and he\'s even told that if he wins enough, he might be able to get his chance to face the red man. so now i think the series is going to focus on these 1 on 1 battles and ganta will win these slowly by the skin of his teeth. he\'ll become stronger and eventually this will lead him to the climax to fight the red man. but after two of these battles, it\'s never mentioned again. so i guess the show isn\'t that either. then the show becomes about a group of rebellion of deadmen trying to gain their freedom (mind you, that this is already more than halfway through the 12 episodes), so now i start to think the focus of the show is going to be ganta and this group\'s plan to break out which will result in them finding out about the wretched egg and will end with the battle against the red man. but then the rebellion arc ends and the show says something to the effect of ""ganta and yoh are now back to their regular inmate lives"", basically saying that the series is no longer going to focus on the secret underground deadman facility thing. so it constantly feels like the writers want to go in one direction, but then quickly switch it up and you get this really incohesive feeling.i know i wrote a lot about two reasons i didn\'t like deadman wonderland, but that doesn\'t mean i disliked it. i thought it was actually a pretty enjoyable watch. the conspiracy of the deadman wonderland\'s purpose and shiro and ganta\'s mysterious past are really interesting to watch unravel. it\'s just not

""To get this right out, this is a series most likely to never get completed, not due to overabundance of episodes but because the studio that had the rights to it, went out of business so I'll say for that reason, this anime is kinda a pass. It had promise, had a good bit of world building, decent characters, and a cool story. There are a few things one can complain about like how there are parts of it that are predictable and the protagonist complains a bit but without a finished product I feel I can't fairly judge it. Would I recommend it? I...have heard the manga is completed so it may be worth your time there though I haven't finished it yet so I can't say it's good. but you at least get the full story without having to spend the extra time so no, I reluctantly say it's a pass. have heard the manga is completed so it may be worth your time there though I haven't finished it yet so I can't say it's good. but you at least get the full story without having to spend the extra time so no, I reluctantly say it's a pass."", 'Oh, Deadman Wonderland.You know when you watch an anime, and the first few episodes are amazing, but it all goes waaayyy downhill from there?Well, that\'s Deadman Wonderland in a nutshell.~No spoilers here!~Deadman Wonderland is a 13 episode series that came out in 2011, based of the manga by Jinsei Kataoka. Now, let\'s start with the review.Story: 6/10Don\'t get me wrong, this is the reason I decided to watch the anime. It seemed so cool sounding and I really liked the concept of it. I\'\'m also a big fan of horror/thriller anime, so I decided to watch it. It started off great- some kid gets framed...for the mass murder of his whole class. The story was so interesting, I was just dying to watch the next episode. Well, until, everything got so much worse after episode 3. But overall, I really liked the concept, it just needs a lot of work. There were a lot of plot holes, such as, one of the characters shown in the opening only shows up for 3 minutes in the last episode, and we really don\'t get much knowledge about them! And, the last episode was just very disappointing and left me very confused. It was just too much to handle. And trust me, I\'ve seen a lot of confusing anime\'s, but this one was only confusing because it was missing so much detail.Art: 5/10When someone says the words, ""Deadman Wonderland"", lets just say the first thing I don\'t think about is the art. I\'m not saying it was terrible, but it wasn\'t something that stood out or anything. Just mediocre.Sound: 7/10Now, I really do like the sound, and to be specific, the opening for the anime. Very catchy, I could listen to it all day. The ending wasn\'t that bad, either! The soundtrack was actually pretty decent, I won\'t complain.Character: 6/10Besides the fact that each character has something unique about them, there wasn\'t a lot of character development. Actually, not a lot at all. Some of the characters only showed up for an episode or two, and then disappeared for like, 3 episodes, and then showed up again. Ganta, the main character, was an okay character, and maybe even Shiro, and of course, I liked Minatsuki. But besides that, I couldn\'t really get a whole lot from the others. They were either always changing personalities, or we would only get a certain amount of screen time and then they wouldn\'t really do anything after that.Enjoyment: 6With all of these factors in mind, my overall enjoyment was about a 6. If you\'re looking into getting into this anime for whatever reason, please just read the manga. You won\'t be as confused, and it\'ll save you a lot of time. This anime isn\'t the worst I\'ve seen, but it definitely was far from the best. You\'re better off watching a different anime if you don\'t plan on reading the manga.All in all, Deadman Wonderland wasn\'t that bad, and I\'m sure if there was a lot more effort put into it, it would be pretty good. So again, just read the manga. It will save you time, and you won\'t be left on a cliffhanger or stuck in the middle of a plot hole or a rushed story. for the mass murder of his whole class.

And, the last episode was just very disappointing and left me very confused. It was just too much to handle. And trust me, I\'ve seen a lot of confusing anime\'s, but this one was only confusing because it was missing so much detail.Art: 5/10When someone says the words, ""Deadman Wonderland"", lets just say the first thing I don\'t think about is the art. I\'m not saying it was terrible, but it wasn\'t something that stood out or anything. Just mediocre.Sound: 7/10Now, I really do like the sound, and to be specific, the opening for the anime. Very catchy, I could listen to it all day. The ending wasn\'t that bad, either! The soundtrack was actually pretty decent, I won\'t complain.Character: 6/10Besides the fact that each character has something unique about them, there wasn\'t a lot of character development. Actually, not a lot at all. Some of the characters only showed up for an episode or two, and then disappeared for like, 3 episodes, and then showed up again. Ganta, the main character, was an okay character, and maybe even Shiro, and of course, I liked Minatsuki. But besides that, I couldn\'t really get a whole lot from the others. They were either always changing personalities, or we would only get a certain amount of screen time and then they wouldn\'t really do anything after that.Enjoyment: 6With all of these factors in mind, my overall enjoyment was about a 6. If you\'re looking into getting into this anime for whatever reason, please just read the manga. You won\'t be as confused, and it\'ll save you a lot of time. This anime isn\'t the worst I\'ve seen, but it definitely was far from the best. You\'re better off watching a different anime if you don\'t plan on reading the manga.All in all, Deadman Wonderland wasn\'t that bad, and I\'m sure if there was a lot more effort put into it, it would be pretty good. So again, just read the manga. It will save you time, and you won\'t be left on a cliffhanger or stuck in the middle of a plot hole or a rushed story.', ""What a shame Deadman Wonderland was never continued, it feels like it ended where it could've gotten really good.In its entirety, and standing as one season only, Deadman Wonderland is mediocre. It has some incredible animation at times (at least to my eye), an interesting plot and surprisingly, some nicely fleshed out characters (I'm thinking specifically Nagi and Gengaku) (oh, and Minatsuki). Surprising because it's only the first season, and they aren't even the MC's.I don't know what I expected but it definitely wasn't this. The premise is certainly one I've never heard of before, so I'll give it that. But again, execution...wasn't there. It was decent at best. It mostly made sense, and the pacing was okay, at times would feel a little too fast, but generally not too bad. If it had gotten another season all the little things I have a problem with probably could've gotten fixed. The main one being, I still have no idea what is going on.The MC draws some similarities with the MC in Servamp. The only strength of these type of MC's is that they always get back up and that they don't seem to ever give up. Weak as Ganta is, I will give him props for the occasional character growth and that one moment of weakness where his entire character just took a whole 180 (personally, my favourite scene of him ever). It was quite literally 12 episodes of Ganta trying to get stronger but failing almost every single time but whatever, Shiro was cute and stuck to his side, so that's a nice balance.Also, the fan service? I can't quite grasp why there would be any in an anime like this, especially considering the dark undertones this anime has. It has its gore, a fair bit of action and a white haired girl in skin tight clothing for what reason? There was even a scene where the top prison guard (whatever she is) was getting changed?Anyway, not quite worth my time. It was interesting at least, had some good characters (about 3) and a pretty cool concept with the deadman (or deadmen idk). Could've been a lot higher if the characters were better and if any attachment between myself and the characters were achieved. The MC being weak sets up for a good development later on so that's not a huge flaw, but I've seen plenty of season 1 animes that are high in action/shounen that perfectly execute characters and plot within 12 episodes.In other words, only watch if you've exhausted your anime list or have run out of shounen's to watch (I'd be impressed). wasn't there.

Even though we all know the answer all along. This whole time the MC chases a certain someone who did something, only for it to be the person who was with them the whole time, we all know who it is the entire time. The MC doesn\'t ever use his 2 brain cells to figure it out if he put some thought into it at all. He gets so close to figuring it out and the anime just ends, maybe it\'s a product of them thinking they were going to get...a season 2 so we can have the characters actually interact with each other when they learn this knowledge, but it didn\'t happen. I\'d advise not watching this if you want to be left feeling satisfied at all. a season 2 so we can have the characters actually interact with each other when they learn this knowledge, but it didn\'t happen.

Before I get into this review, just know that the series was cancelled, so there will be no season 2 for it, which effects the viewing heavily.Plot: Everything was normal for Ganta Igarashi at school, until a mysterious being cloaked in a red cape came and absolutely OBLITERATED his entire class, except for him. Being framed for the massacre of his class, Ganta is sentenced to death row in Deadman Wonderland, a morbid amalgamation theme park that boasts main attraction events in which prisoners compete in order to win prizes...so that they can survive their sentences. Ganta quickly finds that beyond this already morbid concept that onlookers just think is a show and no real danger is coming to the participants, there is something much worse and more sinister happening at this out of the ordinary prison.I actually really liked the concept of Deadman Wonderland. I thought that this could have been a great idea if it wasn't so broken down. There is a lot of over the top gore, but the action sequences are hardly up to par. There is more drama than anything happening which each side story that is presented between the characters and the relationships, and the gore is mainly due to the factor of the characters abilities being blood related. The concept of forcing these supernatural prisoners to fight to the death is honestly a really minor factor to the show, since you only get the see the competitions on about 3 occasions, the rest of the airtime is just focused on the background happenings and what goes on behind the scenes.The main big bad guy, aka 'Red Man', who Ganta is hunting for the entire time, is never made actually relevant aside from fueling Ganta to keep going. The characters that are NOT the MC are actually a lot more interesting and enjoyable, but I feel like they all got short sided with what they were shown doing/allowed to do since Ganta had to be front and center the entire time. Shiro had such an interesting story, but the ending of the season felt a lot like a mid-season break that was supposed to lead to something much bigger. Maybe if they were to actually follow through with that, and the series got another 12 episodes, then there would be a better rating to the show, but where it lies now and will forever, it just fell short of its mark.Because of the fact that this series got cancelled, it was just...half-baked as it is. I know that the manga delves further into the story, and the anime got cancelled for the fact that it deviated too far from the manga, but where it ended, there was actually 0 conclusion to any of the main story or side stories.

The artistic style and music compliment the plot and themes well, and there is enough action & suspense to keep the viewer watching.We have the main protagonist (Ganta) who is suddenly thrust into the challenges of a new unforgiving world, along with a raw expanding cast of characters. Each demonstrate their own unique flair & skills as the story progresses. The story tries to strike a...delicate balance between the conflict of an innocent protagonist against a dark world, while also presenting a protagonist bold enough to overcome those challenges. Unfortunately the author errs to the side of caution, giving depth to the unforgiving world at the expense of Ganta's character depth which leaves much to be desired.The beginning and middle (of the anime) start off quite well as the story develops, though the ending for the 1st season was picked at an picked awkward place that would be difficult to stick the landing. Several years later, season 2 hasn't come and likely won't but that's okay because the manga is a better adaptation and carries it until the end.I recommend watching the anime first if you're into a semi dystopian, quick binge watch at 12 episodes and if you like it enough can read the rest.

Then his entire class other than himself is brutally murdered leaving only him as a survivor and soon Ganta is on death's row, charged with the killing of his classmates, and sent to Deadman's Wonderland to live out the sentence. There's...inherant problems with this story. There's no real investigation logic applied to the conviction of Ganta's guilt and it's all flicked through fairly quickly. I can forgive this, however, because the show wants to try and get to the meat of what it wants to show. The problem is that the story itself becomes rather messy very quickly. From episode to episode the theme of the show as a whole and the focus of individual episodes seems to jump around aimlessly. Unsure whether it wants to be about a kid on death's row, a boy trying to prove his innocence, a boy discovering a form of superpower or a prison break and yet somehow all of them at once. It's an attempt that doesn't mix well, mostly because the show attempts to juggle all these themes at once and it all comes crashing down pretty horribly. What the show lacked here was a clear focus on exactly what exactly it was supposed to be.Characters suffer from a fairly similar problem. Ganta is our frontman, our main character, and at first I didn't much mind him. He's pretty down and upset to begin with but that makes sense. Anyone would feel broken and confused with the set of events that happen to Ganta in the first couple of episodes. However the show becomes very set on Ganta and the perception that he is weak and has to become strong. This is fine in itself except it results in Ganta becoming extremely self depricating, and at the finale, when the show seems to say 'look, he's strong now' the only strength he really has is he can shoot his blood blobs faster than before. There is very little development here in terms of internal character or strength and it injures the show badly.The other character, and Ganta's companion for the series, is Shiro, and anyone who's anyone will have alarm bells ringing through their head at the mere sight of Shiro. I'm rather tired of this kind of character in anime. The strange looking oddball character who might seem a little odd but essentially harmless but underneath is actually far more sinister. Shiro, when she's not being developed, is good fun. She's smiley, hungry and always quite enjoyable.

The First Phase is Ganta's phase of confusion and learning. Here Ganta learns the rules of Deadman Wonderland, he comes to discover his power and he meets Shiro. Phase Two brings us the show's phase of survival and cage fights with Ganta meeting other Deadmen, understanding his power more and fighting other Deadmen. The Third Phase is the show's phase of escape, fight or flight. Here the Undertaker's are introduced, Ganta is determined to become stronger and escape attempts are made from the prison.

But, here's what I remember. It starts off great. Actually tries to set some character up, and even gives some backstory. But, after a few episodes, no more characters are well established, and they will be forgotten not too long after you see them die. The ending was bad. A lot was just left open for interpretation, and just felt empty. If this got 20 episodes, or even a second season, I would say it's a lot better.

While this show has a pretty shitty story I can say that all other aspects of the show are pretty alright. The art style isn\'t bad and a lot of the gore is very detailed so if you\'re into that it\'s a plus, the main character isn\'t a piece of shit and I actually ended up liking him a lot more than I initially thought I would. The show can honestly be pretty funny sometimes as well, but I don\'t know if that\'s on purpose. The...side characters are usually pretty good but when it comes to the villains it\'s really 50/50. The ending song is an honest bop and I listened to it fully every episode.In my honest opinion, you should give this show a shot, the story is a dumpster fire but sometimes it\'s fun to watch shit burn.More specific gripes and opinions for others who have watched the show*spoilers*(story)My biggest blight with the story is that the person who runs the fucking prison twilights as a fucking DEFENSE attorney, I guess that in the world of Deadman\'s wonderland there is no such thing as the BAR or a conflict of interest. How in the world does nobody see an issue with the man defending the condemned being the same man that benefits the most if they are found guilty.My second biggest gripe is that this world has the audacity to claim that there are ""human rights organizations"". I refuse to believe for a second that Deadman\'s wonderland would be open for a month if there was a real human rights organization anywhere in the world. I would\'ve been fine if they just ignored the idea completely and it was just implied that people were hungry for violence but instead, they try and act like people care about that shit.Another complaint about the story is the fact that Deadman\'s Wonderland is a tourist trap???? Again, this would have been normal if the society at large was obsessed with violence but during the death race, they just think that everyone who is VIOLENTLY murdered is fine and it\'s just special effects. How stupid are these people? Are you telling me that people can watch someone\'s head burst like a bubble or be sliced in half and still not realize that people are dying let alone the smell of burning flesh from those poor souls who fell on top of the electric wires and were cooked? Those people who have smelled burning flesh can attest it is a horrible smell so I doubt many people would even want to be there.Another big plot hole is the fact that half of the prison staff, including the  LEADER of the prison staff, is in the dark about the truth of Deadman Wonderland and how they have people with superpowers in the basement. Why the hell are there so many random ass grunts that know about this ""Big Secret"" but for some damn reason the head of the prison staff is kept in the dark.My last complaint about the story is about the military and its part in Deadman Wonderland. While it makes sense that the military wants to use this new technology I cannot see the reason why they would let this psycho run the whole operation instead of just putting some military puppet in the position.I do have to say that when the main character is taken to the secret part of the prison the story tightens up and I really start to enjoy the story more.(Characters)Now when it comes to the villains I think there is really only one that actually has a real motivation to become this merciless killer is Nagi. After watching his pregnant wife die it only makes sense that he would lose his mind and go berzerk and the idea of him sealing away those memories to only have them come back was one of the high points of the story. Now... when it comes to the other characters who are villains it just seems so fucking lame. The punk monk Genkaku becomes this homicidal maniac because he was beaten and molested at his temple but really... are you fucking kidding me? You can go to the head monk or at least the police or... I don\'t know, maybe switch fucking temples. There is no way that he just sat around and didn\'t do anything until the breaking point where he murdered them. The little girl undertaker is stupid and is a blatant example of some edge lord with a pen\'s wet dream. I refuse to believe that some fucking mom would just torture her kid ruthlessly for the tiniest fuckin things and I doubt it would\'ve gotten far unless CPS doesn\'t exist in any form in Japan.Sometimes I felt that the writers were trying so hard to make these edgy-ass backgrounds for the characters that it was honestly just comedic at some points. When Minatsukis mom tried to save her flowers instead of her daughter I honestly started laughing especially when she got obliterated by that rock. When Ganta was crying out for his superhero while getting attacked by that rabid dog I was also laughing. I can\'t tell if this was designed to be a joke but for the sake of the writers, I hope it was.The main character doesn\'t suck which is impressive especially when you consider the fact that the story sucks dick and balls and I honestly like the fact that he stands his ground and actually backs it up which is nice.In the end, its a 6/10 and that is all I gotta say about that. side characters are usually pretty good but when it comes to the villains it\'s really 50/50.

There are some positives don\'t get me wrong, but the positives are severly outweighed by the negatives. Let\'s talk about them shall we?\\Here are the positives: The theme song is an absolute banger. The art style is nice and fluid and fits the style that the...show is going for.

They fight with their blood.They make a cut on their body and they can control their blood and use it as a weapon.Every Deadman has different kind of using their blood.They are all traped in a prison called Deadman Wonderland with some sick, twisted idiot who made that prison because some orphan girl (Shiro) was the first Dedamn and creator of all other Deadmans.So the creator and president of the prison artifficaly made Shiro whit the mother of the main protagonist Ganta.His mother later killed herself.Ganta was supposed to be used as a human experiment baby, but when she gave birth to him she changed her mind and instead used orphan child, Shiro.When he was young he used to play with Shiro, later he forgot that and at the and he remembered.She was stronger than average person so she always saw him as a weakling.When he came into the prison he was really weak, but through some training he got better.After that is the story of what happened in the prison and how he cleard his name, bla bla, but it's mostly in the manga.

Firstly, I really liked the entire concept of the Wonderland where the prisoners would go, it reminded me of alot of others shows, but somehow the almost childish theme they had made it stand out compared to others. The characters were also a big stand out to me, paticularly the girl with the red swirly tits, not for her tits but how out of place she was in the show, and then to find out she was exactley where she...should of been the whole time, her character mixed with her personality seemed to symbolise wonderland very well. Ganta was a character i did not follow well his story was simple but it was odd how he was framed for something that was impossible for him to do in the first place, but his character arc was satisfying to see nearer the end of the show. Alot of characters didnt hav much of a background to them, making them look like plot armor rather than a fully made character and story. The art style was cool, sound was good, bur repeated Gantas theme tune too often and some times used it on other characters. To bad there isnt another season to answer alot of unswered questions.Forgot to mention the guy that coudnt find a shirt the whole show, the one with one eye, i got more background to a ""Supporting"" role rather than a main. should of been the whole time, her character mixed with her personality seemed to symbolise wonderland very well.

I won't go in to detail about the plot, but instead just speak in very general terms about the quality of the show.Episodes 1 - 6:You might like it. You might not. Personally, I loved it. Just read the MAL description of the plot, and that's basically all you need to know. It almost presents itself as a gory twist on the typical shonen genre. Adolescents with supernatural powers duke it out in an arena. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT!? But it's executed well. The action is...brutal and fast paced. You want to see the MC - who is portrayed as very relatable and sympathetic - come out on top. But amid the carnage and misery there is a message about caring for others, self sacrifice, and friendship, all executed in a way that doesn't feel forced or sappy. First half is an easy 8/10 for me.Episodes 7 - 12:Disappointing. Whatever it was that attracted you to the show in the first place is probably gone. A sea of new characters, as well as a villain, are forced on to center stage. You are given no time to really get to know them, and there's way too many to keep track of. On top of this, these flat and stagnant characters push aside some of the already established cast (who were considerably more interesting). The very thing the show is based around ( the powers that they wield) isn't even explored again until the last two episodes. You're just forced to watch unnecessarily complex drama unfold between characters who mean nothing to you. 5/10It's not awful. Just disappointing. The first half said so much with so little. And the second half said almost nothing with so much. brutal and fast paced. You want to see the MC - who is portrayed as very relatable and sympathetic - come out on top.

Fushigiboshi no☆Futagohime Gyu!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1886/Fushigiboshi_no☆Futagohime_Gyu,"['You are not missing out on anything with this one.One of the big selling points of the first season was the setting. It wasn\'t just another school, it was a whole fantasy planet full of all sorts of stuff. The characters were well connected to the world, being the princes and princesses of their respective countries, and the story had a clear goal, stopping the sun from going out.Now imagine you took all of these characters, stripped them both of their context in the world and most of their personality and transplanted them into a generic school setting.This second season does not take place on...the mysterious planet, but instead on a different world that has a school for royalty all the characters have to attend. The days of air balloon journeys around the hollow earth to stop the encroaching darkness are over, now it\'s time for school adventures, how exciting.This school is strict though, it has rules against anything fun and will threaten to kick you out if you break them. Any time anything too fun happens, our generic Anime villain student council president will step in and summon shadow monsters to disrupt things, usually with very little success. The princesses then transform and engage in the least interesting battle sequences this genre has to offer, sprinkling the monsters with glitter until they vanish. They still have similar wish magic to the first season, but here it\'s used much less creatively, mostly to mass dispel shadow creatures or save someone from them.The other character are present but sadly stripped of what made them enjoyable. Altessa is doing manzai comedy now, Shade apparently forgot his whip and will to fight at home and everyone else barely does anything either. Not particularly bothered by the mystery of the shadow creatures, they instead do stuff like leading the fencing club.But hey, there are new characters as well, surely those are fun. The princesses now have Doremi fairies that help them transform, stripping Poomo of his role in the story. They are agents of chaos and usually just mess things up. Oh, there is a girl that says ""fushigi"" a lot, a character dedicated entirely to manzai jokes, the most annoying ojousama character I have ever seen and a boy that cries easily. I know, great lineup.The story of this show feels like Satou Jun collected scripts for Doremi episodes that got scrapped for being too boring and made a show out of them. The setting has lost it\'s magic, being mostly school focussed now. Doremi was an excellent example of how to get great emotional impact from such a setting, but this doesn\'t happen here. You have episodes like the princesses helping an inventor construct a fart fuelled power generator or their fairies messing up the recipe of a baker. I barely even remember what the others were about, none of them left a positive impact.My recommendation is to pretend this doesn\'t exist. It\'s not Futagohime anymore, it\'s some barely functional school Anime with the same character designs.

The princesses now have Doremi fairies that help them transform, stripping Poomo of his role in the story. They are agents of chaos and usually just mess things up. Oh, there is a girl that says ""fushigi"" a lot, a character dedicated entirely to manzai jokes, the most annoying ojousama character I have ever seen and a boy that cries easily. I know, great lineup.The story of this show feels like Satou Jun collected scripts for Doremi episodes that got scrapped for being too boring and made a show out of them. The setting has lost it\'s magic, being mostly school focussed now. Doremi was an excellent example of how to get great emotional impact from such a setting, but this doesn\'t happen here. You have episodes like the princesses helping an inventor construct a fart fuelled power generator or their fairies messing up the recipe of a baker. I barely even remember what the others were about, none of them left a positive impact.My recommendation is to pretend this doesn\'t exist. It\'s not Futagohime anymore, it\'s some barely functional school Anime with the same character designs. Just watch Doremi instead or something. the mysterious planet, but instead on a different world that has a school for royalty all the characters have to attend. The days of air balloon journeys around the hollow earth to stop the encroaching darkness are over, now it\'s time for school adventures, how exciting.This school is strict though, it has rules against anything fun and will threaten to kick you out if you break them. Any time anything too fun happens, our generic Anime villain student council president will step in and summon shadow monsters to disrupt things, usually with very little success. The princesses then transform and engage in the least interesting battle sequences this genre has to offer, sprinkling the monsters with glitter until they vanish. They still have similar wish magic to the first season, but here it\'s used much less creatively, mostly to mass dispel shadow creatures or save someone from them.The other character are present but sadly stripped of what made them enjoyable.
