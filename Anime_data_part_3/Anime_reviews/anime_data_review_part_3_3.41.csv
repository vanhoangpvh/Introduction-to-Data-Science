Stop!! Hibari-kun!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3332/Stop_Hibari-kun,"[""Very dated.Allthough I liked the animation and the characters a lot (very 1990), and some of the humor is pretty well written, the main premise would be a disgrace these days.This isn't a spoiler, but the main running joke is transphobia. Allthough the crossdressing boy (trans girl) is treated as a hero with basically no flaws (she's awesome!), what goes for funny in every episode is how people are scared/think it's weird/diislike that part of her, and that's kind of hard to swollow these days, unless you're on the wrong side of history and decency.The other jokes are good, though, it's not a barf fest,...but treat what I wrote as a trigger warning if you have a hard time with that kind of thing.If Hibari wasn't awesome, I'd give this a 1, but because she is, I give it a 5. but treat what I wrote as a trigger warning if you have a hard time with that kind of thing.If Hibari wasn't awesome, I'd give this a 1, but because she is, I give it a 5."", ""When i first starting watching this anime. I had my doubts about the art seeing as it was made quite a while ago but i gave it a shot and wasn't disappointed.The story was great though i didn't feel as though it had a real plot maybe a collection of episodes instead. It revolves around a teenaged Kohsuka who has now moved in the home of his mother's friend, because she had died a while back. Its just so happens that the Yakuza family has four beautiful daughters, but the one daughter, Hibari, thats more beautiful than the rest  is actually a boy. Hibari...just can't keep his hands off Kohsuka and so their crazy yet happy lives go on.Art was good nothing spectacular or anything but back then it was considered great.If this show was to get a makeover to 2009 artist redoing the character design it would definitly be a one hitter.The music was okay and can get annoying sometimes. Though there is a different song for a situation so you know when something is coming on based on the music playing.The characters were the best part of the whole series. Hibari was the most unique and one of a kind with his interactions with everyone in the show. Hibari also reminded me of Jun watarase of Happiness so for those who love jun should definintly check out this anime.Overall i enjoyed this series very much. It had the perfect combination of romance, comedy and genderbender and was a joy to watch. just can't keep his hands off Kohsuka and so their crazy yet happy lives go on.Art was good nothing spectacular or anything but back then it was considered great.If this show was to get a makeover to 2009 artist redoing the character design it would definitly be a one hitter.The music was okay and can get annoying sometimes.

Not gonna lie, this series is one of the more complicated (for me) animes I've watched yet. It was equal parts awesome and dreadful.As far as characters go, Hibari-chan is amazing. She's everything a trans girl aspires to be and more. She reminded me so much of our generation today.  My character rating for this review is ONLY of Hibari. Every other character deserves a 3 or below.Literally everyone else in the series was either passively transphobic or outright racist (including Hibari's father and the...family bodyguard). I was not expecting to see the racism and that was very hard to look past when looking at the series as a whole. Also, I kept hoping I'd see a payoff in the final episode of her family finally acknowledging she is a girl. That didn't happen, this was made in 1982.  The director may have been an egg and this was his attempt at reconciling that, idk.  I rated the overall story for this review, as a 3. Only because it felt like the entire point of the series was transphobia.I gave it a MAL rating of 6, but only because of Hibari. Otherwise I'd probably rate it a 3 or 4 due to the problematic nature of the other characters.I wish a sequel would come out showing Hibari a few years later, who is now goth, and how she was traumatized by her racist family and upbringing.  I would watch the hell out of that.If you are strongly bothered (like most of us) by racism and transphobia.. I'd pass on the show. I watched it for um, science, but would never recommend it. family bodyguard). I was not expecting to see the racism and that was very hard to look past when looking at the series as a whole.

The humor is absurd and full of references to pop-culture like other gag-manga of the time, which would be a positive aspect if it didn\'t overwhelmed the show, trampling over possibilities to focus on varied characters and, specially, develop *anything* of the relationship between the MC and Hibari, which stays limited to funny skits until the last episode. Which is specially bad since this is not a short anime, having 35 episodes.|Review|Stop!! Hibari-kun! premise is quite cool (considering this is the 80\'s Japanese zeitgeist): the MC suddenly has to...live in the house of a (comical) Yakuza boss that lives with his 4 daughters: however, one of them, Hibari, the most beautiful one, is actually a boy.Hibari is labeled as a ""crossdresser"" in the series, though it actually may be transgenderism by today\'s standards. The main premise is that even though Hibari is a ""pervert"" (that\'s how his father calls him), he is so beautiful and awesome that people just have to accept him the way he is. He acts like a girl and nobody outside the family knows he\'s a boy. The MC of course rapidly falls in love with him (not knowing he\'s a boy), and when he discovers Hibari\'s gender he tries to negate it. Throughout the series he keeps trying to convince himself that he\'s not attracted to him, even though he definitely is, and Hibari always teases and flirts with him knowing this.Again, considering the spirit of the time, this is actually a positive approach into the subject. This is a comedy anime after all, and nothing is taken seriously. And this may also be the biggest flaw of the anime: even with interesting characters, like Hibari\'s other sisters, the classmates at school, and a cast of other comical yakuza employed by the family, I felt these characters weren\'t explored how they should, considering this is an 35 episode anime.Most episodes just consist of random comedy situations with a fair dose of surrealism and references to pop-culture inspired greatly by other gag-manga of the time, like Dr. Slump. I\'m a great fan of this type of humor, but it starts getting really repetitive, and even boring, since the show in going on, and nothing is actually happening. Some characters receive more episodes focused on them, while others, for some unexplainable reason, are almost ignored. It\'s really unbalanced.And this is specially worse considering Hibari and his relationship with the MC is basically *never* developed in *any* way. Things always fall to shallow comedy skits of Hibari flirting with the MC and he getting flustered or embarrassed, until the very last episode. Actually, the last episode happens just like any other episode, like the show was abruptly cut in half. It makes you feel there was a lot of wasted potential here, as a whole. live in the house of a (comical) Yakuza boss that lives with his 4 daughters: however, one of them, Hibari, the most beautiful one, is actually a boy.Hibari is labeled as a ""crossdresser"" in the series, though it actually may be transgenderism by today\'s standards.

Which (the ""comedy"" running gag show) is obviously a materialization of the two main characters trying to cure themselves from inner frustations of the rejection of what they are, but that are stuck in facing the crude reality that people around are stuck in repressive stereotypes that don\'t want to evolve and care around. So why would they care about living along the decorum while everybody are being socially decided to be worst?! I think this the message of this...very descriptive masterpiece series! Insanely great from the start until the last of the 35 episodes as even the musics are real bangers. very descriptive masterpiece series!

Hibari-kun has a great premise revolving around an LGBT character (a crossdresser), and that aspect of it works out great. Unfortunately, pretty much everything else works against the show\'s premise. Disregarding the low-quality art style of the series, Hibari and Kosaku are great characters, and it would\'ve been fine to leave it at just that; however, instead, Hibari is given three sisters and a variety of token cast members which seek to insert ""funny"" jokes. Unfortunately, the jokes and even plots rarely ever make sense. There\'s a continuous ""running gag"" about Hibari\'s father seeing a white alligator in his dreams and many jokes seem...to feature cutaway fantasies so poorly constructed it\'s sometimes hard to tell what\'s actually happening, or how it was even meant to be a joke. For instance, in episode 9, the coach is talking to some kids about respecting nature, and out of nowhere, they become Native American caricatures speaking gibberish for a few seconds and revert to the scene afterward. Many jokes are also about guns, violence, Kosaku not liking Hibari (which oddly, only occasionally works to the show\'s benefit), and Hibari\'s dad almost dying/having a serious medical condition after overreacting. However, this isn\'t what does the show in, at least for me: all of these things, while not passable, would ordinarily not be a deal-breaker. No, instead it\'s the fact that the series relies on stereotypes to progress not only its characters, but the episodes themselves. At least one episode is dedicated to finding a way to make Hibari more manly, and he almost gets sexually assaulted by the end of the episode. Another example would be Hibari emotionally manipulating his own sister and bribing a little boy to go on a date with him...without even telling the boy of his true identity. Sadly, despite the show\'s great LGBT lead, I can only give it a 3/10. It\'s a shame, this type of show had great potential, especially for its era. to feature cutaway fantasies so poorly constructed it\'s sometimes hard to tell what\'s actually happening, or how it was even meant to be a joke.

Sengoku Youko: Yonaoshi Kyoudai-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/56242/Sengoku_Youko__Yonaoshi_Kyoudai-hen,"[""I bid you good day, tired adventurer. Have you grown weary of the endless deluge of isekai and reincarnation in your fantasy? Have you yearned for characters that have empathy and compelling motivations? Perhaps you would be partial to stories that don't rely on familiar tropes and instead seek to subvert your expectations?Give Sengoku Youko a chance.I know, its current rating of low 7 isn't exactly a great sell in the age of inflated scores, but hear me out. It's the kind of story that starts off in a very modest fashion but continuously picks up momentum as it goes. With nearly every single episode,...you're watching its best episode yet. What starts off as a road trip turns into an epic tale of love, friendship, and camaraderie.The author, Satoshi Mizukami, has earned his cult following for a reason. His works showcase a very particular style of storytelling focused on creating a diverse case of unique characters with compelling motivations and letting them figure out the story based on what these motivations are. In his worlds, there are no truly good or truly bad people; rather, there are people who care for different things and finding themselves in misfortune or conflict with each other. You could say it's kind of like Game of Thrones, except not edgy or cynical; quite the opposite: the character interactions in Sengoku Youko and Mizukami's other works are remarkably warm and soulful—to the point where you end up loving the entire cast, and even antagonists can be empathized with.This adaptation by studio White Fox isn't breaking any records in terms of production values and cuts corners relentlessly where it can afford to, but it's clearly crafted with passion and is honestly much better than I would've expected for a very niche manga from the late 2000s, showing respect to the original work and enhancing it where possible. The early episodes are the weakest episodes as I've alluded to earlier, mostly due to the source material's somewhat haphazard pacing and the need to fit six volumes of manga material into a single cours' of TV runtime, but once it finds its stride mid-season, it's all smooth sailing from there. The soundtrack by the famed Evan Call is fantastic as usual and helps set the tone for the action, and the opening by MindaRyn was one of my favorites from the winter 2024 season.Overall, the first season tells a compelling story by itself, but in the grand scheme of things it merely serves as a setup for the main bulk of the narrative. And trust me: the second half, coming summer 2024, will reach much greater heights. I, for one, cannot wait. you're watching its best episode yet.

The animation is of a good standard and well cared for, the graphics are solid, as is the character design, excellent music, in particular the Opening masterpiece which was created to perfection.The characters are currently interested and already from the opening lines of the work, at least for these three episodes we already begin to give them depth. ', ""Sengoku Youko is a good fantasy action anime which didn't gather much attention this season due to its lack of a sizable manga fanbase to generate hype. Given that this anime feels like a shounen from the early 2000s, many viewers more used to the action-packed gory violence of recent shounen (CSM, JJK) didn't bother giving Sengoku Youko a chance, which is a shame since this anime has the best character writing out of all anime airing this season.The main cast comprises of a group of outcasts with tragic backstories and motivations the audience can understand. These characters work well together, connecting through their individual...traumas. However, each character also possesses a unique personality and distinct goals, setting them apart from one another. There is alot of room for development and character growth as the characters have their own personal weaknesses which makes following their journey compelling. While the character writing isn't unconventional by any means, it still stands out, especially considering that many recent anime productions lack the fundamentals of a strong cast.The story on the other hand, while not achieving any remarkable heights yet, benefits from an intriguing premise and the distinctive setting of feudal Japan, where humans and monsters coexist. Sengoku Youko uses this setting to explore the power struggles of individuals marginalized by society—an overarching theme reflected in the characters' backstories. However, one minor concern I have with the story so far is that the pacing seems a bit too fast, not allowing many important moments enough time to breathe.Despite that, Sengoku Youko is the best anime of this season. It immediately spends the first 3 episodes fleshing out the characters by giving them tragic backstories, personal weaknesses, distinct goals and personality traits. These elements not only set the characters apart from each other but also contribute to an engaging group dynamic.Current Scorings:Animation: 7/10 (Good)Sound: 6/10 (Nice music)Story: 5/10 (Typical Old-school Shounen)Characters: 7/10 (Well-built)Value: 1/10 (No impact, unheard of by most)Enjoyment: 7/10 (Fun)Overall: 5.5/10 (Fine) traumas.

This prolific author\'s stories are a mishmash of unorthodox proportions, but yet creative at the same time that you\'d be wondering how someone like him is able to be so gargantuan at his many notable series. From the likes of the famed series of Spirit Circle (which is the mangaka\'s greatest work that hasn\'t got an anime adaptation yet)...to the rather lukewarm adaptation of Fall 2018\'s Planet With (which J.C. Staff did decent where the ""original"" anime came first before the manga\'s release), and the abomination that was Summer-Fall 2022\'s Hoshi no Samidare a.k.a Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer (which the anime was the series\'s biggest sin by way of poor and lackluster production values), the anime counterpart definitely needed a lot, and I mean, A LOT of time in the oven to cook.All of this, leads us to the other ironic side of the coin, which is this Winter\'s season\'s Sengoku Youko, which covers the 1st part of the manga: the Yonaoshi Kyoudai-hen a.k.a World Reform Siblings Arc through the first 13 of its intended 37-episode series for a ""complete"" split 3-cour season. And for an interesting fact (if you want the TL;DR critique) of the show in general: Sengoku Youko is Satoshi Mizukami\'s weakest work, but given the most competent AniManga adaptation thus far from a near-far-gone, returning renowned studio.In Sengoku Youko\'s fantasy world, there exists 2 factions of creatures: ordinary human beings, or monsters in the form of Katawara, experimental beings who are laden with power. The latter is true for a girl named Tama Youko (yes, which literally means fox), whose only goal is to like Jesus Christ (if he was not a human), correct the people in their evil and sinful ways and guide them back on the proper path of goodness and justice. However, what is said truer to her, doesn\'t apply to her brother Jinka, who is a human, and still hates humans in both bone and flesh, with his grudges unknown. Their journey to reform the world is met by Shinsuke Hyoudou, who\'s a samurai, but a coward by the main fact, who vows to become stronger to protect his loved ones. Together, the trio may have their separate ambitions, but the goal is one and the same to explore and reform the world as they deem fit. But enemies stand in their way, not to mention ruthless, and a ploy to experiment on humans and transform them into the aforementioned Katawara creatures, set them onto a path where dangers lurk at every corner, fighting against people that will give them quite the challenge on the road to purification.At first, the trio are faced by the Dangaisyuu: a group of monks who\'re just as they look, innocent monks. But its leader, Yazen, is one that has a quench of power, and the people that serve him, serve the Katawara side of the community on their path towards evil, so much that they have power unabashed to trample on their opponents with much katawara power. But then again, this is the sibling duo of Tama and Jinka they\'re facing against, and the trick about them is that while Jinka is the human, Tama is the Katawara source which provides him powers to be transformed into a powerful Katawara, much like Tama\'s namesake of being a Youko to give Jinka fox powers, which the more tails, the more powerful Jinka is. The more colourful characters that follow thereafter, say, from Shakugan (saved from being a Katawara), to Jinun, Douren and Resshin, these are the true masters of their craft who also sides with the Dangaiyuu to push Yazen forward in his world-conquering quest of transforming humans into Katawara, which does not bode well with Tama\'s philosophy, while testing Jinka\'s limits of becoming a human-Katawara hybrid to the detriment of his thirst for power.If you ask me, Sengoku Youko\'s a pretty wild story of the standard Satoshi Mizukami style that is really Mizukami levels of unmistakable both from the manga and anime standpoint, though Part 1 of 2 here of the Reformed Siblings Arc that covers the manga\'s first 6 volumes of 35 chapters worth, it does take some time to get used to, especially if this is your first time watching a Satoshi Mizukami show or have been burnt by Hoshi no Samidare a.k.a Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer, and wanted an exoneration in his name in the animation department. Well, we finally got that treatment.Well, well, look who\'s back. I did not expect to see the famous Re:Zero studio come back from the grave, especially since the studio\'s massive undertaking to complete another season of the Utawarerumono series. Taking a year apart to get back to the Re:Zero groove coming back this Fall, studio White Fox may have an episode of their fall from grace, but that doesn\'t NOT give us a chance to praise their ever-so-consistent production, even if this is kind of a re-start for the studio before the famed series will take up most of their time, leaving the 2nd part of the show after Season 3 (which I\'m totally fine with). Finally, Satoshi Mizukami gets the name recognition along with good production values to boot from White Fox, albeit with director Kagetsu Aizawa who had a misstep with 2018\'s Hakyuu Houshin Engi modern reboot.The OST by Evan Call, really helps liven up the atmosphere of the show greatly, even if the show does kinda wobble from time to time. Still though, that does not stop the theme songs from being great songs, of which MindaRyn has a song that I finally can say that her OP song ""Hibana"" is her best Anisong thus far. KEIKO\'s ED song does the job following the show\'s historical and mythical fantasy, which is great since it\'s famed composer Yuki Kaijura, showing that her craft is still unmatched.Despite all the praise I can really give about Sengoku Youko as a whole, the story unfortunately is still the weakest link tying everything together, and it will not be until it\'s latter part of the double-length, 24 episode-long Senma Konton-hen a.k.a Thousand Demons Chaos Arc, is shown that has the story explode in terms of mythical lore. Again, I can only judge the show by its completion one-third of the way, which is decent overall.Still though, this is your best chance to experience a new Satoshi Mizukami anime, and trust me, things in the future will look better once Part 2: The Thousand Demons Arc arrives later in Summer...just not now, not yet. to the rather lukewarm adaptation of Fall 2018\'s Planet With (which J.C. Staff did decent where the ""original"" anime came first before the manga\'s release), and the abomination that was Summer-Fall 2022\'s Hoshi no Samidare a.k.a Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer (which the anime was the series\'s biggest sin by way of poor and lackluster production values), the anime counterpart definitely needed a lot, and I mean, A LOT of time in the oven to cook.All of this, leads us to the other ironic side of the coin, which is this Winter\'s season\'s Sengoku Youko, which covers the 1st part of the manga: the Yonaoshi Kyoudai-hen a.k.a World Reform Siblings Arc through the first 13 of its intended 37-episode series for a ""complete"" split 3-cour season. And for an interesting fact (if you want the TL;DR critique) of the show in general: Sengoku Youko is Satoshi Mizukami\'s weakest work, but given the most competent AniManga adaptation thus far from a near-far-gone, returning renowned studio.In Sengoku Youko\'s fantasy world, there exists 2 factions of creatures: ordinary human beings, or monsters in the form of Katawara, experimental beings who are laden with power. The latter is true for a girl named Tama Youko (yes, which literally means fox), whose only goal is to like Jesus Christ (if he was not a human), correct the people in their evil and sinful ways and guide them back on the proper path of goodness and justice. However, what is said truer to her, doesn\'t apply to her brother Jinka, who is a human, and still hates humans in both bone and flesh, with his grudges unknown. Their journey to reform the world is met by Shinsuke Hyoudou, who\'s a samurai, but a coward by the main fact, who vows to become stronger to protect his loved ones. Together, the trio may have their separate ambitions, but the goal is one and the same to explore and reform the world as they deem fit. But enemies stand in their way, not to mention ruthless, and a ploy to experiment on humans and transform them into the aforementioned Katawara creatures, set them onto a path where dangers lurk at every corner, fighting against people that will give them quite the challenge on the road to purification.At first, the trio are faced by the Dangaisyuu: a group of monks who\'re just as they look, innocent monks. But its leader, Yazen, is one that has a quench of power, and the people that serve him, serve the Katawara side of the community on their path towards evil, so much that they have power unabashed to trample on their opponents with much katawara power. But then again, this is the sibling duo of Tama and Jinka they\'re facing against, and the trick about them is that while Jinka is the human, Tama is the Katawara source which provides him powers to be transformed into a powerful Katawara, much like Tama\'s namesake of being a Youko to give Jinka fox powers, which the more tails, the more powerful Jinka is.

Should it be higher or lower? In my opinion, it's exactly right.STORY: 6 (Fine)/10I was about to put a higher rating - but the story is quite basic until the end. My main problem with this show, something that holds it back from an 8 or even a 9, is the first few episdoes. I almost dropped the show - twice - because of it's incredibly dull start. The progress is very slow and nothing very interesting...happens until around episode seven. The reason my rating is 6 is because it's quite a simplistic story, and lots of it is setup. However, I think that the second season (and I believe third, which will come out if the next season does well enough) will be much better, getting that 8 or 9 I mentioned.ART: 8 (Very Good)/10The artstyle of this show is my favourite - with lines and borders of various thickness and great shading, so it might just be my opinion, but I thought it was great. The coreography was pretty good but the moves themselves were not half bad, and the transformations were beautiful. It definitely adds to the vibe of the show and fits the setting.SOUND: 6 (Fine)/10I might go back and change most of my 7s on sound to 6, because I am yet to see a cast that sticks out as particularly bad, let alone below average. For the original sound track, I enjoyed the music played during the show, but as for the OP and ED, I think they were just average, but I have seen a handful of reviews describing each as a masterpiece, particularly the opening.CHARACTER: 7 (Good)/10The characters were like the story, but slightly better - they start out appearing quite basic, but they get more interesting and complex as the show progresses. Once again, my rating is held back by the slow start - so I'm definitely hoping for a good season 2. The character development was definitely good, especially with two characters in particular. I also enjoyed the antagonist because most modern shonen nowadays that I see have antagonists like Shigaraki and Sukuna, forces of chaos and destruction. In Sengoku Youko, the characters remind me of the World Government in One Piece or the (if you've watched, you'll know, this is a twist so I won't say it) of FMA - most of them believe they are fighting for good, but on the inside, they are corrupt and even experimenting on humans.ENJOYMENT: 7 (Good)/10Here, I will use the expression 'high highs and low lows' because that's pretty much sums up this show. To mentally illustrate it, if it was a graph, it would rise slowly, shoot up a bit around episode 7 and then rise slowly again. I did enjoy this show a lot, particularly the fights and episodes 7-10, but I also think the first 6 episodes really drag this down.I reccomend this show, especialy since you no longer have to watch the boring start over 6 weeks, and can breeze past it in a day or two.

Speaking as someone who has read Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer, it certainly hasn\'t hit as hard as that series did, but it\'s planted opportunities to do a great deal more.It\'s not so much that the series is slow, but rather that it lacked an identity beyond its worldbuilding and basic establishment of its core cast. From there, it just became a series of fights that slowly built on those identities before a couple of big moments started to shift the momentum. The series has been...slow to become more dynamic as it builds things out from a basic ""let\'s fight a new powerful opponent"" as a template for most episodes and has started to introduce the larger issues in the world surrounding them and how each character relates to them. I can\'t say any of the characters have been terribly investing so far, but they\'ve given them enough building blocks to make them worth following.This is a long series, slated for 37 episodes in total with these 13 episodes comprising the first arc and the remaining 24 comprising the second. Moving slowly to create an investing narrative in order to build out the world and establish the characters is fine by me if there is certainty that there\'s going to be more, and based on that ending, there\'s a lot to expect. I\'m cautiously optimistic, especially as we\'ve seen some admittedly abbreviated character arcs play out over the course of the series so far. I can\'t say any of the characters have really grabbed me yet, and though there\'s some interesting worldbuilding, it seems minimal so far, largely kept as background noise while the series focuses on the central characters. That\'s not bad, but it does mean that the second season needs to go pretty hard to make this series more than just a good time. slow to become more dynamic as it builds things out from a basic ""let\'s fight a new powerful opponent"" as a template for most episodes and has started to introduce the larger issues in the world surrounding them and how each character relates to them.

This movie acknowledges that this isn\'t as easy as it sounds.Dreams Stars was an experimental crossover movie, featuring only the three newest Precure teams. Perhaps the lack of spectacle is why it scored so low. Nevertheless, I actually found this new concept quite enjoyable, as it gave the characters more space to interact. Another thing to consider is that this movie caters primarily to younger viewers, so the characters occasionally break the fourth wall. However, I didn\'t think it felt out of place. The movie is also partly animated in 3D,...which may turn some people off. I really liked the 2D animation style with thicker outlines, and the CGI, while a little choppy, actually looked pretty good.The story wasn\'t ground-breaking but still engaging, and the pacing was really good, in my opinion. It was fun to watch the Kirakira cures travel to different realms and meet their seniors. This movie actually made Ichika more likeable in my eyes, as she was quite mature and helped Sakura grow. Sakura was also a more fleshed-out character than I expected. I suppose the only downside was the main villain, who was more of a comic relief, so Samidare had to pick up the slack. The monsters were quite strong, though, and I enjoyed most of the action scenes. Last but not least, I really liked the aesthetic of this movie, Sakura\'s world, and the music.I can recommend Dreams Stars to any fan of the seasons from 2015 to 2017.

Rental Magica,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2369/Rental_Magica,"[""Rental Magica is a bit of an odd anime. It's mainly a series of one shot episodes relating the exploits of Iba Itsuki, the 2nd president of Astral, and his various employees as they combat evil spirits, demons, rogue mages, magical pollution, etc.What makes the show a bit odd is the fact that it initially can't decide if it wants to be a combat anime, or a highschool romance, a purely supernatural thriller, or a comedy. It literally has a bit of all those genres. Because of this, many people may be put off watching the show after a few episodes. Bear with it...though, as it does get progressively better.The story in itself, as explained already, is mainly a series of one shot episodes. There is, however, an underlying story which is hinted at throughout most of the series, and becomes clearer towards the end (which is why I said bear with it).The art and animation in the show is generally quite good. The characters and backgrounds are generally very well done, and the majority of spirits/demons/etc, are very well depicted. The combat scenes are very well animated and should satisfy most people.The sound is also well done. The opening theme is a catchy J-rock song which has become a favourite of mine (both in japanese and english). The sound effects and atmospheric music are generally good throughout the series.The characters are reasonably well realised. The characters of Itsuki, Honami and Adelicia are generally quite good, and an effort has been made to focus on specific characters in several episodes scattered throughout the series. This helps to round out the characters afair amount, but otherwise there is no real effort to develop the characters more - but then again, this type of anime doesn't really need character development.I'm a bit of a fan of episodic animes (Mushi-shi, Aria, Mokke, Ghost Hunt, to name a few), so watching Rental Magica was an enjoyable experience for me as I didn't expect any distinct plot to appear. I also liked the fact that this show highlights one thing that is commonly left out of other &quot;magic&quot; based shows - the rules.I'll explain. Astral is an organisation made up of practitioners of various forms of magic (Celtic Witchcraft, Shinto, Onmyoudou, etc - they even have a ghost working for them). Astral isn't the only magical organisation though, as there are numerous others (Goetia - the descendents of Solomon, is the most notable). All of these organisations are governed by a mysterious organisation simply called &quot;The Association&quot;, who enforce the rules regarding the use of magic. Certain acts are considered taboo, and the show covers some of these very well.The other side of the &quot;rules&quot; coin are the rules governing a particular form of magic. The show very clearly highlights the differences in the various forms of magic used, and also covers some of the dangers of misuse or breaking one of the taboos. This is what really sets the show apart, as it is one of the few shows that covers the technical side of magic, and it covers it quite well. The creators of the show went to a lot of effort researching the various forms of magic in an effort to make the various rituals as accurate as they could, and for me at least, the effort paid off.The only thing I didn't like about the show was the character of Itsuki Iba, as I found him to be a bit too shy/reticent/cowardly/etc. This is supposedly balanced by his alter ego (when he removes his eyepatch), but initially the difference didn't sit well with me as I kept wanting to punch him in the face (I should point out that he does improve later in the series though).This isn't a straightforward combat anime. Nor is it a truly supernatural thriller. It most definitely is not a horror, although some of the uses of magic in the show can be called horrific. It's a complicated mixture of several genres which may, or may not, sit well with most people, depending on your preference.If you like coherent, sensible storylines with good plot and character development then you may not enjoy this (doesn't hurt to give it a try though). If you're after thrills, action, chases, etc, then you may not enjoy this either.If you're after an enjoyable anime that isn't too serious, and is sometimes a bit tongue-in-cheek with it's humour, then you may actually like this show.I can think of worse ways to spend half an hour. though, as it does get progressively better.The story in itself, as explained already, is mainly a series of one shot episodes. There is, however, an underlying story which is hinted at throughout most of the series, and becomes clearer towards the end (which is why I said bear with it).The art and animation in the show is generally quite good. The characters and backgrounds are generally very well done, and the majority of spirits/demons/etc, are very well depicted. The combat scenes are very well animated and should satisfy most people.The sound is also well done. The opening theme is a catchy J-rock song which has become a favourite of mine (both in japanese and english). The sound effects and atmospheric music are generally good throughout the series.The characters are reasonably well realised. The characters of Itsuki, Honami and Adelicia are generally quite good, and an effort has been made to focus on specific characters in several episodes scattered throughout the series.

Overall, I had to drop this series because it was so unpleasant to watch. If you're really into Harry Potter, then I guess you could love this series though. "", 'Although this was a great series, there is much to criticize about. For one, the chief character, Itsuki, does nominal developing, and is not once thought of as &ldquo;Most Powerful&rdquo; as you would anticipate from other series&rsquo;. Instead, the series relies on the supporting characters for that feeling of triumph over the opponent. Also, the series talks much about the preceding generation of Astral mages, but not once decides to go into detail about it, which is not a good plot hole in my outlook.  On top of that, it takes about half of the entire series to start getting the true experience of...the story.

I have a lot to say about this anime and I\'m having a hard time deciding where to begin.Well it seems only fitting to start at the one thing that makes this anime stand out for me above all animes in its category, the magic. Generally anime magic is much like, well anything else animes use, as powerful and versatile as the writers want it to be. However this anime has the best magic in any anime I\'ve ever seen. The magic just seems so real, the way they use it the way they talk about it,...even just how each magic seems to have its own set of rules and limitations. Now in you may be thinking that the magic in this can\'t compare to the magic in say Fairy Tail. However, while it certainly does have a significantly larger stock of both magic and magic users, I often found myself feeling like the creators of Fairy Tail to be using ""magic"" in place of the word ""power."" In Rental Magica, the magica is much more defined, from beginning to end, and there\'s never a moment where you think, ""why didn\'t he do that earlier?"" or ""if she could do that all along why\'d they have trouble with the cannon fodder from earlier?"" But I digress.Next is the main character. For me this is the sort of main character I love, he\'s intelligent (mostly) friendly, and wants to be helpful, as well as having the power to basically be the strongest member of the group (but as to not spoil anything I won\'t go into detail). The people around him all can more than fend for themselves but he often finds himself feeling like he\'s relying on them to save him.This anime has a lot to offer and is something that i feel like everyone should give a chance. its a great anime that I can watch a dozen times, that\'s why its my fourth favorite anime. even just how each magic seems to have its own set of rules and limitations.

The story is shallow and messy, with weak animation for its battle scenes, and the characters are as flat as a deflated balloon.StoryThe story is so incoherent. That\'s the only way I can describe it. I have come across animes with messy, borderline incoherent story-telling. But this is on another level, not only is the story-telling rocky, the concept on a whole is not even clear. The episodes were originally aired in a non-linear pattern, where the First episode is the Sixth in chronological...order. And whichever way you choose to watch it, whether is using the chronological episode numbers, or the broadcasted jumbled pattern, both ways don\'t make the show any better. Maybe the novel tells the story better, but the anime really did not tell any sort of story. The different magics weren\'t explained, the state/ rules of the world weren\'t properly established, the storylines were all vague. The romance genre in here is at best, surface value, the storylines on the romance element were just there as a convenient way for the characters to interact with each other to increase the dynamics between them, there is no real substance in their interactions. The ""mystery"" element is just a poor by-product of not having the characters\' backstory smoothly relate to the current events, and not having establish the characters\' power/magic/capabilities and throwing them straight into battles with suspense music. The events that happens in the anime just seemed to happen with no reasonable cause. This makes the story very shallow. There is potential in the story, but the anime really disappoint in not bringing out even the bare minimum.ArtThe character designs are interesting and very fitting to their personas. Basically the art quality and design is not bad in this anime, including the backgrounds, there is nothing much to dislike. But the animation of the battle scenes really lowered the overall art score for me. For a show that is basically based on battle scenarios to move the plot and grow the characters, the battle scenes really are too weak. The movements are not smooth, the crossfires are underwhelmingly portrayed (is like they are depending only on the sound effects to bring about the intensity of the fights), and the characters are seemingly just standing still when the scenes focus on them.SoundThe sound score is highest as I am also acknowledging the VAs work. The sound effect is above average. While the opening and ending themes are average at best.CharacterThe characters are like empty Kinder Bueno Surprise Egg chocolate. You will expect some sort of surprise, whether is good or bad, but turns out, is empty. The characters started out with very vague personas, and yet could still fail to develop into a reasonable, story contributing character. The growth of the characters are forced, and more dialogue based than actions. And even after such forced development, the story doesn\'t use them effectively, is like a mental note to the audience that the characters have changed, but the changed characters won\'t be acting any different from before their changed. The character development is so superficial, is insulting.I honestly can say a lot more on how disappointing the characters are, but I shall stop, for reasons like, I am tired. I will at least have to say that, the characters really had way more potential than the story itself. order.

It hits differently for different people, so it\'s hard to give it an unqualified recommendation in light of that, but it\'s not so deeply flawed that its various issues are going to be universally hated either.The series is at its strongest when it decides to just be a straightforward action story. The action is well-animated (if you can find a version with decent video quality in 2022), the...monsters are well-designed and the battles have a good sense of natural progression, where they deal with larger and larger threats over time, using their experience from previous fights to overcome them. They also do a good job of handling the power of our main protagonist, Itsuki. In a lesser series, he would be ridiculously overpowered and his near-invincibility would suck all the drama out of the big action setpieces, but they do an effective job of placing limits on him to preserve that sense of tension without making it feel like that\'s what they\'re doing.Unfortunately, Itsuki\'s power is pretty cringey (he takes off his chuuni eyepatch and can instantly see the exact way to defeat any enemy, and issues commands to his team in a very deep voice that contrasts hilariously with his usual Whiny Nerd speaking voice), but that\'s anime for you.  The larger problem though is that it makes for not-very-compelling action once he gets involved. Seeing Honami throwing mistletoe darts and Nekoyashiki using his always-entertaining Cat Magic is fun, but it becomes substantially less fun when it\'s preceded by a guy doing a bad Lelouch impersonation and reciting the exact list of actions he wants them to take. Hearing a sequence of commands like ""Honami, fire your mistletoe 44 degrees to the right and 12 degrees up"" rattled off one after another feels like reading off of a spreadsheet or something, which is not the way you want your action scenes to climax.When it\'s not building towards an action scene, things become even more hit-or-miss. The characters are mostly pretty good, and I like all of them for different reasons in isolation, but the romcom antics are frequently exasperating. The female leads, Honami and Adelicia, are the primary culprits here, their bickering over who Itsuki likes more is incredibly obnoxious every single time it comes up. It feels very undignified coming from two characters that mostly have their shit together in all other areas of life and doesn\'t really fit well with the fabric of the rest of the show.  Itsuki himself is also too pathetic and cowardly at times. Those issues aside though, the characters are solid overall and the roster of Villains With Pretty Reasonable Motives is actually better than most shows of its type.Finally, one last issue that bothered me was the lack of continuity. If you aren\'t already aware, the episodes of this series are intentionally out of order chronologically, and there is no apparent purpose to it other than a thinly-disguised attempt to capitalize on the success of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, which aired the year before. Since most of the episodes are standalone rather than telling a single, serialized story throughout the season, you frequently don\'t even notice that it freely jumps up and down the timeline, and they make no effort to help the viewer orient themselves to ""when"" an episode is taking place. It\'s an aggravating way to watch, as character relationships feel like they\'ve regressed or skipped steps from one episode to another, and sometimes characters simply aren\'t present because they haven\'t been introduced yet in the objective timeline. For example, Kuroha appears in episodes 1-3 as a regular member of Astral, while episode 4 resets everything to before she had joined and was just meeting Itsuki for the first time, which is about the most confusing way you could possibly present her introduction to the cast. Most of the time it isn\'t that big of a deal because the case-of-the-week structure often makes it irrelevant when a story is taking place in relation to others, but it\'s just weird and unnecessary. monsters are well-designed and the battles have a good sense of natural progression, where they deal with larger and larger threats over time, using their experience from previous fights to overcome them. They also do a good job of handling the power of our main protagonist, Itsuki.

It feels very undignified coming from two characters that mostly have their shit together in all other areas of life and doesn\'t really fit well with the fabric of the rest of the show.  Itsuki himself is also too pathetic and cowardly at times. Those issues aside though, the characters are solid overall and the roster of Villains With Pretty Reasonable Motives is actually better than most shows of its type.Finally, one last issue that bothered me was the lack of continuity. If you aren\'t already aware, the episodes of this series are intentionally out of order chronologically, and there is no apparent purpose to it other than a thinly-disguised attempt to capitalize on the success of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, which aired the year before. Since most of the episodes are standalone rather than telling a single, serialized story throughout the season, you frequently don\'t even notice that it freely jumps up and down the timeline, and they make no effort to help the viewer orient themselves to ""when"" an episode is taking place. It\'s an aggravating way to watch, as character relationships feel like they\'ve regressed or skipped steps from one episode to another, and sometimes characters simply aren\'t present because they haven\'t been introduced yet in the objective timeline. For example, Kuroha appears in episodes 1-3 as a regular member of Astral, while episode 4 resets everything to before she had joined and was just meeting Itsuki for the first time, which is about the most confusing way you could possibly present her introduction to the cast. Most of the time it isn\'t that big of a deal because the case-of-the-week structure often makes it irrelevant when a story is taking place in relation to others, but it\'s just weird and unnecessary.', 'Came after watching a reels on it. I gotta stop thinking that every mc with eye powers is like gojo.The amount of shit the main character is made of and comes out from his mouth is unbearable. FUKIN good for nothing and makes every job hard for other characters. Everything would have gone smooth if the mc didn\'t existed. The mage girl is alone enough lol.The anime storytelling is fuked up.Nothing is explained well. just don\'t watch it unless you want to see a bland mc with no powers but always says ""he will save every girl 🤡"".Lol there\'s nothing to talk about more...so added thisDue to his father\'s disappearance, Itsuki Iba has to take over the family business: a magician dispatch service. Their family employs countless magicians and other supernatural beings in order to send them out to help those who need magical assistance. As a leader, Itsuki now has to be tough, commanding, and reliable, but there\'s one problem, he\'s a coward. Also, in order to run a successful business, he must connect with his employees, which is more difficult than it seems due to his personality. But not only does he have to deal with his own employees, he also has to deal with those who threaten the family business. so added thisDue to his father\'s disappearance, Itsuki Iba has to take over the family business: a magician dispatch service.

Tottoko Hamtarou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/508/Tottoko_Hamtarou,"[""Ahh, Hamtaro. Where do I begin? The epic tales of little hamsters and their trials and tribulations in a big world. This series is absolutely irresistible. I first started watching it with my little sister because of the cute hamsters but soon got pulled into the simple, childish world.Bear in mind that this is a series primarily aimed towards children and is being rated as such. However, I found the series enjoyable on many levels, from the rivalries between the hamsters for their loves and the various friendships and relationships that invariably develop with such a large cast of characters.The animation and music...are both top notch, the Hamsters are beautifully drawn and fit nicely into a colorful suburban world. The music is fun and silly and you'll find yourself humming along. It's all very upbeat, bright and happy.Story wise, it's a slice of life anime, concerning both the hamsters and their owners; the children of the neighborhood. It is episodic in nature but never repetitive or slow. Each episode jumps back and forth between the main character, Hamtaro, and his owner, often going through very similar situations on different scales. There are always new adventures, new problems to solve, misunderstandings to clear and new hamsters to meet. Every episode oozes charm and offers not only plenty of slapstick humor but also that of a more subtle kind. You can see how each hamster's personality reflects their owners, and get glimpses into their lives. Boss blushes furiously every time his crush looks in his direction and explodes in anger whenever anyone else gives her any attention. Another two hamsters have a permanent rivalry over their shared beloved. Their antics kept me chuckling every episode. With such a huge and varied cast of characters, someone is sure to catch your eye. Each one bursts with life and fun.So, in summary, it's a highly enjoyable series, great for watching with a younger sibling or child as a safe introduction to the world of anime. Or even just for laughs and eye candy. It's not moralistic, but has plenty of good messages; friendship, kindness, believing in yourself. It's upbeat, fun and never petty or mean as many children's shows are these days. Highly recommended, check it out! are both top notch, the Hamsters are beautifully drawn and fit nicely into a colorful suburban world.

Where did you go?Let me begin my review by acknowledging (and hopefully resisting) a little bit of bias. Hamtaro was the very first anime series I ever saw. I started watching it when it was still airing on Cartoon Network in 2001; I was only three years old, so I suppose it's understandable that I fell in love with it. I don't feel like I should list myself as having watched any episodes, since I don't remember any of them in particular, but for many years, Hamtaro was my life. I would try to get up early every morning so I could...watch it in the 6:30 slot before preschool.I only just discovered, today actually, that after the dub ended in 2002, the series kept running in its native Japan until 2006, and I am here to tell you that if I had known that, I would have gotten into subbed anime much sooner. Hamtaro, as a whole, is a beautiful series, in so many different ways.The story and character get a perfect ten from me for obvious reasons. Hamtaro brought out liveliness, kindness, adventure, and even childlike romance, all things a children's series tries to have, and it blew those topics out of the water. Not only is the title character courageous and adventurous, he's a bit naive, which makes him even more adorable.Art and sound...not quite so perfect, but understandable given the target audience. Children are going to love this series whether it looks like a hundred-million-dollar budget movie or not.Enjoyment? I believe I already acknowledged that area.The overall score is what it should be, in my opinion. Hamtaro is what every child longs for in a television series, and Ritsuko Kawai delivered. You don't see many anime series that live on ten years after they end, but yet, here we are today. At the time of writing, I am already making plans to get back into this series almost fifteen years after the last time I saw it.Tottoko Hamtarou, you gave me my childhood.

I'm a fan boy!But my review is honestly what I think this series deserves--it is a perfect mix of everything anime is suppose to be. There is a bit of everything from time to time: romance, action, humour, suspense, seriousness, etc.The series is most enjoyable in the original form (Tottoko Hamutaro) as I find the voice acting much better, and the sound EXTREMELY better. It has, by far, the BEST OST soundtrack of any anime I've ever heard, surpassing the likes of One Piece by a mile.Where it does fall short, unfortunately, is the story. At times the childishness of the...series really comes through and that will ruin it for some people. As well, some things just don't make much sense.But if you love furry little creatures, and love it even more when they're personified, then you really need to start watching Hamtaro / Tottoko Hamutaro. series really comes through and that will ruin it for some people.

Waccha PriMagi!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49285/Waccha_PriMagi,"[""It's rare that a show is able to completely hook me in from the start but that's what Waccha PriMagi was able to do. With charismatic characters, good comedy, and hints in the background for a deeper plot, it seemed like Waccha was prepared to use its time well and create a stellar show. And in the end Waccha was able to live up to that potential and ended up being one of my favorite shows.Waccha's characters excel in both being fun characters to watch on screen and as being deep and interesting characters that grow throughout the show. The issues that the main characters...each have are developed and tackled well. The show being four cours allows each of these issues to be explored through out the span of the series, which gives both a lot of nuance and development to these aspects of the characters, but also gives them a more meaningful and realistic development as they are approached through out the show rather than covered for an episode and then forgotten about. All the while the episodes that focus on these various issues work really well, and provide a lot of good viewing experiences. A good example of this is Miruki. When she's introduced she is presented as a selfish idol, only looking out for herself. But as the show goes on and she gets more screen time more of her personality shines through including a lot of the unique characteristics that drive who she is and the outlook that she has. This development and characterization does a great job of making her feel very real and admirable despite the negative qualities that she has. It also does a good job of showing the viewer why some of her negative qualities are there, and gives a great nuanced picture of her.The character's charisma are all top notch too. The characters have fun personalities without feeling overly gimmicky or shallow. The interactions between them as well as very fun to watch, as they can bounce off of each other in great ways. The mascots in particular have a lot of great chemistry together. It's always fun to see Myamu and Chimumu bicker with each other as the two's silliness play off well against each other. It's also nice to see bonds like Matsuri's and Hina's where Hina can both be a mentor to Matsuri that helps her get experience and suck into the PriMagi, but also can be a sort of rival at the same time. Each of the various characters between the cast are able to have strong bonds with each other and provide something in their interactions with different characters. The cast is just really fun and likeable. Each of the characters is pretty much able to carry an episode on their own and utilize their unique charm to make the episode fun.The plot also developed well. The hints that they dropped at the beginning towards conflict in the background where explored later and even brought out a strong theme on the role of technology versus the power of magic when it comes to idol performances and other entertainment like it. Waccha was able to tackle these ideas in various ways with different character's relations to the main theme, without making it overly focused on these thematic ideas. It was able to do this by having these ideas be central to various character's development and plot. They fit into the puzzle pieces the Waccha created itself with and paired well with the natural development and character based issues that the characters were dealing with.At the end of the day, I really loved this show. It was the show that I looked forward to the most for the past year, with characters that I absolutely loved seeing on screen. Episode after episode Waccha was able to provide a whole bunch of entertainment and enjoyment. The cast has been one of my absolute favorites and ultimately it's hard to say anything but I love this show. It was a great time watching it, and there were so many heartfelt and resonating moments from it that I really enjoyed. It basically fulfilled all that I was hoping for at the beginning. So I'd easily recommend others to watch it. It's really good. I wish I could talk at length about all the specifics I enjoyed about it but I wanted to keep this spoiler free and give an overview. I hope this was fine enough. Personally though I loved the show, and I hope you all enjoy it too.

I was recommended this anime by a fellow stranger on the internet and was drawn into its art style and cheerfulness that the show appeared to have. And I was honestly very surprised to see how good this show really is so far!STORY:The story is great. It's easy to understand, and I like how light-hearted it can be at times. The way the idols were introduced were definitely not slow-paced (ones that take an entire...episode on the buildup), and in my opinion, it was perfect just for me, although I am aware this is not everyone's cup of tea.ART:The art is one of the only things that bought me to watch this, and it was impressive. If you do not like any other aspects, you will likely find the art style and consistency to appeal to you, but everyone has a different taste in art. and that is perfectly fine. However, I enjoyed the consistency of the animation, and how Myamu's over-designed dress never had a single animation error, or at least I did not notice one. One thing I did like was how before the performances for the daily song, the characters would be in 2D backstage, and the characters still did not look messy even with the complicated dress designs!The 3D CGI was not bad as well compared to other idol anime CG. I mean, if you take a look at Aikatsu, you will see the difference. But personally, I preferred 2D over 3D.SOUND:This was one of the only animes in which I never hated a single song. The Opening was very good, as well as the ending. I could not stop listening to the ED as soon as I finished Episode one, and in fact, I just listened to it again and again a few hours ago.The songs by the idols were incredible. The only complaint that I have is the repetition of the songs, and how Matsuri's main song was used every time she appeared, with only a different outfit to attempt to compensate, but it did not change a thing. Though I am only 10 episodes through, I hope they are not that lazy.CHARACTER:I loved the characters. I would say Matsuri had a good amoutn of development (you get to see her family), and Myamu had good development with her grandfather (no spoilers). Although, so far, I have not seen any development with the rest of the characters, such as their families and home lives..ENJOYMENT:Overall, I enjoyed this anime very much.

So take what I have to say with a grain of salt.  I do know the reasoning behind this franchise which is to sell Japanese girls cheap merch that is on par with the merch Japanese boys get pushed with in regards to Kamen Rider and Super Sentai.  There's the hugely popular arcade game(mainly with older people, not kidding you) that is aimed towards girls.Story 6:  Where I'm at currently which is 11...of the 13 episodes current available as I write this, the story is just setting up for the first main the FreshFest and it's been pretty episodic with the story just setting up who characters are as a whole.  At min I'm guessing this is to be a 50+ series so it's going to take time for the actual story to go anywhere.  As is right now? It's fine enough, nothing really unique they do but execute it in a good enough way.Art 8: What really did me in for PirPara and why I never got past the first 38 ep was honestly the art.  PriMagi moved a bit back towards the Rainbow Live art, not sure how previous entries were but that was more of what I find pleasing at least.  It's like they made a compromise between Rainbow Lives style and PriPara's style and it honestly comes out nice I think.Sound 7: This is where I'm going to be more generous than most on this.  I had initially picked up this franchise to fill the void of Aikatsu that was left when the poor excuse of a series Aikatsu Planet came to be.  All of Aikatsu used a good amount of reusing songs(early series were a bit more varied but still), then Rainbow Live and the first 38 ep of PriPara were no different.  When almost all episodes in a 50+ ep series airs it's expect to be this amount of repetition to be honest.  Trying to compare it to something that is 13 like Love Live Superstar(didn't watch) and Selection Project(did watch) is pretty stupid.  SP had 5 or maybe 6 total songs in 13, LL not sure but probably par for course based off the first 2 series.  Out of all the songs we've heard from the cast so far I've only disliked 1 and hope they do add more song variety in the near future.Character 7.5: I'd say the most contentious character of them all is Myamu.  Always the ADHD ridden character in this type of franchise and Myamu is this one.  Less grating some of the Precure characters we've had with this personality but still.  Outside of that all the other characters so far that are key figures have been great.  Slow on the growth but it's steady growth we see within the cast realizing they've been too lazy about PriMagi and slowly getting more serious or the seriousness of another and seeing how far she's willing to go.Overall 7.5:  Too early at the moment to tell if I'll continue to like the series or not but so far I have as I've watched 11/13 available ep so far.  Tempering your expectations is something one must do with this franchise as it's here to sell Japanese girls on merch and a money wasting arcade game but for what it is this entry is enjoyable without all that too. of the 13 episodes current available as I write this, the story is just setting up for the first main the FreshFest and it's been pretty episodic with the story just setting up who characters are as a whole.

Wan Jie Du Zun 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/52765/Wan_Jie_Du_Zun_2nd_Season,"['The first season was okay, but this season is too much adventure, as we really see main story continuation. The main protagonist is just buffing like a god, and they are introducing someone as Villan who is lower than him but stronger, but no matter what, the protagonist always wins. The worst part is that they forgot about the first season story and the romance and revenge part, which was the main interest of this series. Artwork isnt good either need to improve a lot and the expression of the character is also too shabby you always get to see melodrama. ']"

I personally found the ending to be very satisfactory and bittersweet and it left me wanting for a bit more.

Wonderful Days,https://myanimelist.net/anime/548/Wonderful_Days,"[""At first I was afraid this was going to be like Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within - a big let down, but I was pleasantly surprised by this high quality Korean animated feature.Like both the Final Fantasy installments, which this is so reminiscent of, Wonderful Days takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where a group of humans are fighting for a better tomorrow - their wonderful days.  One can tell that the plot is not a major aspect of the movie; there is very little background on the present events and little or no clarification of what is what.  But that's...not important.The characters, too, are unexplored and their personalities have little significance.  There is no motivation for their actions and random switches in beliefs.  It's like a mega chameleon fest, where none of them know what their true colours are.  Poor character development.  But then again they're not important.What drives this anime, and the reason why I give it an 8 after all it's shortcomings, is the absolutely brilliant animation and sound.  To really enjoy this, you need to watch a good quality version of the movie.  The cell-shading/CG artwork was fantastic and played its part perfectly in describing the darkness of post apocalyptic earth.  I never thought cinematography was important for anime, but by god was it well done.  Some of the &quot;shots&quot; coupled with some excellent music brought out the emotion which the 1-D characters could not provide.  It is like watching Monet paint.  Maybe that's a bit too much, but you get the idea.If you're planning on watching this, don't go in expecting something extraordinary, it's nothing brilliant.  But it was certainly enjoyable, if not interesting to see what the Korean animation industry is capable of.

I’m so disappointed in this movieThe reviews were really positive, the plot seemed really interesting and the cover of the anime looked awesome.It was also recommended with the Final fantasy advent children which I really like. I’m sorry to say that I really can’t find what’s similar with these two. And I think that the person who recomended Final fantasy advent children with this anime, needs to...rewatch Final fantasy advent children.Anyway, the characters were really flat and didn’t feel realistic at all. The art is decent, but not very good.

As it only was like 4$ I thought I’d buy it. I didn’t really expect anything from it, since it was Korean and all, but I was pleasantly surprised..[5]Story: The story had potential, and had this been a series with at least 12 episodes I think it would have been really good. But as it stands we only have a movie and the 1.5 hours of playtime is not nearly enough to explore the desolated world we are introduced to in ‘Wonderful Days’. If you want to know...the premise of the show, just read the Synopsis here on MAL, no need for me to go through it here. There really isn’t anything more to say about the plot. If you liked the premise you should have no problem watching the show and enjoying it for its other aspects, just don’t expect anything more than the premise..[9]Art: The art is probably the very best thing about this movie, and this is what makes those 1.5 hours of your life worth the watch. It’s especially the backgrounds that amazes me and I think only Makoto Shinkai has done better (of the animes I’ve seen this far). The backgrounds are dark and depressing in tone and they seem very realistic.  I don’t know about you, but I’ve always been a sucker for flashy technology stuff, and this movie is no let down on that department. Flashy computers, elevators and whatnot, everything beautifully animated. Had to use my “drool-bucket” again. The thing that kept this movie from getting a 10 here is the characters. The thing with the characters is that they have a much brighter tone to them than the backgrounds, so they don’t really match up, if you know what I mean. Animations and all were fluid, so no problems there. This may be my personal taste though, and its nothing major anyway, but just thought I’d mention it.[7]Sound: The sound is pretty good, but I’ve heard better. The sound is better than average, but it was only enough to get it up to a 7. I can’t say much about the voice acting really since I watched it in Korean. It just felt very different from Japaneese, and I don’t think I can give a very good opinion about it so I’ll just leave it untouched. I’ll just say though that the voice acting wasn’t disturbing or anything like that, so I guess I can say it wasn’t bad at least.[6] Characters: The characters were much like the story, unexplored. Again I think it’s because of time constraints. Even though the characters doesn’t have any real development you can understand why they are doing what they are doing and so on. This score would have been lower would it not have been for the side characters which I think have some good personalitys that fit the setting of the anime and are appropriate to where the characters live (Ecoban/outside).[7] Enjoyment: I enjoyed this movie quite a bit and I think it was well-worth my time. It’s a shame that such a good storyline was destroyed by time constraints though. All in all this was a pleasant surprise to see what the Koreans can do. If you just need something new, relatively short and artistically awesome, then watch this, you won’t be disappointed. the premise of the show, just read the Synopsis here on MAL, no need for me to go through it here.

I am so disappointed that I didn't like this.Story (3) + Character (3)Just to clarify this: I think the story is a really good idea. But it could have been carried out so much better. I kept on being unable to connect with the different groups and characters, and found myself not really being interested in them. The dialogue is flat and impersonal, and little is done to personify the main characters in any other ways. I am not feeling any sympathy (or any other feelings for that matter) toward the diggers nor the Ecoban people, simply because I don't feel like...I know them or what their lives are like.Now, I have seen several action driven films where the actions scenes by far make up for the lack of character. Wonderful Days is not one of these. Most of the scenes (with a few exceptions) seem to go on for way too long, because there is hardly any content in them. Again – it’s all flat and lifeless.I think that ultimately the plot could have worked really well if it had been given more time to be explored, developed and personified – either in a longer movie or in a series.Art (9)Not much to say here really. It is just wonderful, breathtaking and inventive. I’d recommend the film to people just for the graphics. Even the very obvious difference in animation between people and backgrounds/objects work really well for some reason I can’t figure out.Sound (6)The film music is good and somewhat inventive. However, I feel that any effect gained by the good music is lost due to the slowness and lack of believability in the scenes.I was only able to get a hold of the English dubbed version. Most of the voices work well, but some of the actors are not really that great.Enjoyment (4)I found myself being bored and hoping that the next scene would be better. Because I so desperately wanted the film to work – unfortunately the first scene was the best as far as I’m concerned.In the long run I feel like Wonderful Days is just like one of those pretty girls that think that because they have the looks, no one will notice the lack of personality.

Not that it is entirely bad, I have enjoyed watching it, but if someone asked me what I think about it, “lame” would be a perfect word.Lameness begins with storyline. It is the most generic dystopian future storyline that you could think of.Mankind has split into groups of two: elite, who live in ultra sterile futuristic Eden, and working class who live in the wasteland.While I think it is accurate vision of the future or even depiction of the present day (we already are divided by where we live, where we eat,...relax, etc), I can’t help but find it boring.Boredom begins because now we have very clear distinction of who are the good guys and who are the bad guys. I wish we would see this movie from one side only. Like, if we only saw elite, bad guys and good guys could shown opposite and thus a chance for a nice plot twist.However it is not the case and everything is as predictable as it gets. You know exactly what is going to happen in the end. Maybe not the details, but on the large scale, everything is clear from the very start.Characters are also really lame. I couldn’t care less about any of them, except maybe some secondary guys who are way more sympathetic than the main guys!Main characters are blank, uninspired, generic and boring.Music is … I don’t remember it. It is there, but always somewhere in the background.However there are some positive things I can say about this one: wasteland is really cool, more time and character development in there could have created nice Mad Max atmosphere.Eden invasion was a tribute to Death Star invasion and I always love references and tributes. Too bad I don’t really like Star Wars.Other than that, it is an mediocre sci-fi movie with nice animation, boring characters and decent story line.Some extra points for me wishing to look at the sky more often after watching this.6/10originally written for http://mykkanime.tumblr.com/ relax, etc), I can’t help but find it boring.Boredom begins because now we have very clear distinction of who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.

I would love to see this taken up as a series, which would allow much more development of the characters. There is a relationship between Jay & Cade which doesn’t really get touched on until near the end, when it becomes clear that they are more than just friends. This begs the question of her relationship with Shua. Apparently, he left the city whilst still a small boy, and hasn’t been back for 10 years, yet she recognises...him instantly. I can’t really say any more without real plot spoiling.The graphics and art work are superb! The backgrounds are claimed to be CGI, (Wiki says that they are just processed to look like CG). The characters are traditional animations, and there is some live action rendering as well. The overall look is great.Inside Ecoban we are treated to sweeping panoramas of a vast city complex, with beautiful landscaping and soaring architecture. The Delos Core is portrayed as a technological marvel, with anti gravity lifts and holographic computer memory storage, as big as a small city itself.Outside the city is a landscape of shanty towns, shrouded in perpetual fog, or lashed by the incessant rain.The digger characters are a bit flat and stereotyped, but fit the story line well. Arrogant, hot headed punks, brutish thugs, loud mouthed show-offs, they form the typical cannon fodder of any rebellion. They all come good in the end. I was a bit disappointed that there weren’t any real attempts to show the impact of the disaster on those outside Ecoban.

Scenes of an action don\'t pull suddenness. Probably I yet didn\'t see finer cruelty. The torn-off hands and the raked heads cause only admiration, but not disgust.

A machine failure occurs, and the manager asks the officer to halt all work so the workers will not be harmed. As the officer (non-surprisingly) refuses, the manager threatens with a strike, following the officer kicking him and shooting him for his non-compliance.Characters 6The Characters are pretty basic. A  caring though badass protagonist, the security force is brutal, and there\'s always that one kind-hearted  officer among them. The diggers are the stereotypical ""Ghetto""  people, though they are not very explored. Workers, rioters and criminals, as one would expect from a ghetto full of downtrodden people.The protagonist is pretty developed and his character is revealed pretty quickly, though the characters around him have development that pretty fits an hour long movie.I wouldn\'t say they are too interesting, they are just there to keep the story going.Story 7-8As for the story itself, I\'d give it a 6-ish. It\'s a basic story of rebellion against an elite. What I very liked about it is the pacing and how they build it to come to the climax. For an action movie (which it is not) the pacing is slow, but for a drama it is fitting very well, which is why I give it a 7-8. This is where the characters\' purpose comes in, as they themselves are not all amazing, but they give the story a good ""flow""Graphics 10Nothing to say. Great application of CGI with animation, this movie is beautiful.Soundtrack 9The sound design of the movie is great. The scenes aren\'t packed with ambient sounds to compliment the setting, but keep it natural. The music is employed very well to deliver the mood shown in the scenes.In the English dub some of the voice-acting is pretty mediocre. The protagonists is well depicted, as some other characters, but overall it is not that great.Overall it\'s a 9 for me regarding soundtrack.To sum it all up, it is a great movie in my eyes if you want a chill afternoon or before bed movie. I loved it and do recommend to try it out.It\'s an overall 8.5 for me. they need.The story shoots off explaining exactly that.

Workers, rioters and criminals, as one would expect from a ghetto full of downtrodden people.The protagonist is pretty developed and his character is revealed pretty quickly, though the characters around him have development that pretty fits an hour long movie.I wouldn\'t say they are too interesting, they are just there to keep the story going.Story 7-8As for the story itself, I\'d give it a 6-ish. It\'s a basic story of rebellion against an elite. What I very liked about it is the pacing and how they build it to come to the climax. For an action movie (which it is not) the pacing is slow, but for a drama it is fitting very well, which is why I give it a 7-8. This is where the characters\' purpose comes in, as they themselves are not all amazing, but they give the story a good ""flow""Graphics 10Nothing to say. Great application of CGI with animation, this movie is beautiful.Soundtrack 9The sound design of the movie is great. The scenes aren\'t packed with ambient sounds to compliment the setting, but keep it natural. The music is employed very well to deliver the mood shown in the scenes.In the English dub some of the voice-acting is pretty mediocre. The protagonists is well depicted, as some other characters, but overall it is not that great.Overall it\'s a 9 for me regarding soundtrack.To sum it all up, it is a great movie in my eyes if you want a chill afternoon or before bed movie. I loved it and do recommend to try it out.It\'s an overall 8.5 for me.', ""This is an outstanding anime that mixes diffrent types of animation seamlessly and in a way that makes this movie a smorgasbord for the eyes. The music and the characters are deep, rich and complement eachother perfectly. It's one of the few Sci Fi's that actually succeeds in getting me to belive that it really is set in the future.The minus is that it's a bit slow at times and that the bad guys in the movie is a bit to archehtypicly evil (or free of human emotions).This is wheighed up by the main antagonist and protagonist which actually has a really developed back-story to...explain the choises they makes.To sum it up - a movie with great quality, depth and wonderful settings! explain the choises they makes.To sum it up - a movie with great quality, depth and wonderful settings!"", 'If you are someone who highly values style in an anime, especially in regards to lighting of scenes and the general soundtrack, you\'d likely get more from this movie than I did. I also want to make the disclosure that the DVD I found for this only had EN dub and no subtitles available, so certain issues might be addressed better in the JP original or EN sub.The movie is set in a dystopian world where pollution savaged the Earth and to allow humans to survive, ""ancestors"" designed a living city but barred the majority of survivors from entering it, leading to many thousands of...deaths except for those that were allowed to come in to work as slaves, named ""builders"". It\'s not an overly complicated story but unfortunately that\'s the extent of the story we get about the world. The city doesn\'t have much character or life about it, ironic for a ""living"" city. You might picture something similar to the great living city of Blame! but unfortunately its nothing similar and only serves as a generic set piece a few times with nothing really unique about it.The builders outside of the city also struggle to have an identity, especially when the push was for them to be allowed into the city, but they aren\'t allowed in and instead have to live out in the wasteland, which was what they joined up to be builders to avoid. Since we learn so little about the world outside the 3 main characters, it never drew me in and I had to go check to see if there was source material this was cut down from but it seems to be a wholly original work.Overall lore aside, the current issue is that the city seems to be dying and a rebel citizen is trying to cause it to detonate in an ""energy release"" which we are told will kill most of the citizens of the city. This is very briefly mentioned and then hand-waved away, which does make it quite hard to relate to the rebels who are rather suddenly revealed to be the heroes of the tale. The main character Jay is part of the security team for the city along with a potential love interest Kade who is the commander of security. They form a love triangle with Shua, the rebel who infiltrated the city.Outside of being romantically interested in each other, the three main characters are pretty empty. Jay in particular is worst affected by this because she seems to have very little agency, instead just following Shua from place to place, changing allegiances seemingly on the drop of a hat because she met a boy she had a crush on over a decade before. Kade\'s main purpose is just to be the other side of the love triangle. He has little motivation outside of having feelings for Jay, so much so he\'s willing to backstab people in hopes of her loving him. Shua has the most character but is also the weakest, because the character is a fairly generic anime protagonist. He\'s very capable at everything he does, wins fights fairly easily, is brooding and talks about dying constantly but makes sure to show that he likes helping orphans.Action sequences in the movie are surprisingly weak but that\'s mainly due to how one-sided the fights usually go, with the rebels quite easily gunning down the nameless soldiers. This includes an invasion of the city at the end of the film which goes so easily with only about 7 rebels, I have no idea how the city has kept control over the builders for so long when they claim to have a 100 to 1 advantage in numbers. The gore effects and the animation in the combat can be quite appealing to look at, especially the bar fight and the final confrontation but its rarely exciting or surprising. Probably the worst part is a long sequence of a character entering the city at the end through a glider they specifically built for the mission, seemingly being the only thing stopping them from launching earlier, but after finally making it in, he just bumps into the other rebels who drove their car in without issue. It made the entire glider storyline pointless outside of pretty heavy handed symbolism.The soundtrack was great for the most part even if there was one part of the final fight where I felt that the soft, uplifting, nearly operatic music didn\'t work during a large gunfight.The CGI animation does look dated but the overall production value and presentation of the movie is still great today. It\'s going to be a weird comparison, but a lot of the character design reminded me of the Dead Space animated movies, particularly the first one.Despite the short comings, I\'d recommend it for a watch.

Danball Senki,https://myanimelist.net/anime/7081/Danball_Senki,"[""When I was first getting into anime a few years ago, I developed a bias against the use of CGI in anime. I used to hear anecdotally from other people in the community (and sometimes still do) that CG animation is often used as a cost-cutting measure, and therefore it is bad. I completely agreed with them despite these conversations never really expanding past these handful of talking points. I mean I saw my fair share of poorly composited CG models in 2D environments, so of course CGI in anime seemed bad. But the thing is, I never understood what exactly makes CGI look bad....So when I started watching anime with CGI that I actually thought was pretty good, I felt compelled to look into how CGI is utilized in anime and try to understand why it works in some cases but not in others.What I’m trying to get at is that Danball Senki’s utilization of CGI is amazing and it adds to the experience in a way that wouldn’t be possible within the constraints of 2D animation.If you’re unfamiliar with this anime, Danball Senki adapts a video game series of the same name by Level 5, the studio known for Youkai Watch, Inazuma Eleven, and many other games. It’s about these super powerful toy robots that kids build using model kits and battle each other in ultra-strong cardboard arenas. That’s all the context you really need. When I started watching, I was immediately taken aback by how head-on Danball Senki’s pacing and storytelling is. The only other Level 5 adaptation I had seen up until that point was Youkai Watch, which doesn’t follow its video game counterpart at all and is instead a Doraemon-like episodic gag anime. Comparatively, Danball Senki puts us straight into the action, engaging us with its story almost immediately. What stood out to me the most is Danball Senki’s restraint; it doesn’t feel the need to shove a battle scene into every episode, which seems almost unheard of in game/toy adaptations that aim to market their products first and foremost. Danball actually takes time to develop its story and cast in a way that doesn’t feel forced. While I could go on about Danball Senki’s pacing and storytelling, I’m more interested in dedicating this review to an element that stood out to me the most: the CGI.A common criticism you often hear towards CGI in anime is how it feels out of place, particularly when a 3D model is in a 2D environment. Not only are they two different art styles, but it’s tricky to make a 3D model not stand out in a static 2D environment. However, one of the most defining traits of CG animation is the ability to utilize a 3D space. Danball Senki takes advantage of the fact that most battles take place in these cardboard arenas, meaning not only is the switch from a 2D environment outside of the arenas to a 3D one inside the arena less jarring, but the 3D toy models don’t feel out of place either. Because everything in Danball Senki’s battle environments is in 3D, they’re able to make the most of dynamic camera movements. For example, the beginning of a battle in episode 3 really stood out to me for how the camera flies around the battlefield, establishing a sense of space where these toys are fighting. The battle against Ban and his rival Jin in episode 14 had this really cool sequence where the toys fought each other while jumping all around the battlefield, even jumping up to the skies to duke it out as they fall back down. I really appreciate the use of camerawork in these 3D environments to establish a sense of space as it adds so much to the enjoyment of these battles.That being said, there are instances where the toys appear outside the confines of the 3D cardboard arenas. In these instances, Danball Senki manages to avoid the 3D models feeling jarring within the 2D environments with a simple trick. There are many ways to composite 3D and 2D together, such as good lighting and shading, or even something as simple as quick movements to make it less noticeable. In Danball Senki’s case, what I think blends the 3D models most is the use of scale. For example, the first episode features some toys attacking Ban in his home in an attempt to steal his LBX (which by the way, the LBX toys canonically use live ammunition meaning if Ban got hit he could've died... WHAT). During this scene, the camera often scales down to the toy’s size, with everything 2D scaled up. In any shot where the camera is scaled up, the toys are appropriately scaled down. You can judge for yourself, but I think this works wonders for making the 3D models never feel out of place in the 2D environments. Episode 28 is another example of the 3D models working well in a 2D environment during a scene where they use the toys to break into a hijacked train. Once again, the toys and camera are appropriately scaled down in size, aiding in the believability that they’re actually in this space. What’s funny about this example is that there is a 3D smoke effect that broke the immersion for me with how out of place it felt. It takes up a considerable amount of space on the screen but doesn’t blend in well with the background. Other than these small instances, Danball Senki has great 3D compositing in both the 3D and 2D environments.With all that being said, the best part about Danball Senki’s CG animation (and the reason I felt compelled to make this review in the first place) is just how awesome it is. The way the camera flies all over the place, the way it establishes great angles to see the action, and the way it moves in unique ways to highlight certain things in a battle are all impressive. One scene that stood out to me as truly epic was a battle in episode 20 featuring an LBX that looks like a Jester who has the unique ability of confusing their enemy by dancing around them. The camera work is very lively and constantly moves around the toys. But what I really appreciate is how the camera focuses and follows the Jester’s feet as it dances around the other toy. Highlighting this little detail made the fight significantly more exciting to watch and made me appreciate the freedom Danball Senki has with its camerawork. It goes a long way in making these battle scenes really entertaining, something I can’t imagine working if it wasn’t CG animation.I know this review has been mostly about the CGI since I like focusing on specific aspects I find interesting when I make reviews, but I really don’t want to understate how great I think Danball Senki’s writing is. The story is constantly progressing with some great plot twists and revelations here and there. I especially loved the development of the rival character Jin and his relationship with Ban throughout the series. I just don’t have any analysis to make about it; I just think it’s a super solid story and I was entertained the entire way through. Anyways, I hope this review has convinced you to not only check out Danball Senki, but also think about what makes CGI good or bad in anime for you personally. I’m not an expert in art, not at all. Everything in this review is just aspects that I’ve noticed and thought about while watching Danball Senki.

Yami Shibai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19383/Yami_Shibai,"[""Esta review también está en español.Step right up and have a look… It's time for Theater of Darkness…With this ominous presentation, a mysterious man wearing a golden mask invites us to enjoy Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories (Theater of darkness, and from now on, YS), an anthology of Japanese rumors and urban legends, full of spirits, ghost, curses, and all those creepy things we like so much. No gore or extreme violence here, only pure, clean terror.Unlike creations like Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror or Kousetsu Hyaku Monogatari, which both had a more medieval setting (or at least, before the Meiji era), YS take place in...modern Japan. Personally, I think this is a plus, because, although it's true that there are some Japanese folk elements, it's not hard to understand what's going on: with minimum reasoning (and a couple of anime in your list... not that many, but enough to know that those papers with rare scribbles are actually talismans, for example), you can know what's going on (and that without the gazillion clarifications subbers usually add in historical anime).One of the first things you'll notice in YS is its duration: less than five minutes, and that including the presentation and the ending song. How does this affect the story? Contrary to what one can expect, it's actually something good. When it comes to horror and suspense, keeping the tension is vital. The episodes in YS (all self conclusive, by the way) are often very direct, stating the situation/predicament of the protagonist almost immediately, and before you know it, the conclusion arrives. The stories may not be very original, but YS really knows how to use the shock factor: even when you know what is going to happen, in the end you'll be surprised.The second thing that stands out in this anime is, of course, its animation. Still images… almost no animation (you're never going to see lips moving, or eyes blinking, for example)... low budget? No, for the visual aspect, creators decide to imitate the kamishibai, a traditional storytelling technique inspired by the artistic usage of paper figures and scrolls (thanks for the tip, MAL synopsis). It's similar to that seen in Midori: Shoujo Tsubaki but, in YS works a lot better. Even if the animation is a bit static (but don't worry, there are some movements... this is not Inferno Cop), both character and backgrounds are well done, and are occasionally replaced with photos, and even sometimes with live-action moments.  A strange combination, yes, but it works well, and really contribute to produce some disturbing moments. Also, it worth mention the good coloring: after all, it helps the ambientation a lot that the palette used has a majority of opaque colors, and strong and violent red/violet/black tones for the... complicated moments. And the final detail: a lot of little black dots are present during the animation, simulating that we are watching something in an old projector. It's a nice touch.When it comes to horror, sound is very important, since it sets the mood... and I must say that, here, YS is brilliant. The seiyuus (whoever they are) fulfill flawlessly with their work, showing the full range of emotions present in this kind of work: tranquility, confusion, and finally, fear. Bonus points for the narrator, that, even if he only have a few lines per episode (and only at the beginning), he remains constant throughout the series. The sound effects are deep, loud and clear, being the most predominant (of course) the footsteps, or the door openings/closing. These are particularly powerful in the sense that, for a long time, there's no music... only sound. But when the music finally hits... god damn. First, it starts quiet, ominous, almost imperceptibly... and then it starts to rise up, only to hit you in the face in the perfect moment, the one with more tension. As a final detail, it worth mentioning the ending: personally, I wouldn't even consider Hatsune Miku for a series like this, but the song Kaifuu Emaki works perfectly. Not only sounds fine, it has a kind of distorted tone that made the song slightly unsettling. Awesome job.Final words: Yami Shibai is a fascinating product. The stories are interesting (with some cliché, of course), dynamic and gloomy, that can actually surprise you (or at least, scare you a few times). Visually is not spectacular, but it works fine, and its personality is undeniable. Sound's impeccable using silence and music at the right times to create the right mood. And most important, the episodes are very short, so the tension is high all the time. If you like horror animes, YS is practically mandatory.--------Acérquense y observen… es hora del Teatro de la OscuridadCon esta ominosa presentación, un misterioso sujeto de mascara dorada nos invita a disfrutar de Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories (Teatro de la oscuridad: Historias japonesas de fantasmas, a partir de ahora, YS), una antología de rumores y leyendas urbanas japonesas, llenas de espíritus, maldiciones, y todas esas cosas escabrosas que tanto nos gustan.A diferencia de creaciones como Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror o Kousetsu Hyaku Monogatari, que tenían una ambientación más bien medieval (o al menos, anterior a la era Meiji), todas transcurren en el Japón (más o menos) contemporáneo. Personalmente, creo que esto es un plus, porque, si bien es cierto que hay elementos folclóricos japoneses, no presentan una dificultad a la hora de entender que es lo que está pasando: con un mínimo razonamiento (y un par de animes en la bolsa… no muchos, pero los suficientes como para saber que esos papeles con palabras raras son talismanes, por ejemplo), uno comprende (sin la necesidad de que los subers agreguen miles de aclaraciones).Una de las primeras cosas que uno nota de YS es su duración: no más de cinco minutos, y con eso incluyo la presentación y el ending. Como afecta esto a la historia? Contrario a lo que uno podría esperar, juega a su favor.  Cuando se habla de horror y suspenso,  mantener la tensión es algo vital. Los capítulos de YS (todos auto conclusivos) suelen ser muy directos, planteando la situación/predicamento del protagonista casi de inmediato, y para cuando uno se quiere dar cuenta, la conclusión llega de golpe. Las historias no serán muy originales, pero YS juega muy bien con el shock: hasta cuando uno intuye como va a terminar el capitulo, al final se sorprende, por cómo se barajan las cosas.Lo segundo que llama la atención en este anime es, por supuesto, su animación. Imágenes estáticas… animación casi nula (nunca van a ver ojos parpadeando labios moviéndose, por ejemplo)… bajo presupuesto? No, para el aspecto visual se decidió imitar el  kamishibai, un estilo de contar historias en las que se usan figuras de papel y pergaminos (gracias por el tip, sinopsis de MAL). Es similar a lo visto en Midori: Shoujo Tsubaki, pero, la verdad sea dicha, en YS funciona mejor. Sacando el hecho de su no muy fluida animación (pero que se entienda, sí que hay movimiento en los personajes, esto no es como en Inferno Cop), tanto los personajes como los fondos están bien hechos, y ocasionalmente, son reemplazados con fotos, y a veces, hasta con momentos live-action. Una combinación extraña, si, pero funciona bien, y realmente produce momentos realmente perturbadores. También, cabe mencionar el buen trabajo en el coloreado: después de todo, ayuda mucho a la ambientación que se haya usado una variedad de colores opacos en general, y fuertes y violentos tonos rojos/violetas/negros para los momentos… complicados. Y a todo esto se suma el efecto en la animación de los constantes micro puntos negros, que simulan el efecto de que estamos viendo algo en un proyector antiguo. Es un buen detalle, y todo suma para que el producto final asuste más.En una producción de terror, el sonido es muy importante, y hay que decir que, acá, YS es brillante. Los actores (sean quienes sean) cumplen impecablemente con su labor, mostrando toda la gama de emociones presentes en este tipo de situaciones: tranquilidad, confusión, y finalmente, miedo. Puntos extra para el narrador, que si bien solo tiene unas pocas líneas por capitulo (y solo al principio), se mantiene  constante a lo largo de la serie. Los efectos de sonido son profundos, siendo el caso más evidente el de las pisadas, o cuando se abren la puertas. Estos son particularmente poderosos por que durante ratos largos no hay música… solo sonido. Pero cuando finalmente llega la música… agárrense. Primero arranca tranquila, ominosa, casi imperceptible, para ir subiendo, y golpear en el momento justo, en el de más tensión. Y como detalle final, cabe mencionar el ending: personalmente ni se me hubiera ocurrido usar a Hatsune Miku para este tipo de serie, pero la canción Kaifuu Emaki funciona muy bien. No solo suena bien, si no que tiene una especie de tono distorsionado que la hace ligeramente macabra. Muy buen trabajo.Bueno, para redondear, Yami Shibai es un producto fascinante. Sus historias son interesantes (tal vez con algún cliché), dinámicas y tétricas, y realmente pueden sorprender, o al menos, hacer pegar algunos saltos. Visualmente no es espectacular, pero cumple de forma muy convincente, y su personalidad es innegable. El sonido es impecable, usando sonidos y música en los momentos justos para lograr crear malestar. Y lo más importante de todo, los capítulos son cortos, por lo que la tensión no se pierde en ningún momento. Si te gustan los animes de terror, YS es prácticamente obligatorio.

Yamishibai: Japanese Ghost Stories (or Theater of Darkness) is essentially the animated equivalence of telling spooky stories by the campfire. Of course, unlike campfire ghost stories, it has the advantage of telling its story through visuals and atmosphere setting sound design. This is as rudimentary as storytelling gets, short and quick to the point. Yet these tales of horror are plenty effective; distilling the tense atmosphere and shocks which make those short ghost stories so much fun.Yamishibai wholly commits to creating a creepy atmosphere from beginning to end. The short opening for every episode has a man...in a creepy mask telling a bunch of pale, lifeless looking kids with bloodshot eyes at a playground to gather round and listen to his story. The color pallet is all grimy, dank, and subdued. Lighting is used to ominous effect, casting shadows and shining at discomforting angles. Ambient noise and a few musical tracks create tension very efficiently. The show does a good job building up to the inevitable jump scares in every episode, which are surprisingly effective given how prevalent they are. You could probably have a seminar on how to properly do a jump scare using this show.To say that Yamishibai is animated is a bit of a stretch, actually. Fluid motion is pretty much non-existent here, and characters mouths don't even move when they talk.  It isn't done in the traditional animation, instead much more like an elaborate puppet show of sorts that uses paper cutouts. Oddly enough, this doesn't hurt the show, and in fact it even works to the show's benefit, although it makes quite clear that there wasn't much of a budget behind this project. This style gives the show an almost other-worldly feeling that helps the scares along, as they might have come across as trite in a more traditional animation style or live-action. The constantly on-edge voice work and ominous use of sound complete the creepy package.With all this said, Yamishibai is undeniably a one-trick pony. The only thing the show actually accomplishes is the effectively creepy atmosphere. The stories themselves are, frankly, unremarkable. Yes, they are steeped in Japanese occult lure, which is interesting, but that is it really. They are only serve as the skeleton for the show's short creepshows. They never give much of an explanation and ultimately don't leave any sort of impression. The stories all follow essentially the same formula, and so can be very predictable. Some are outright silly, most notably an episode that features a poop monster, and are only saved through the show's effective atmosphere. This is excused by the fact that these are short episodes with run-times no longer than 5 minutes, but it is clear that Yamishibai is as narrow in scope as a show can get.Minimal ambition aside, Yamishibai is a fun little taste of the macabre. All things considered, it is nice little collection of creepshows. It isn't a big time commitment only spanning 13 episodes, roughly around an hour with the short running-time of the episodes. It's a good little time-waster to watch in the dark. in a creepy mask telling a bunch of pale, lifeless looking kids with bloodshot eyes at a playground to gather round and listen to his story.

The stories are also well written, unique, and diverse. They are the type of short stories that stick with you.  I also like how most of the ending mainly implied, but open to interpretation.I don't care much for the artwork. It is very artistic. The animation mimics kamishibai well. It's just a little too different for my taste. It has a semi realist style too it. It kind of blurs the border as to what defines an anime at times. On the bright...side, it does make it creepier.The music for this one is awesome! It really enhances/brings Yami Shibai to life.  Honestly, it probably would not be that creepy without it. The voice acting not bad also. For me, the best thing about this anime is the ending theme. I am a huge Vocaloid fan. Miku was perfect at the end. I sometimes remember to watch this just becouse I like the ending.The characters are just characters in this anime. They weren't meant to stand out, and they don't. They are usually only in one episode a piece, so you don't actually get to see much of there personality. They usually react like normal people to the situations, though.It's definitely different than most anime, but definitely worth at least checking out if your a fan of horror. It's not something I would not re watch at the same time (the surprises are what makes it worth watching).

The problem here is I do not lean strongly either way because I cannot completely tear down nor defend it. I will say it is a big factor as to why I did not rate this a perfect 10, though. Visually, it is compelling. There are times when the quality falters, but because of the stylistic choices which fit in with the cutout \'theatre\' image, I cannot complain. The sound and atmospheric design is very well done. And most importantly, the horror is...executed amazingly. But this is where the 4-minute limit becomes a hit-or-miss situation.There are quite a number of times where the fast pace actually helps. There is literally no time for draggy or slow exposition or set-ups (all of which are handled concisely and without halting the progression of story), and every episode almost instantly dives right in. The suspense is amazing. And there are undoubtedly one or two episodes which were just right, and might have in fact been ruined if they had added even a minute more. But there is mostly where all the advantages of using 4 minutes shine – the build up.On the other hand, more often than not, the fright is cut off so anticlimactically and abruptly, that you\'re left with less of a horrified ""oh my god"" and more of a genuinely confused ""what the fuck"". Unless that was their goal, since it is half the reason why you\'re so compelled to watch the next one, because you feel the need to satisfy all the unreleased tension. But if this was the point, then why wouldn\'t they just make an anthological movie? I understand that every episode is meant for just one quick scare, but that\'s 10 seconds after 3 and a half minutes of really, really good set up and anticipation; it almost feels as if they\'re pulling punches.Perhaps what makes it frustrating is that it is very obvious that the staff involved are very good at what they do, and that they have the potential create a fantastic horror anime. They evidently understand how to make an atmosphere creepy, and not pretentiously so. For instance, many horror filmmakers use mannequins without necessity, simply throwing out the mascot of the uncanny valley simply because people are creeped out. Yami Shibai uses it once, and they use it oh so beautifully. And the fact that they can create such suspense for characters that the viewer hardly has time to become invested in or care about speaks volumes.I can\'t say restricting them to 4 minutes is wasted potential, because it is a very difficult task – so if anything they had to work even harder for it.

As I watch the series, instead of feeling the fear that the anime attempts to show to the viewer, what I felt is the disappointment of having these stories that could\'ve been developed into an excellent horror anime was put in a 4-minute episode.Every episode has a new story, new characters and a unique way of scaring people that could\'ve been used to develop a new anime. I find it nice that certain episodes make me cover my face with a pillow due to the fear. At the end of...every episode, I find myself disappointed since the stories presented can already become ideas for an awesome anime series. Knowing it is a series, the time they used in making these series, they should\'ve spend it in developing one of the stories presented into a brand new anime. Like for example, one episode of the series could\'ve been a nice mystery, horror anime if developed more. The disappointment actually repeated for 13 times until the end of the almost an hour series.Overall, if in terms of the goal of expressing the horror, I recommend this anime.

Well here are those very ghost stories in anime form.I would like to start with the anime art style yes it is quirky but it fits the mood of the narrating and actual story as well as that when the characters do speak the actors who play the characters sound like they are actually very terrified so all due props to them for doing such an excellent job at acting.If you are looking for a short 5 minute...anime with quirky art style and great voice acting then this one is for you.As for scary ""meh"" i did not feel it to be honest but then again everyone is different and someone may get the jitters but that still does not make this a bad anime for 5 minutes of condensed anime it\'s a great watch.-Mr_Blueee- anime with quirky art style and great voice acting then this one is for you.As for scary ""meh"" i did not feel it to be honest but then again everyone is different and someone may get the jitters but that still does not make this a bad anime for 5 minutes of condensed anime it\'s a great watch.-Mr_Blueee-', ""Yami Shibai...This series is a collection of short horror stories which aren't meant to make you jump in your seat but rather scare you with creepy, weird and unique short stories which  don't involve jump scares although the second season is filled with them.Every episode is unique but many are uninteresting, cliche and boring. The episodes aren't great but the ideas produced are the most compelling component of this series.The art is uninspiring but the pure stiffness of the animation adds to the overall creepiness. The animation is like a picture drama with minor movements, cardboard cut-outs essentially.The characters are rather...weak but you can't expect much character depth or development in 4 minutes; each episode also has different characters.I enjoyed the series to a degree. Episodes are only 4 minutes and it's difficult not to recommend such a short series. It won't take up much of your time and might entertain you with some creepy ideas.

I only anime that I could possibly slightly comapre it to is Pet Shop of Horrors due to the way that it is set out with new characters and storylines each episode. It was a quick watch of horror which I could fit in to watch anywhere and get a little creeped out everytime.--STORY--The story was ok. Considering each episode goes for a duration of 5 minutes with a new story each episode there was not much room for development of a story. But that was not the point of this anime. It was just...a quick little horror story to give people a scare.--ART--I really liked the art style of this anime. It was completly different to most art styles in the way that it resembled a paper cut out and stop motion animation. Even with this simple art design, the anime still managed to look good and present scares. In fact, some of the scenes were probably even creepier being this type of art style.--SOUND--The sound was another main aspect of this anime. Some of the small creaks and cracks that this anime made really added to the tension and scares. The voice acting was really good and the sound the creepy beings made and the way they spoke made them even spookier.--CHARACTER--Much like the story, being such short episodes with new characters you could never really get to attached to chacters, but in retrospect you didn't need to. These characters were just experiencing something creepy and you didn't need to know their whole backstory. Enough was known about them in most of the epsiodes to know why they are where they are and what they will do about the circumstances which is all you need for this anime.--ENJOYMENT--I really enjoyed this anime and although I never got completly scared I can tell you 100% I go creeped out. Some of the stories and character designs were super creepy and haunting and there are few that I don't think I will ever forget.--FINAL THOUGHTS--Overall, I think this anime is a good one to watch if you are a fan of horror and just want something quick and creepy to watch. For storylines and character development watch something like Another but if all you want is a quick scare and can accept a different art design then I would recommend this. a quick little horror story to give people a scare.--ART--I really liked the art style of this anime.

Furthermore, shows need to arouse interest, as suspense, action and production need to work together to offer the best show possible, be it film, manga, series or anime.  Yami Shibai is an example of how to make disturbing stories, without depending on other forms of discomfort or tension.To begin with, I must say that the show is independent of a very elaborate narrative quality, especially when it comes to a compilation of Japanese horror stories, where urban...legends, cases and superstitions are always frequent in Japanese villages and regions.  Yami Shibai took advantage of this, bringing a very unique style that is common in Japanese culture, the kamishibai.  It is this type of visual technique that captures the public's attention, because in addition to inserting a new art of making anime, it brings with it a significant cultural repertoire.The production of this type of show would be easily hampered, since it is common for experimental anime to fail in technical execution.  With Yami Shibai, that doesn't happen.  On the contrary, the surrounding and episodic construction of environment makes the show more frightening, so much so that it is one of the strongest points of the anime.However, the show has a significant problem: the jumpscare and the false suspense that the anime occasionally does.  In some episodes, the fright does not happen the way he appears to have programmed, which displeased me, since I particularly think that the best type of visual horror is that competent with the sound and suspense created around the audience.  When that doesn't happen, the show tends to appeal to bad techniques, like jumpscare or stopping the songs to give a scare when everything seems to be okay.In general, as much as Yami Shibai has some shortcomings, it is a pleasant show to watch, especially at a time when you feel you are not seeing many shows, as this is very short and easy to be consumed.  Its cultural quality and the transmission of the climate of terror are very good and really admirable.  I look forward to the next sequences.  Congratulations to the ILCA studio, which was competent and daring to produce such a commented show. legends, cases and superstitions are always frequent in Japanese villages and regions.

It's one of the earliest forms of entertainment humankind engulfed themselves with. Before television electricity even before literature, people gathered around the fire to hear chilling tales. Humans like to be frightened and immersive themselves in a world full of ghost goblins and demons.So let's gather around and I will tell more of about some horrifying Ghost story's.. Welcome to my review of Yami Shibai!Rather then one big story this is a collation of shorter ghost tales. And with only four minutes of time they are surprisingly well done, and being told in...a creepy menacing way!!They are unique ominous and extremely well presented .Before I start watching this i thought the short time could be a problem but that was a misconception!!   The style itself may be extremely simplistic and first appears as child's play. Created by elementary students for a school projected,That is a mere deceitful illusion, that are fragmentized early in when presenting its true nature!. Its unsettling disturbing and very threatening.The art-style fits in tremendously well, and substantially adding to the scare-factor and give that eerie feelingThe music is not that imposing. It's rather other sound effected that just add to its ominous atmosphere and making it feel even more sinister. Sometimes the sound effects are weird sometime creepy.And it always works with the scene itself . The voice actors are doing a monumental job.You can hear the distress and fear even hate in the character's voices. This brings life and credibility as a good ghost story should have!!!! To build a great and lovable character in such sort time is unreasonable and totally unnecessary. This is a horror and the character is mere cannon food for our sick enjoyment.The Ghost Stories are the star here. All the characters are support and their only obligation are to raise the fear factor!! And to die in the most gruesome ways possibleWhen everything comes together we have collections of ghastly story's.That never feels monotonous or tedious. And it succeeded with its main purpose and made me feel uncomfortable!!I going to lock my door and sleep with the lights on tonight!! If you wonder why,watch this anime and you will understand better.

YamiShiBai is based on the concept of KamiShiBai, an ancient storytelling technique based on paper in 12th century. Young viewers may not appreciate the artwork in YamiShiBai due to its dull and simplistic texture. In YamiShiBai, the artwork reflects reality and correct atmosphere. Moreover, the sound effect often creates huge tension and uneasiness. Although the ending is very predictable, I still get very scared by some of the grotesque images.Although most of the episodes in YamiShiBai are scary,I feel that some of the episodes convey valuable insights. In episode 3, people smile in order...to deter bad omen. In reality, how many people are wearing a smiling mask? In episode 5, a father puts work before his family and he is sent to an alien dimension. When someone is often too busy for his family, will he be too late to meet his family?In conclusion, I would recommend YamiShiBai to anyone who feels negative to the current trend in Japanese anime. YamiShiBai may be short but the skill in conveying the right atmosphere in storytelling is excellent. to deter bad omen. In reality, how many people are wearing a smiling mask?

What bothered me is the fact that I never saw a creepy anime though, till I saw Yami Shibai.Yami Shibai is basically the best example for a pure horror anime. It doesn’t waste any screen time onto anything but horror, and very creepy one indeed. The episodes are very short, which normally annoy me about anime, but in this case it works perfectly, because it’s very different to normal anime. In this anime you don’t care about the plot or the characters, this is just a 4 min...show to frighten you. In my opinion it could have been a bit scarier (especially at some episodes) but since I never saw any creepy anime till now it was exeptable.The artstlye is very poor done, but fits the whole concept very good, because with a normal anime style it wouldn’t create that fear, in my opinion. It mostly consists out of pictures for each character or object which move over a background (kinda like the first episodes of southpark with less movement, but more detail and darker).The soundtrack mostly consists out of creepy background noises and a pretty good ending theme, as expected from a pure horror anime. Since those background noises are the main reason you get so frightened I would say that they did a pretty good job there.Like I said before are characters not very important in this anime since they change every episode like the plot, and to judge them as a whole I would say they just like characters from a normal horror show, and the plot for me had some good episodes and some not so good ones but that’s for you to decide.So in conclusion is the show not for the faint-hearted but it’s not too creepy so it might disappoint for the hardcore horror movie fans (it got some pretty nice ideas though). But you can’t expect a 4 min anime to be as scary as a movie like “Ju-On the grudge” or something like that. But overall it’s pretty nice to see something like this being produced since the rest of the anime market is overflown with very similar shows and I because of its short duration it won’t cost so much time even if you dislike it, so watch it! show to frighten you.

For example, would it make sense to rate Madoka highly  because it achieves its aim for shock value and exploring the ""depth"" behind the magical girl genre, regardless of the quality of its story or characters?Yami Shibai is the perfect example of an anime which raises this conundrum for me. It isn\'t particularly representative of, or even relevant to, the standard structure and characteristics of anime; it is, however, a show that sets out with the...purpose of being scary and one that manages to fulfill its purpose through and through.Story? Sure, this one has lots of stories! They\'re fairly enjoyable and are set out competently enough to engage without going so far as to seem ridiculous. They focus on horrific or mythical beings or events in Japanese culture, incorporating these into the everyday lives of a different character every episode. Ultimately, though, the stories themselves are more or less predictable in both setup and actual content, with some episodes having no twist (i.e shock factor) at all and relying greatly on the atmosphere of the writing to deliver fear. Not the best idea, because as I mentioned, the predictability and overall ""generically scary"" writing behind the stories is watchable, but not at any level of ""great"".But that\'s not why you would watch this anime. You would watch Yami Shibai because of its presentation.Shock value in anime is generally reliant on the graphic nature of the content, primarily because anime\'s visual style and fluidity is not becoming of jump scares or subtle movement. Yami Shibai is an anime that recognises this problem and overcomes it through use of its art style. The unique paper-like template characters make for arguably visually pleasing sights but, more importantly, allow the anime to utilise a constant flow of movement that is so necessary in the action and atmospheric reliance that binds horror together.  Bodies tremble in fear, cameras shake and change direction swiftly in exciting fright scenes, small movements are discernible in the background to increase tension; this is an anime that knows how to tailor its appearance to best suit its purpose.Additionally, the animation is scattered with instances of differing animation to create an amazing contrast for delivering impact — as seen in the final episode (minor spoilers), wherein the sudden introduction of non-papery movement creates a surge of shock and powerfully reinforces the shows final scare. The way Yami Shibai experiments like this is great to see in a medium that could so do with more innovation, and in this case the direction pays off wonderfully in how effectively the art styles combine to create that much more fear.The voice acting is all around great, with lots of nice restraint in use of voicing and very little overacting (which, one can imagine, is something of a common problem in any horror media). The soundtrack is very fitting too, often chilling and with notable switches made between ""creepy"" and ""safe"" to further the impact of the show\'s scares. While this does feed the predictability I mentioned in regards to story, it also doesn\'t attempt to counter that predictability in what would almost certainly be a futile effort; the fact that the anime can embrace its inherent flaws and go on to make use of these flaws is both admirable and enjoyable to see in an anime like this.Overall, I definitely like this show. It\'s more or less standard in the writing department, but as an experiment in presentation I would call it a great triumph and acknowledge it as the first anime to genuinely scare me (the last episode being the best at that). Good premise and better execution; I\'ll likely be coming back for the second season soon. purpose of being scary and one that manages to fulfill its purpose through and through.Story?

All of them were interesting and in my opinion, done well. Every story is at the very least, creepy (some were downright scary), and it had me hooked from the first episode.Animation:At first this was a sticking point to me. The animation was extremely basic, but after a few episodes it grew on me and actually it fits very well with the asthetic of the show. The animation is based off of the Japanese paper theatre story tellers. It is done well for what it is trying to do.Sound:The sound is done very...well and adds to the general vibe of creepyness and is unnerving at times. The Story Teller's voice animation is done excellently and is very creepy.Characters:Can't really say anything about this because each story has its own characters.Overall:Definently scary and worth watching. well and adds to the general vibe of creepyness and is unnerving at times.

That’s not to say that there aren’t any good horror anime out there however I find that there are few horror anime that seem to be legitimately scary. When I say this, I mean anime that can successfully keep the viewer on edge when watching them through sound and atmosphere, instead of just dumping lots of gore and yanderes into the show and having the characters give psychotic smiles every now and then (looking at you Elfen Lied and Future...Dairy). Yami Shibai: Japanese Ghost Stories is one of the few anime I’ve seen that gets the Horror atmosphere right and while not perfect is a unique group of shorts that give some good creepy tales.Yami Shibai is a series of 13 episodes all of which are three minutes long. The episodes consist of one-shot ghost stories that take place in modern Japan based on ghosts from Japanese folklore. The anime is based on a form of Japanese storytelling called Kamishibai. These were moral based stories stories drawn on paper scrolls that Monks would tell to a mostly illiterate audience. In modern times, Kamishibai is still conducted to tell stories to young children. The opening of each episode actually starts with a Kamishibai storyteller calling children over to him to tell them the story of the episode.Each short focuses on a different short story with different characters and settings. These can range from a story about a haunted videotape to a man being trapped on an unknown floor of a shopping mall; my favourite though was the short about a ghost haunting a school printer (only because it proves that those things are evil). If these scenarios sound familiar, it’s because they are, all of them are heavily based on old urban legends and if you watch a lot of anime or read a lot of creepy pastas, they’re going to seem familiar. That being said, that seems to be the point of the anime, the stories are meant to seem like ones you’d tell to a group of friends around a campfire, which makes sense as the anime puts the stories in the context of being, well, stories being told to children. Most importantly though, the anime does a really good job at making these familiar stories still seem creepy. It was one of the few anime were I really did feel a bit tense as the episodes went on, even when I could predict what was coming next. It does a really good job building dark and eerie atmosphere that can really get under your skin and while there were a couple of dud episodes that weren’t that scary, the majority succeeded. Some people might complain about the extremely short length but in my opinion it was the perfect length for these kinds of short stories, it’s enough time to set up a scene but not so long as to let it start dragging on.The animation is also quite interesting. Being based on the Kamishibai paper scroll artwork, the anime tries to emulate this using stylised cut outs for the characters. While I can see some being turned of by the lack of fluidity, I personally really liked this; it’s unique from other anime and adds authenticity of the anime further giving it the feel of being a story. My only real complaint is that some of the ghost's designs look a bit too similar, like be prepared to see ghosts that look like the girls from The Ring/The Grudge in at least 4-5 episodes.Sound wise, there aren’t any real standout tracks but the music does help to set the atmosphere for the show and lets the audience know when all the really bad shit's about to happen. The opening has no song but strangely enough the ending is a dubstep song featuring Hatsune Miku. The song itself is kind of mediocre and sounds a bit out of place but I guess it’s meant to calm the audience’s nerves down a bit after the episode.Yami Shibai is isn’t a masterpiece of anime nor is it truly innovative but the episodes are good little shorts with some familiar tales and a unique art style that can easily satisfy you if you’re in the mood for a spook, especially with Halloween coming up. There only three minutes long so it’s not like your wasting much time either. Dairy).

I have to say, this anime really surprised me, it exceeded my expectations and managed to hold my attention, I mean, it could get repetitive at times but the episodes are only, what, four minutes long? So I sat through it all and somehow ended up writing this review.STORY - 8It\'s a very simple concept, ghost stories,...that\'s it, that\'s what the anime revolves around. I thought this sounded interesting and ended up giving it a try. It\'s basically your average ""telling spooky stories around the campfire"" scenario, except instead of that we have a mysterious man in a yellow mask telling said spooky stories to children. So, simple idea, but still cool.ART - 8I\'m personally not the biggest fan of this art style but for some reason it was very interesting, unlike any anime art style I\'ve ever seen before. It was a more realistic take on anime art, and I especially liked the dark and gloomy color choices. The art, I\'d say, is a really important part of this anime, because it gave a very creepy feel to the atmosphere. I personally wouldn\'t draw like this in my own art, but I think it\'s fair to say that the art fits this anime.SOUND - 9Now this is one part of Yami Shibai that makes me really like the series as a whole. I LOVED the ending song, and the ominous background music was another big part of the anime. Not much to say about the voices, as I didn\'t really pay attention to them, but I guess they fit the characters.CHARACTER - 6There are no characters who stay through the episodes except for the yellow-masked man and the children, who we still don\'t know much about, but that adds to Yami Shibai. There\'s not really much to say here.ENJOYMENT - 6It might be rated G so it wasn\'t really that scary, as most horror anime are not, but it was still a little creepy. As for enjoyment, it was mediocre, not spectacular but not appalling. I found myself sometimes waiting for the episode to end, and it wasn\'t too thrilling for me.OVERALL - 7I got a lot more than I expected from this anime, I\'d say it was pretty well done for such a simple concept. Though, sometimes simple is the best way to go. Overall, I was really surprised with the outcome. that\'s it, that\'s what the anime revolves around.

Simply because I don\'t really enjoy it....I mean I do like it  but I don\'t like it......to more clear I like it but it scares the shit out of me every 0.10 seconds(yeah I\'m a scarycat but deal with it!). So for my surprise that some afternoon out of boredom I click on a new title on Crunchyroll called ""Yami Shibai"" and today out of boredom I am writing a review about it. So...with all the shit introduction and nonsense being already said,today on Javier123\'s reviews (yeah I know its shit and I gotta find another name)I\'ll be reviewing Yami Shibai:Japanese Ghost Stories.(Ok this my first review don\'t be too critical and please tell me what you thought about it and please excuse my ENGRISH.)Story SectionA normal horror movie this days goes something along of lines of this: A group of twats go to a vacation and then there is a psychopath  with a hockey mask that is not armed with a gun, isn\'t armed with a tank and isn\'t armed with a nuclear bomb. He\'s just armed with a very little and inoffensive knife. Then they must escape and shit happens. My father always told that Japanese horror titles are always the best and Yami Shibai sure lives up to that expectation. The story is quite simple, every day at  evening the creepy looking guy with the golden mask comes to the park in his bicycle with his tv and says ""Come here come here!The Theater of Darkness is about to start"" and then we get introduced to a new folklore ghost story of Japan.It can range from a curse to affairs with yokai or gods to simply monsters.But keep this in mind:the main character is always fucked and there is no exception,there is no happy ending in any story.Two things I\'ll like to pinpoint are the duration of the episodes and the overall structure of the series as a whole.The duration relatively short wich is 4 minutes long and if you count  the ending song is not a very  long episode. But trust me even if they are short, every story has it punch somewhere you won\'t be disappointed.The story as a whole is not the great thing,it doesn\'t have structure in other words there is no ending,no beginning and so of course no development.But in my eyes is not that bad because it was simple and enjoyable so why ask for more?Overall 4/10Characters SectionIn an horror movie these days the characters  stereotypes are: the male lead, the female lead, the hunk, the nerd, the hot chick and the black guy who gets killed first. In Yami Shibai the only character that returns is the creepy guy with the golden mask. Every episode introduce us to a new bunch of characters. But because of its duration there no time to we the spectators to know the characters .But even so every single one of them acts perfectly human shows perfectly his emotions in a normal human way.Overall 3/10Art SectionSome people may say that the art is bad but I actually thought that is was surprisingly good(considering how it looks)The animation is pretty much mediocre and there isn\'t too much movements and other things like the scenario aren\'t spectacular either. But the way that the facial expressions of the characters are drawn...dam that looks realistic. I did like how every characters seemed realistic and how there facial expressions showed emotions perfectly.Overall 6/10Sound SectionThere isn\'t very much to say here. Voice acting was done perfectly well showing emotions and being mature and also the sounds effects make you feel like your just there with the characters. Even is it was enough the music themes add the feeling perfectly. The ending song performed by Hatsune Miku Is kind of creepy but really catchy(like 95% of all vocaloid songs.Overall 9/10Enjoyment SectionSo here is the final question did I like Yami Shibai?Well .....kind of. It was entertaining and scary but my favorite part was when the ending came because I could finally relax since every episode got me on the tension. I   didn\'t enjoy the story and the characters for reasons I\'ve already said before, but the characters designs and the soundtrack made me really enter to the overall creepy atmosphere of the series and that something that every anime does not manages to do with me.Overall 6/10Final VerdictI would recommend this to anyone since it those certainly is a fresh taking on the usual Moe-Moe-kyun-fanservice-romantic-highschool-waste-of -potential crap. Yami Shibai does certainly is a must watch for the late summer season.The final score is 28/50 wich should be a 5 out of 10 but I\'ll make an exception this time.I give this series a 6 out 10 with all the shit introduction and nonsense being already said,today on Javier123\'s reviews (yeah I know its shit and I gotta find another name)I\'ll be reviewing Yami Shibai:Japanese Ghost Stories.(Ok this my first review don\'t be too critical and please tell me what you thought about it and please excuse my ENGRISH.)Story SectionA normal horror movie this days goes something along of lines of this: A group of twats go to a vacation and then there is a psychopath  with a hockey mask that is not armed with a gun, isn\'t armed with a tank and isn\'t armed with a nuclear bomb.

The animation gives a very bunraku feel, almost as though the characters are all puppets behind a screen. It was no surprise, then, to find out the animation is specifically designed to mimic kamishibai; visual storytelling from the post-war period in Japan. Fans of series like Another and Jigoku Shoujo or any supernatural anime designed to spook and terrify will most likely enjoy this series.

Prepare for one heck of a ride.', 'Yami Shibai\xa0is a series of horror shorts by ILCA. I\'ve looked at another one of their anthologies two years ago when I reviewed Kowabon. So, is this one any better?Story:Like Kowabon, every episode is a short, quick fire horror scenario. They basically follow a formula of setting up some kind of unsettling scenario, building on them and then reaching a conclusion.The biggest issue is that, if you know your horror tropes, you can pretty reliably predict most of the episode endings. To be fair to the series, it does appear to be directed at very young teenagers, maybe even children on the verge of becoming...teenagers. So, a lot of the target audience won\'t be as familiar with the tropes.I will also credit the series for being fairly effective at setting up its scenarios. The episodes are good at quickly establishing the scenario, building up on it and then either coming to a sudden conclusion or using misdirection to make it look like they\'re winding down before leaping into the conclusion. The misdirection does vary a bit. There are episodes where it\'s very obvious that there\'s something more and there are ones where it almost looks like they\'ve reached a proper conclusion. If I were watching this as a twelve to fourteen year old, it would probably fake me out successfully for a couple of these.Characters:My big issue with the characters is the narrator. Yes, I realise that they\'re setting the scenario as stories being told by an elderly man as part of a performance, but the narrator is truly pointless. He pretty much says ""this is the story of some boys,"" right when you\'re seeing three boys on screen. He tells you nothing that you can\'t glean from actually watching the episode.As a whole, the characters are very simple and basically serviceable. Like with their other series, they show up for one episode and never get fully fleshed out. Which is a problem since horror does work better when you have some investment in the characters making it out okay. You lose something when you\'re just ambivalent over them.Art:The art style is designed to be reminiscent of one of those paper figure shows you may see on the streets as a kid. Which isn\'t a bad aesthetic to have but it\'s pretty obvious that it\'s also a budget move. I\'ll still give the series some credit in that it looks better than having a bunch of graphical glitches.Sound:The acting is passable. There aren\'t any performances that are great, or super memorable, but they\'re basically acceptable. The music is the same way.Ho-yay:There is no romance in this.Areas of Improvement:Ditch the narrator. We don\'t need him to waste our time giving us redundant information.Break Expectations a bit. I know the target audience is a bit younger, but it would help to have some subversion.More dynamic performances. I know the characters don\'t have much to them, but it would help if the acting went above basically acceptable.Final Thoughts:For what it is,\xa0Yami Shibai\xa0is decent enough. If you\'re looking for just under five minutes of spooks, you\'ll probably find it engaging enough. I\'ll give it a 6/10. teenagers.

Tonk...""An old man siddles up to you, saying in an eery voice, ""Step right up and have a look. It\'s time for Yamishibai.""Every episodes starts in that creepy, distinct way. An obvious introduction for a great horror series.Let me start by the usual gradings...Story:Now, in every episode, the story is different. Different characters, different plots, different moments in life. Since spoilers ruin the fun, I won\'t give any, but keep in mind this is a horror series, so expect to be sweating, clenching your teeth, widening your eyes, or having the hair on your spine stand on end....or will...you. Perhaps the pants from your mouth will stifle the screams waiting to escape. Maybe the sweat on your brow will dampen your dry lips....Who knows....It\'s not like Corpse Party horror style, but is unique and fun at the same time.Art:The art in Yamishibai is, again, quite peculiar. Imagine a paper figure moving its way across the screen. Very few movements, very few expressions. But, in my opinion, every expression that the characters give are very distinct. Fear, anguish, horror. You might feel it along with them. Of course, as a psychological horror series, you can expect dark colors, terrifying characters, and scream wrenching effects.Music:Well, to be honest, I didn\'t pay attention to the music too well because I was busy hiding under my blankets and wanting to pee in my pajamas, but overall, the music fits the show. Slow, builds up, conclusion. Nothing special. The music helps add to the simplicity of the show.Characters:Characters were quite nice to approach. They may seem a bit shallow, but show genuine fear and are more like real humans than most anime shows out there. Personally, sometimes I wonder if they actually were real people who met horrible fates. The voices are practical and down to earth, no squeaky high voices, no absurdly annoying quick pace voices, none of that. The voice actors are good.Overall, even if this show need a little work, I liked it very much, and I hope they come out with more seasons. Right now, they have two. If you are interested in gripping yet slow paced stories, come and enjoy! We have our Scream Monitors on...! you. Perhaps the pants from your mouth will stifle the screams waiting to escape.

Each episode is 4 minutes long, making this a really short series that you can probably finish in about 2 or 3 hours. However it doesn't really detract from the value of the show. Because each episode is so short, it sets up the premise and gets to the point pretty fast. The thing this anime does best is it's atmosphere. Because it gets to the point fast, the atmosphere is intense and fast-paced, and...each climax usually ends with a twist. I enjoyed alot of the stories told in this anime, yet some are better than others.Art: 9The art of this show is probably the most unique type of art style I've ever seen. This show has no animation. It is inspired by kamishibai, a form of japanese storytelling on a street using illustrations. This mimics the style fairly well and adds to the creepy atmosphere with it's semi-realistic look, and the little bits of animation it DOES have are really fluid and creepy. This would've gotten a 10, however I noticed that the art style of the characters was completely different from other episodes, and it was fairly distracting.Sound: 10The sound in this show is incredible. The voice acting is SERIOUSLY on point. The music adds to the creepy atmosphere, and you can't go wrong with Miku singing the ending song (not even joking). Can't complain about much here. I thought the sound design was amazing.Characters: 5This is the weakest part of the show, but I understand why. You can't develop one off characters in one 4 minute episode. You just can't. However, a lot of the characters aren't very smart. A lot of horror cliches are used with the characters, however I guess it didn't bother me that much. Just a minor nitpick really.Enjoyment: 9I really enjoyed this anime. I had a great time sitting at the edge of my seat, waiting to see how the story would end. My favorite episode was probably episode 4, definitely the creepiest one (in my opinion).Overall: 8I'd recommend this for any horror fan. This is a great show to watch for Halloween with some friends, or in a dark room by yourself with the lights off. I loved it to bits. each climax usually ends with a twist.

Each episode has a proper horror creep that steadies from a standard uncomfortable base up towards a satisfying, yet open-ended climax. As horrors should be, there isn\'t a lot of detail, and it\'s all within an understood realm of disturbing. What works in Yami Shibai is the idea that no object, action, or location is safe from horror. And, when those things are scary, there\'s almost an inconvenience to them at first, rather than a straight up terror factor.For instance, the Hair episode has the MC photocopy something and lines come out on the copy. That\'s not scary at first,...that\'s annoying. It\'s only after she investigates a rather mundane thing that it becomes scary. Time and time again, these things take place. It\'s incredibly intelligent.Art:Spooky cardboard cutouts. Why does this work? Similar to Courage the Cowardly Dog, certain aspects of horror are expanded to other forms of animation. It\'s that unsettling idea of including something ""out of this world"" that creates another dimension of fear. How does this new animation function? The only way to find out is to keep your eyes peeled.Sound:A good balance of ambiance and climactic tones. It can be a little childish when it gets super quiet, then bursts loud for jump scares, but it\'s never to a painful degree.Character:No character is all that important, but the characters within each narrative are explained enough to do what they need to, and that can be a very difficult task when writing what are essentially flash-fiction compilations.Enjoyment:EXTREMELY enjoyable.

It got me jumping on my chair but the story always leave me hanging. I don't know the reason as to why the scary things happened. It always leave me wondering.Also, as you go further with the anime. The story gets creepier. It's a plus points. "", ""I'm not mad, just disappointed. The stories that they had to play with here had so much potential and were genuinely interesting. I stuck around only because I hadn't heard of them before and wanted to hear how they turned out. How they treated these stories felt kind of lazy in comparison to what they could have pulled off. The art is stagnant, devoid of energy and gives off more of a storybook vibe, which they're probably going for on purpose. Regardless, the style they chose keeps their ghosts and monsters from jumping out at you, and not once was I anything more than mildly...creeped out. Even at that, it was at the story itself and not how they presented it to me. The sound is audible, and delivers nothing more than is absolutely necessary. The characters are decidedly two-dimensional, and I found myself caring for them in one way and only one- how they were going to get themselves killed, cursed, or captured. I had no investment in them most of the time, and even when they did end up writing a good character, it was gone by the next episode due to the nature of the format. It is below average for sure, but still maintains some merit in it's atmosphere (which is no doubt provided by the stories the anime is telling and not the show itself) and as a vehicle to get these stories to more people. Now if these stories were written by the people behind Yami Shibai and not just accumulated by them, that would be commendable, because they are essentially good stories. Though, upon further research I found this was not the case. These stories are based off the rich tapestry of Japanese folk tales and urban legends which already exist, written into short story form, and poorly adapted to the screen. In this way, it would have done better as a book of spooky stories or something like that. I reiterate that there's nothing wrong with the tales themselves, I would just like to see them presented in a way which lives up to their potential. Overall this title is comprised of a series of good horror stories presented in a decidedly sub-par fashion.

Watch it if you want to, but you should probably read these stories or have a friend tell them to you; Your imagination can do a better job than Yami Shibai."", ""The story is good if you like folklore, even if you lack any knowledge of the japanease one, but sometimes the closures can feel a little rushed because of the length of the episodes and the fact that each episode has it's own storyline, setting and characters.The art of this anime is very unique but quite fitting for the topic and atmosphere, it feels fresh and dark, but it's not for everyone some people might find too motionless.The soundtrack is nothing special in my opinion it could have been better, the ending theme  is an exception to this given the fact that I find...it quite catchy.There is no real character development, you never really get to know anybody and characters are usually used as tools to produce a reaction in the viewer, the problem is once again a result of the length of the episodes and the kind of narrative.With all this said, this anime might not be the typical horror that I'm used to watching, but it is spooky and engaging.Overall it's uniqueness and quirky style make it worth watching, it's not a masterpiece but it is enjoyable and because there isn't any continuity between the episodes you can watch them with great lengths of time in between without having to refresh your memory, which is great if you hardly ever have time to sit and relax (watch anime). it quite catchy.There is no real character development, you never really get to know anybody and characters are usually used as tools to produce a reaction in the viewer, the problem is once again a result of the length of the episodes and the kind of narrative.With all this said, this anime might not be the typical horror that I'm used to watching, but it is spooky and engaging.Overall it's uniqueness and quirky style make it worth watching, it's not a masterpiece but it is enjoyable and because there isn't any continuity between the episodes you can watch them with great lengths of time in between without having to refresh your memory, which is great if you hardly ever have time to sit and relax (watch anime)."", ""To some viewers, 4 minutes of storytelling might seem very difficult to comprehend, and more often than not, to appreciate for such time frame gives very limited avenue of presenting a well-crafted plot, unforgettable characters, and the development of those two elements - which are unsurprisingly the ones that the average viewer wishes to encounter in a series. Therefore, it is not unknown that some anime have ultimately failed in this endeavor (fcking Pupa) by messing everything all over the place and putting rather insignificant and irrelevant plot tools, probably with the hopes of regaining interest in the viewers' dying flames of enjoyment. Therefore the...most basic premise in formulating an understandable and valid plot within 4 minutes of viewing time is to get to a single story and focus on developing it, crafting every significant detail as relevant as possible to the main storyline.Yami Shibai definitely does that.It is a simple collection of stories of the supernatural, varying from ghosts, curses, witchcraft, and other paranormal activities. It brings about the feeling of the unknown, and invests heavily on the elements of suspense and  typical horror genre plot devices. What I liked about the series is that each story did not beat around the bush, (which is probably imperative within the given time frame of each episode) and got to the main point of the plot. The mystery element was there, and each story leaves a striking impression by forcing the viewer to think beyond what was shown - which was a key element in mystery. Some people would complain how stuff weren't explained well, but I think it was justified and to some extent, intended. The time frame was four minutes to begin with, and with that limited amount of time, a plot would develop better by focusing more on what happened, rather than why it happened, because what generates the mystery and suspense is not the complicated explanation for what happened, but rather the peculiarity of how events were presented, something that is unconventional and beyond the ordinary. Therefore Yami Shibai's strategic presentation of stories complemented well with the atmosphere it intends to show. Moreover, the episodic collection of stories, aside from continuously sustaining the element of creepiness and suspense, contributes to an overall impression of the viewer by not actually driving the horror from the creepiness and scaring ability of each plot individual episodes, but rather by emphasizing that the myriad of paranormal activities boils down to one thought: that stuff we normally see everyday are not as what they seem to be. Some stories actually are very interesting and mind-blowing, and the lack of explanation for such paranormal activity intensifies each individual episode. The art and sound were also great in complementing with the overall story, the art personally makes me feel that the stories were more of urban legends and forces the viewer to think whether such happenings are possibly true or not (of course they probably are fictional works of art, but that vague feeling from the artwork contributed to my enjoyment so much).So why did I give Yami Shibai a rating of being average? First of all, while some stories exceeded my expectations, some stories were downright failures in their own ways. Some stories do not make even sense, and instead of presenting a plot-wise progressive horror story, it presented a series of scenes so stagnant it becomes personally boring. Since the quality of stories range from bad to good, I would have to rate them as average. Moreover, some stories present details that as much as I wanted to appreciate, seem to forcefully join plot pieces together it didn't seem naturally fluid and smooth-going; to some extent, I felt that they are irrelevant and did not contribute to overall impact of the story. Finally, I felt that the strong points of the series, were already imperative to be done given the shortcomings of the entire series, i.e. the short length of time, episodic presentation and complete lack of explanation of the paranormal. I also feel that to some extent the horror value it offers is somewhat generic and present in every other average horror anime. Since it did not offer any marginal personal enjoyment because of the lack of development of each story, I would have to rate Yami Shibai as average. Do I recommend this anime?

Despite each episode being so short, it does a very good job of getting the viewer on the edge of their seat and wanting to see more.

This was the main reason why I decided to watch Yami Shibai.At first the art may be discouraging, especially the way everything is animated. But I got used to it quite quickly and honestly appreciated it. It actually suits the concept of the series. It's as if you were watching a little theatre of horror stories, indeed. Actually, there appear creepy creatures and the way they are drawn can give chills by itself.About the stories: I can't say every of them caught my...full attention. Some are better, some a bit worse. However, a few of them give this disturbing feeling while watching. Are they scary? Well, not necessarily, although as I said they can leave uneasiness to an extent. It's all an individual experience.As a whole, I found those 13 episodes entertaining.

When it\'s good the art and sound fit perfectly with the story making it both unnerving and thought provoking. However, when it\'s bad it\'s like watching an animated version of a story written by a middle schooler who thinks they\'re deep. Fortunately all the episodes are independent and just five minutes long so you\'re at a minimum risk of wasting your time!Like I\'ve pointed out the stories vary in quality but it\'s really the combination with lacklustre direction that makes them bad. Sometimes it\'s better to tell rather than show, especially when it comes to animating horror. A description...of a gooey monster sounds scarier than a drawing of an awkward blob ya know?Which brings me to art! Overall I love the art style of Yamishibai. It goes really well with the simplicity of the show and it\'s (generally) psychological horror. No, the monsters don\'t look very scary but the creepy lady in the background or eerie building look _amazing_. The sound is very similar to the art and so they go together well. My only complaint is that the voice acting feels out of place at times since ""overacting"" doesn\'t really fit with the rest of the show\'s simple aesthetic.I wouldn\'t necessarily recommend the show as a whole but I would _highly_ recommend episodes one, three, four, five, ten and twelve. It would be a shame to miss out on these grate horror stories just because the other episodes are underwhelming.

I\'ll list some of the notable pros and cons.Pros:- Diverse stories and settings (As much as Japan allows it)- Horror stories are based on real life myths and legends from the land of the rising sun, yes! This is quite possibly it\'s strongest aspect as it adds educational value for anybody deeply invested in the paranormal.- The simplistic and unique way it\'s ""animated"" adds to it, not detract. Animes are known to not be as scary as films so it feels to me they used this to their advantage....- Good narrator.Cons:- Unfortunately every story ends in a cliche , stereotypical horror way. Yes there\'s justification for it, but if they were going to imply the protagonist of the story say, died. There\'s better ways they could\'ve done that.- The characters, especially adults suffer from a high level stupidity syndrome. Most evident in the episode called ""Hair"" from what i remember.- This is beginner horror. It\'s not supposed to be anything more than that, so this is more of a personal nitpick.- Stock sound effects. Very common and noticeable for someone that\'s surrounded themself with horror for a long time.All in all. Recommended for casual horror fans looking for a quick thrill, as for the rest. Temper your expectations, it\'s got some charm to it just don\'t go into this thinking you\'re going to get scared badly and that your search for a good horror anime series is over.(I don\'t think i will be making revisions to this review in any case. Yami Shibai is a long running anime series and i don\'t have any plans to cover it all. This was a quick one-off that i felt compelled to make.) - Good narrator.Cons:- Unfortunately every story ends in a cliche , stereotypical horror way.

Yami Shibai is a different kind of horror anime. It's not your usual 24 min per episode, but rather a 5 min per episode anime. Simply, it's a collection of short stories.--STORY--The story was't anything special. Considering each episode lasts only for 5 minutes and the stories being standalone, there wasn't any sort of story development or anything. Some of the stories had something deep, while some were just about a quick scare. So, don't expect much.--ART--I really liked the art style of this anime. It felt weird in the beginning, but it soon grew...over me as I watched the show. It's very different compared to our usual anime out there. It reminded me of cardboard cut out characters with stop motion animation. It's simple but very effective. I would say, this really elevated the show.--SOUND--The sound was really good. It was perfect for this show. Some of the sounds really helped in creating the tension and suspense leading to good scares. The voice acting was really good and was spot on. The emotions of the characters felt realistic thanks to the voice acting .--CHARACTER--Like the story, there isn't anything special about the characters. They are there to complete the story. Since, it's a collection of short stories with new characters you can't really care for anyone of them, and there's no actual need too. Some were interesting and some were not. Also, some of the character designs were really weird and creepy. Which imao worked very well.--ENJOYMENT--I really had fun watching this anime. It was totally a different experience for me. Some episodes scared me and some didn't. But all the episodes were outright creepy. I like being creeped out or scared. So, yeah. It was fun.--OVERALL--This anime is for people who love horror and want something weird and creepy to watch in a short format. For others it's mostly gonna be a hit or a miss. Don't come here expecting a great story or characters. Because, it's not made for that. over me as I watched the show. It's very different compared to our usual anime out there.

Yet, it seems that Yami Shibai does a good job at it.Story:Each episode consists in a 4-minute short story, always following the same pattern and starting with the narration of a storyteller who briefly introduces us to the characters. We are then rapidly thrown into a seemingly ordinary situation, which progressively proves itself to not really be quite ordinary. The tension builds up until the climax is reached, signaling the end of the episode. Some people seem to consider short anime to be inherently bad, but I think...this duration works well with the horror genre. The fact that the story ends really quickly prevents us from getting distracted, which would nullify all the tension-building.The stories are very open to interpretation, as the reason why the events of the episode happened is never really explained. This can be unnerving, and even seem like a cheap way to write a story without having to think too much about it. It\'s probably true, but I think it also helps strenghtening the fear. The episodes start with an everyday situation that becomes abnormal because a supernatural being made its way into it, leaving the protagonist to wonder what exactly is happening and why. The fact that the threat\'s nature is unknown increases the sens of danger and the feeling of not knowing what to do. There are a few stories in which the side characters seem to understand the situation, but they never explain it to the protagonist, leaving them – and us – to face something we cannot comprehend.Characters:Each story has its own characters, the narrator being the only one who appears in every episode. As you can guess, we do not have much time to get to know them before the episode ends, but this is not really a problem because there simply is not much to learn about them. Those characters are not complex or remarkable in any way, acting like most people probably would if they were in their place. A lot of them are not even given a name and are simply introduced by the narrator as your average man, woman, little boy, ...Is that a bad thing? Not really. Each story shows you how some people can suddenly find themselves in a terrible and horrifying situation, and the fact that those people are awfully normal only increases the feeling that those stories could be real. They are happening in our world, to people who are just like us, so how can we be sure that they really are just stories?Visuals:Let\'s directly get to the main point: the animation. It can be a major turn-on or turn-off depending on how you see it for the simple reason that... well, there is actually nothing that could really be called ""animation"" in Yami Shibai. The visuals are made to mimic the style of the kamishibai, which is a style of storytelling that uses paper characters moving in front of a background. The movements are therefore very limited – for example, when someone talks, their lips don\'t move – and illusory, as the characters simply jump from one pose to another. But when the time comes for real movement, you\'ll definitely feel uneasy.The characters have a design that\'s quite realistic compared to most anime on the market which clearly helps setting a more serious mood. Most of the colours used are either dark and dull or reddish, contributing to the establishment of a eerie atmosphere.However, the art style varies from one episode to another, some being much prettier than others.Sound:The voice-acting is quite good, but also different from what you\'re probably used to. You won\'t hear your typical anime voice that no real japanese person has, but something closer to reality in the way the characters speak.The musics are fine, but rather discreet. The sinister atmosphere is mainly set using sound effects or a sudden silence.The ending is sung by Hatsune Miku, which is... very surprising. But – and it is maybe even more surprising – it actually fits the mood of the anime quite well, the robotic vocaloid voice giving the song some kind of strange tone.Enjoyment:So, did Yami Shibai find the miracle recipe to make a scary anime? Not completely.I found all the episodes – minus one – to be creepy, but the quality wasn\'t quite constant. While some stories were really nice and managed to frighten me, others were extremely weird, leaving me with a ""What did I just watch?"" feeling. Obviously, we are all very different when it comes to what we consider to be scary, and if some people will shiver in fear while watching this anime, others will just probably wait for the episode to end without batting an eye.On a side note, I\'d like to point out that most episodes contain a jumpscare. I admit that, well, I\'m not a fan of those, as I don\'t consider that making me jump is making me afraid. However, jumpscares are something that\'s rarely used in anime and, for this reason, I think it is quite remarkable.As a whole, I really liked Yami Shibai. It is different and, even though it isn\'t perfect, it is very interesting and entertaining.

If you recall i mentioned how tame the horror was. Which makes it a good choice for children to watch.

Yami Shibai was a refreshing take from the blood splatters, with short but effective story telling, very much like camp ghost stories with paper puppets.Each episode is a stand alone story, no more than 3 or 4 minutes long, focusing on a particular person who just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.  The stories mostly deal with ghosts, spirits and unknown creatures, never really clarifying exactly what is...happening, which only adds to the eerie confusion and fear of the unknown and unexplainable.The art and animation are brilliant for this series and type of story telling, completely surprising the audience by not using the typical anime-style designs and going for more story book type illustrations that reminded me of Junji Ito in some ways.  The characters move similar to stick puppets, bobbing and floating along according to the storytellers desire.  It really makes you feel like you are actually witnessing the 5 o'clock puppet show in the beginning of each episode.Everyone sounds like a normal person, no over hyped voice acting and the characters are portrayed well.  Tension is done well, the darkness and quiet of the series further adds to the atmosphere.  Episode 4 really had me holding my breath.I don't easily scare so none of the episodes managed to make me jump like it did for some, but I still enjoyed the overall creepiness of this show.  Because the episodes are around 4 minutes long I was able to enjoy it in one shot without putting off any daily responsibilities.  It was fun watching it alone, but I think it'd be even more fun watching with kids or a friend who scares easily. happening, which only adds to the eerie confusion and fear of the unknown and unexplainable.The art and animation are brilliant for this series and type of story telling, completely surprising the audience by not using the typical anime-style designs and going for more story book type illustrations that reminded me of Junji Ito in some ways.

The only thing scary about this series is the breakdance that the guy did in the last episode. (This somehow has 8 seasons but No game No Life S2 is still pending *sigh*)P.S: If you wanna watch it regardless I\'d suggest watching it with the ""its so bad that its good mindset"".(MAL wants me to write a longer review so... I don\'t know what...to do, guess ill just shit on this for a bit)Story: Is there a story? Not really. From the 3-4 episodes that I was able to bear watching, what I could figure out was that the anime does a good job of scaring you through its sloppy nonsensical writing.Art: While I wanna shit on this aspect as well... I guess it was okay-ish considering what they tried to go for. (But their desperate attempts to animated the jump scares give me nightmares where I\'m killed by being stabbed with cringe)Sound: Kinda decent sound, but I can see that they clearly cheaped out with the SFX. (not that good sound design could\'ve saved the series)Characters: It\'s an Anthology which means that it has a diverse set of unequally shitty stories. The characters are very deep...deeply flawed and unrelatable.

Naturally the impact varies from story to story and some of them could have perhaps benefited from slightly more time. The animation is very bare bones, but the unique style and good timing compensate for that quite nicely. As with most horror/spooky series, the sound is the most important aspect, in builduing tension and Yami Shibai does a good job, with the select, few sounds, it has to offer. The ending theme is also very nice.Fazit: Light, but fresh horror series, which is probably...worth the little time, that it is going to cost you. worth the little time, that it is going to cost you.', 'Before I begin, I must clarify three things. One - this is my first review on this site, so I don\'t expect it to be a great review or anything. Secondly, I\'ll be reviewing this like you\'d review Ani*Kuri 15, but only with the story. And finally, I don\'t get scared easily, so if I say an episode didn\'t scare me it shouldn\'t lower my ideas of rank.Art//8The art style in Yami Shibai is very unique and I absolutely adore it -- a different art style is something I really like in an anime. It fits well with this episodic anime, told as if...it were one in a book of horrors -- and in a way it certainly is. I think the rt style really only fits with this anime. It wouldn\'t fit in other gorey or scary animes, really. And that\'s just one of the many things I love about the art, but since I don\'t want to be repetitive I\'ll move on to the sound.Sound//7Of course, the sound is amazing too. The voices fit the characters and they definitely don\'t sound like characters from a moe anime or anything. I also like basically every other sound, as this anime seems to pay attention to detail in not just art but also in sound.Characters//7Oh, I would\'ve loved to rate this higher, but I would like to comment on some things after I get done with the things Yami Shibai does right with its characters. First of all, they feel like actual humans. Voices match up, art matches up, and the reactions they have are pretty appropriate for the situations. Granted, some characters are just.. quite stupid or get scared to easily. I guess since I wasn\'t scared through most episodes where the characters react in immense terror to their situations I am like this, but still, as mentioned at the top of this review I don\'t get scared easily. Aside from those minor flaws, the characters are great.Enjoyment//10I binge-watched all three seasons of this show and didn\'t stop for anything - To put it briefly, I love this show.Now for the episode reviews -- and no, they won\'t all be getting a gold medal. I won\'t delve deep into the episodes to avoid spoilers, so they\'ll be very brief.---The Talisman Woman//7It took me a while to realize what the woman\'s intentions were, and when it hit me later in the episode I still hadn\'t of thought that ending was coming. Nice episode, but with an alright jump-scare.Zanbai//8This episode was quite creepy, I must say. Especially with the chant at the end -- I don\'t know why, but it wasn\'t the voices that scared me and instead the movement. It was very, very ominous. The ending could\'ve been scarier, but I liked Zanbai a lot.The Family Rule//7I would\'ve rated this a six if the little boy didn\'t act like an actual little boy. He was very curious but I think his parents should have tried to help in the end, but they were probably paralyzed by fear. I\'ll leave that be and instead focus on how creepy those masks were -- aside from that, I wasn\'t even slightly frightened but I enjoyed the episode.Hair//9Very scary. I admit to not expecting that jump scare and it did get me, so I\'ll give it some points for that. Granted, I feel as if the protagonist was a little stupid or just way too brave for her own good - personally, I would\'ve ran away screaming. That was just creepy.The Next Floor//8I didn\'t expect that whole twist with the woman in the near-end and the eye scene freaked me out. It gave an odd, captivating feel of loneliness and dread and I wanted to see what happened to the husband. Again, great episode.The Overhead Rack//5I didn\'t care for this episode. The visuals and sound affects were creepy, no doubt, but I couldn\'t get into it. I definitely don\'t hate it though.Contradiction//10Very, very frightening visuals. The twist at the end was something I expected, but it still got me. This is my favorite and possibly the most frightening episode in this season.The Umbrella Goddess//7I liked this one, and the ""little boy"" scared me. However, our protagonist is an idiot, even if he is a young boy.Cursed//9Cursed has this weird feeling of hopelessness and it\'s somewhat chilling. I liked the ending and I\'d love an anime just based off of that one episode. I\'d like to say this was the most intriguing one right after Contradiction.The Moon//4Didn\'t scare me. I don\'t have a thing for monsters. Yes, I know, this was targeted at a Japanese audience with different tastes, but still, I dislike it. Hate? No, I don\'t hate it. It still has its redeeming qualities.Video//7Eh. The person didn\'t scare me, but the reactions and the end definitely were good. Even if the person in the video didn\'t frighten me, I still liked it.Tomonari//9That. Ending. Very, very, very creepy. I didn\'t want to look up at my ceiling for a very, very long time.The Tormentor//6As a season finale of sorts, my expectations were raised -- and I was sightly disappointed. Yes, the mystery was alluring and the scene where the boy sees the dancing.. whatever, yes, that was scary. But the jumpscare -- if you can even call it that -- was bland and I am only now realizing it was meant to be a jumpscare. Also, the ending made me laugh -- I\'m not sure why. it were one in a book of horrors -- and in a way it certainly is. I think the rt style really only fits with this anime.

Each episode is around 5 minutes long, but it works perfectly for the genre, as it leaves you wondering what the heck happened to the characters after the story.It's not the best thing ever, but I'd still recommend watching it if you're looking for something quick.Just a warning though, try to watch it when it's still light outside. "", 'I really enjoyed watching the first season of this show. Japanese horror is really something like no other. I don\'t know what it is that makes it so much scarier than Western horror that truly sends a shiver up my spine. Perhaps it\'s because us no good Americans tend to meddle in things that shouldn\'t be meddled with in the first place. Going directly into haunted house or abandoned asylums, opening locked trunks and secret diaries that say ""KEEP OUT, DO NOT OPEN!"" I think a part of me when watching this thinks, ""See whatever happens to you, you deserve...it.""But with Japanese horror it\'s all about being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Rarely is the cruel punishment handed out due to meddlesome Scooby-Doo teenagers but a tired businessman who decided to stop at a ramen shop. Or a housewife who stopped to have polite conversation with a stranger. Japanese horror scares me because it reminds me of the premise of ""Drag Me to Hell"" where the protagonist was cursed to go to hell because she was doing her job and didn\'t provide her client with a loan to save her house. See? Wrong place, wrong time, and certainly the wrong person.In my opinion the best episode in this season was ""The Next Floor"". Sooo eerie, sooooo creepy, where you really didn\'t know what was going to happen next. That\'s another thing that separates Eastern and Western horror. You always know that in Western horror that whatever is out to get you is going to kill you. But in Eastern horror, it\'s more about the \'Why?\' rather than \'How?\'. You and the main character are truly one when you\'re just as scared as to what comes around the corner or what is the strange image in the distance. I highly, HIGHLY recommend this first season. :) it.""But with Japanese horror it\'s all about being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

One thing to note though, Yami Shibai rely heavily on cheap jumpscares, which is understandable since every story has to be put in a super constraining time limit of more or less four minutes.That's also what irks me the most. Why have all of these incredibly horrifying stories that will definitely keep some viewers up at night but butcher it by putting scary imagery with loud music in the background every time? Imagine how the series will go on if they...try to build up the atmosphere and keeping the viewers on edge with longer episodes.That is also the reason why the characters feel so flat. They don't have any meaningful reason to be in the episode other than to probably die by the end of it.Nevertheless, it's a classic traditional horror stories that your Asian moms would tell you so that you don't sleep in late, or go out past sunset, or do you homework, etc. It does makes you feeling nostalgic if you grew up with these kinds of stories.

It is very interesting and also can be really creepy. Creepy in a less forward scary way, and more in a suspenseful way.The historical components are probably the best thing about the series, but from my personal knowledge I think some of them are not entirely accurate and made up for the purpose of the plot. I wish they would have leaned into this side a bit more because as-is it sort of falls flat as a horror genre for me.Personally, the art style was...really distracting and made me feel like I was having a seizure which added to the story of course, but also detracted from it as well. This, paired with the above makes it so it doesn't meet expectations as hoped. really distracting and made me feel like I was having a seizure which added to the story of course, but also detracted from it as well.

Hataraki Man,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1592/Hataraki_Man,"['Characters/DevelopmentBegining with the flow of things, it was done quite well within the eleven episodes there are of the show. Each one basically focuses onto certain problems the characters must deal with, or a certain task set that needs to be done and the issues that arise while doing so. The characters emotions and hardships of work are displayed during these times, and also focuses on some of their lifes out of work. Some of the character development is done through thoughts, showing off their stress during work or sometimes questioning themselves why they actually work so hard. On very few occasions we get some...flashbacks to explain why a character has views and feelings that you see within that current episode.The relationship between Hiroko and her boyfriend is first shown as a simple one, something rather typical and quite relaxed, which soon develops into something quite different as the pair begin to focus more on their work rather than the relationship between the two. Dates are missed, and long periods of romance lacking days await in the latter episodes which has some effect on the pair and causes more problems to arise within the show. Not all the episodes however focus on the main character, but instead explain the roles and personality of the other characters, the jobs they do and any emotion involved. Talking about the character though, each one is unique within the workplace and rather likable and you get to know them more. You&rsquo;ll somewhat learn their role within the company sooner or later, and attitudes involved, each with dealings of their very own problems.Animation/SceneryArtwise, everything has been done pretty well. Character designs are brilliant as each one has their own distinctive looks making them more appealling and realistic. Such details from their clothes and makeup they wear, facial structure, hairstyles and even the eyes give them the unique touch between them all for both the males and females, unlike some shows where female characters can usually look the same.Colours are vibrant and pretty bright throughout the series, which blends together quite ncely. Nothing really stands out of the ordinary and the colours are balanced between each other with some smooth transitions and shadings with make the art work visually look well made and appealling. This even flows perfectly well into the background art with some realistic looking structures and designs for both interior and exterior locations, where lighting and shading helps a great deal for depth using beautiful tones. The bright colours can look quite exotic during those sunny days during the series, while night life is approached will with plenty of darker tones with some hints of dark blue in them, while the other city lights add more light to the scenes. Foregrounds and the characters are also quite bold in appearance, while having some smooth, light lines between them and the backgrounds while looking great.Animationwise, is surprisingly decent for this type of show, where the general themes aren&rsquo;t of sword fighting or gun shootouts, but of pure drama and emotional life events that take place. However this is one of the shows highlights which keeps a more modern and realistic feel to the series, and a job well done in that area.Audio/MusicThis isn&rsquo;t a strong area of mine to comment and discuss about so I&rsquo;ll be brief. Voice acting is generally well done throughout, with a well chosen actor per character of which have fitting voices and can reflect their personalities quite well especially the stress and emtion that goes through Hiroko which Rie Tanaka does a good job of. Other such sound effects are pretty moderate, used and timed well so no complaints in that area. Can&rsquo;t exactly remember any of the background music so I guess it&rsquo;s quite moderate with nothing really rememberable. I did like the music themes in this one however, especially the opening which has a good sound and tune to it, flowing pretty well with the sequence.ConclusionGood approach to the hardships of having a career while keeping a relationship strong and the types of problems involved. Good flowing story with some interesting characters and developments between them. Decent visuals and animations throughout which remain appealing. This show isn&rsquo;t for everyone out there and best watched with an open mind about life with some decent drama and emotion involved.

Talking about the character though, each one is unique within the workplace and rather likable and you get to know them more. You&rsquo;ll somewhat learn their role within the company sooner or later, and attitudes involved, each with dealings of their very own problems.Animation/SceneryArtwise, everything has been done pretty well. Character designs are brilliant as each one has their own distinctive looks making them more appealling and realistic. Such details from their clothes and makeup they wear, facial structure, hairstyles and even the eyes give them the unique touch between them all for both the males and females, unlike some shows where female characters can usually look the same.Colours are vibrant and pretty bright throughout the series, which blends together quite ncely. Nothing really stands out of the ordinary and the colours are balanced between each other with some smooth transitions and shadings with make the art work visually look well made and appealling. This even flows perfectly well into the background art with some realistic looking structures and designs for both interior and exterior locations, where lighting and shading helps a great deal for depth using beautiful tones. The bright colours can look quite exotic during those sunny days during the series, while night life is approached will with plenty of darker tones with some hints of dark blue in them, while the other city lights add more light to the scenes. Foregrounds and the characters are also quite bold in appearance, while having some smooth, light lines between them and the backgrounds while looking great.Animationwise, is surprisingly decent for this type of show, where the general themes aren&rsquo;t of sword fighting or gun shootouts, but of pure drama and emotional life events that take place. However this is one of the shows highlights which keeps a more modern and realistic feel to the series, and a job well done in that area.Audio/MusicThis isn&rsquo;t a strong area of mine to comment and discuss about so I&rsquo;ll be brief. Voice acting is generally well done throughout, with a well chosen actor per character of which have fitting voices and can reflect their personalities quite well especially the stress and emtion that goes through Hiroko which Rie Tanaka does a good job of. Other such sound effects are pretty moderate, used and timed well so no complaints in that area. Can&rsquo;t exactly remember any of the background music so I guess it&rsquo;s quite moderate with nothing really rememberable. I did like the music themes in this one however, especially the opening which has a good sound and tune to it, flowing pretty well with the sequence.ConclusionGood approach to the hardships of having a career while keeping a relationship strong and the types of problems involved. Good flowing story with some interesting characters and developments between them. Decent visuals and animations throughout which remain appealing. This show isn&rsquo;t for everyone out there and best watched with an open mind about life with some decent drama and emotion involved. An enjoyable watch for eleven episodes.', 'Hataraki Man was an anime that caught me by surprise. The anime deals with themes of work, overwork, dissatisfaction with work, finding your purpose in work, ultimately loving your job, and even death. It is a more mature anime—not that the anime has any lewd content or even ""fan service""—but it is mature in its themes and setting; the characters are age 22-and up, and the anime greatly paints them as life-like as possible; Japanese men and women in the workplace, with thoughts, desires, anxieties, &c., and their associations with each other. To remain simple, I\'ll detail the main traits:I found the story...outstanding, in that it revolves around many characters who are involved professionally with each other, while the entirety maintained its focus on the protagonist. Each of her (Hiroko Matsukata, the main character) is equally represented in some way, and you become acquainted with each person around her. At least, I can definitely say that I did, and I appreciated knowing her environment, and how realistic each profile was made for those around her. Having said this, her part in the series, the main part, is never sidelined, as each person has to work with each other in their projects. They affect one another, and this adds to the depth of this very realistic tale. There are few moments of drama, everything which flows smoothly and appropriately. As I said, the realism will not deter, but draw. By the end, I found myself at odds with the decisions of the characters, but I realized that this was not a fault with the creators of this anime, but that that is who those characters were, and their respective decisions are all their own. I respected that.The art can be difficult to review, as the anime was released in 2006, and I am writing this in 2015; certainly the time has afforded greater advancements in art style and animation. Nevertheless, I can accurately say that the lowest point of this anime is its animation. Although not much of it is starkly bad, certain scenes show flaws, but very few. In any case, I was far too caught up in the progression of the story to mind, and, depending on what sort of viewer you are, you will be as well.The sound and music, I found, are perfect. The opening and ending songs fit the anime very well, as they speak about both work and a woman\'s personal thoughts on her life; her desires for love in a relationship, which certainly plays an important role in this story. I discovered Sambomaster through this anime, and their two songs (used as inserts) sound amazing when used. In the somber scenes, the music appropriately switches to correct-sounding music. Nothing out of the ordinary, perhaps, but it works, and it works well.The characters are the triumph of this anime. They progress very well, and are constant; their desires are all made known through certain small scenes of introduction with each. They deal with life and the troubles thereof with as much emotion and reasoning as you would expect from those around you. As I said, they\'re given equal representation, and their characteristics are as if they really are people you would meet in your everyday life. Each character has a past, a present, and a future; their desires are not bland, but realistic: they want to be the best at what they do. The usual characters which range on the overtly cute to those meant for comic relief will not be found here, and that is one of the reasons I enjoyed this anime: the characters are unique in that they are almost alive, and never fake.Perhaps the reason I enjoyed this anime was due to how I related to it. This is something I noticed from the first episode, how this anime appeals to the older viewers: viewers who have jobs and have to deal with the stresses associated with finances, work (struggles with fellow employees and bosses and timelines and &c.), disillusionment with the future, and maintaining a good romantic relationship. I myself am 25 years old as I write this, and I am surprised how interested I became of this anime, but then wondered why there aren\'t more of these bits of realism. Nevertheless, there are many aspects to enjoy from this short anime, and different people may enjoy it for various reasons.Overall, I loved it. I loved every episode, and there are many great things which are not found in this review. It does not have action, but the actions of the daily, work-stressed individuals which keep a business going; it is not a love story, but the people in this anime are just that—people, and, thus, have desires just like the majority of the people on earth regarding romance and love, desires which are stifled at times by their busy lives, to where they wonder if they\'ll even have sex again.This may not be an anime for everyone, but if there is a certain person I aim this anime, I point it towards those more mature fans who can appreciate a slice of life that represents the realities of life, while maintaining a good story with a good, hardworking protagonist.It\'s short, but definitely comprehensive.

I hope you enjoy it.', ""As this is a slice of life show, there's not really much story to speak of.  It's more episodic than arc-based.  The most important aspect to this show is probably the way Matsukata's ambitiousness clashes with her life as a woman and her desire (and, at times, need) to be feminine.  While this is mostly positive, there are a few moments where the femininity contradicts the ambitiousness, rather than contrasting with it.  In other words, there are some points where Matsukata is portrayed as less of a strong, independent, struggling woman and more of a vulnerable, weak, victimized woman.  While...disappointing, these moments are few and the series is ultimately more inspiring than off-putting.Matsukata is ultimately the only character that gets any real focus; the other characters get at best part of one episode focused on them, then a couple lines here and there afterwards.  This actually becomes repetitive, as a character is introduced, portrayed a certain way, then revealed to have some thought or emotion which contrasts with how they're portrayed.  This type of motif might have been more successful at entertaining if the viewer were given more time with the character, so as to develop some empathy.  While this is used to good effect at some points, the series would most likely be better if there was no pretense of depth for all but a few of the characters.The pacing is decent; it plods along a little bit near the end, and in the final episode there's a bizarre repeating of scenes.  Presumably, the intent is to show some events and actions and then follow up by revealing the circumstances behind them; but since it replays the relevant scenes in their entirety it looks suspiciously like the final episode was originally too short, and then padded to fill time.  This very well may not be the case, but whatever the intent was, the effect is unwelcome and detracts from the experience.Ultimately, the most appealing aspect of this show is the philosophical.  It is somewhat enjoyable, but the lack of screen time for most of the characters makes empathizing with them difficult, resulting in what feels like filler. disappointing, these moments are few and the series is ultimately more inspiring than off-putting.Matsukata is ultimately the only character that gets any real focus; the other characters get at best part of one episode focused on them, then a couple lines here and there afterwards.

No matter what genre, studio, director, or whatever is attached to an individual product, I must always feel like something important is happening. There are different ways you can make something feel important, but it generally needs to make me thing. It needs to make me laugh. It needs to feel like the team behind the anime gives a crap. And before people bring up how the team behind that Brynhildr anime was trying their heart out, I mean give a crap in a...way that isn’t stupid.So that brings me to my Secret Santa: Hataraki Man, which I elected for because the other options were Vision of Escaflowne and Kamichu, and the only way you’re going to get me to watch a Sunrise mecha or a slice-of-life show revolving around some little girl falling in love and experiencing the benefits of a religion I have no interest in is if you gave me the Bernie Lomax treatment of killing me and making my corpse do the most out-of-character things. To be fair, I did try Escaflowne because I thought its “classic” status and the era that it came from would at least make analyzing what’s wrong about the show fun, but nothing about what the show did right or wrong clicked with me and I stopped watching after the third episode.Not that Hataraki Man was a better option, because it turned out to be one of those slice-of-life shows that is simply what it is: an anime about a working woman who ruins her social life through taking her career too seriously. Most office entertainment like Office Space, Parks and Recreation, or Mobile Police Patlabor would use that premise to leap into some humor, drama, or good insight into the working environment, but Hataraki Man chooses to go the route of insultingly having none of these, reminding me of Shirobako if at least got the basics right, but only got the basics right. Throughout most of the show, I’m watching this woman work in a magazine company and all I have to say is “why?” Why am I supposed to care that she’s ruining her life through work dedication, and why am I supposed to care about her dedication to work itself? And before people give me that “because I can relate to her” bullshit, let me remind you that this is fiction! I go to fiction in order to get something I can’t get in real life. I go to anime to get something I can’t get from other mediums. Like Pee Wee Hermann, I don’t want to watch something I’ve already lived through.The first half or so of the anime does have structure: each episode, one of the employees interacts with our “hataraki man” protagonist, Hiroko, and we learn more about her, them, and how they perceive each other throughout a 22-minute runtime. Unfortunately, because the show never really attempts to be funny, never tries to make a big deal out of their interactions, and doesn’t even really tell me anything all that unique character-wise, each episode comes off as rejected filler from an early UPN sitcom. They do try to sprinkle drama here and there regarding Hiroko’s social life, but it’s the same stuff you see in every office story with no unique spin to it and it doesn’t really even build up to anything resembling an overarching story in the grand scheme of things. Even when the show gets more dramatic in the second half regarding Hiroko’s apartment getting flooded or her “even more workaholic” boyfriend, nothing about the show makes my brain function because it never really goes beyond the premise that was laid out to us, which in of itself ain’t that interesting. And just to give this anime one final kick to the balls, the animation is technically good, but it’s poor in terms of visual metaphors. I can’t recall one time the cinematography even came close to making me feel like I’m in an office environment.Hataraki Man is one of those early noitamina shows that most people have forgotten in order to remember stuff like Honey and Clover or Paradise Kiss. I see people remembering it as some cult classic that deserves to be looked at more in relation to those works, but after watching this, I think the reason it was forgotten whilst the other two survived in viewers’ memory is because it wasn’t good and the other two were. Paradise Kiss in particular was funny, dramatic, used the visuals and writing to give me a good insight into the fashion industry, had an awesome ending, and did it with a high school girl to boot. Hataraki Man came, went, and despite having an adult women in her late 20s as the main, didn’t give me anything at all.

Inazuma Eleven Go,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10507/Inazuma_Eleven_Go,"['Inazuma Eleven Go is set ten years after the iconic Inazuma Japan lift the Football Frontier International trophy against the Little Gigant in the final. Matsukaze Tenma is our protagonist in the show looking to enter the Raimon Junior High football club.The premise of the show is quite different from its prequel, ten years in the future all the schools are managed by an organization called ""Fifth Sector"" who negotiate all the results of a soccer match and go by the belief that all schools should get equal attention when it comes to soccer. This restricts the club who are naturally at a higher...level to other, such as Raimon, to not be able to play at their best. The results of the game are given to the teams and whatever the decision taken by the Fifth Sector the match should provide the exact same result and if it ignores its decision the club may get in danger of being disbanded. Raimon, because of its massive boost of success thanks to the majority of players in the Inazuma Japan team, is been getting talented players who transfer to the school in hopes of playing for them. The teams do as the Fifth Sector order them to but after Tenma joins up things begin to change as he tries to make everyone understand that this is not what true soccer actually is where there is no passion and hard work involved. Slowly as the show progresses, Endou Mamoru is appointed as their coach and the team continues to defy Fifth Sector\'s orders and play their own soccer.There\'s also some new changes added to Inazuma Eleven Go with the introductions of ""Keshins"" or ""Avatars"" which is the soul embodied within a person. Avatars are constantly used in soccer matches as a means of shooting and even more for goalkeeping, as they tend to provide more power to the person. Personally, I\'m not a huge fan of Avatars and they\'re a little too fancy for me, and I still like the old school simple Hissatsu Techniques but still they\'re a lot of fun, no doubt. Avatar is first seen from Tsurugi Kyousuke, who is a ""Seed"" hell bent on destroying the Raimon Soccer club. ""Seed"" is the name given to the players trained specially by the Fifth Sectors and sent to different schools and who can use their Avatars at will. Although not every Seed can use an avatar, the high-class training given to them by Fifth Sector makes them a formidable opponent. A seed is present in each and every one of the schools across the nation and they have the duty too oversee if the club is obeying the orders of the Fifth Sector or not.Inazuma Eleven Go starts extremely slowly from its first few episodes so I advice you to not expect more action and fun, free-flowing soccer right away. It takes it time to get going as Raimon continues to defy but it gradually keeps getting exciting once it reaches the Holy Road Tournament, which is the same as the Football Frontier Tournament in where top schools across the nation compete to be the best in the country.There are a lot of new faces in the Raimon Junior High and the main one of them is Matsukaze Tenma. Tenma is seen to be saved by Gouenji in a flash back scene, where he kicks the ball and hits a big block of wood which would have hit Tenma when he tries to save a puppy as a small kid. The ball has a Raimon Junior High mark in it and he keeps the ball with him and hopes to join Raimon once he grows up. The next character is Tsurugi Kyousuke, who is sent to Raimon as their seed but instead intends on destroying their club completely. However as the series progresses and as Tsurugi takes part in most of the matches, he learns to admire his teammates and then joins them in their battle against the Fifth Sector. Tsurugi plays as a striker. Shindou Takuto is the captain of this new Raimon team and his role is as a midfielder. Shindou is seen to take out his Avatar when he is faced with Tsurugi at the start of the series and is the first non-seed to succeed using his Avatar in the series.T-Pistonz+KMC continue to do a great job on the openings but the soundtracks in the series are just about alright and nothing too special. The voice acting is decent as well.Inazuma Eleven Go doesn\'t live up to his prequel at all but all in all it\'s still enjoyable once it hits the mark. You may end up hating the series as a sequel but then again it\'s set ten years in the future and has completely new characters for the team and in that aspect Inazuma Eleven Go is the starting installment with two more sequels to it; Chrono Stone and Galaxy. I\'d recommend you end it at episode 127 in Inazuma Eleven but if you\'re a hardcore fan of it and want more of the cool hissatsu techniques with new characters and are also willing to watch the sequels as well then you can give it a GO. (Pun intended).Sorry. level to other, such as Raimon, to not be able to play at their best.

(Pun intended).Sorry.', ""Inazuma Eleven GO! isn't as good as the original, but it's still fun. It's ten years after the original and soccer is run by Fifth Sector, who decides who wins and who loses in advance. To go against them is to get your school shut down... apparently. Yeah, it's dumb. Dumb like a fox! But half the fun of this show is how dumb it is. It's good-naturedly silly and they do try so very hard. The beginning is hard going since nobody but Tenma is willing to challenge Fifth Sector so there's a lot of whining, but once that's over with the plot is...as fun as the other series.It does have two major problems however.First off there are the Avatars. These basically take the place of the hissatsu techniques, although they have a few of those as well. but the difference is they're just not as fun. Instead of shouting some random Engrish word and having magic appear they now shout out said name and a giant creature appears behind them to fight for them. It's less fun and more easily exhausted, especially since they don't have more than one animation which takes forever and seems to need to be replayed every time.Secondly there are the characters. I have no problem with Tenma. Even if he is an Endou knockoff he's a good one. There's also Tsurugi, who has the amazing ability to play soccer without taking his hands out of his pockets, Shinsuke, who is like a pink bouncy Yoda, and Shindou, whose ability to direct players through music makes him an awesome captain. They're all good. They're also the only characters in it. The other teammates get no screentime and no personality. Even these guys have precious little to do except for Tenma, and most of his story is over once he gets everyone on his side. The villains are disposable too, and rushed through too fast to have any sense of drama. In general the fights seemed rushed too, as if they couldn't bother to put any effort into them. I suppose the formula had to dry up sometime.So if you liked the original you'll probably like this one. If you didn't then this one won't change your mind. as fun as the other series.It does have two major problems however.First off there are the Avatars.

Is it me or is this ""new"" Raimon kind of the same as the old one? They have a big guy too...I felt like I was watching the original all over again and yet...something changed?The main character now is a player and not a goal-keeper, inovative? I wouldn\'t say so, but it is nice to see the field from another point-of-view...Sound...The opening is good and enjoyable, at some times the soundtrack seems a little too dramatic for the show that it is...I would espect the whole ""orchestra"" idea from an action / thriller show, not from a soccer based anime...The voice-acting is good but like I said, adults do not differ from the kids they were in Inazuma Eleven...Character - 6/10Clones, clones...they all look like clones...Tenma is a rip-off of Endou, he has the same attitude and ""love"" for soccer and the energy to make his team-mates ""pumped up""...Then we have Tsurugi, which appears to be a cool character but doesn\'t do much...Shindou, at first I thought he would end up as some melancholic kid who cried over everything but it was actually good to see him ""spark up"" a bit and now he is playing ""actual soccer""...Not many characters had the chance to show off their cool techniques or personalities so, I don\'t have much to say...Oh, and Endou didn\'t change at all, besides the fact that he looks calmer...Enjoyment - 7/10Even with all the elements above and the feeling that this show won\'t be much different from the other one...I find myself checking back for subbed episodes and watching them happily...I am enjoying it and I hope I will enjoy it even more once more characters shows up and the plot thickens a bit...I enjoyed the previous season and this one (Even without much inovation to bring) promises to be as enjoyable as the last one...Let us just hope they keep us busy with the episodes...Overall - 6.2If you liked the previous season, you might enjoy this one...if you are looking for something more realistic, don\'t watch this and go watch ""Captain Tsubasa"", if you enjoy slow-passed comedy and action, you might want to watch it...Either way, it isn\'t a great anime but it will keep you busy and away from all the other anime that like to bring ""ecchi"" to everything xD The art doesn\'t change much, even when the characters are grown-up, they still look like kids...The hairstyle, clothes and even their height might change, but their voices remain the same and you can still see the ""little kids"" they were before, even with the ""adult look"" they claim to have...One thing I do enjoy is the variety of characters, all with unique hairstyles and looks but...what is that?

And, I\'ve been sorely diasappointed. This series falls way below expectations in almost every way possible.Art:9The only silver lining in the otherwise dark cloud, the art has improved. Better animation and art than the first.Sound:5Voice acting was top notch. Unfortunately the music score, which sets the feel for the series was.... horrible.Although the later themes were better, but \'Ten made Todoke\'? Seriously? What\'s wrong with T pistonz and KMC! And lets no even talk about...the EDs. These songs cannot even hold a candle to ""Ryuusei Boy\' or \'Maji Bomber\' (or even \'Seishun Oden\', for that matter.)Story and Characters: 6Being a kids anime, I didn\'t expect much of the story. Although they\'ve tried to make Go darker ad edgier,the whole Fifth Sector suspense is not half as impactful as say, the climax of the Aliea Arc. Just the same old formula of ""organisations trying to control sakka"".Moving on to the characters.. It was nice to see the old ones return- we got to know what happened to them after the FFI, which was refreshing. The new characters, unfortunately, seem to be like the same characters mish-mash.Tenma proved to be the bane of the series- his personaity was a complete copy of that of Endou\'s. It was like watching Endou say those positive, encouraging things... except in Tenma\'s case, they sounded banal- it was nothing new.And what I find annoying is that even the matches seemed repititive (maybe after watching all those international level FFI matches, school level matches might seenm to be tad boring). I remember skipping all the match sequences- because most of them ended with Tenma (who else) giving hackneyed soliloques and speeches and everyone magically ""falling in love with soccer"".Even though I\'m a huge football/soccer fan, and I never minded Endou\'s speeches because they made sense......To me, Tenma\'s ramblings are nothing but pure peurile garbage.Enjoyment: 7Salvaged by the old characters.Overall: 6Verdict: IE GO is, especially in the beginning, very slow. Although the things do become a bit interesting, but believe me, halfay through, you\'ll realise that the only reason you\'ll watch the series sincerely willl  be to catch a glimpse of your favourite characters in the first series the EDs.

Marking the beginning of a new generation, it's one of my favorite seasons! In this season, new characters make their appearance, such as Arion Sherwind (Tenma Matsukaze), Riccardo Di Rigo (Takuto Shindou), Victor Blade (Kyousuke Tsurugi), Jean-Pierre Lapin (Shinsuke Nishizono), Sol Daystar (Taiyou Amemiya), Gabriel Garcia (Kirino Ranmaru), Skie Blue (Aoi Sorano), Ryoma Nishiki, and Bailong (Hakuryuu), thus embodying the new generation of Raimon. It's always a pleasure to see the iconic old characters again, even if they take more of a backseat, which is completely normal. Additionally, Raimon Middle School is...brand new thanks to the success and legacy of Mark and his friends.One might think that this season is the same as the first season, meaning we have a new team, participating in a tournament (in this case, the Holy Road), and the plot repeats itself, but not at all! The Fifth Sector plays a central role in this new season by imposing strict rules and manipulating match results. The Fifth Sector claims to act for the good of football, by preventing level disparities between teams and ensuring player safety. But in reality, it stifles the creativity, passion, and sportsmanship of young footballers, who must comply with its orders or face sanctions. This system is an insult to football, as it denies the fundamental values of the sport, such as fair play, respect, self-improvement, and the joy of playing. It turns football into a rigged spectacle, where players are mere pawns serving obscure interests. It deprives spectators of the emotion and surprise that come from an unpredictable and fiercely contested match.This system bears resemblance to reality, especially regarding match-fixing scandals that have hit Italian football. Indeed, several Serie A players are currently under investigation for participating in illicit sports betting on underground platforms. Some of them are even suspected of influencing match outcomes in exchange for money or favors. These illegal practices undermine the integrity and credibility of Italian football, which has already been tarnished by similar scandals in the past. They jeopardize the future of Calcio, risking the loss of trust from its supporters and partners.Raimon's role in the fight against the Fifth Sector is crucial and inspiring. Raimon is one of the few clubs openly opposing the Fifth Sector, refusing to follow suit like many formidable opponents who are either under Fifth Sector control or allied with its cause. The team also faces the threat of the Dragon Alliance, a secret team formed by the Fifth Sector to eliminate the Rebellion. Raimon represents the hope and resistance of all young footballers who want to change the system and restore true football. Raimon is supported by former players from the previous generation like Mark Evans, Axel Blaze, and Jude Sharp, who experienced the glory and joy of football. Raimon is also followed by many fans who admire its courage and determination. Raimon symbolizes the football revolution aimed at overthrowing the Fifth Sector and freeing the world's most popular sport.Among significant innovations, the concept of the Fighting Spirit (Keshin) is an original and fascinating addition to the Inazuma Eleven GO universe. It's a manifestation of the strength and will of football players, allowing them to transform into mythical or legendary creatures with extraordinary powers. It adds an epic and spectacular dimension to football matches, turning them into true battles between overpowering beings. It also helps develop the personality and character of the characters, who must learn to master their Fighting Spirit, evolve it, and synchronize it with their teammates. The Fighting Spirit is a symbol of the passion and courage of players who spare no effort to achieve their dreams. brand new thanks to the success and legacy of Mark and his friends.One might think that this season is the same as the first season, meaning we have a new team, participating in a tournament (in this case, the Holy Road), and the plot repeats itself, but not at all!

I have seen a lot of garbage anime - but rarely have I seen such a garbage story. Scripted and in advance decided football matches that are so unbearable to watch you might as well skip every single one of them as you have to sit through match after match where the team that was being told to lose will just stand on the field watch the opponent score goals, do nothing and at best just feel down about it.It does not help that you have...to watch the main character being the only one (later on one of the few) on the team that wants and tries to win regardless, instead his own teammates actively give their best to lose, hinder him to win them the match and constantly talk down to him. - Yes, they are just silly children and yes, this is an anime but again, it doesn\'t make any of this more bearable or easier to watch.A ""holy emperor"" (a child) deciding which of the two teams wins and loses, even decides the exact score the match needs to end with made all the scripted matches completely pointless to watch or get excited about.There is a lot of character development happening yes, but in no way does any of that make these matches any more bearable to watch. And in no way would I ever want to recommend Go to anyone. Watch the previous season/arc (Inazuma Eleven), that one is amazing. If you still want to give it a try, I highly suggest to skip at least the first dozen episodes. to watch the main character being the only one (later on one of the few) on the team that wants and tries to win regardless, instead his own teammates actively give their best to lose, hinder him to win them the match and constantly talk down to him. - Yes, they are just silly children and yes, this is an anime but again, it doesn\'t make any of this more bearable or easier to watch.A ""holy emperor"" (a child) deciding which of the two teams wins and loses, even decides the exact score the match needs to end with made all the scripted matches completely pointless to watch or get excited about.There is a lot of character development happening yes, but in no way does any of that make these matches any more bearable to watch.

The only way to leave the war is to serve out three years or pay a $1.5 million fine - deserters are shot down...by their comrades.  It's not a spellbinding story, but has enough substance to allow the artwork and the spectacular animation sequences to hold your attention.From the detailed drawing of various aircrafts - Mirage 2AE, Crusaders, F-14 Tomcats, Tigershark AE, to the brilliant dogfight sequences and explosions, for action junkies it's very enjoyable.  The characters too are sharply drawn, and the quality of the fight sequences are captivating.The sound, well, like the Gundam franchise, Area 88 uses a blend of electronica and rock for the aerial battle scenes, so we don't really get a taste of the sound of aircraft engines, it's like watching F-1 races on mute.  However, the music choice is quite appropriate and adds to the pulsating effect of the dogfights.There isn't a lot of character development.  Except for Kazama Shin, we don't learn a lot about the supporting characters.  Yes, through the emotional turmoil of a war, there's scope for cathartic outpouring, and portrayal of the horrors of fighting, but it stops there.  Just when you think you might find out more about a character, the storyline stops pursuing the train of thought.  Nevertheless, there are some interesting side characters who add to the tension and even laughter!Personally, I really enjoyed this anime, and the OVA series.  The fighter jets, the technical precision, the dogfights, are quite realistic but drawn beautifully and is a treat to watch with booming sound on a large screen.  If you liked Yukikaze, you'll like this too.  It's no masterpiece, but it's short and excellent for a weekend viewing.  The only complaint is that there isn't any sense of closure.  You'll need to read the manga to get that.  A strong recommendation to action junkies, and airplane and mecha fans. by their comrades.

To me it's one of the greatest Anime ever made. So to say I went into this version nervous would be an understatement. I mean could it live up to it's predecessor or would it pale in comparison?Well after having marathoned the series well inside 24 hours I can honestly say this version at the very least captures the spirit of the original. The tone of the series is much the same but it's not without some issues. The main issue I had is this TV remake is missing a bunch of the high...points in the original OVA's story and alot of the details. The original OVA crescendo's at many points throughout and this version simply does not. To give an example take the Canyon mission, in the OVA this is a really big event and the tension ramps up moment by moment from mission reveal all the way to completion. In this series it just does not receive the same buildup, the incredibly risky venture of flying through this Canyon at night and the reasons why they must do this are all just left out. Even the difficulty of the mission is mostly not touched upon, at least not in the same way. In a microcosm this example sums up most of the problems I have with this version, it's less dramatic moment to moment.But its clear the series had a different vision in mind, and in many ways a different tale to tell. I've not read the Manga so I don't know if this series is more accurate or neither adaptation matches it. I do know though that Area 88 2004 is not quite the same as Area 88 1985. The structure of the story is much different, the OVA is very melodramatic and the TV series is more of a character study. There are many other changes too, the TV series has a few new characters and leaves out many others. Similarly entire events just don't happen in the TV series that happen in the OVA, this goes so far as certain characters remaining alive. Even the events that do happen across both are often altered to present the same event but in a very different way. The ending to the TV series is also drastically different, not just in story but also in characters actions and motivations, leaving a very different aftertaste.I'll just touch quickly on these things also... The CG planes were actually pretty good and certainly better than I expected. I was very worried about this aspect of the show prior to viewing but I think the team they got to do them did a good job, especially for early 2004. Next the sound design on the planes also seemed to be on point which really adds to this version just like it did in the original OVA. But I wasn't so hot on the character design changes, I mean yeah obviously this series was made almost 20 years later but Shins hair and overall design is much better in the OVA compared to how he looks in this series where he looks like he just walked out of an episode of YuGiOh at times. Finally there's the OST and this was a pretty big disappointment, I knew going in that the OST was now mainly electronica but that didn't change the fact that it was pretty underwhelming. Not terrible but it's a HUGE downgrade on the OVA's OST. In this version the OST is just sorta there, occasionally adding to the atmosphere but very rarely. The Opening/Ending themes were also both pretty lackluster.So yeah there are many changes and I will say now that the original OVA is still the superior series, in fact if I hadn't seen it my opinion on this new version may have been drastically different from what it is. I believe the 2004 version is still a great series, the characters are still very interesting and likable, the action is still mostly great and as someone with adoration for the OVA I still enjoyed seeing the series through a different lens.

This show is underrated.Being ranked #1600+, it really deserves better spot.That's not saying this show is greatest show ever, but it is really good at what it does.STORYWhen show first started I was kinda confused with happenings. It's about area 88, a base for mercenary pilots fighting in some war. Which war it is is never told. Some might find that stupid, but the whole war is only second to true story, which is about a pilot Shin Kazama and photographer Shinjou.ARTWell, show is aired in 2004, means graphics could have been better....They are still awesome at some moments, when portraiting the sun, the deset and the emotions. Dogfights could have used more polishing though. Every fight seemed the same. There are few different scenes, but mostly repetition of the same.SoundIf you like action-techno stuff, you will love this show. Show had great opening, and mediocre ending song. Soundtrack was mostly good, but suffered from same problem art has. Repetition. Also, I must point out to one problem with soundtrack. Sometimes it was completely out of place.CharacterStrongest part of the show in my opinion. Shin is portraited just as he should be: strong, smart, yet somewhat sad person. And art does its job on him perfectly. Other bigger and smaller characters grow more and more as show progresses. There are no sudden changes or unexpected turns from them. They are the same people they were from beginning to the end, with only their life experience changing them. There are no one-time speaches in this show to turn someone around. There are speaches, but nothing that would change a person. Much more like a real world situations.EnjoymentI enjoyed in this show most of the time. As always, I'll leave this category without saying much because each person has different tastes and enjoys in different things.OverallGreat show with only some flaws such as repetitiveness, not so good art and missing story parts. If you like dog fights, not really realistic, but still, with characters which are great pilots but still need help when faced 1vs3, so they're not Gods, than this show is for you.If you like main characters which are badass in what they're doing, but are still both nice, gentle and caring, this show is for you.Give this show a try, you might find yourselves pleasantly surprised.

In one episode were Shin narrowly misses hitting a 747 with his F-104 suggest that weight turbulence don't have any effect, also it does leave the question if a collision could be avoid in that way.The story has likable characters but has un-clarified story lines like why a mercenary  air base exists and why they only ever seem to go up against Russian mig's. The Area 88 airbase acts more like a conventional airbase with regards to operation but  mercenaries are...suppose to work for who ever pays but this is not the case according to the story-line at least.This could have been a very good series but it does not gel very well so you get a disappointing series to watch, its not totally bad that you could watch it if it was on but you would not want to spend money on adding this to your collection. suppose to work for who ever pays but this is not the case according to the story-line at least.This could have been a very good series but it does not gel very well so you get a disappointing series to watch, its not totally bad that you could watch it if it was on but you would not want to spend money on adding this to your collection."", ""I have seen this anime get its fair share of negative reception, I once read an entire twitter thread from somebody laying out piece by piece why they hated the show and presumably, anybody else should too- But even after the 80s OVA set a very high bar for me, I absolutely adored this anime adaptation. The animation is nowhere near as good as the 80s OVA, with the intricately animated sequences of fighter jets being torn to pieces, and turbine engines being displayed for the whole world to see almost like human entrails being visible after being shot, are nowhere to be seen, and...the extremely well drawn 2D jets have been replaced with CGI.Despite this show having a longer runtime than the OVA, the story is never resolved like it is in the OVA. This sounds terrible, BUT this show gets a 10/10 for me for the sheer vibes alone. A full early 2000s trance soundtrack is already a plus for me with songs like Spread Your Wings being iconic, but the way these songs are paired with the dogfights completely makes up for the lack of airplane guts being spilled.Another plus is that characters actually get more development time, with some characters like Boris who were originally only footnotes in the OVA actually getting whole episodes dedicated to them. Each episode is also varied and the show never feels like it drags even in the downtime, moments where everybody was on the base were very chill yet satisfying. In one episode, a hidden sniper keeps the whole airstrip disabled for the entire episode, resulting in a somehow tense yet also relaxing episode that gets resolved satisfyingly in the end.Area 88 is an extremely fun anime from 2004 and it is absolutely worth your time if you're willing to view it as a different beast from the 80s OVA and the manga, also go listen to the BANGING trance soundtrack, especially Spread Your Wings by System F and Awakening by Rank1.EDIT:I just rewatched the anime and IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN I REMEMBERED IT. The vibes are absolutely IMPECCABLE and the moments on the base are absolutely so chilled out.

Some fairly realistic fighter planes are always a nice alternative to mechs, which we\'ve become accustomed to being, generally, the centerpieces of this type of tale in the anime medium.The TV version is a little more light-hearted than the OVA adaptation, and maybe easier to get into for that, but it suffers for the same reason. It\'s also not paced nearly as...well. If you find yourself interested, think less ""Legend of the Galactic Heroes"" or ""Armored Trooper VOTOMS"" and more ""UC Gundam"". well.

This and the fact that this iteration of Shin Kazama is very robotic (with the intent of the viewer seeing the character as others see him) detracts heavily from the overall story of the series. I feel that even with this issue, this is still a good series to start an aviation nut on. ']"

Ao no 6-gou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1051/Ao_no_6-gou,"[""Yet another anime I remember watching during my Toonami days. I remember not liking it very much when I was younger, due to the dark plot. But I've recently rewatched it again (years later) and I must say, this was a kickass anime.I was rewarded with a great plot, jazzy music, excellent animation, and a good moral lesson.The story itself had a pretty interesting and original twist on the End of the World genre of movies. With the theme's of man vs nature and such (it does this much better then The Happening, but that isn't very hard to do).I only wish that they'd...have made a few more episodes. I'd really have liked to have seen the plot deepen somewhat, which we didn't get the chance to see with just 4 episodes.The animation was great, at least the hand drawn portion. It flows very nicely and the colors are vibrant. The drawn stuff has aged very well... the CGI not so much. They added quite a bit of CGI, which probably looked cool 10 years ago. But now you can CLEARLY see the age. This can be an eye sore at times.The soundtrack was quite interesting. You'd think that something like this would have an epic orchestra score. But instead, the soundtrack consists of a group of jazz tracks. The jazz actually fits very well with the anime, who would've thought...The characters aren't very complex save for Zorndyke, who ends up being a very complex and deep character. Other than him, the other characters remain 2 dimensional. Hayami is your standard antihero, Kino is your standard annoying female counter part, and Verg (who is actually my favorite) is your standard bad guy, up until the end where we see a completely different side to the monster shark captain.Once again, I blame the lack of episodes for this. We're just not given time to watch these characters develop at all.Overall, this is a pretty good anime from beginning to end. It has and uses some very interesting idea's, some elements work (the concept and story) while others don't (the CGI).I recommend this to any action/apocalypses junkies. have made a few more episodes.

It ran in Shonen Sunday, and stands at three collected volumes.  It has yet to be licensed Stateside.In 2005, a live-action movie was announced by Gonzo studios, with Masahiro Ohkura directing.  There's no more info about the movie after this, so your guess is as good as mine as to whether or not it's actually still happening.Blue Submarine No. 6 is a four episode OVA that was produced by Gonzo (famous for their work on Gankutsuou and Bokurano) and directed by Mahiro...Maeda (famous for directing Gankutsuou and the Second Renaissance segments of the Animatrix).  It was released in Japan in 1998, and came Stateside in 2000 courtesy of Bandai Entertainment, and was released one episode (which ran about a half hour) a disc, and the final disc was released on October 3rd, 2000.  It also aired on Toonami starting on November 6th, 2000 in the 6:00 block.Story: In the near future, the seas have risen to flood most of the world, and what few areas of land remain are attacked and/or destroyed by sea-living hybrids created by a scientist named Zorndyke.  In order to stay alive, humanity relies on the crews of submarines known at the Blue Submarines.  The story focuses on Blue Submarine No 6, and a jaded ex-submariner named Hayami, who is asked to come back and help the crew defeat Zorndyke and his hybrids.Sound like every other post-apocalyptic anime you've seen?  Well, it is like most other post-apocalyptic anime out there, except that it takes place mostly in the sea.  For the most part, the plot isn't anything particularly stellar, not to mention subplots that are bought in out of nowhere and kind of made of WTF.The characters are not particularly well-developed, even for having only four half-hour episodes to do it in.  The characters have basic traits established, and that's how they stay for the entirety of the series.  One of the problems I have is the &quot;romance&quot; between Hayami and the female lead, Kino, who's a whiny little bitch who suddenly does a 180 about how she feels about Hayami in the third episode.The one exception to all of this is Zorndyke, who comes in in the second episode, and is probably the best well-developed plot line and character of the whole thing.  He's initially painted as the ZOMG EVIL SCIENTIST, but as the OVA goes on he gets enough development that you're left with this moral ambiguity about him that you see in shows like Code Geass and Death Note.Art: The blend that Gonzo does of 2D and 3D art here is absolutely stunning, especially for the ocean scenes.  They're also particularly creative in their designs for the hybrids, which is a nice touch.  The overall color scheme is based on various shades of blue and grey and green, because hey, we're in the ocean.Normal character designs aren't anything particularly special, but hey, it works.Music: The music for this series is all jazz-bassed, as is the ED (no OP), and all in all, I really like it.  ...Nothing more I can say about it, really.Seiyuu: Again, no seiyuu that I recognize/love to death, but all in all, a pretty good job.  Props especially to Mutio's seiyuu, who could convey what she wanted to get across with the character without using actual words (most of her dialogue was humming or random sea animal-esque noises).Length: I think they could've stood to add two more episodes and made it a six-episode OVA, which would've given it a bit more time to breathe, in terms of plot and characters.Overall: A pretty decent OVA with a plot and characters that don't stand out much, except for one character, pretty art and music, and awesome hybrid designs that deserved an episode or two more.Story: 7/10Art: 9/10Music: 9/10Seiyuu 8/10Length: 7/10Overall: 40/50; 80% (B-) Maeda (famous for directing Gankutsuou and the Second Renaissance segments of the Animatrix).

I say amazing because I\'ve never really seen anything quite like it, that is to say it is quite unique and quite creative. However it does seem to have a lot of holes, much seems to go unexplained.

At yes, along side those hours watching Gundamn Wing and Chris Colorado, there was this odd little show about a Blue Submarine and some odd Animal men.Back then, I wasn\'t so crazy on it, but that was mostly because I could never work out what order the episodes went in. I had this vague idea I might be watching them out of sync, or perhaps that I missed one.Now of course, its...14 years on and I\'ve got the series.And Damn do I love it.Blue Sub 6 does not, really, stand out in any particular category. No numerical store I could give it would really do justice to how Much I really Like it. The Animation is smooth, beautiful, but its not remarkable in any way. The Story isn\'t perfectly original, but its good and it has some wonderful little details. Frankly, the characters don\'t stand out at all for me.But somehow, all put together, its a truly enthralling thing to watch. There\'s a noticeable lack of Romance, although I think there\'s something implied between Mutio and Tetsu. And perhaps Tetsu and Mayumi too. The Scenes of underwater combat are stylish, well done, and fairly believable, but the far enough between that you can\'t call this a ""Battle Anime"". The Scenes with the animal men are...Strange, but present a rather interesting view of them. Very human, yet clearly not.The Music is rather nice too, some wonderfully appropriate Jazz tunes in there. Rather reminds me of Big O in that respect. but I can\'t say it stands out in this regard eitherIn fact, all in all, my reason for loving this series cannot be found in any particular aspect of it. Its, so to speak, in the completion rather than the components. 14 years on and I\'ve got the series.And Damn do I love it.Blue Sub 6 does not, really, stand out in any particular category.

I hate blatantly obvious, excessive use of CGI, and if Blue Submarine No. 6 excels at anything it's that. More than 50% of animation is CGI and it is combined with 'normal' animation in a awkward and unconvincing way.However, I was intrigued by the development of the story, so I've decided to keep watching, and I really tried. But I just could not overlook the animation.The characters in the two episodes I've seen haven't exhibited anything out of the ordinary, so that part gave me no incentive...to move onto the third episode. 'All that jazz' playing in the background, as good as it was, was also unable to compensate for the animation, which pretty much ruined every good aspect of this anime.The worst thing in my opinion is the way that the animation combines CG vessels with 'normally' animated characters. It looks, as silly as it might sound, unnatural.It would be against my better judgment to recommend you try to watch this if you bear no grudge against CGI, because it's bad CGI, which includes  little blurry people running around and it lacks details and finesse. to move onto the third episode.

It was an adaptation of a manga the same name written in the late 60’s and covers some interesting themes having been made not far from Japan’s post WWII reconstruction and rapidly changing government structure at the dawn of the Cold War and the nuclear arms race. The anime was certainly dated and I can only...imagine what the manga looks like, but what’s presented in around 2 hours or so is a pretty interesting post-apocalyptic action anime.Initial disclaimer I have to present for every one of THESE sorts of anime. I’m pre-disposed to liking this one. It’s a postapocalyptic Waterworld filled with furries. I cannot be held entirely accountable for my objectivity with these sorts of setting so if you watch this anime and hate it, I could totally be wrong.What immediately stood out to me in this series after bracing for the impact of the 90’s CG (which yes DOES get a pretty hefty pass because it was hip at the time) was the sound design. I was really blown away immediately from the first scene at the quality of the sounds in this show. Seagulls chirping behind a character would sound perfectly echoed in the distant top left of my hearing. Characters talking on a submarine echoed appropriately. Sounds underwater, electrical work, layered voices, and more were all very impressive in the version I watched. The soundtrack was also very impressive ranging from energetic jazzy music for every battle sequence to somber siren’s calls from the hybrid mer-people.Something about terrible 90’s CG that had a lot of budget behind it was also oddly palatable compared to cheap CG slapped on modern anime. I can’t explain that. The character designs here were varied wildly and the human and hybrids were both all wildly different in design. You really got a feeling that “humanities last fleet made of every nation” was being show to us.Characterization in the show was decent. No character had too much of a background to speak of so we had to grow attached to them through their actions in the present. The protagonist Tetsu Hayami was a pretty solid no nonsense badass and his relationship with our two kind-of love interests Mayumi and Mutio was captivating enough. I felt like the OVA’s were clearly rushed for time and can’t help but wonder if more is given to the readers of the original manga in this regard.The antagonists of the series are presented in an unconventional way in some senses and you could tell the creators were trying to present a scenario where the viewer may not agree with the villains, but they could certainly empathize with them.Pretty good viewing experience, I would certainly recommend given the required time investment.(SLIGHT SPOILER BELOW FOR WARNING PURPOSES)P.S. In all of Japanese media for some reason fish girls can never catch a break. The heck is that about? Mermaids deserve happy endings too. Bad things happening to cute girls really put a bad taste in my mouth and if I’m being legitimately honest pretty much all deducted nobles are really knocked for that reason. imagine what the manga looks like, but what’s presented in around 2 hours or so is a pretty interesting post-apocalyptic action anime.Initial disclaimer I have to present for every one of THESE sorts of anime.

It is something I have always wanted to start. There is no time like the present, so let us begin.Blue Submarine is a fresh spin on a post-apocalyptic man vs the world story. I believe the true strength of the anime lies in it's unique story in a seemingly oversaturated market (granted it was made 20 years ago as of this write-up) while it's true weakness is it's inability to do anything tangible with it in a 4 episode settingIt is of this reviewers belief that...this OVA would have perhaps been formatted better as a movie or a longer series. My largest pet peeve was the character and their progression or rather I should say lack thereof. The main characters felt hollow and only serving as a placeholder of sorts for the character they COULD become. Abysmal.The sound was that of the funky fresh jazz variety that seems to be a beloved attribute of 90s anime sci-fi, of which I will not complain. It gives a particular vibe that can trigger nostalgia in the older anime peruser, myself having been a young viewer of Toonami, often sneaking up late to watch shows such as Dragon Ball, Gundam and the like.The last item I will touch on are the visuals. For the show being 20 years old, the art is impressive in 1080p. It looks as good or better than some currently airing anime, but...There is one tiny part of the visuals that didn't quite hold up so we'll, and that's the CGI. Watching it now in 2019 it feels like watching science mystery theatre 3000, it's that comical. But for the era, I'm sure it was well done.Well, that's it. I'm sure that this review will likely go unnoticed as the show is not popular and rarely discussed, but I wanted an opportunity to try to write something up.If you do happen to read this, please leave me feedback on how to improve upon my reviews.Thankee-sai. this OVA would have perhaps been formatted better as a movie or a longer series.

Little did I know the story is very deep with many morals. Although the structure is flawed with plot holes, it is easily overlooked with the very well transmitted moral.ArtFirst, It must be taken into consideration that this was aired 1998-2000. The art/animation was beautiful in this. The style was fairly old due to the airing date, but that quality was...well beyond most anime of this time. The animation creates a favorable atmosphere that allows those who prefer modern animation to enjoy and become indulged in the anime.SoundThe sound in this was somewhat unique. There was a lot of jazz which was nice to hear for once after a long time. There was no opening theme and an ending theme that was nothing special. The sound during the anime was not well done and did not fit the situations well. Despite the fact that the music by itself is nice, the usage of the music is not well done.CharacterThe characters in this show are not anything special. There is not much character development in the anime and their backgrounds are not well explained.As far as enjoyment goes, I can highly recommend this if you would like a nice moral and some outstanding art, but would definitely ask you to refrain from watching it if you are expecting to get to know the characters. well beyond most anime of this time.

I guess I was too busy watching Outlaw Star and Tenchi Muyo. Maybe it is fortunate that I did not get to see it then, as I think I enjoyed it more now than I would have back then.I'm not going to tell much about the storyline beyond the synopsis because there isn't too much more to tell without spoiling the whole thing. I will say though that the story and several characters are extremely deep considering the time constraints...of 4 episodes. There is a lot there beneath the surface of the character interactions and the dialogue. Unless you can infer at least some of those points, you may find yourself scratching your head at times at the plot holes.Characterization is simultaneously the strongest and weakest link in the series. Some of the characters are archetypal in part because they find themselves in stereotypical situations for anime. Others are archetypal simply because there isn't the time to devote to fleshing them out. You find out a lot about Zorndyke despite his short amount of screentime because his motivations for sparking the genocide of humankind are one of the major driving points.The art has definitely held up well for the age of the series. The animation itself is great and consistent. While some have criticized the CGI, I have certainly seen worse CGI in much more recent series. It is clear that they tried to get the most out of what they had for the times. The underwater explosions, physics, and structures also appear to be quite accurate from my largely uneducated point of view.

I wonder what\'d it\'d be like if Japan made a cartoon?"" Well look no farther because Blue Submarine No. 6 is that. But, you know, not at all really.First off, the character and creature designs are spot-on. The world Blue Submarine presents the viewer with is at once visually interesting and begging to be explored. Everyone looks and sounds very distinct and at no point (despite the relatively short amount of time I had to get to know everyone) did I ever confuse a character with another. I was initially ready for a tropey...cast that really seemed like they were copy/pasted right out of an anime database. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that everyone develops over the course of the meager four episodes in a most pleasant way. No one is really how you initially expect them to be. As I watched the anime I couldn\'t help but want to know more about the history that led to the Earth we see here, but if you think the anime is going to give you answers OH NO, it\'s not. Hehehe. Get it? It\'s like the title. I did a bit there. Hope you caught it.But no, really, you aren\'t told nearly enough about this fascinating alternate reality for it to really sink in. The humans are fighting hybrid creatures, but why? When were they made? How were they made? Why did the villain feel like creating human/animals hybrids was the best course of actions? Why did he (SPOILERS) transform that one human prisoner into a hybrid creature? Was it just for kicks? The villain\'s character is sorely underdeveloped, especially compared to the protagonists, and I didn\'t feel like he effectively justified himself to the viewer. And fine, okay, a villain certainly doesn\'t have to be justified. But the anime really seems like it WANTS you to understand him. They really go far to say ""Hey, he\'s not THAT bad. Just delusional!"" Sorry, but killing over 10 billion people and attempting to destroy humanity completely is pretty evil by most standards and I\'m not biting. The writers could have really gone in an interesting directions by playing up how justified he feels against how atrocious his acts really are, but instead the earnest attempt to make him sympathetic when his actions are so destructive is just really bizarre and off-putting. The main side villain is also totally uninteresting, despite his design (Did I mention the creature designs are all amazing? Because they are.) Story-wise, everything is really straightforward and while the anime starts out as if you\'re going to be slowly revealing the past of each character, the ultimate reveals are all pretty disappointing in all honesty.This anime is also LOADED with terrible CGI. And man, OH MAN, is it terrible. I saw the amazingly drawn characters and thought ""Alright, this looks great!"" But then the first of many terribly CGI\'d fight scenes begins. This is definitely where the OH NO of Ao No. 6 Gou comes from. The fights would actually be very interesting if they were just animated in 2D. But with so much terrible CGI saturating the anime, from the water to the splash effects awkwardly places over 2D characters to the ships and other creatures, it almost becomes hard to enjoy what would be very interesting visuals. I say ""almost"" because the soundtrack is terrific. I mean, it\'s really good. Energetic jazz spliced with sparsely used enigmatic and otherworldly tracks. Not on the level of Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo or any of the other legendary anime soundtracks, but still fantastic and it makes sitting through even the worst-looking CGI a pleasure.So do I recommend it? I mean... kind of? It was good. I liked it. It\'s no Akira but it\'s still an interesting post-apocalyptic story with some cool visuals and moments with a great soundtrack. Nothing fantastic, but worth looking into. cast that really seemed like they were copy/pasted right out of an anime database.

Right off the bat, I dubbed Mutio as my favorite character, because I was very into non-human characters. Since I saw it right around the time I started listening to Gorillaz, I initially thought that Hayami looked a little like Murdoc, or Murdoc looked  a little like Hayami.

', ""Blue Submarine No. 6 is one of the archetypal gems of the Toonami era. The atmosphere, sound design, and plot truly embody the essence of that time, heavy with a sense of discovery that only a limitless medium like anime can fully realize. Even beyond that association, this show stands on its own as something forlorn, complicated, and artful, while not losing any of the kinetic action which also defines a huge part of its identity. Beginning with the story, the viewer is met with a post-apocalyptic world, inundated by an ocean full of sentient hybrid monsters, the work of a mad scientist, which the...rest of the world now coordinates against. The story retains the original flavor of the 1967 manga it was adapted from, right down to the premise, including mechs and mad scientists. However, it also synthesizes deeper philosophical and conceptual influences from the late 90s enough that it can be counted as something completely distinct. It is this balance which makes the story so refreshing, even decades removed from its initial release. The pacing is phenomenal for such a short run, and the dialogue is masterfully written, invoking the full weight of people facing the very end of the world. However, for all its strengths, it's not perfect. The message of the tale gets muddled towards the end, and though it might be understandable given the runtime, it still feels as though they didn't know exactly how to end it. It seems to wrestle with itself, even though such wrestling is ultimately unnecessary. The overall message of Zorndyke's twisted idealism being evil is on the face of it, true. To conclude otherwise is to dig a little too deep, while being simultaneously pretentious and shallow. The major flaw is that, even if the story doesn't really conclude this, it allows enough ambiguity for such arguments to gain a foothold. This is still the case, even when the hybrid creations of Zorndyke are occasionally sympathetic, specifically with regards to Mutio. Though, even with that fact in mind, it was still cruel of Zorndyke to thrust them into a world of constant war. It is clear they love him, yet he treats them as little more than tools, despite what he says to the contrary. Speaking of things which aren't perfect, I now must speak on the art, this anime's strongest aspect. This claim might seem contradictory, but it isn't. The art direction as a whole is bold and unique, and all of the traditional animation is crisp, warm, and smoother than many anime of the modern day. Everything from the cinematography to the fight choreography leaves a lasting impression, in a way which few shows of any era manage to accomplish in any kind of enduring fashion. Now, it's plain to see that the CG isn't very good at all. It doesn't hold up, and I doubt it impressed on anything other than a technical level back in 1998 either. However, I still don't think it detracted from the show, and here's why- it was brave and well-placed at the same time. To include such heavy use of CG made them trailblazers, and to put so much of it underwater, where smooth lines and flat, curved edges look more natural, made them prudent innovators. While at first it felt kind of galling, I quickly got used to it, and it only served to highlight just how gorgeous the rest of the animation really is. Meanwhile, the sound design's crowning jewel is this jazzy, smooth composition, reminiscent of Cowboy Bebop and Trigun, fitting right in with the auditory landscape which defined that golden age of Toonami which so many of us are so familiar with. It's complex, contemplative, and alive with a sensitivity to any given scene and its context. On a dime it can turn from this dreamy, acoustic track to a gripping score which shudders with panic and dread at a mile a minute. The rest of the sound is also excellent, with fully realized sounds of life and one of the best dubs I've ever heard. The emotion in their voices bleed through the speakers, feeling immersive and arresting throughout. However, special attention must be paid to the sound of breath. The way Blue Submarine No. 6 utilizes the sound of breath is utterly unique. It sounds as though the voice actors are actually being punched, or cut, or surprised, and on and on. It is raw and vivid, and adds so much to the voice acting that I didn't know it could. It's a small thing, but it adds yet another piece to the monumental achievement of this show's overall sound design. The characters are also quite strong, feeling warm and human in a lot of ways which are hard to achieve in such a short time, even managing to do so with those who aren't strictly human to begin with. The ways these characters interact is both excitingly grand, and unmistakably desperate. Real, three dimensional human relationships, poignant with pain and conflict abound. Of them, my favorite characters are the longsuffering badass and secretly idealistic Hayami, and the despicable genius Zorndyke, with the blood of billions on his hands. I like Hayami because he feels like a great fit for the world in which he finds himself, with a monumental grit that doesn't just amount to instant plot armor. Meanwhile, for as much as I hate Zorndyke, it cannot be denied that he is a multifaceted, compelling villain. It goes to show than no matter how eloquent or well-meaning someone is, they can still be horribly, monstrously, wrong. Overall, Blue Submarine No. 6 is an excellent anime, not only archetypal of the era in which it was produced, but also enduringly compelling and, at the end of the day, cool as hell.

Well not that much badly executed but not having time to execute the story.First of all I really love the soundtrack of this, i still listen to it after months of watching the movie.But lets go to the important stuff, the elephant in the room its the visuals of the cgi shit, and they are ps2 like which makes sense giving the fact Gonzo made cinematics for videogames before doing this, but even with the crappy cgi in today's standards I still think it has good action even...with the bad CGI (edit, it actually looks decent if watched in a small screen from a certain distance).The thing got me hooked from start to finish, its a really good concept for a story but the thing couldn't shine at all because it only had little less than 2 hours to express the whole thing, not saying something like that isn't possible because there are movies that are 2 hours and cover the whole manga of a serie, right?, its not that easy, this 4 ovas suffer because of not being able to develop the world or the characters enough, i would have loved to see more in depth explanation of the characters for example one of them that was involved in the start of this war, the technology, they had a lot of things to show but little time to show them so the whole thing its just lacking.Don't let this negative things I said about it let you thing its a bad anime, I personally like it and think it could bring way more juice than it did, but its good for what it is, not outstanding but just good. But this is personally one of my favorite obscure anime tbh, idk why I've grown attached to this anime this much, maybe for someone else its just another weird experimental set of ovas from the 2000s and 90s but for me its special in a way I can't describe. with the bad CGI (edit, it actually looks decent if watched in a small screen from a certain distance).The thing got me hooked from start to finish, its a really good concept for a story but the thing couldn't shine at all because it only had little less than 2 hours to express the whole thing, not saying something like that isn't possible because there are movies that are 2 hours and cover the whole manga of a serie, right?, its not that easy, this 4 ovas suffer because of not being able to develop the world or the characters enough, i would have loved to see more in depth explanation of the characters for example one of them that was involved in the start of this war, the technology, they had a lot of things to show but little time to show them so the whole thing its just lacking.Don't let this negative things I said about it let you thing its a bad anime, I personally like it and think it could bring way more juice than it did, but its good for what it is, not outstanding but just good.

While I did have interest in wanting to see what all the fuss was about, I was also a bit hesitant to acquire this for my collection considering Gonzo's rep for the quality of their works being all over the place and making it hard to recommend them as a studio for consistently good quality works considering for as excellent quality works they can make like Gankutsuou and Bokurano, they've also made stinkers like Witchblade and Zaion: I Wish...You Were Here. In the case of Blue Submarine No. 6, the series felt like wasted potential to me.The series depicts a post-apocalyptic future where most of the Earth has been flooded and humanity is at war with a army of mutant sea creatures given sentience by a rogue human scientist. The main focus of the anime is on a young man named Hayami Tatsu who is recruited by the submarine forces of Blue No. 6 to aid in humanity's efforts against the creatures. He strangely seems indifferent at wanting to contribute to the cause as he is acting pacifistic, but the series explores why he acts as he does as it progresses. This makes him the most well-developed character of the series and a major highlight for me, though that's not saying much as I'll cover later in the review.The animation for Blue Submarine No. 6 is probably some of the most impressive I've seen for a 1990s anime thanks to its nice mix of CG animation and traditional hand-drawn animation, possibly rivaling the quality I seen with the excellent animation work for Macross Plus. While the CG animation looks rough in detail compared to more modern implementations of the technology, it still features nicely rendered designs of sunken buildings and the various submarines in action throughout the OVA's run. Animation was very fluid in this series as well, as characters moved about at a natural pace, sea creatures swam convincingly fast in the water and submarine battles were nice on the eyes as the CG animation produced air bubble effects for the use of said submarines and any torpedoes they fired in the heat of battle. Character designs were reasonably detailed, though human designs were a bit on the plain side. However, some of the character designs for the sentient sea creatures were quite unique and original for an anime series, particularly designs for Verg and Mutio.Getting all praises out of the way though, Blue Submarine No. 6's quality suffers quite a bit thanks to its pacing. The series immediately throws you into its action and rushes through its events at a very quick pace. This, combined with the limited run time and episode count of the OVA, greatly limits any opportunities for world building and fleshing out of plot and characters, as only Hayami and Mutio get any real fleshing out or development. Mostly every other character is tacked on with a character archetype and we get little to no details revealed about them. The anime seemed like it was trying to express some sort of moral lesson about how man's excesses to the environment could lead to the future of Blue Submarine No. 6 without any coexistence between man and nature, as seen with Zorndyke's monologues and Hayami's actions. Yet without any reasonable fleshing out or world building, the effectiveness of expressing this lesson is greatly crippled.But perhaps the worst feature to this OVA would be its choice of soundtrack. Consisting entirely of upbeat jazz pieces, the musical tracks are totally out of place for the series and are more obnoxious on the ears than enjoyable for me, possibly rivaling the annoyance I had with the synthesized techno-rock soundtrack used for Geneshaft.Overall while visually pleasing and having some promising elements to its storytelling, Blue Submarine No.6 is another anime that I felt had wasted potential thanks to its limited run time greatly limiting what focus could be given to characters and its world, hence adding another subpar work to Gonzo's rep for the varying quality of their works that I've seen.

You've seen it a million times before.What really stands out is the animation quality. It's beautiful, minus the CGI battles with the ships. Very fluid and really nice shading. I also loved the character designs. The MC, the heroine and all of the furry and fish people were really, really good. Other than that, there...isn't much to write home about.

The character designs are great. An all-star lineup of animators, graced by the likes of Kōji Morimoto and Toshiyuki Inoue among others, put in some good work. Mahiro Maeda's direction is appropriately reserved, distant, and atmospheric for what is an otherwise ludicrous story. Sounds like a home run, right?But this is Gonzo we are dealing with.

Ergo, all that aforementioned good work is buried under mountains...of ugly and poorly aged CG animation.

The main theme of the story is hardly original. The pace of the story is almost predictable. The conclusion is on the other hand promising but fails to wrap the story smoothly or even to make sense. You almost feel like the scriptwriters were not given enough time and ended the story in a rush, unfulfilling way. The scenario clearly needed more episodes and development in order to run smoothly and to make sense. As it is,...it feels like a lot of fuss happened for no reason and the conclusion will leave you more frustrated rather than satisfied. It had potential for greatness, thanks to all the talking about humanity’s greed and ecology. It didn’t make use of it though and thus the story is half good. A typical GONZO mistake. Very good visuals and promising stories that are always ruined by their apathy at keeping the pace of a series as good as it begins.CHARACTER SECTION- As it is, the only character with interest is the “evil” scientist, who wants to wipe out humanity. He has a good reason for what he is doing and is not a typical bad to the bone villain.- The only thing the rest of the characters do is fighting for or against him, instead of having personality and goals of their own. There is supposed to be some personal drama around the leading man and woman but given the short duration of the series, it will feel uninteresting. All the whining and crying of the shark-like leader and the renegade female mutant feel more like pointless torture time, rather than reason for acting as they do. None of the characters has much coloring or development because of the duration. Most seem to have something interesting to show but nothing of such is shown in the end. As soon as their development begins, we see the ending credits.- Even the scientist is not that great, as his plan is not given enough time to be explained. I mean, destroying humanity and most of the world just to replace sentient life with a race of warlike animals? How will that help the planet? Duh!ART SECTION- This is amongst the first anime that managed to mix 2D and 3D without making it look utterly stupid. There is a huge amount of details and colors given to almost everything, making the optical department a sight of sore eyes.- Realism in motion is quite good, although casual viewers will probably dislike the way 3D objects move and the mannerism of the characters. They both look weird and not natural, something that was expected for an early CGI work. But it’s not like GONZO learned from its mistakes and improved later on.- Anyway, the animation takes some time to get used to but it eventually becomes bearable. The 3D doesn’t always look ok next to the 2D but if we think this is GONZO we are talking about, we must give them a credit for taking animation in anime to a whole new level with this title. Really; just check how lame all previous attempts were. Hell, just check how uninteresting most upcoming 3D anime were.- Other than that, the character designs were way too generic and simplistic to the point you cared more about the backgrounds and the action than about them. This tends to make them less interesting than the theme of the story.SOUND SECTION- Jazz for humans and tribal ouga bouga drum music for mutants, almost made it sound like a strategy game with themed factions. Voice acting was decent, although the voice synk for the mutants feels more like dubbing than actually listening to what they say with groans and barks in their native language. Beyond all that, the context in the dialogues is mostly philosophical and scientific and you get a kick out of paying attention to what they say.ENJOYMENT SECTIONThe aesthetics are better than the story and the characters put together. It all comes down to a silly ecology theme of value your planet and recycle or the shark boogiemen will eat you.

This four-episode post-apocalyptic science fiction OVA (Original Video Animation), directed by Mahiro Maeda, was released in 1998. Blue Submarine No. 6 is a unique entry in the anime genre because to its blend of compelling characters, strong action, and deep concepts.Animations and Visuals:Blue Submarine No. 6's animations and graphics are certainly a visual feast. Astonishing underwater scenes and agile character movements are produced by the series' seamless blending of classic 2D animation and computer-generated images. With beautifully drawn landscapes and finely built mechanical creations, the attention to...detail is extraordinary. Particularly remarkable are the aquatic settings, which have a hypnotic fusion of vivid hues and heartbreakingly lovely sceneries. By bringing the world of Blue Submarine No. 6 to life, the animation transports viewers to a stunningly realistic dystopian future.Characters:The ensemble of characters in Blue Submarine No. 6 is diverse, with each having special goals and challenges. Tetsu Hayami, the protagonist, is a capable pilot caught in the crossfire of rival forces.

Blue Submarine took on that challenge by only having four episodes for its series. With only four episodes, did Blue Submarine achieve something few anime can pull off? Let's find out.Since there are a limited amount of episodes, Blue Submarine has no choice but to be fast-paced; which I think they handle very well. Blue Submarine was unique and the premise is something that you’d be hard-pressed to...find a copy of. Sadly, the story was just too simple and left viewers wanting a little more in return from spending their time watching the show. The show’s concept was unfortunately too ambitious and needed perhaps a standard 12 episode season in order to fully flesh out concepts such as the fish mutants Dr. Zorndyke created.The story being bareboned meant that the characters would have to have uplifted the show. The main character Hayami had decent development that’s nothing unique, a standard emo protagonist. Hayami has a major regret and he learns to overcome it, which was nice to see, but Mutio, his sidekick, never grew as a character herself. She never changed and just stayed the loud-mouthed sidekick the whole time. The best character in the show was the villain, Dr. Zorndyke. While he didn’t have much screen time, his motivation for why he flooded the earth was something I really related to since I practice Taoism. One of Taoism’s beliefs is that there is no difference between animals and men, we are all animals. Dr. Zorndyke flooded the earth because he was tired of seeing the way humans treated the planet, such as pollution. This made him a character I will never forget.Blue Submarine Six was one of the pioneers in anime to use CGI, and it shows. The show didn’t age well at all; the CGI looks like Playstation 2 graphics. The worst part is that they tried to use CGI whenever possible, which made the scenes unwatchable and hard to get through. This is a shame, because the actual art style is pretty to look at, but it was drowned out by the constant use of the CGI. The show had a balance of 90% CGI and 10% standard art. The voice acting, on the other hand, was really good for a dub in the early 2000’s. I found some of the tracks in the show were actually good, and it helped add to the dark and helpless emotions in scenes.Unfortunately, I didn’t enjoy my time watching this show. It was a struggle to get through it, and there weren’t even that many episodes to get through. If you are looking for a dystopian future-themed anime to watch, this isn’t the show for you.Story: 5/10Art: 1/10Sound: 7/10Character: 4/10Enjoyment: 1/10Overall: 2/10 find a copy of.

Asura,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8475/Asura,"[""What makes a monster? Are some men born monstrous or are they simply a product of their time? This film forces the viewer to struggle with these kinds of questions. What would we be willing to do in order to survive? Can we even fathom what people had to do so long ago and how can we possibly judge them? Asura has shocked and touched me in a way an anime film has not since Grave of the Fireflies. The title character is designed to look very much like an oni of folklore, but the viewer is reminded very quickly first and foremost he is...just a child. This makes witnessing his gruesome and primal attempts at survival all the more disturbing.Perhaps what struck me most about this film was a clever sequence in which Asura struggles to crawl out from a pit of corpses. His clawed gnarled hands reach up to the light in the cracks of the rock and the animation breaks to see Wakasa in the river shortly before she discovers the wounded Asura. This scene clearly paralleled a certain journey for Asura. He crawled from the depths of Hell to catch a glimpse of Heaven and that's when he truly learns about human kindness from Wakasa. This scene was so poetic that it made the rest of the film all the more tragic.This film was beautifully done. At times it is difficult to watch, but that is the point. I will not soon forget this film and I do not think anyone else who sees it will either. just a child.

I will not soon forget this film and I do not think anyone else who sees it will either."", 'Asura kicks off with a pregnant woman giving a quite graphic birth to a boy, before she beats a wild dog to death with a nearby axe. As we can see, things are looking pretty grim in this world. Everyone is dying and the only way to survive sometimes is to resort to cannibalism. This baby eventually leaves his mother (after she throws him onto a fire with the intent of eating him) and becomes a wild child who runs across the countryside, eating other dying people.To be fair to the producers of Asura, there probably was a time in history when the outlook for...society really was this grim. There probably was a time when a child would stumble while pushing a log and a guard would order his father to throw his feeble son into the ravine. There indeed probably was a time when haggard housewives would stumble along a road, gossiping about how their next door neighbour ate her baby. Maybe it’s just my fault that I can’t take such a bleak world at face value. But it would really help if the show didn’t keep undermining itself.For one, there’s no context given for how the world ended up in this state. People are poor and there’s no food, that’s just how life is. It never gives any idea that an alternative would ever exist. It’s just grim decay from start to finish, and it really likes to beat us over the head with this, to the point that it flips around and becomes unintentional comedy. The spurts of blood that would shoot out of someone the cannibal kid attacked looked completely ridiculous. It also has real issues with continuity sometimes. The cannibal kid suddenly jumped from having a vocabulary of about 10 words to being able to philosophise the pain of existence.Then there was the CG, which had the usual problems CG has. Characters do that thing where they sway in motion for a few seconds before coming to a standstill, like a video game character returning to their neutral stance. Hair seems to be made out of flat pieces of paper glued onto the top of their head like a wig. I know the movie is supposed to look ugly, but I don’t think these were the kinds of ugly it was going for. Sometimes I wonder whether my dislike of fully CG anime comes from me being used to 2D animation and having a gut dislike of anime designs in 3D, but then I see a shot where someone’s standing still but their feet are mysteriously hovering a few centimetres above the ground and dismiss that thought.It’s has some incredibly dumb scenes too. I’m going to spoil a big plot twist here, but you shouldn’t watch the movie anyway so who cares. The kid occasionally meets this monk who tries to teach him not to become a killer. During one of his attempts to teach the kid, the monk pulls out a sword and then swings at his own arm. I thought this about making the kid realise he cared for someone and would stop the monk from swinging the sword. But I was under the mistaken assumption that the movie was leading to some sort of hopeful narrative conclusion. Instead the monk chops his arm clean off and tells the kid to eat it. The kid runs away, so the monk just stands there are cries for a bit, probably at the realisation of how bloody thick he was for chopping off his own arm. I suppose it seemed like a good idea at the time.And you know what this was all leading up to (spoiler warning for the end, but again who cares because it’s a rubbish film)? The kid has an entire village chase after him to kill him, only to fall into a ravine. The kid doesn’t die, which might at least give some narrative finality to his actions where we learn the damning life of being a monster that is beyond saving. Instead he becomes a monk with his life lesson being that people die because I don’t know, life sucks I guess. It’s such a frustratingly pointless end to a movie that would have been unpleasant even if it wasn’t so badly made. With that end though, it makes me wonder what the point of the whole thing was. Even if you like unrelenting grimness, which makes for a bad story anyway the same way unrelenting calm and peacefulness would, there’s anime far better made than this crap. society really was this grim.

"", 'Asura starts off with a very graphic backstory as to how the main character came to be, showing his gruesome birth and exactly what he had to go through pretty much immediately after being born. Lets just say Asura didn\'t have a great start in life, and because of that he basically became a wild animal who can\'t speak. The movie is fairly short so I\'m going to do my best not to spoil anything, that is why I\'m not going to go into too much detail about specific events.Story(6): While this is probably the movies saving grace, it doesn\'t exactly ""save"" it. The...story is about a boy who is left for dead by his mother in medieval Japan where starvation is the norm, and people often have to resort to cannibalism to survive. Having to survive on his own, he basically becomes a wild beast. Who will kill and eat anything, including humans. Early on he meets a monk, who for the first time in his life shows him compassion. The rest of the movie is basically him trying to survive in a small village where everyone sees him as a monster, while he\'s tries to become more human. Overall there where some distracting plot holes, like how did he survive as a newborn left for dead, but it was a fairly well told story with an ending that I think saved the film from being completely mediocre.Art(6): The art is similar to the new Berzerk movies, in that it\'s a mix of digital 3D animation and hand drawn. Much like the new Berzerk I didn\'t even notice it was done in this style when seeing the trailers. It can look really nice during certain scenes, but scenes with subtle movement can tend to look awkward in my opinion. Maybe some people like this style, but I personally am not a fan. The movie might have actually benefited from being in a more traditional hand drawn style, cause I actually found it distracting at times.Sound(6): Everything about the sound was just ok, the voice acting was ok, the score was ok, just ok. Nothing memorable. If anything the voice actor for the main character I thought over did it with the whole ""wild beast"" thing. I don\'t think that was his fault though, I\'m sure he was directed to do it that way. I just think they could have been more subtle/realistic, about that.Character(6): This was one of the things about the movie that was a bit disappointing. It is a character driven story, but the characters are just not that likeable. The monk was probably my favorite character, and he didn\'t get much screen time. The story relies very much on your feelings for the characters, and I just wasn\'t attached to them.Enjoyment(6): I really can\'t say I enjoyed the movie that much, but it kept me entertained enough that I kept watching. There are some pretty climatic moments that keep you interested, so you never feel bored. At least I didn\'tOverall(6): Overall, the film is watchable. I don\'t feel like my time was wasted watching it or anything, so if you are interested in it I say give it a shot. The ending really helped make it a 6 and not a 5 though, I just thought it had a good message however somewhat cheesy. I\'d like to mention that I have never rated anything on MAL a 10, so my 6 is pretty much most peoples 7. story is about a boy who is left for dead by his mother in medieval Japan where starvation is the norm, and people often have to resort to cannibalism to survive.

What happened to get us the right situation? What could happen to a child in a horror scenario? .With a well tied script and a production well made, it is in this scenario of pain, hunger and misery that we are surprised by the plot which holds us from beginning to end. The graphic quality of the film is also excellent and can create some exciting, dramatic and fun times. Despite being a film with a strong theme and using a child...as a primary weapon for the deaths, Asura is a great option for something different than we are accustomed. No superpowers, giant robots and magic, just a kid, an ax and a civil war. Focusing intensely on the protagonist's soul pain and his thirst for human flesh, the film manages to follow a very realistic line, presenting the facts that occur due to hunger and separation / difference between the rich and the poor, something we see very well in our day to day as a primary weapon for the deaths, Asura is a great option for something different than we are accustomed.

It’s a movie with many philosophical morals and strong character development. Why makes humans different from animals? Why do humans need love? Many questions about our existence are explained through an indirect way in this show.In the beginning we are presented with a horrific situation where people go insane due to their hunger. I such circumstances a boy is born. Years pass and the boy doesn’t behave any different from a wild predator, literally. It isn’t until his meeting with a Buddhist monk...that he experiences feelings of kindness. The monk names him Asura and from that day his whole life changes. However, the one that plays the most important role is not the priest but a young woman who happens to interact with him. Asura will experience the warmness of belonging somewhere and the pain of being abandoned... but in the end will he choose the right way?The story portrays intense feelings and disturbing themes as well as being very dramatic. In the end I believe it's worth watching though.Art:The art I saw in Asura is not something I come across often (but not rarely either). The landscapes were outstanding and the way they presented the scenes of famine were really impressive. The character design was not very realistic in most cases but it was still more realistic than in most anime. On the other side I found that the way Asura was depicted is related to his nature and was a way show it more intensely. I noted that in the end he did not have fangs as in the beginning of the story which I considered very symbolic.Sound:I don't remember anything exception from the soundtrack... I thought it was normal. I kind of took a liking to the ending song though.Character:There are many characters in the story such as Wakasa (the girl), a worker and the ruler of the area. Each one was represented a different type of person. The only character development was in Asura because the other characters didn't need any as it would have ruined the story. He represented the viewers in some way, who are confused about all the questions that arise in the story. We are invited to (partially) put ourselves in his shoes and wonder... On the other hand Wakasa represent the the right ideology but I believe the show makes sure we see her imperfections. Her father and the villagers represent people that are not very thoughtful of their actions and I think the fact that they are many is quite important... Moreover, the lord represents corruption and selfishness and as the story goes on we can see why he is so different form Asura in end. Finally, the monk seems like some type of holy person that is there to guide Asura to the correct path (the one we think is correct). We might resort to very intense action which if I had to analyze I would be a bit troubled but I think that's necessary to make the story flow.Enjoyment:The story while being set in a realistic environment is not very realistic itself, especially due to the fact that Asura has almost supernatural powers. In the end it doesn't matter though as it is a story of morals and that makes it more beautiful.

Asura tries to explore multiple concepts about human nature such as nature vs. nurture, human greed, despair, what people do backed in a corner, but unfortunatley falls VERY short of delivering a moral lesson. There's too much ambiguity involved to ever create a meaningful message, as everyone Asura kills is NOT justified. Even in the end it is very hard to sympathize or forgive Asura for his candid killing since I could relate to the opposing characters and the actions. There's no real life message to this story, which you...kind of expect for shows/movies with this type of dark theme.There are many plot holes that are present in Asura such as why did the monk leave Asura to himself when he was clearly not rehabillitated, how did he survive as a baby, etc.That being said, the atmosphere that Asura creates with its amazing art style keeps it afloat to make it enjoyable. Death and decay is displayed very well with the 3D artwork highlighting corpses, disembodied limbs, blood, crows, and the like. Not only that, but the pleasant backdrop of green rice fields contrasts the overall dark feeling of the whole movie which creates a forboding feeling of tragedy.The supporting characters are memorable enough, such as the badass monk that makes the scene twice as intense or the kind yet steadfast Wasaka willing to stand tall to her morales.The movie was entertaining enough to keep me watching, and I was glad that I watched it in the end. kind of expect for shows/movies with this type of dark theme.There are many plot holes that are present in Asura such as why did the monk leave Asura to himself when he was clearly not rehabillitated, how did he survive as a baby, etc.That being said, the atmosphere that Asura creates with its amazing art style keeps it afloat to make it enjoyable.

Struggling to survive, it did what it could and what it needed to and hence became something like a wild beast child if you will. The child, Asura, goes through a series of events which then leads him to learn about humans and slowly regain some of his humanity. But then again, happiness never lasts long and well the rest you\'ll have to watch for. :)Mind you, beware...of spoilers o.o, I\'ll try to refrain from them though.In terms of story, personally I loved the plot. Some may dislike the drama and the darkness of the story, but thing is, life back in the day for poor people could really be that harsh. For the poor, their lives\' work could be ruined by one disaster and one disaster can kill entire cities. As well, the story has so many interesting themes such as the nature of humans, the difference between humans and beasts, survival ...etc. It brings up the idea that humans are rational creature but when it comes to survival, we can also do crazy shi- I mean beasts. Ahem. (SPOILER, SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IF U DON\'T WANT TO READ IT........I want to say another thing about the story before I move on and that\'s about how the story ends. If you like happy endings, well then, just watch it for the action because a happy ending is not what\'s waiting for you at the end of this tunnel. Ok, maybe that was an exaggeration, but surely even if this was to classify as a happy ending it\'s not your generic one. The bittersweet ending of this story, in my opinion, was very suitable. It once again reinforces another idea that\'s repeated throughout and that\'s the fact that no matter what horrible things happen, humans can cope and continue to live. Not everyone copes, but we can cope.)Rating for story is 10/10Next is art. Art was also something special in Asura. Unlike the traditional stuff, this anime movie uses a blend of cg and 2D art. Course, when I first saw it, my first thought was ""Oh no..."" and I fully prepared myself to sit through the whole thing solely for the sake of the story. Fortunately, this seemingly awkward blend grew on me, and now that I look back on it, I feel that it was done quite well. The beginning scene was a little effie, but the whole cg thing really brought the story to life (haha, get it? To life? ...... I\'m so lame). Especially for the Asura character, he actually looked like a demon which makes his beast to human transition that much more compelling. In terms of animation, cg can get pretty, well choppy? Uh, yeah. Anyways, the cg for this anime was relatively smooth and none of that physics defying hair going on. Things followed the laws of physics and to me, that was more than enough. :) Lastly, I just wanted to say that the general use of color was great in the sense that it help to portray the mood and emotions at different stages of the story.Rating for art is 10/10Third is sound. Ok to sound. To be frank, I didn\'t really pay much attention to the sound/music. But perhaps that could be a good thing too in the sense that the sound and music were realistic enough and matched the story so much that I didn\'t even realize it until the end. One thing I did notice is the manipulation of the volume, louder as the story became more intense and gentle (or even silence) as the violence ceased. One memorable moment was the volume manipulation at the end, and I\'ll leave it at that. :DThe rating for sound is 8/10Next is character. First I like to say: I LOVE ASURA O.O in an omg-his-character-was-so-awesome-I\'m-bawling-my-eyeballs-out-and-it\'s-so-sad-but-I-can\'t-stop-watch-OMG-I JUST-WANT-TO-GIVE-HIM-A-HUG sort of way..... o.o...... ahem. As much as Asura looks and acts like a demon/beast, there are moments where you realize that:A. He\'s just a childB. He doesn\'t know better than to act like he does given his history andC. YOU JUST WANNA GIVE HIM A BIG FLUFFY HUG :(ahem....As for the other characters, there\'s Wakasa, a young female in the village who (SPOILER) Asura becomes attached to. Romantic or not, that\'s up to you to decide (SPOILER END). Wakasa\'s character design is the equivalent of a desert rose or a female version of Moses except not religious.... and Japanese... which ever works for you. She portrayed in a very pure manner but also a very human manner as well. In a sense, if Asura is the wild and beastly side of humans, then Wakasa is the kind, and rational side of humans.I also want to mention character development. As the story was focused on the humanization of Asura, all the development was centered on Asura while the rest of the characters took a guiding role that interacted to shape Asura\'s change. And I think, given the length of the movie, worked out nicely.My rating for character is 10/10Finally over all enjoyment. I think it\'s pretty apparent what my opinion on the movie is from my previous out bursts, but I really think this is a fantastic movie. I mean it was relatively realistic and meaningful and really exciting to watch. Then again, upon reading some of the other reviews it seems this is the type of movie that people either hate or love. So if you love drama, tragedy or action themed stories with a good plot, take a stab at this movie. And if you don\'t, well then that\'s up to you, but I\'d try it :3Thanks for reading. of spoilers o.o, I\'ll try to refrain from them though.In terms of story, personally I loved the plot.

At first glance, it would look like a movie full of mindless violence catering for people who enjoy watching those horrific stuff. It would put off some people because of the gore and violence (these scenes would appear immediately right off the start of the movie). I managed though because these kinds of movie are right up my alley and I consider the scenes in this movie as somewhat ""mild violence"". Anyway, behind the killings and the blood fountains portrayed in this movie lies a message...that was strongly delivered.The setting is 15th century Kyoto. Kyoto at that time was almost like a wasteland due to floods, drought and famine. Enter Asura. Yep, you guessed it, Asura is the main character of this movie called Asura. He is a savage, a monster, a cannibal, a murderer and a beast.  You would think he\'s evil from watching the first parts of the movie. The reality is he is just a child who was forced to learned by himself  the hard-way on how to survive and to protect oneself. He is completely devoid of any morals since he grew up in the wilds. You\'ll see at the beginning of the movie how tragic his birth is.Along his journey into the world of humans, he will meet a mysterious Monk (who frickin kicks butt) and a kind girl known as Wakasa. He and the monk will meet multiple times by chance and the monk will teach him how to fight the beast inside his heart. Wakasa is kinda like his mother who will provide him the warm love and affection that he never received since being born. She will teach him how to be a normal boy. These two will be his guiding light towards the path of change. Of course, before reaching that goal he will have to come through a lot of tragedies, deaths and painful stuff. (T_T)The art of this 3D animation movie (which looks like it\'s a cross between 2D and 3D) is okay, though a think a lot will hate it because it\'s not exactly the beautiful 3D art the most are accustomed to. But if you acknowledged that this is Asura\'s unique style just like I did then you will enjoy the movie a lot more. Movements are fine and fluid though sometimes the characters look weird but that\'s because they purposely created Anime-ish characters that has unreal body proportions. But it\'s OK. One thing about this 3D style though, I honestly believe that if Asura had a 2D version (real anime) instead of this then it\'ll be a lot more gory. The Sound is okay too. Nothing outstanding but nothing bad either.Overall, this movie was good. Indeed it can be hard to watch at times but the character development of someone like Asura is very unique. You don\'t see any characters like this which is realistically portrayed. He kills people, even innocent children and has this murderous wild instincts (you don\'t usually see any MC like this in any anime). The driving forces for watching this film is Asura\'s harsh and cruel journey into the human world and his dramatic development into being someone more human. The movie is has actions and a lot of drama (real drama!)  If you can handle watching gore, violence,  dramatic/tragic stuff, and you don\'t mind the art style then I have to recommend this to you. If your\'e a happy person who don\'t want to feel sad or horrified then don\'t. (but seriously i recommend this for everyone!)My Personal Rating: 9/10 that was strongly delivered.The setting is 15th century Kyoto.

A miserable pile of little secrets!""-quote not relevanthaha, that was just a gag, now here\'s my review for this movie:when i watched the trailer, I knew I was going to be hooked in to this movie, and after I watched it, I was never disappointed and quickly became one of my most favorite anime movie of all time.Asura takes us to a medieval era in japan where famine is widespread and everyone struggles to eat and survive, and among those people, there was a child who was human in appearance but has primal instincts like that of a wild animal. Through...his journey, however, he was able to witness how human beings interact and began to waver from his animalistic path towards the path of being a human.After finishing the movie itself, I was dumbstruck at how well written the whole story was. The concept was very dark, genius and intriguing at times. The movie itself questions us of what really makes us humans or are we willing to give up our own humanity in order to survive in this cruel world.Awesome, brilliant and dark, I highly recommend this movie to those who love dark stories and those concerning human virtues. his journey, however, he was able to witness how human beings interact and began to waver from his animalistic path towards the path of being a human.After finishing the movie itself, I was dumbstruck at how well written the whole story was.

Are we a product of our environment?  These types of themes can be seen in other anime, but this film uses the subject of cannibalism to drive this thought process, which is something I haven't seen done in anime before.  During the entire movie, Asura has to face three powerful influences on his character: a monk, who stirs up Asura's fight against his beastly nature; Wakasa, who shows him love that he hadn't known since his mother...abandoned him, and a lord, who villainizes Asura and confuses his chances on becoming accepted as a human being.  All three play a very large role with Asura, but you won't connect with any of these characters.  I feel as though you're not supposed to.  You're an outsider looking in.  Your job is to analyze the situation, and hopefully arrive to a meaningful conclusion. Plus, there's so many conflicts that are thrown at the viewer, I don't see how anyone could consider liking any of the characters.  One in particular, the monk, is very interesting, but he only comes in when needed to push the story forward.This story makes a big deal out of encouraging the viewer to think on whether Asura might just be a young boy trying to survive.  Maybe he already is human? Maybe people are inherently good and want to be that way, if their environment will let them? But for me, the film was more of the shortcomings of human nature.  Manipulation, lying, hatred, double standards and selfishness.  There are plenty of instances where I questioned, why would Wakasa, someone who is literally teaching Asura to love, show the opposite? Or why would the lord be selfish to his own starving people, but instead of the people villainizing the lord, they turn on Asura? There was a lot of foolishness based on human behavior.  Seeing Asura's mother abandon him due to starvation twisting her mind, showed me how the environment can sway a person to do things they wouldn't think was morally acceptable, as opposed to how some of the characters purposefully treated Asura and each other.  When the credits rolled,  I was mostly left feeling frustrated with human decisions.In terms of the quality of the artwork and sound, it was overall good.  I was pretty surprised by the CGI.  Usually in anime, it's clunky or ill-fitting, almost as if it's pointless.  This CGI seemed more of a mix of 3D and 2D, so there was a bit more fluidity to character movement that made this enjoyable to watch.  Great care was put into Asura's facial expressions.  There's a scene where Asura has to fight or die, and his facial expressions really helped me to sympathize with him at that time.  The sound effects fit the theme, they were odd and jarring. I think they wanted the sounds to be alarming since the nature of the film includes cannibalism.  And let's be honest, Asura looks creepy af! Masako Nozawa's voice acting for the character Asura was amazing.  She was definitely the most notable out of the cast.  Everyone did a good job, but I enjoyed Masako Nozawa the most.  Lastly, the background music was very suspenseful.  Even though this is supposed to be a philosophical movie, it's still lightweight horror/thriller.  So the repetitive bass during one of the fight scenes made me pretty tense.This is definitely not a film I could recommend to everyone.  If you like the macabre with some pretty dark philosophical undertones, then this would be for you.  It's not a spectacular anime, especially since it immediately throws the nature vs nurture argument at the viewer.  Also, in my opinion, the film tried too hard to encourage the viewer to think about that argument and in doing so, dropped the ball a few times with character influences.  Luckily the CGI was pretty interesting and the story moved quickly. abandoned him, and a lord, who villainizes Asura and confuses his chances on becoming accepted as a human being.

BanG Dream!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33573/BanG_Dream,"[""It's become a common trend in recent years for an anime project to spawn an idol group - it boosts the popularity of the franchise, and provides another avenue for profit. However, according to Takaaki Kidani, founder and president of Bushiroad, the company responsible for the BanG Dream! multimedia project, the era of idol anime is coming to an end, and band shows will be the next big thing. Which is interesting, because despite technically being a band anime, BanG Dream adheres incredibly close to the idol formula. You can buy albums and character songs for BanG Dream. (Shouldn't the focus be on the instruments?)...You can go to a concert and see the voice actors perform live. And it's not just concert tickets and CDs that BanG Dream is trying to sell you; the multimedia project also includes card games, headphones, several manga series, and a mobile game. BanG Dream is an extremely commercial project, which isn't a bad thing in and of itself. However, it becomes a problem when the pursuit of financial interest comes at the expense of creativity.Everything about this anime is designed to be safe and inoffensive. There's nothing new or risky here that could potentially alienate consumers; just trends and tropes that have proven themselves to be successful thrown together into an amalgamation that's sure to sell. It's something that nobody is going to hate, but that nobody is going to love either. Rather than creating something that's only okay for everyone, it would have been better if they had created something that will be at least one person's favorite. Sadly, making a good show seems to be secondary to making good money.There's not much that's more generic in anime than a story of a high school student trying to start a club for one of their interests. With that premise alone, you already have a fair sense of the events that will go on over the course of the series: In the first two thirds of the series, it'll be necessary to recruit more members, and of course they'll all have some issue that needs to be worked out before they can join, and once the group is finally completed in the final third, there will be some last challenge to overcome. But genericness aside, there's also the issue that the series is loaded down with fluff. There are so many scenes that don't accomplish anything, when there's so much that needs to be accomplished. It would have been possible to tell a much better story in much less time if the staff actually cared enough to write something interesting, but as it is, the story is generic and insubstantial.Scenes that don't accomplish anything doesn't refer only to the half-developed plot; character growth was only sorely lacking. The characters start the series well within the lines of clearly defined archetypes, and over the course of 13 episodes, they never really go beyond that. There's the occasional scene that will hint that maybe some growth is going on, but it'll never result in lasting change. This results in a tragic absence of sincerity. No matter how absurd a situation characters are placed in, it's still possible to relate to and care about them if their actions and emotions feel genuine. Here, the situation isn't all that detached from ordinary life, but these characters are so flat that it's near impossible to connect with or be invested in them.Perhaps another aspect of this is that the characters aren't visually appealing. BanG Dream relies heavily on CG for its performance scenes, and this causes the characters to look really unnatural, especially their faces. And even when the show isn't relying on CG, the use of stills and pans is abundant. Over the course of its run, there were two occasions on which episodes were delayed by a week, and it also started two to three weeks into its season. It's not unreasonable to expect that this extra time would be put to good use for making sure that everything actually looked good,  but apparently CG was passable, and the staff couldn't be bothered to go beyond that.After watching a certain amount of anime, you begin to pick up a few words and phrases: youth, dreams, bonds, excitement, you get the idea. These are the types of words that make up the songs from BanG Dream - no real depth, just a barrage of platitudes and banalities. At least, that's how the lyrics are for the opening and ending themes. As for all of the other songs that are sung over the course of the show (like five?), they're left untranslated. It's probably no great loss, though official releases ought to get into the habit of translating song lyrics. Despite being a band show, it seems that the music really wasn't all that important.None of these factors on their own would necessarily ruin an anime. A solid cast could compensate for a lousy story, and some people won't care how a show looks or sounds as long as it has something interesting to say. The problem is, BanG Dream doesn't have any strong suits; everything about it is derivative and half-baked. It doesn't have anything new to say, and exists only to make a profit off of an existing trend. It projects a future for the industry where creativity is shunned, and the only thing that matters is marketability. This is everything that is wrong with the industry. Good riddance.

It's not unreasonable to expect that this extra time would be put to good use for making sure that everything actually looked good,  but apparently CG was passable, and the staff couldn't be bothered to go beyond that.After watching a certain amount of anime, you begin to pick up a few words and phrases: youth, dreams, bonds, excitement, you get the idea. These are the types of words that make up the songs from BanG Dream - no real depth, just a barrage of platitudes and banalities. At least, that's how the lyrics are for the opening and ending themes. As for all of the other songs that are sung over the course of the show (like five?), they're left untranslated. It's probably no great loss, though official releases ought to get into the habit of translating song lyrics. Despite being a band show, it seems that the music really wasn't all that important.None of these factors on their own would necessarily ruin an anime. A solid cast could compensate for a lousy story, and some people won't care how a show looks or sounds as long as it has something interesting to say. The problem is, BanG Dream doesn't have any strong suits; everything about it is derivative and half-baked. It doesn't have anything new to say, and exists only to make a profit off of an existing trend. It projects a future for the industry where creativity is shunned, and the only thing that matters is marketability. This is everything that is wrong with the industry. Good riddance."", 'I decided to give BanG Dream a shot since I enjoyed the tap tap hell which is the rhythm game. In all honesty, I usually go into these types of anime with low expectations and I set the bar especially low because of how boring the synopsis made the anime sound.At a glance, BanG Dream looks generic, bland and boring. Storywise, there’s nothing outstanding about it but it isn’t bad nor good, it’s more mediocre. The plotline is definitely not the selling point for this anime. It’s your standard “airhead gathers girls to start a band/group” which is fine, it’s supposed to be lighthearted....Although, there is some realism within the show. It touches on family issues, finding yourself and there are some very serious takes on friendship and relying on others. The plot itself isn’t completely predictable, there are a few things that might leave you wondering what will happen next. The story does start off slow and a couple episodes are mainly just the progress of the group which can be boring. Overall, the story wasn’t bad but it could’ve been better.As for characters, they’re all very likeable. A variation of tropes, you’re bound to like at least one of the main girls. There was at least one episode dedicated to each member, the development was pretty good for twelve episodes. The bonds between them all were displayed well and the friendships were developed nicely throughout the series. If you played the game like myself, you will notice an absence of three other bands, if you haven’t played the game you aren’t missing out on much so don’t worry about it. If BanG Dream does get a second season I would like to see more of these characters implemented in story rather than just being cameos.The artwork was nice, like most band/idol anime the colours are vibrant. Everything else was pretty standard apart from the eyes, they seemed to focus more on the eyes than anything else. Only complaint would be the CG, it was messy. Didn’t look particularly good and they would’ve been better off without it.Now one of the more important aspects, music. The OST was nice enough, it wasn’t memorable or anything but it did add to the atmosphere during scenes. Although, there were a lot of times where background music wasn’t used where it could’ve been. If you don’t pay attention to that kind of stuff then it shouldn’t be a bother. The opening and ending were nice, ending better than the opening in my opinion but both were catchy. The songs were cute and funny, the voices were raw which I can appreciate since they’re all supposed to be novices. The seiyuus did a great job portraying their character, you could really hear the emotion.Generally speaking, BanG Dream wasn’t fantastic but it was enjoyable. Lighthearted atmosphere, cute characters and catchy songs. Whether or not you watch this anime is for you to decide. I hope this review at least helped you finalise your decision!

I hope this review at least helped you finalise your decision!', '""Why does it exist"" is really the only way I can think to describe this anime. For a simplistic slice of life anime about a group of friends trying to start their own band, it\'s perfectly fine. Not anything special, and incredibly inoffensive. But fine. You can sit down, watch it, and you don\'t feel like it\'s a chore to do so. But at the same time, it\'s not going to blow you away. It\'s obvious that this anime\'s primary purpose is to be one element in a multimedia project, spawning an idol group, the game, ect, and that\'s really all it is. It does...everything you expect, and it does it in a decent enough way, but it\'s all stuff you\'d be expecting. It has heart behind it, but that heart is cliched in itself.I may seem like a broken record here, but that\'s really because I can\'t think of much else to say. If you enjoy the BanG Dream! game, or the songs by the real life groups that spawned from the project, then you\'ll likely like the anime. It\'s the characters you like from one of the bands, doing band like stuff, and becoming friends. If you\'re planning to just watch the anime, do yourself a favor, and don\'t make it a ""drop everything and look forward to watching this"" thing. The best way to watch it would be casually, in between the things that have your complete focus. In that sense the anime is enjoyable, but don\'t expect anything more out of it. everything you expect, and it does it in a decent enough way, but it\'s all stuff you\'d be expecting.

I was honestly looking forward to this anime (with all the love live jokes about this being the new sub for it). The first episode is extremely boring. You don\'t really care for our main character Kasumi. Her first impression is just generic AF. Happy, just discovered her new passion, dream seeking, klutz, wants to give it her all, etc. You care much more for her new friend Arisa who wont go to school for stupid reasons that aren\'t explored. You forget that she is there after Kasumi is looking for other members. The only character...who actually has development is Kasumi\'s childhood friend Saaya. Sadly the way they shoe horned her story is honestly terrible and really dumb. They also make a lot of effort to show Kasumi\'s younger sister Asuka who is planning on quitting the swim club. THEY NEVER EVER explain why, yet she\'s in the anime quite a bit.pre-END note:This is not a K-ON rip off. It had potential to be a good anime, but the story is lacking so much. The art is bad when they are full body and from a slight distance, the CG looks like they have flat heads, the sound is...average, the singing voices of PopiPa are MEh( But that\'s fine because they are supposed to be novices). All main characters are forgettable, you are left wanting to know about the other bands. (WHICH YOU CAN. This has a very good rhythm game for the JP appstores)But I guess if you like watching girls play instruments and have a ruff time trying to reach their goal... I guess you can watch it.Don\'t expect anything near a K-ON or even a LL.Honestly don\'t even bother unless you want more""""""Character Development"""""" for the JP app game.(side note: in the game atm gitter green just has 1 song and no actual characters in game as of the writing of this review)FINAL Opinions:After just watching ep 13 of this series you can definitely tell where all the budget went towards. Background characters are actually there, full body shots look good. Their faces don\'t derp(except maybe otae, I still don\'t like her CG face). You can see a few other characters from the game\'s other bands and some interaction from Ako and Rinko from Roselia(posibly one of the best bands in game).In the game ""SPACE"" in not in the map, but instead another place called ""Circle"".

In the end I still stand on my review.', 'Like many others, I discovered BanG Dream! when it was a fresh app that had just come out. I consider myself extremely well versed in idol anime especially those that have spawned from mobile rhythm games. When I saw an anime had been made, I was looking forward to it because other idol anime like Love Live! and Cinderella Girls had been successful. However, this was not the case with Bandori.It is extremely bland and seems like it was a fast attempt to catch up to other idol anime that had been successful and making tons of money. None of the characters are multifaceted,...and the plot itself is generic. Personally, I would stick to playing the game and skip the anime itself if Bandori interests you. However, there are many more series more deserving a watch. and the plot itself is generic. Personally, I would stick to playing the game and skip the anime itself if Bandori interests you.

I was expecting more tbhStory is good, and the pacing was alright.Music, this is where they shine.

Without being forced, it actually feels like there is progression and trials for the characters, which is something I really appreciate.ARTI don't think this animation has as much quality or heart as K-On, sometimes almost feeling cheap. Any presence of CG here (or in related games or music videos) is surprisingly smooth. Character design is appealing,...however, even with side characters.SOUNDMusic might be my favorite out of those listed shows, and if you wanna cheat, more Poppin Party and Roselia songs and covers outside the show are mindblowingly good.

Perhaps you thought to yourself, ""maybe the source anime was good!"" If that\'s the case, be warned, because if you\'re anything like me, you won\'t come out the other side as optimistic as you were going in. It wasn\'t too good. I\'ve broken down my review into the core parts.Story: 4/10It wasn\'t terrible. But it wasn\'t good either. Most, if not all, of the paper thin plot was shoehorned in, in an artificial attempt to create drama. Hardly any of it flowed naturally; it felt like one needless hurdle after another. This...is, of course, in a show which requires little to no plot in the first place. Look at K-On!, for example, a band anime where girls get together and have fun. Bandori, on the other hand, doesn\'t exactly attempt to be revolutionary, but it does fall back to the same tropes that almost every mediocre show is guilty of. And then immediately forgets about said plot tropes. It was a rough ride from start to finish, but I will say that it ended on a good note. There were perhaps two good episodes throughout the series.Art: 3/10Good lord, what a mess the art was. I\'m not exactly an anime art style connoisseur, if it\'s presentable, it\'s fine by me. That\'s what this anime wasn\'t: presentable. Right from the get-go the amount of derp-frames are absurd; more often than not you\'ll stare at a face and question whether or not that\'s even anatomically possible. And when they cut to 3D CGI for the music scenes (this happens often, so be wary of that) it\'s not any better. I will say, however, that what we\'ve seen from their 3D CGI recently as music videos from other bands (HHW, Afterglow, etc) look leaps and bounds better, so I\'m hopeful for season 2\'s CGI. (Which, by the way, S2 will be only 3D CGI. We\'ll see how that goes.)Character: 6/10Kinda trope-y, kinda fun. A lot of the personalities of the cast are those which you\'ve seen time and time again, but that\'s not to say it was that bad. There are times you\'ll think to yourself, ""Of course, because that\'s what that stereotypical archetype would do"", but it flows kinda nicely. It certainly makes for some humorous interactions. Some.Sound: 8/10This is a huge hit or a miss, and not everyone would agree with me. For one thing, I didn\'t like the singles. They didn\'t resonate with me, as I found myself enjoying maybe 2, 3 songs tops. The background music, however, was great at conveying whatever emotion the studio wanted you to feel. It built tension, opened relief, conveyed when a time was goofy, or whatever else music is supposed to do. It was good, it sounded good, it worked well, not much else to say here.Enjoyment: 6/10Even with everything I\'ve said above, I didn\'t hate it. It wasn\'t a masterpiece by any means, but it wasn\'t as if it was some show written, produced, and aired in less than a day. When I wasn\'t reeling in the artificial drama or awkwardly staring at a poorly drawn key frame for more than what felt like was normal, I enjoyed the wacky antics of these characters. As I\'ve said, there were a few good moments buried in a mountain of mediocrity.Overall / Conclusion:If my flip-flopping stance hasn\'t been drilled through enough, I\'ll reiterate it one last time. It wasn\'t bad. It wasn\'t great. It was somewhere between ""just okay"" and ""good"", which I suppose warrants a 6.

Kasumi Toyama voiced by Aimi Terakawa our genki leader...check. Arisa Ichigaya voiced by Ayasa Itou our resident tsundere and main focus of quips and teasing within the group and the keyboardist of the group...check. Rimi Ushigome voiced by Rimi Nishimoto the bassist of the group, the shy one...check. Tae Hanazono voiced by Sae...Otsuka the aloof cloudcuckoolander one and the guitarist of the group...check and finally Saaya Yamabuki voiced by Ayaka Ohashi the drummer of the band and probably the only decent character in the anime. Yeah, if you blatantly haven\'t noticed, besides Saaya, the other characters are as stock and cliche as they already are. Saaya is the exception all due to her backstory and why she doesn\'t want to be in the band and once her DOES join the band...she becomes bland as every other character. The rest of the Poppin\' Party?...they essentially had Kasumi by coincidence gathered these characters together to form Poppin\' Party...check. The minor supporting characters are also there and some are supports...again typical but there are other bands in this anime and LA is more intrigued by the colorfully exotic bands other than Poppin\' Party...and they are designated to be only cameos and other characters Poppin\' Party just interacts with.The plot is your typical ""form a band"" and ""be the best"" as LA said, typical of the genre, however this anime just has ever plot beats of its contemporaries. From K-On! on how the coincidences lead down to forming the band, the band competition, Kasumi\'s later character dilemma reflects something similar to Love Live\'s Honoka in the first season and finally the multiple bands in competition have both shades of Love Live and The iDOLM@STER. The characters are no better with their stereotypical archetypes that any idol fan or ""cute girls in a band or idol group"" has seen.The animation from Xebec and Issen are well pun intended but the animation has a rather poppy feel to it, from it\'s characters to it\'s backgrounding. The animation is decent especially with it\'s character designs having a moe touch with some bolded outlines making the designs rather unique which is rather wasted on many of the main cast characters being stock and bland as they are. The ""Lives"" use of the CG however is probably the worst aspect of the animation, as in the CG integrated with the bright and poppy traditional animation just clash SOOOO heavily and the CG use is rampant in the almost every Live concerning Poppin\' Party, LA gets it Love Live did that too but even they integrated the CG better and used it in conjunction with it\'s traditional animation as the seasons and Sunshine passed and BanG Dream! on the other hand has this blatantly apparent CG in full and used for the majority of it\'s Lives (sure BanG Dream! doesn\'t have another season or anything but they never deviate from using CG in their Lives, it\'s just a mark of laziness AND consistency). Overall, Xebec\'s character designs are all great and all, LA just wished it blended to it\'s Lives as well.The voice acting is artificial moeness in a ways. From Aimi Terakawa who yes, is annoyingly genki to Rimi Nishimoto as Rimi- ohhh LA saw what you did there- Ushigome...as the squeakily shy vocals and Ayasa Itou as the tsundere and her vocals became rather annoying especially after her thousandth tsundere quip. The only two voice actors LA seemed to like were Sae Otsuka due to her nice tsukommi quips and her general cloudcuckooness and Ayaka Ohashi was moe but a decent one and she got bit more range due to her ""backstory"" bringing in her dramatic vocals into play.In the soundtrack department, the OST is ok enough though with Kasumi\'s singing ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" over and over again you\'d WANT Kasumi to shut it. The rest of the OST is just ""ok"" but not to the point of being ""catchy""...just ""ok"", but it\'s like every other generic Japanese anime pop music you\'ve heard. You know for an anime that has music as one of it\'s core focus (you know..forming the band and playing songs etc.), the music should be one of the things you kinda had to excel at.LA will point out that it\'s themes of being a ""star"" or stars in general is hamfistingly inserted into the characters and plot which also seeps into the writing as well, sure something like Love Live also had their themes front and center yet they were subtle in their execution but they weren\'t as obnoxiously blatant as what BanG Dream! did with their theming of ""stars"" (Poppin\' Party\'s guitars are star shaped, the Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, looking out to the stars when there aren\'t any, Kasumi herself being one of the main driving forces for this theme), in it\'s defense, LA gets it, Poppin\' Party and by extent BanG Dream! is trying to have it\'s own personality by using this theme, sure it CAN do that...LA just wished it wasn\'t as blatantly eye-rollingly obvious what it\'s trying to get across.The finale arc as LA aforementioned to Kasumi\'s ""dilemma"" is, it DOES make it interesting BUT the other plotline being the place where the bands all play at ""Space"" is gonna get closed...LA to say the least kinda thought it clashed heavily with Kasumi\'s plotline (or forgotten until the final episode). Before LA goes into more detail...CHECK on Space being closed (See Love Live\'s first season entire goal for Honoka). One is that yeah...it\'s something LA has seen before just in a MUCH smaller scale, second is the fact that what does Space closing has to do with Kasumi changing herself into training herself to the point of losing her voice?...their still gonna have their band, the band isn\'t gonna dissolve if Space is gone as they can ohhh LA doesn\'t know...still make a CLUB at school and still sing songs at school and lastly, HOW can Poppin\' Party resolve Space from stop being closed down, it seemed more in the grunchy owner\'s own personal reasoning than a ""financial"" problem as to why it\'s closing (and the finale?...NEVER tells WHY but it\'s still closing so yeah...feels like an almost total non-conflict)...it just feels forced and checking the boxes for forced manipulation into trying to like the already stock and annoyingly bland characters. Two Steps forward...5 steps back...BanG Dream! is like every other idol or cute girls in a band anime you have seen only done with little effort (not completely though), from the too similar plot and character beats to it\'s just ""ok"" OST songs. BanG Dream! is by all means a run of the mill, checked boxes of its genre and expended as little effort to get this franchise off it\'s feet.It\'s no wonder BanG Dream! reception has been radio silent in terms of popularity. Yes, this anime based off a manga has turned into a franchise, from a mobile rhythm game to their merchandise not selling (no seriously) to only a little to no DOUJIN circles doing anything about this franchise. Wow...that\'s depressing...LA says all this about BanG Dream! even outside of the anime itself as the anime/franchise is artificial and desperate to go with the trend and be popular but like LA said about the anime, the anime is a stock, cliched with none of the flair that it\'s contemporaries has done better with it\'s elements and even better than BanG Dream! has done.From a seasonal point of view, BanG Dream! was a pretty mediocre to almost boring ride, it had a ""bit"" of effort in it\'s characters but it was a slog to get through at times. But nonetheless, BanG Dream! is definitely one of those animes from Winter 2017 you can quite easily ignore and not miss out on anything. BanG Dream! is mediocre and cliched being played straight without a hint of flair to it, not horrible or appalling per say...but on par of nothing much to offer in which you can find better animes from it\'s genre (be it idol, music, drama or all three).One last note but this is just LA, but LA would of thought that changing the focus from Poppin\' Party to ANY of the other bands could have made this anime a bit better... Otsuka the aloof cloudcuckoolander one and the guitarist of the group...check and finally Saaya Yamabuki voiced by Ayaka Ohashi the drummer of the band and probably the only decent character in the anime. Yeah, if you blatantly haven\'t noticed, besides Saaya, the other characters are as stock and cliche as they already are. Saaya is the exception all due to her backstory and why she doesn\'t want to be in the band and once her DOES join the band...she becomes bland as every other character.

The anime itself in my opinion falls short of being a great music anime however that is not to say the music in the series is not amazing as this series has some of my favourite music in anime to date even though only a glimmer of that is shown in this first season.The anime for BanG Dream is also amazing past this season, this anime felt like it was building up to something greater which is exactly what it did as both season 2 and...season 3 are massive steps up in storytelling, appearance, and writing in general. (which is why I ranked sound 8/10 for this show as I know it gets EVEN BETTER in the future seasons(This anime unlike the game focuses almost entirely on the band Poppin Party with occasional very short appearances of the other bands from the game (Afterglow, Pastel Palettes, Roselia and Hello Happy World) and another minor band that is almost exclusively in the anime Glitter GreenThe game is a rhythm game visual novel and does great storytelling, the reason I am making this review is I encourage you to watch this show and explore into the deeper universe of the series if you dislike the first season of this anime.Now about the actual show now that I got that disclaimer-esque warning out of the way.The show centers around 5 girls, Rimi, Arisa, Tae, Saya and Kasumi who form a band called Poppin Party, this is a mixture of your typical school anime and music anime that feels somewhat cliched and boring at times however is still very enjoyable. It is important to know that despite this anime showing mainly this band that there are 6 bands in total shown in the bandori universe that matter up to this point.Poppin Party (our main cast)but there are also 5 minor bands of importance in this series (pre S2 and S3)Afterglow, Pastel Palettes, Roselia, Hello Happy World, and Glitter Green (who are minor characters in this show)A lot of these minor characters won't be shown much and if you are a player of the Bang Dream mobile rhythm game and coming to watch for those characters in specific you should know that you will likely be let down.The story is fairly rudimentary and isn't a shining point at all, if you are coming for story expect barebones basic writing, nothing exceptionally terrible but also nothing to praise or give props to.Art is fairly good, the 3d design of the characters can be off putting but they get much better with their animation in S2 and S3 so I can't flaw them much as it doesn't take away from what is being presented.I ranked character a 6 because despite the series as a whole having amazing characters, you only see a glimmer of that here, this is a great stepping stone into these characters but don't expect many major developments.I enjoy this series and I even enjoyed this show despite the fact it pales in comparison to it's contemporaries, I heavily encourage you to try Season 2 and maybe Season 3 if you enjoy S2 and install Bang Dream Girls Band Party on your mobile device to see the better parts of this series.Overall I rank this a 7/10 due to it being an overall good series and good starting point for the show, it is lackluster in a lot of parts and lacks the shine and charm the future seasons and game bring, however that does not mean it should be discounted entirely.

There are plenty of shows that became successful following a particular format, and those achievements should not be diminishes. Look at Kuroko no Basket. It just happens that Bang Dream falls in that specific genre. So, onto the review.The story is very basic. A high school girl, Toyama Kasumi, looking for inspiration, follows a trail of star stickers to a pawn shop, where she finds a red star shaped guitar. She decides she wants to learn how to play the instrument...and find people to put a band together. Everything works out in a way or the other. She finds the right people to play in the band and they are able to perform on a live stage. With some complications along the way, but you get the point.Through out the story, the main characters go through some major character development, making them a little bit fleshed out, and a little less one dimensional. At the beginning of the story they downright look like stereotypical anime characters, but to the end, you can see their personalities shine with all their flaws and imperfections, making them all extremely relatable and likeable. Even the ones that you are not completely fond of.The animation is not horrible, but they could have been able to do better. The CGI aspect is really cool looking, but it just doesn't save some of the more atrocious looking parts of the animation.What really stands out from this show, in my opinion, is the music. This is no Nana or K-On, but the music is still pretty darn good. Rock songs have always been my favourite thou, so I might be a little biased while going into this, but you cannot tell me that Time Lapse doesn't friggin pump you up. It makes you wanna do a massive workout, and run around doing stuff. It is very classical rock, with tones of pop and and musical theatre, but you kinda get the gist. If you like idol anime music, you will probably like this kind of music. Poppin'Party is pretty standard though when it comes to Bang Dream music.There isn't just one type of genre. If you go into the game, there is a whole variety of songs to listen to from five different bands with specific styles and songs. That is what makes this franchise so much fun. Putting different bands together to showcase the genres out there (ranging from musical-theatre to gothic), with relatable characters and fun stories, is something that very few have done.To be honest, the reason why I am giving this review 8/10 is because I play the game, and I can see the characters, the story and the music develop in such a way that you don't really see in the anime. If you are just gonna watch the anime you might be a little disappointed, but if you go into the game, you can just see why it is so compelling and fun. My favourite band isn't even Poppin'Party (Toyama Kasumi's band), yet they are still lots of fun to listen to.Lastly, Bang Dream in reality is not about Poppin'Party. Bang Dream is Poppin'Party, Afterglow, Rosalia, Hello Happy World and Pastel Palettes. Bang Dream is about finding your own musical preference and style, while obviously finding entertainment in cute girls and pretty cards. and find people to put a band together.

After having seen this, I can say that while it may not be the most perfect show out there, it's still an origin story filled with plenty of sparkling and heart-pounding moments.To form the all-girl band called Poppin'Party, Kasumi—an oddball who has an energetic heart and a voice that blissfully melts my heart—has to meet the other members first, and earlier segments of the show introduce us...to them. We have Saaya, a caring older sister who helps out with her family's bakery; Rimi, a timid choco-cornet-loving girl; Arisa, who is adorable because of her gap moe tendencies; and Tae, the dorkiest and most comical one of them all. At first glance, their tropey demeanors can come off as being too vanilla, but I'll assure you this. Those basic traits of theirs will eventually pave to way to some sincere development as they realize what lies ahead in their musical ambitions.Before I get into the character development though, there are points throughout the show where the story gets quite shaky. Like the creators know how the plot points will chronologically line up, but didn't put in enough effort to make them flow more naturally. As a result, some scenes—mostly the sedated humdrums—feel out of place when they're shoehorned in the storyline. And those scenes can be distracting, considering the character development here rely a lot on nuances and subtleties.It's not to say all these small interactions are meaningless. In fact, most of them are genuinely enjoyable to watch, and not just because they're heartwarmingly cute or humorous. With the constant focus on how the girls' dynamic with each other evolves through their actions, thoughts, and exposure to music, their flaws and personal issues are slowly revealed, and this is where Bandori sparkles the most.Because the show is grounded with no overly ambitious goals, the changes Poppin'Party go through feel realistically intimate. Everyone has their own worries to deal with, as is the case with Rimi's anxiety, Arisa's social awkwardness, Saaya's burdens from her past, Tae's general apathy, and Kasumi's optimism causing her to become oblivious of her own self. And it's through the start-up of their band—with support from each other and their family—where they learn that they can overcome these things that are stopping them from seeking out the beat they've been looking for. As they practice, they discover more about themselves along with the wondrous prospect of being in a band together—and it's a development that's very fulfilling to see.Art-wise, even though I find it could've been done better, the vibrancy at least works well enough with the narrative elements. There are stills and pan shorts here and there, with some odd-looking eye placements, but there are also scenes that look beautiful in the character-defining moments. The CGI isn't half bad either, as outside of the occasional off-model ones, it captures the fun energy from Poppin'Party's performancesSpeaking of performances, the musical direction taken by this show is mostly low-key, with soundtracks that complement the relaxed atmosphere quite nicely. The insert songs are definitely the most notable ones, considering they characterize who Poppin'Party is as a novice band. It helps that the creators chose to go with a raw live feel rather than using the version from post-production as it makes their songs sound even more authentic to the ears. From a rough and basic start to a more delightful result, their music resonates together with their development as a band.Looking back at everything once again, Bandori might have started off feeling uncertain, but its direction took for a better turn with its evolution towards an emotionally engaging story on Poppin'Party's origin. They sparkle from their meaningful development and friendship. They make my heart pound when they perform. And I'm definitely proud of what they've learned before becoming such a lovable band. to them.

It started with a manga of 5 teenage girls coming together to start a band. Then in 2017, an anime was made with new character designs and story. And in the same year, we also got the Bang Dream! mobile game, which is now a huge success with over 9 million players, but how good was the anime that started it all?Story:The story is about a girl named Kasumi who decides to start a band out of inspiration when seeing a band perform live. She makes friends with other four girls to form...the band, ''Poppin' Party''. I'm a sucker for music anime with this kind of story, as I enjoy watching the characters grow and improve on their skills in the band. What makes the story interesting is the character arcs that our girls have to go trough, but other than that, the story is quite simple and even predictable at times.Art:Bang Dream's art isn't anything too impressive compared to what we get in anime nowadays, but I certainly wouldn't call it bad, but I also wouldn't call it great. One thing I do admire about Bandori's franchise is the character designs, Popipa defiantly has the most natural colored hair out of all the bands in the franchise and it makes sense since the characters were based off the seiyuu hat voice them. Background art is... alright. There are some nice places in the anime that have some nice designs, but a lot of the series also takes place in a school, so don't expect anything too ground breaking with the scenery. Characters can be quite expressive, but can also have a bit of ''derp' faces from time to time. The CGI is... average. It definitely looked strange at times, but thankfully, season 2 got a different studio who have experience with CGI so the animation looks ten times better. The CGI is only used in music sequence scenes so you won't see them too often.Sound:Listening to the soundtrack, it has nice tracks, but it's a very standard slice of life anime OST. Nothing too much stands out in the sound, but what I can praise Bang Dream! for is the music. Back when the first anime came out, Poppin' Party didn't have much songs, but even with the little amount they had, the songs are pretty good! The music has always been my favorite part of the franchise and it gets better and better as time goes on.Characters:The 5 girls of Popipa might be very standard character cliches when you look at them first, but they become much stronger and better characters as you go trough the show.Kasumi Toyama is the very cheery denki girl who's looking for more excitement and thrill in her life which inspires her to start a band. Kasumi is a very standard protagonist who's very optimistic about everything and never gives up. While she still has flaws and not the best leader, you can see how her character grows and improves. Whether her optimistic personality becomes annoying or not depends on the viewer, but I love Kasumi for how hard she works.Rimi Ushigome is the shy one of the group, looking up at her big sister as an inspiration in music. The character arcs in bang dream are always so satisfying as you watch the characters grow and that's also very apparent with Rimi. While she still struggles a bit with her shyness as the series goes on, you can see how she battles with her fears and becomes a more confident bass player.Arisa Ichigaya is the tsundere. Constantly being annoyed by some of Kasumi's actions and attitude towards things as well as being easily flustered. I can see how Arisa can be annoying to some, but the brutally honest personality is what I like about her character. As the series goes on, she also opens up with her feelings more and starts to really get attached to everyone in the band.Tae Hanzono is a very... interesting character. She's the ''airhead'' of the group, but the same could be said for Kasumi. Tae is my personal favorite of the girls, as she's so unpredictable and bizarre with some of her words and actions. She is the most skilled one in the group and the one most passionate about her instrument. She's a joy to watch throughout the show.And that leaves us with Saya Yamabuki. Saya is kind-hearted and the most mature, bu she doesn't get as much screen time due to her joining the band much later in the series. I won't spoil much, but she has the most interesting arc during the end of the series which makes her a great character.There are also some other minor characters, but they aren't as interesting to talk about. The best way to experience these characters is actually trough the Bang Dream! mobile app. As you read the games stories, you really see more of the characters that the anime doesn't explore, but that's recommend if you really want to get into the franchise. (The app does have a global release).Enjoyment:I personally enjoyed the anime. I think my love for the franchise is because of the mobile app and just how much the app offers in terms of content. I enjoyed watching the characters and their interactions, and how they grow as a band and friends. You can really see how much they end up caring for each other and it might be cheesy as hell, but I love it.Overall:Bang Dream! isn't fantastic, nor is it awful. I feel like not enough fans of the bandori app give the anime a try because of it's animation, not even realizing that the anime does a great job at developing Poppin' Party as a band. I would definitely recommend the second season and game over the first season, but if you have interest into a music anime about a group of friends, give this anime a try. the band, ''Poppin' Party''.

The band aspects and the good music were in a way similar, but that’s the end of it. Bang Dream! shines on its own. The story is actually generic, its the usual plot that you see in any slice-of-life animes starring only high school girls. But what separates them from the bunch would be the characters and the progression of their story. The pacing was quite slow compared to the usual pacing of a slice-of-life high school girls anime, but very compact and solid as they were able to showcase everything. Their setting was also quite interesting. Yes,...you don’t see much guys/men in the series, but the thought of having a studio cafe for girl bands sounds really BADASS. Even though it was unrealistic, it was still fun to watch it.I do want to point out the use of episodic introduction/focused arcs of the lead characters. It is the usual trope that we see on SoL, but I am getting tired of it. It would have been great if they layered each of their arcs since the beginning, then slowly their arcs would unfold. Just like how they handled Saaya’s arc. That’s the ideal way of storytelling, showing subtle moments of her struggle and background in every episode to get that right Bang! (pun intended) at the exact episode where her arc is focused. That way the viewers watching would appreciate each member/lead character of the series.Cuz I am talking about the some of the characters anyway, gonna start sharing my thoughts about them.Like the story, the characters were generic but still, really likeable. The main character, Kasumi, is your typical genki MC. She’s noisy, sociable, friendly and optimistic. I’ll be honest, I’m not too fond of her. Out of all the main girls, she’s my least favorite. Still, her role in getting everyone together is quite vital and she is pretty much the foundation of their group. The moment she collapsed, everything else fall as well. Even though I’m not too fond of her, I do empathize and understand her struggles. Her development wasn’t that large, but dang, it resonates hard. Her struggles near the end reminded me alot of my own hardships. So seeing her stand up again, with the help of her bandmates/friends, was really heartwarming.Now, for the other members of Poppin’ Party, my most favorite character would be Arisa. She’s the tsundere one, and she is very precious. After seeing her in the very first episode, I know there was something with her that was different. Not only that she is smart, she’s also innocent when it comes to friendship. Like I said, she’s precious. I also like that she’s pretty much the voice of reason in the group, and I totally get her. Oh! oh! Oh! Her friendship with Kasumi is so cute and precious. It’s very genuine. Though compared to the early episodes of the series, their display of friendship lessen. Still, you can easily tell that both of them cares for each other and are pretty much besties status. I am a bit disappointed though, her background wasn’t tackled much. It would be nice that she would get a proper arc in the next seasons. After all, I wanted to know more about her.Saaya, the one who got the most development, she’s okay. Her first encounter with Kasumi was weird, but in a way, realistic. I like that she interacts well with Kasumi even though the latter is crazy. Like I said above, she got the ideal character arc, and that definitely helped us, viewers, know more about her and her struggles. Her struggles were really relatable and her confrontation scene with Kasumi was one of the best I had seen in awhile. (kudos to the writers!)Rimi also got a decent amount of development. She’s really shy and timid, but I liked that she was able to overcome her fears and be able to shine like her own sister. She’s really cute too. Also, her being the bass player and the one composing their music….definitely a PLUS to me.Lastly, Tae. She’s peculiar. Tae’s someone who loves music and in a way…kinda dumb. She resonates well with Kasumi and goes along well with the other members. I can’t really say much about her, cuz she’s forgettable and the least developed member of the group.As a group, the lead characters play well with each other. Even though they are different in terms of personality, they still have the right amount of cohesiveness to make they group work.I don’t much opinion about the other supporting characters. Most of them are there only cuz of the story, though I do wanna point out that there’s actually parents involve in this series. It makes this series more grounded and realistic.Now, for the art and animation. Bruh, they actually used CG correctly. I had seen alot of failed attempts in using CG in idol animes. I always wished for it to improve. Seeing this series to have a decent CG, especially during the performances, it made the series more fun to watch and enjoyable. The character designs looked generic, but they are actually not bad. The overall art was pretty decent. Even the lighting and color scheme of the series wasn’t painful in the eyes. It was also consistent. Definitely alot better than I expected.Of course, I won’t move on until I discuss its music.Infairness, they actually have good music. They are fun and easy to listen to. I can’t really compare them to the awesome K-On discography, but Bang Dream!’s music are pretty decent. I’ll definitely check their music out.Overall, Bang Dream! was what I expected it to be, a simple slice-of-life anime about girls getting into music and form a band. In some ways, this anime is quite similar to some of the idol animes out there and I am not complaining. Bang Dream! actually delivers. I had fun watching the series.I would definitely recommend this to everyone who likes idol animes or the current plot-trend of slice-of-life, you guys would definitely like this series. If you are not part of that niche, I think you can still enjoy watching this one.Anyway, that is all for now. you don’t see much guys/men in the series, but the thought of having a studio cafe for girl bands sounds really BADASS.

That was the time I watched this show and rated it a 7.It's been a while but now that I've seen many other shows I feel like I can rate shows more accurately based on my own preferences and tastes.If I'm being honest the story really is predictable, the art is good but maybe lacks a bit of frames every now and then and the idea of cute girls doing cute things isn't for me, at least in this format anymore.But this is a music show after all...and that is the are which this show excels at. I think there is any other reason to watch this show all the way to the most recent third season. Unless you enjoy this show of course. Just speaking from analytic point of view and reviewing the story, art and characters it's not worth it. However all of us have something they like and others don't.

First of all I have low expectation in this kind of anime, i hate anime with pure fanservice only but not much with plots but this one is different and i was surprised! As expected the story revolves around a girl who aspire to perform in the stage and shine! That's cute and all, she's very persuasive af and honestly kinda annoying but...it is her best trait. She is the MC, Kasumi. The first 3 to 4 episodes was you usual moe anime. Girls being just kawaii girls and practicing guitar with fucking twinkle twinkle little star makes me want to drop it but after that episodes the train of emotion comes rushing in so fast. The later half of the anime shows us the realistic side of being a performer such as hard practice and time management and other stuff such as for example Saya's mother being sick of all the time. BTW i love that episode, Kasumi and friends trying to convince Saya to join the band. Imma say its the strongest episode for this season. If you love anime about band plus some moe moments this anime is really good for you.The animation is fine, im not really bothered by the CGI animation during some scenes and of course it is a musical anime so the music here is good AF and I love their songs XD Even the songs not played in the anime. Character wise i love all of them. They are unique to each other and as you can see my DP is Tae. lol. She's funny af so she's mah waifu. I really enjoyed the show tho the first 3 episodes were weak but the rest specially 8-12 is really enjoyable and full of emotions.. 8/11 it is her best trait. She is the MC, Kasumi.

I keep expecting the show to hit a stale arc, but I'm into season 3 now and it's honestly kept everything right up there....At first I didn't like that the music performances and later seasons were all CGI, but then I noticed how well animated it is and how much the 3d actually adds to the animation making the music performances incredibly lifelike.

Seemingly for no reason whatsoever, a certain property can catch on like wildfire and take the anime community, or the larger media-consuming public, by storm. Other franchises peter out into oblivion before getting their chance to shine, and yet still there are some where their very existence is a jumbled mass of “What on Earth is going on?” Especially given the sometimes-erratic nature of anime production, there are some buses that keep starting and stopping.""BanG Dream!"" is one such show that falls into that category. Originally released in Winter 2017 to complement the video game,...the animated franchise effectively underwent a period of dormancy for a few years before its second season was released in Winter 2019. The second season itself was more a functional reboot and re-writing of the rules, as it ultimately continued the series in a new kind of direction both tonally and character-wise. In the meanwhile, it’s worth taking a look at this first season since it stands apart as though it resides in its own universe, somewhat divorced from the whole that eventually formed from it.New high school student Toyama Kasumi is looking for something that will cause her heart to beat like it did when she gazed at the starry sky as a child. After following a trail of starry stickers to her classmate Ichigaya Arisa’s warehouse and fawning over the star-shaped guitar there, she and Arisa both attend a Glitter-Green girl band performance at the SPACE club. The performance ignites the fire that Kasumi has been looking for, and together with Arisa, a baking family’s daughter named Saya, the younger sister of a Glitter-Green member named Rimi, and SPACE club staff member Tae, they form their own girl band – Poppin’Party.Despite the rather conventional setup, ""BanG Dream!"" early on demonstrates a narrative awareness of the genre and actively works to try and subvert it. Under normal circumstances, a show like this about making a group (be it for a sports club or an idol troupe) would introduce the various members one at a time, usually the result of being swept up by the main character’s charisma or presence. The series doesn’t completely divorce itself from those standards, but here though, all five Poppin’Party members are introduced and interact with one another early. The sense of familiarity with the various members is allowed to germinate sooner than most other shows would, so by the time the group begins to form, enough time has been taken to establish the dynamic. This holds true even though they are not all brought into the group at the same time. It makes the overall sense of character camaraderie tighter than it would be otherwise.Though as far as the individual characters personality-wise are concerned, there is definitely a wide disparity between which ones resonate as far as an enjoyable presence. Two characters best exemplify this, with one being Arisa. She’s the group’s curmudgeonly character, and easily became one of my favorites to see. Her reactions and quasi-tsundere tendencies are thankfully over-the-top enough to get their comedic value without crossing the boundary into nauseating, and the fact that all of the group members seem to know exactly how to push her buttons makes poking fun at her fair game at any moment. The story also gives her enough moments to show that, despite all of that, she still has fun and will go those extra steps for her friends.Kasumi’s character is unfortunately at the opposite end of that spectrum, at least at first. As could be expected from an overly-enthusiastic character which comes dangerously close to being a nuisance, she doesn’t necessarily have the greatest sense of personal space, and already wants to be on given-name bases with nearly everyone that she meets. Her presence produces the rather strange effect of both wanting to see her dream of Poppin’Party realized, while also seriously wishing that she would, at times, dial it back, and not just a little bit. It never got to the point where I didn’t want to see her on-screen, however the writing seemed to channel her energy in a hundred different directions that took too long to find its way. This does partially get rectified in the second half of the season when she faces a shift and can demonstrate restraint and unease.Part of this shift is due to being at the mercy of the shift in narrative tone – at first, ""BanG Dream!"" tries to straddle the line between wanting to and not wanting to take itself seriously. Kasumi roping in the other members of Poppin’Party reads as light-hearted, yet cannot quite coalesce since the show’s anchor is teetering on the edge of being a frustration. Halfway through the season we come across the first genuine conflict of the show, but it does have the problem of being almost too serious in contrast with more or less everything else that came before. It’s one of those circumstances where juxtaposition works in theory, yet the actual impact feels more ham-fisted and artificial since the dissonance is so stark.The end of the season, however, manages to settle into its proper rhythm – if the previous arc went a little bit far with its gravitas, the final few episodes manage to find a decent middle ground between them. The problem facing the group is serious to be sure, but feels more akin to an actual problem that a real band would be facing if they were trying to become known. By getting a cold dose of reality splashed in their faces, it allows the group to show their true mettle and tackle their challenge head-on. It therefore makes the season’s climax read as deserved.The look of the show itself is not terrible, but it does leave something to be desired. Despite coming out in 2017, ""BanG Dream!"" season one feels as though it came out of the late-2000s with its character designs. The compositing however is its weakest element – there is an awful lot of sunshine in the course of the series, which unfortunately gives too many scenes a bit of a glare and whitish hue. Quite a few locations are recycled, which is perfectly fine, although certain things like the warehouse rehearsal space are rather blank.Gratefully, if the visuals were lacking in some respect, the music does help to make up for a lot of these shortcomings. Though, given the Poppin’Party songs that were available at the time of the anime’s release, I do have to wonder why they chose “Tokimeki Experience” as the OP song. The track itself is not bad as a standalone piece of music, though it lacks the kind of exuberance that the story seemed to be striving for. That said, all the choices for insert songs within the thirteen episodes themselves were good picks, and the rare occasions where there was original material contributed to an earnestness that was pleasant.And “earnest” more or less is what defines the first season. In the midst of its heavy-handedness and occasional times where it wasn’t that funny, this did feel like a group of five girls who cared about what they did and about each other. There’s a kindness in the series that made it seem like this band was worth following. Did I like this season? I can’t say that I did, but I was intrigued by it, which is more than I can say for a lot of other things I’ve seen in the course of my anime life.""BanG Dream!"" season one is an odd duck. It seems to keep itself tied up when it wants to let loose, and when it does indeed let loose, it gets a little bit crazy. It manages to find some semblance of balance in the second half by introducing some rather practical conflicts and allowing the group as a whole to combine in a way that feels strong. It may be at times rather uneven, but it was fun when I wasn’t necessarily buying it or laughing with it. It’s kind of in its own quirky little corner of the anime music world… the animated franchise effectively underwent a period of dormancy for a few years before its second season was released in Winter 2019. The second season itself was more a functional reboot and re-writing of the rules, as it ultimately continued the series in a new kind of direction both tonally and character-wise. In the meanwhile, it’s worth taking a look at this first season since it stands apart as though it resides in its own universe, somewhat divorced from the whole that eventually formed from it.New high school student Toyama Kasumi is looking for something that will cause her heart to beat like it did when she gazed at the starry sky as a child. After following a trail of starry stickers to her classmate Ichigaya Arisa’s warehouse and fawning over the star-shaped guitar there, she and Arisa both attend a Glitter-Green girl band performance at the SPACE club. The performance ignites the fire that Kasumi has been looking for, and together with Arisa, a baking family’s daughter named Saya, the younger sister of a Glitter-Green member named Rimi, and SPACE club staff member Tae, they form their own girl band – Poppin’Party.Despite the rather conventional setup, ""BanG Dream!"" early on demonstrates a narrative awareness of the genre and actively works to try and subvert it. Under normal circumstances, a show like this about making a group (be it for a sports club or an idol troupe) would introduce the various members one at a time, usually the result of being swept up by the main character’s charisma or presence. The series doesn’t completely divorce itself from those standards, but here though, all five Poppin’Party members are introduced and interact with one another early. The sense of familiarity with the various members is allowed to germinate sooner than most other shows would, so by the time the group begins to form, enough time has been taken to establish the dynamic. This holds true even though they are not all brought into the group at the same time. It makes the overall sense of character camaraderie tighter than it would be otherwise.Though as far as the individual characters personality-wise are concerned, there is definitely a wide disparity between which ones resonate as far as an enjoyable presence. Two characters best exemplify this, with one being Arisa. She’s the group’s curmudgeonly character, and easily became one of my favorites to see. Her reactions and quasi-tsundere tendencies are thankfully over-the-top enough to get their comedic value without crossing the boundary into nauseating, and the fact that all of the group members seem to know exactly how to push her buttons makes poking fun at her fair game at any moment. The story also gives her enough moments to show that, despite all of that, she still has fun and will go those extra steps for her friends.Kasumi’s character is unfortunately at the opposite end of that spectrum, at least at first.

It may be at times rather uneven, but it was fun when I wasn’t necessarily buying it or laughing with it. It’s kind of in its own quirky little corner of the anime music world…', ""I'm reviewing this from the standpoint of someone who's been a huge fan of the BanG Dream mobile rhytm game for some time before I decided to start watching the anime.I'll do my best not to be biased, but I think BanG Dream is an amazing, expansive media franchise, combining good music with great characters and every part of it has been more or less enjoyable for me. At the moment there are 7 bands and the first season of the anime focuses on the main band of the series, Poppin'Party.The anime does a great job adapting Band Story 0 from the game, which is...about how Poppin'Party got together in the first place.Without giving away too much, the story is about Toyama Kasumi, a girl who discovers her love for music and seeks to form a band. Together with her newfound friends and bandmates, she has lots of fun, but also goes through lots of hardships in order to fulfill her dreams.Both the comedic and dramatic moments were adapted perfectly and they might be even more impactful than how they were in the game. Nothing was left out from the original story, so new BanG Dream fans can easily jump in, while existing fans got new scenes and more fleshed out minor characters. For example, aside from Rimi's sister, Yuri, none of the Glitter Green members appear in the game that much, but they're more prominent in the anime and we get to know them a lot better there.There are even some cameo appearances from the other bands which don't have a part in the story of the first season.I already know and love the characters from the game, but they're just as enjoyable and lovable in the anime. Since this first season focuses on the band Poppin'Party, all the members get a lot of screentime, their own arcs and development.Saaya's arc was my favourite one among them and its finale was my favourite moment of the season.As for my favourite character, I don't think I have one. The whole main cast was equally great.Another thing I like about BanG Dream is how it balances slice of life, drama and music. An equal amount of time is spent on lighthearted moments and humour, character drama, character development and showing the band practicing, preparing and playing music.All those aspects are executed with a lot of heart and soul, too. It's not just all about cute girls or fanservice; it's about the characters being friends, growing as people, giving their best and doing what they love.Since this is a music anime, the music in it is obviously important and there's a lot of it.Poppin'Party's songs aren't the most revolutionary music you'll ever hear, but I think they still stand out among music from other similar anime. Most of the songs fall into the J-Pop genre but there's a lot of variety and I personally love them. My favourite among the ones used in season one is Star Beat and it's probably one of my favourites from the whole franchise.Another thing I love about the music is how the songs that appear in it sound raw and natural, fitting for an amateur band. Sound editing was used minimally so the music sounds just like how it would sound being played in the venues they are playing in (a basement, a school gym, an empty live house...).Aside from the songs, the background music is also surprisingly memorable and adds a lot to the anime.The art and animation are wonky sometimes, but it wasn't distracting to me. The animation being off-model at times maybe even makes the characters more expressive; especially Kasumi, who's hyperactive and lively almost all the time.Something that did bother me is how, in a lot of the performance scenes in the first half of the season, the characters are playing music, but we don't see them actually playing their instruments at all. Instead we get a close up shot of them swaying and singing, while their hands are just kind of moving off-screen.It's like they were trying to show them playing their instruments as little as possible, presumably because they didn't have the time or money to animate it properly. From episode 8 until the end (where most of the performances are), every performance is properly animated, though, so it's not too bad.In those performance scenes the characters are animated with CG, which isn't perfect, but it's good enough not to take me out of the experience.Considering it's just a bunch of still shots, the ending looks surprisingly awkward and it's impossible to ignore how strange and uncanny the characters look.On the other hand, the opening is the complete opposite. It's very animated, natural and feels perfect for the series.In conclusion, BanG Dream season 1 might not have the very best art or animation of 2017, but it's still an above-average music anime full of heart and soul. It's a feel good show full of great characters and music that's guaranteed not to leave you indifferent. about how Poppin'Party got together in the first place.Without giving away too much, the story is about Toyama Kasumi, a girl who discovers her love for music and seeks to form a band.

Blue Seed,https://myanimelist.net/anime/998/Blue_Seed,"[""This is my favorite anime so it may be biased.Story: I love the story, early on the show is monster of the week but about half way through it because one straight story. It is mainly about how heritage is ignored in modern society and on this note; they never go overboard and mix in enough action that it is usually moving forwards.Art: The show's art is a little dated and the colors seemed to be faded but monster design, animation, and the actual art, such as backgrounds and character designs were done quite well.Sound: The score of this anime is done by Kenji Kawaii,...also known for Ghost in the Shell, if you liked his work there as I have, you will like it here, from the upbeat going to school them, to the tragic theme, it varied and all done masterfully.The voice acting in the US is a bit bad at first but around episode 3 and 4 all the characters fall into their roles and it works.The Japanese voice work is done well, highlighted by Megumi Hayashibara as the lead.Character: From the superstitious gun lover to the obsessed scientist the entire cast is fleshed out over the 26 episodes so that no one fells left out.

Another person, Mamoru Kusanagi, former protector of Kaede Kunikida, has defected from the side of the Aragami and becomes Momiji's protector. It turns out that Kaede and Momiji are twins separated at birth and the circumstances of...their birth caused the Aragami to awaken with the splitting of the Kushinada blood between them. As things take a dramatic turn later on in the story, will the Japanese government have no choice but to sacrifice Momiji's life in order to defeat the Aragami once and for all? Not only that, but Kaede's reappearance causes a new twist in the events of the story as she along with the ressurrected god Susano-oh plot against humanity for their crimes against nature and Momiji, believing in the good of humanity, must confront her twin. I enjoyed how the story was told in blending in modern Japanese life and ancient Japanese legends and the romance between Kusanagi and Momiji.The anime itself came out in 1994-95 with 26 episodes, the art itself improved in the latter episodes, but overall the characters looked very well drawn and their designs matched the personality of the character, such as the conservative appearance of Kaede to the ecchi appeal of Sakura Yamazaki when decked out in her revealing red dress.I was pleased with the sound of Blue Seed with music by Kenji Kawai, OP song by Takada Band, and ED song by Momiji's seiyuu, Megumi Hayashibara. Intersting trivia about Takada Band, the male singer of the duo is none other than seiyuu, Fumihiko Tachiki(Gendo of Evangelion, Kenpachi of Bleach). Megumi Hayashibara has worked on other Yuzo Takada projects in lead roles as 3x3 Eyes' Pai and the title character Nuku Nuku of the Nuku Nuku of the franchise. Other talents include Kazuhiko Inoue as the bad boy male lead, Mamoru Kusanagi, Akio Ohtsuka as the TAC's leader, Daitetsu Kunikida, Ai Orikasa as the cool Ryoko Takeuchi, Yoshiko Sakakibara as the head scientist Asuza Matsudaira, Kotono Mitsuishi as the gun-happy Kome Sawaguchi(her character in Blue Seed is often nicknamed Sailor Boom due to her seiyuu also voicing Sailor Moon), Yuji Ueda as the computer whiz Yoshiki Yaegashi, and Jouji Nakata as the evil Murakumo.I felt the characters were really well produced and developed well. I especailly liked how Momiji's character development was played out. She was presented as a character who doesn't settle into the role of a damsel in distress, she prefers to be out there fighting and doing her part and doesn't rely heavily on the others. Momiji does enter into an inferiority phase when it concerns her perfect twin Kaede and thinks her beloved Kusanagi rather be with Kaede than her, and even when she learns what Kaede has in store for humanity, Momiji never shows hatred for Kaede and bares no ill will towards her.  So I commend Yuzo Takada in creating a balanced heroine with a strong will, a sensitive nature, and a good heart. Kusanagi is also another great character, although he's a pervet towards Momiji in the beginning of the series, he is dedicated to her, although he himself has a phase in which he is chasing after Kaede, he loves Momiji and resolves to be with her after settling things were Kaede is concerned. The Kusanagi-Momiji-Kaede story parallels the Inuyasha-Kagome-Kikyo story, but the former is handled much better with the supporting characters maintaining a neutral stance and not taking one side over the other, although Yaegashi himself had a crush on Momiji. Even Yaegashi's character is treated well as he shows good character development and is paired in the end with someone(usually characters like Yaegashi never get a girl and are left single in the end).My enjoyment overall was a pleasant experience as it accomplishes what Inuyasha never did with well rounded character leads, a good set of a supporting cast around the leads, and a main villain I could take seriously. It's a shame that Blue Seed is an obscure title that few people have seen as compared to the runaway hit Inuyasha, as I felt Blue Seed has more likeable characters than Inuyasha and better than Inuyasha in terms of story and romance. I'm proud to be a Blue Seed fan and it is a title I would reccommend to anybody. their birth caused the Aragami to awaken with the splitting of the Kushinada blood between them.

While the early episodes do their part in introducing the characters and the show\'s premise with Momiji being targeted by the Aragami, many of the episodes tend to follow a ""monster of the day"" style plot where a random Aragami is killing off parts of the human populace with Momiji, Kusanagi and the members of TAC tasked with killing off said threat. Some of the episodes do feature focus on one of the TAC members....But otherwise, the ""monster of the day"" setup tends to get repetitive after a while. The show\'s implementation of comedy also came across as a bit hit or miss for me. For instance, I did enjoy some of Sawaguchi\'s destructive antics yet didn\'t get much enjoyment out of the show\'s running gag of Momiji\'s random panty shots and Kusanagi teasing her about it.Looking past these flaws, the show\'s later episodes get into some surprising plot developments once Murakumo is introduced around the middle of the series. Some pretty shocking developments in Blue Seed\'s plot come along concerning the motivations surrounding Murakumo, the Aragami and an old acquaintance of TAC which I won\'t spoil here. These later developments did keep me hooked to the show for its final episodes and were more than enough to make up for the setup of Blue Seed\'s earlier episodes.Outside of said later episodes, Blue Seed does offer a good amount of fleshing out on many of its characters, counting the individual members of TAC, as you get to learn more of their backgrounds, some of whom are a bit on the tragic side and connected to the Aragami threat. The series also does a solid job at setting up suspense with the various Aragami encounters, as well as exploring the past origins of the monsters and the different means in which they were dispatched. The anime was basically making its own loose take on elements of mythology commonplace in the Izumo prefecture of Japan and Shintoism, particularly the Eight-Headed Orochi and the water god Susanoo.In terms of animation, Blue Seed is of standard quality for a mid-90s TV anime title with faded colors, washed-out backgrounds, normal use of animation shortcuts and character designs with a decent amount of detail applied to them.Overall, Blue Seed does make for a solid 90s anime to check out thanks to its fleshed-out cast, supernatural elements and engaging second half. The anime does have some shortcomings from its ""monster of the day"" setup in its first half and its comedic elements. But otherwise, it is still worth checking out if you are looking for older anime titles to catch your interest. But otherwise, the ""monster of the day"" setup tends to get repetitive after a while. The show\'s implementation of comedy also came across as a bit hit or miss for me.

I don’t really like Momiji much. She seems a lot like a whiny little bitch that gets what she wants. She is always getting into trouble and needing someone to save her. She does grow but I don’t think enough. I always get mixed up between the name Kushinada and Kusanagi. They are way to similar and I wish that I wish they could have changed his name so I wouldn’t have that problem. Sadly, its part of the manga as well and so it’s really Yuzo...Takada’s fault. There is a lot of talking and when it does get to the fighting, it lacks much in drawing me in. The reason I love this story though is the underlining Romance. It has a lot of couples, from the high school crush to the adult business man love. I also like the little Omake’s at the end of the episodes.The animation is alright, though very very vintage. Colors are rather milky and dull, sometimes making it hard to see little bits of the show. Sadly, even the characters look rather gray. It skips a lot as well, making the animation look a bit choppy. The designs are pretty much puffy heads and wide eyes for all the characters and a lot of fan service with Momiji. It seems not every girl is in the fan service, just her which feels just wrong. It’s like more care had been done to her skimpy outfits rather then when she is normally clothed. The fighting scenes are lacking in movement and sometimes you can’t tell who is the good guy and who is the bad, making them feel like a big mess.The voices… well it’s a hit or miss and I like most of the English ones with one or two exceptions. The Japanese feels a bit to stiff then I think it should be delivered but it could just be the amount of business people in the story. There is a lot of taking, and heavy on business and science which does get in the way. Takada’s fault. There is a lot of talking and when it does get to the fighting, it lacks much in drawing me in.

Brave Witches: Petersburg Daisenryaku,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34644/Brave_Witches__Petersburg_Daisenryaku,"[""It's not often that a special manages to be more enjoyable and outright better than the show itself, but in my eyes, this special episode of Brave Witches is an exception. After loving both seasons of Strike Witches, I found Brave Witches to be pretty disappointing. It wasn't terrible or anything, but the zany shenanigans that used to take place in Strike Witches were conspicuously absent, replaced instead with straightforward Neuroi fights that weren't that interesting most of the time.The special gives us a very cute and funny story centering around Eila and Sanya, two fan favorite characters from the original series. It was a...joy to see them get some screen time and interact with the Brave Witches. Seeing Eila get jealous of all the attention Sanya was getting from the other witches was adorable and amusing (seriously, I really love those two). The special episode also gives us the fanservice that was practically nonexistent in the main Brave Witches series. Whether or not that's a good thing is up to the viewer's tastes, but this show doesn't feel the same when it doesn't have lewdness and other forms of weirdness in it.Beyond that, there isn't much else to say. The art and sound are fine, nothing special, but still good. There isn't too much 3D or CGI or whatever in this episode (only briefly at one point) compared to the main show. Even if it was just for one special episode, it was nice to see Brave Witches put in the heart and soul of what made its parent series so good (even if it had to borrow characters from said parent series to do so).Enjoyment - 7.5/10 (great)Overall - 7/10 (very good) joy to see them get some screen time and interact with the Brave Witches.

I'll admit that I forgot about it for a bit, but after finally seeing it was uploaded subbed about 2 weeks ago, and putting it off unintentionally for a a while, I watched it.  Just wow!  It makes a great edition to the series.The episode just show cases a side story between the 7th and 8th episodes of the Brave Witches series after Eila and Sanya came to deliver supplies to the Petersburg base.  It features tons of comedy between antics involving...Eila and Sanya, Waltrud, Georgette in cleaning freak mode, etc.  So many people are pretty much obsessed with Sanya and it just adds to the feeling from the comedy and the events are pretty much on par with many of amazingly cute moments from both the Strike Witches and Brave Witches full length series.  For people that had a problem with the lack of ecchi content in the series, you'll get some here.  Even though there are all these cute and funny moments, there is a battle at the end with a quick yet epic conclusion.  The story isn't very simple, but it just works.  9/10.The art is pretty much the same as it was in the series, but there is a severe decrease in the amount of 3d cgi present and even a few of the cgi scenes in the opening were fixed.  It isn't all gone, but it doesn't stand out nearly as much as it did in the series.  It's a little annoying to see, but it doesn't detract too much from the quality.  9/10.You get the same calming  music and energetic fighting music.  I just love the soundtracks that are used for these Witch series, but I do feel  that a single ova or special just doesn't capture the full effect of the music.  I always feel more energetic and calm when hearing this series's music, even if it's not captured as well here. 9/10.The character are just about as amazing as always.  The addition of Sanya and Eila is an amazing piece of bonus content for the episode.  Other sides of characters like Georgette and Naoe are also shown.  The characters are not randomly made extremely complicated or anything, but a pretty much amazing cast is still shown.  One special cannot generally fully capture everyone's quirks in it though.  9.5/10.I enjoyed this special to the fullest.  I enjoyed the full series to the fullest as well, excluding the 3d cgi; 10/10 without it, 9/10 with it, so I took the average of the two.  The 3d cgi is used a lot less in this episode though and even some of the cgi parts in the opening were fixed.  Since the main issue I had with the series is almost completely taken away, my enjoyment rank is a 10/10.  I'm willing to forgive the slight use of noticeable 3d cgi here since it doesn't  take away so much from the beautiful pictures.  I highly recommend this to fan s of Brave Witches and Strike Witches, but watch the series in order.Overall, 9.3.

Litvyak and Eila Ilmatar Juutilainen.As you would expect an episode with Sanya the best girl of the franchise it was always going to be great.It is nice to see the relationship between Eila and Sanya expanded and to see the girls interacting with them.You get the same art as expected with less of the weird CGI. You do get some nudity in this...one but it is enough and not overdone.Sound is the same as you would expect to be fitting. I think Sanya has a great voice.Characters in terms of Sanya and Eila develop well. A few others especially the unexpected actions of Sadako Shimohara with the quirk she has.Overall, it is very entertaining and a great episode. If you watch it in the order it is even better as it breaks up the show nicely. one but it is enough and not overdone.Sound is the same as you would expect to be fitting.

The rest of the ""main cast"" take a backseat this episode.Technically this episode takes place between roughly around episodes 7 and 8, but I don\'t think it would work watching it in chronological order, because this standalone episode disrupts the flow of Brave Witches\' primary story.While I am a...fan of the various spinoff media of the World Witches franchise, I am admittedly not a Sanya x Eila fan, or a Strike Witches fan for that matter, given my own criticisms of the original anime.As such, I had my expectations crushed when I found out this more for older Strike Witches fans. Regardless, I did enjoy seeing Hikari fantasizing about Takami in a romantic way, as has been hinted on her borderline idolization of her sister in the main story, though seeing Eila get jealous of Sanya\'s many admirers does get old.However, someone who hasn\'t viewed Strike Witches before can still successfully watch this bonus episode and see it as characterization for Sanya and Eila, who in Brave Witches, are supporting characters that only cameo a couple of times, and from there go to watch the original series that they\'re main characters in. So it\'s a win-win situation for new Witches fans and business wise. fan of the various spinoff media of the World Witches franchise, I am admittedly not a Sanya x Eila fan, or a Strike Witches fan for that matter, given my own criticisms of the original anime.As such, I had my expectations crushed when I found out this more for older Strike Witches fans.

Chain Chronicle: Haecceitas no Hikari Part 1,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33728/Chain_Chronicle__Haecceitas_no_Hikari_Part_1,"[""I'm a fan of the mobile game, and still play the Japanese version after Scumi shut down the English server. The story in-game was more generic and unmemorable.But this movie was different. The story takes a different route where the Hero doesn't defeat the Dark Overlord and instead gets cancer and PTSD. It was an interesting and darker twist; and definitely has more potential than the story that the game had. The animation was stellar.It's no surprise the anime had an overload of characters, but the designs of them all were great. Most side characters have one or two quirks, but the main ones...like Yuri and Amat get quite a bit of development even though Yuri was just the self insert in the game. The Sages stood out to me the most; they're the crazy and over the top ones.It was more than I expected from a card collecting game.  I really enjoyed the show and the producers did a smart move to change up the story to get old and new fans interested. If you like the RPG genre, then this is an anime you should watch. It's definitely not 'tropey' or 'generic'. This has potential and I'm looking forward to more.//first review dont kill me <3 like Yuri and Amat get quite a bit of development even though Yuri was just the self insert in the game.

You have been warned.Chain Chronicles was a game before it was adapted into anime/movie format. I have not played the game, so I have no past connection nor nostalgia with it. Every bit of this review is based on the anime.Story: 6/10The story began with a twist; the hero, Yuri, lost against the Black King in the Imperial Capital. Not a lot of anime show what would be the “climax” of a story, where the hero and Alliance fought against the antagonist, and lost. I was intrigued by the setting and kept watching to see how it would develop. However,...the story became more predictable as it went on. Though this may be because it was quite evident that the world was falling into chaos due to the Alliance’s defeat at the Imperial capital. There were riots in the Holy Capital and the Holy King’s position was split between three people. Unfortunately, it was a minor focus. Yuri ventured to meet the 3 Sages, which is sad as they barely had any screen time, as they were quite alluring characters.There are two side-stories in this. Yuri’s PTSD-like illness and Burckhardt’s fall into darkness. Due to their defeat, Yuri suffered greatly. He had lost hope and had hallucinations. He was struggling with himself internally and couldn’t fight until he saw Aram, whilst he fought for the safety of a village. Yuri regained his hope and will to fight after a short period only. I wished that they had explored more of his mental illness and see how bad it affects people with it. To me, it was quite unrealistic as Yuri suddenly gained hope just from one person, Aram. He had suffered a major defeat at the hands of the Black King, and now he’s back in it to win it. Had they spent more time with Yuri not being able to fight and slowly win over his PTSD, I would have enjoyed it more. Nonetheless, he was still struggling with it even after he regained hope.Burckhardt fell into despair as Aram, a mere kid, had single-handedly fought many enemies on his own. Aram stole his mana, not once but twice, which pissed off Burckhardt. Aram then called it “even” when he gave back Burckhardt’s with his mana resupplied by the former. Combine this hatred with the fact that he speculated that Aram had stolen a sword, and lost the ensuing argument made him fall deeper and deeper into seclusion. On top of this, the Princess had him accompany the Volunteer Army (VA), an army which Yuri and Aram are part of. He had no chemistry with them, yet, the princess still had him go with them. The Princess’ reason being that she wanted Burckhardt to understand Aram. The saying “opposites attract” does not work here, instead, it worsened the relationship between Burckhardt and the Volunteer Army. In the end, he had succumbed to darkness and became a demon, which the VA fought for a while before Burckhardt left. This must have taken a toll on the VA, both physically and mentally. Had they focused more time on his mental state and his hatred, they would have nailed this storyline very well.Art: 8/10The 2D animation quality was amazing and consistent when used.  Although they used 3D animation during some battle scenes, which flowed somewhat well. Though personally, I still prefer 2D animation over 3D.Sound: 9/10The sound effects for this was quite astonishing. From the magic, to swords clashing, it was quite enjoyable to hear it. The music was on par too. No major complaints here other than just maybe having more hype music.Character: 6/10The cast was huge. So many characters squeezed in. Great character designs separated them nicely. However, there was not much focus on character development, plus with such a character roster, it was hard to develop all of them finely.Enjoyment: 6/10I enjoyed the interesting premise. Burckhardt’s story was interesting and I wished they had focused on it more. Yuri having PTSD-like symptoms was also great. However, they had failed to fully execute Yuri’s side-story as he regained hope in no time at all. The whole thing felt like it was rushed in pacing. Had they given time to explore the dark undertones, it may have been better.Overall score: 7/10Story: 6/10Art: 8/10Sound: 9/10Character: 6/10Enjoyment: 6/10= 35/50 = 7 the story became more predictable as it went on.

Not just anime, actually; also movies, books, etc... So, Chain Chronicle was very fun to watch because of it, but it has some problems that kind of messed up my immersion in the world that's presented.The main problem was the story. It's about a group of people that, in order to restore peace and save the world, go fight a dark army that has taken command of the world. Even though it's ordinary, it ain't bad. The main problem there is the story telling. It's like if the story begins in the half of it...and they don't show the real beginning. You just don't understand what happened in the past and how has this dark army taken command, and, so, you feel lost in the story. I didn't play the games, so i don't know, but it's a problem that can easily be fixed in the next movies, so let's hope they fix it!The art is great. It is really well designed and they present to us a fluid animation in the fight scenes and in all the other aspects. So, it fulfill the criteria. The sound is also good, but it isn't outstanding. Actually, i just finished this movie and i don't remember any tracks from the OST. But there wasn't a single part of the anime that i felt like something about the sound was missing.Another major problem is the character development, but it's more of a consequence of the problems in the story than a problem itself. Well, you just can't like a character judging only the appearence, the style and the personality of it. The main thing is the background of the character, at least for me. And if the story begins in the half of it, you don't know the background, you don't know who are the characters and how did they get where they are. Then i didn't care about what happened to them. But again, it's also a problem that can easily be fixed in the next movies. Let's hope for it.So, Chain Chronicle is a good anime with some problems, but people that like medieval adventure will probably enjoy it, generally speaking.Story (6); Art (9); Sound (8); Character (6); Enjoyment (7);Overall (7). and they don't show the real beginning.

But again, it's also a problem that can easily be fixed in the next movies. Let's hope for it.So, Chain Chronicle is a good anime with some problems, but people that like medieval adventure will probably enjoy it, generally speaking.Story (6); Art (9); Sound (8); Character (6); Enjoyment (7);Overall (7).""]"
